Though the Plus was ahead of its time when it was released — and frankly still looks quite technical today — Nike Sportswear loves to modernize its classic silhouettes so the Air Max Plus has appeared with a brand-new set of hi-vis reflective details.

Officially dubbed “Black/University Red” the most notable thing about this Air Max Plus is that its signature overlays usually composed of TPE are printed directly onto the upper and coated in hi-vis reflective material. This enables the top half’s base layer to have a one-piece mesh construction and make sure its signature detail shines as brightly as possible.

Apart from this daring dash of reflective regalia this Air Max Plus also boasts small red-trimmed swooshes plus red rope laces with their own flecks of reflective material. Large red stripes that run down the tongue reading “Tuned” on the right foot and “Air” on the left foot. Final pops of detail are supplied by branded badges on the tongue and heel leather mudguards and heel overlays jet black plastic toe caps and black midsoles with tonal Air units.

This hi-vis Nike Air Max Plus is available at Nike Great Brittan now and is priced at £155 GBP (approximately $212 USD). A US release may follow in the coming weeks.

Not just at diving but also at knitting. Though he hasn't won any medals for it Daley's knitting has arguably earned him as much attention as his diving: a photo of the 27-year-old knitting from his perch in the stands at the Tokyo Aquatics Center during the 2021 Olympics went viral. Daley who picked up knitting at the beginning of lockdown often posts his projects on his yarn-centric Instagram account where he now has 1.4M followers. Stitching a medal pouch a dog sweater and a team cardigan all while he watched others compete during the Tokyo games Daley said he learned to knit and crochet to help him remain calm during long and draining competitions.

Daley is not unique in finding solace in traditional pastimes like needlework and knitting during stressful moments. Throughout history humans have turned to crafts to improve both mental and physical health and science has confirmed what most of us already supposed: engaging in beloved pastimes including crafting can help improve mood and a person's sense of well-being. Due to their ability to distract from worries and promote mindfulness crafts in general are excellent for easing stress and anxiety.

Like Daley many looked to hobbies at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ease the boredom of lockdown and tame the anxiety that spread along with the virus. Kate Walter an author based in New York City opted to teach herself harmonica because the instrument was small and portable and because she was ""bored and wanted a challenge."" Walter says it provided a welcome escape from her daily quarantine routine. Risa Kerslake a registered nurse and health freelance writer in Minneapolis MN learned to crochet simply to make a blanket for her daughter. She had no idea that the act of crocheting itself would turn out to be a ""tremendous stress reliever.""

The trend of adopting a hobby at the start of lockdown was international. In the UK Hobbycraft the country's largest craft supplier reported a 200% boom in online sales during the first few months of the pandemic. The same is true in the U.S. where leading craft store Michaels saw a 150 percent increase in viewers on its Facebook Live tutorials. Interest in Internet search terms including ""crafts"" and demand at stores such as Jo-Ann also rose.

It has long been acknowledged that hobbies can help ease stress and improve well-being during worrying times. But what is it that makes them so beneficial? According to neuroscientist Dr. Stan Rodski author of ""The Neuroscience of Mindfulness"" hobbies promote a state of relaxation when they require three things: control repetition and focus. Experts have noted that such attributes can help a person enter what is called a flow state.

Flow state a term which was popularized by psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura occurs when one becomes fully immersed in the task at hand. ""There's this focus that once it becomes intense leads to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity…you forget yourself you feel part of something larger"" Csikszentmihalyi said in a 2004 TED Talk.

It is thought that activities that induce this flow state activate the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Also known as the visceral or involuntary nervous system the ANS is made up of two parts: the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and it functions without our conscious voluntary control. This part of the central nervous system influences the activity of most tissues and organ systems in the body. When parts of the ANS activate it can help us relax and keep us in balance.

The good news is there is no one-size-fits-all calming activity. You don't have to take up knitting or even a type of craft to experience stress relieving benefits from a hobby. Any pastime can help keep you calm as long as it promotes the three qualities of control repetition and focus to help induce a flow state. For stitcher Kerslake though she did not start to crochet in order to use it as a stress relief tool she soon realized how much her anxiety would ease after an evening spent crocheting. It seems that in crochet she found an activity that helped her enter that flow state. ""There was something about doing the same repetitive stitch over and over again that really calmed my mind"" she said.

Dr. Rodski notes that it is also important that the activity one chooses be non-competitive. If the brain senses evaluation or comparison it will cause the nervous system to enter an aroused state reducing the relaxation effect. Harmonica player Walter enjoys playing the instrument precisely because the pursuit is free of competition. ""It is fun"" she said. ""There is no pressure.""

The good news about our pandemic hobbies is that their benefits can follow us long after the pandemic is under control. Activities to soothe our psyches and occupy our minds during the pandemic can be more than just fleeting fancies.

For diver Tom Daley he has not only turned his pandemic passion into a tool for relieving the stress of competition but he is now auctioning off his finished products to raise money for causes dear to his heart. Kerslake too is thrilled with her new diversion.

""I'm pretty sure this crochet hobby is the best thing that ever happened to me"" she said. ""It's not even about the stress relief though that's a huge perk."" Rather it's the joy of creating something new that makes her happiest. ""Hats mittens blankets shawls — I love it all"" she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtYm9hdC1jbHViLXN0aWxsLXJvd2luZy1hZnRlci0xNTEteWVhcnMvNjAwMDkxODQxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota Boat Club still rowing after 151 years,"Brooklyn-born brothers John and Charles Corning arrived in St. Paul in the late 1860s. John would become president of the Chaska Brick and Tile Co. in Minneapolis while Charlie started a foundry and a sash and door factory in St. Paul.

But the Corning brothers won their greatest fame rowing and racing ultralight boats on the Mississippi River around St. Paul's Raspberry Island.

The Minnesota Boat Club they helped organize in 1870 is still afloat celebrating a COVID-delayed 150th anniversary as the state's oldest athletic organization on Sept. 11 with a day of races and events (minnesotaboatclub.org/celebrate-150-years).

Two years before the club's founding John Wheeler Leavitt Corning showed up in St. Paul packing some fragile cargo. His prized rowing shell made of shellacked paper was too breakable to ship by train. So it came to St. Paul from New York ""by way of New Orleans by ocean and river vessels it being a popular belief in those days among rowing men that paper boats would not stand the long trip by rail"" according to a 1903 edition of the Razoo a quarterly boating publication.

John Corning attracted curious onlookers to the Mississippi River banks when he first jumped in and started to row. They ""never could see how he 'kept the derned thing right side up' "" the Razoo recalled.

Two years older than his brother Charlie Corning came to St. Paul in 1869 and became an acclaimed boat racer. The Corning brothers were two of the Minnesota Boat Club's founding 10 members in 1870 with John serving as the club's first secretary-treasurer and Charlie as its second president.

Minnesota Boat Club circa 1884: The Raspberry Island club was the place to be for rowers and elite society guests as the sport became a national craze along with boxing and horse racing by 1870. The Corning brothers of Brooklyn established the club as rowing quickly became a spectator sport and a gambling fixture along the Mississippi River in St. Paul.

By 1885 when 100 of St. Paul's elite men and women posed for a photo at the club's first boathouse on Raspberry Island the Minnesota Boat Club included the cream of the young city's crop. Posing with the Cornings in the photo were budding architect Cass Gilbert who would design the State Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court building; Lucius P. Ordway who would rescue and then lead 3M Co.; and William Merriam who would become Minnesota's 11th governor in 1889.

""While the club became a grand social organization it didn't start out that way"" said Sarah Risser a Minneapolis rowing buff who has written extensively about local boating history.

The Corning brothers ""were young kids in their 20s seeking to gain a foothold in post-Civil War St. Paul"" Risser said. ""They cobbled together this boat club and it was a gritty start.""

A floating boat house at the foot of the Robert Street Bridge served as the Boat Club's first headquarters — ""A crude affair"" the Razoo said in 1903 ""which used to leak and threaten to sink every once in so often and caused the 'boys' many a backache at the pumps to keep their house above the waves of 'Old Mississipp.' ""

Construction of a more substantial boathouse on Raspberry Island was completed in 1874. The current Spanish Revival boathouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places dates to 1910 according to club president Charlene McEvoy.

""Rowing became a national craze by 1870 right up there with horse racing and boxing as one of the country's most popular sports"" Risser said.

Spectators often gambled on the races lining the river bluffs and the Wabasha Street Bridge to cheer as racers — in single double and four-man boats — rowed upstream for a mile turned 180 degrees around a stake and sped back downstream to the boathouse.

""Charles Corning was the real star"" often competing nationally according to Risser. His crew once out-rowed a fabled London team in Philadelphia in 1876 according to Risser.

A photo of Charles Corning in the Minnesota Historical Society archives calls him the ""Father of the Minnesota Boat Club and Pioneer of Amateur Rowing in the Northwest."" John gets most of the credit as the first rower in the Twin Cities but many of those stories came from his son Leavitt who published the Razoo.

With popular regattas on July 4th and competitions against rowers from Minneapolis Winnipeg Chicago and Milwaukee at Devil's Lake Wis. and other venues the Minnesota Boat Club's prominence grew.

But as other sports such as tennis and golf grew more popular in the late 1800s the Boat Club fleet fell into disrepair. Financial problems forced it to cut ties with its nationally respected coach an ex-professional racer named John A. Kennedy.

In the 1990s the club's boathouse was nearly condemned and razed its windows busted and bird droppings littering the ballroom floor where city luminaries once danced. A $1 million renovation led by the city and private partners in 2004 sparked a grand reopening.

John Corning died 100 years ago at 76 outlasting Charlie by 33 years. They're buried at St. Paul's Oakland Cemetery. McEvoy said the club still owns a trophy named after the Corning brothers.

There are a lot of ways to make money on Wall Street. But if there's one common theme among the best-performing portfolios it's that they're often reliant on dividend stocks.

In 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management released a report that demonstrated just how dominant dividend stocks are relative to public companies that don't pay a dividend. Between 1972 and 2012 companies that initiated and grew their payouts averaged an annual gain of 9.5%. By comparison non-dividend-paying stocks only managed a meager annualized return of 1.6% over the same time frame.

These results shouldn't be a surprise. Since most dividend stocks are profitable and have time-tested operating models they're the ideal place for long-term investors and income seekers to park their money.

The quandary for income seekers is that they want the most income possible with the least amount of risk. However risk and yield tend to be correlated once you get into the high-yield category (above 4%).

But that's not the case with the following five high-yield stocks. These time-tested companies should continue to deliver for investors via share-price appreciation and yield. I believe they can double your initial investment by 2029 (or sooner).

Annaly Capital Management: 10.3% yield

For income seekers who'd prefer the dividend to do most of the heavy lifting mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management (NLY 0.35%) is a good bet to double your money by or before 2029. If you were to reinvest your payouts at this 10.3% yield Annaly's dividend alone would double your initial investment in seven years.

Mortgage REITs like Annaly aim to borrow money at lower short-term rates to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS) with higher long-term yields. The goal here is to maximize the difference between the average long-term MBS yield and the average borrowing rate which is known as net interest margin. Typically as the yield curve steepens during an economic recovery net interest margins widen. Thus as the U.S. economy finds its footing Annaly's core operations and profit potential should improve.

Annaly is also aided by its ability to prudently lean on leverage to pump up its earning potential. Since the bulk of its assets are agency securities -- i.e. those protected from default by the federal government -- Annaly can borrow money to a greater degree in order to increase its profits and fund its juicy dividend.

As one final note over the past two decades Annaly has averaged around a 10% dividend yield and it's paid out over $20 billion in dividends since its inception nearly a quarter-century ago.

AbbVie: 4.4% yield

On the other end of the high-yield dividend spectrum at least on this list is pharmaceutical stock AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%). Considering its 4.4% yield its modest growth potential and its insane value proposition AbbVie has all the tools needed to double investors' money by 2029 if not sooner.

There's no question that anti-inflammatory drug Humira is going to play a big role in AbbVie's long-term success. Prior to the mammoth sales associated with coronavirus vaccines Humira was the top-selling drug in the world. It has 10 approved indications in the U.S. 14 internationally and is pacing nearly $20 billion in annual sales for 2021 based on the $9.94 billion registered through the first six months of the year. Even with the potential for biosimilar competition in the U.S. in the coming years Humira's multiple approved indications and generally strong pricing power provide a runway for AbbVie to generate significant cash flow from its top drug.

Beyond Humira AbbVie has turned to acquisitions to diversify its revenue stream and further shore up its cash flow. In May 2020 it completed a cash-and-stock deal to buy Allergan. Aside from being immediately accretive to earnings the deal provides added cash flow for research and development and gives AbbVie another blockbuster presence with Botox which has cosmetic and therapeutic applications.

At less than nine times forward earnings AbbVie looks every part a steal for value investors and income seekers.

Altria Group: 7.1% yield

I'll be the first to admit that tobacco stocks aren't the sexy growth story they once were. But when push comes to shove few industries have more consistently delivered for investors over the long run. By 2029 Altria Group (MO 0.26%) the company behind the premium Marlboro cigarette brand in the U.S. is a good bet to double investors' money.

To state the obvious tobacco volume metrics have been headed in the wrong direction for decades. As people have become better educated about the negative health effects of tobacco use fewer adults have chosen to light up. Interestingly though this hasn't hurt Altria as much as you'd think. The company has exceptionally strong pricing power thanks in part to the addictive nature of nicotine and has been able to raise prices to offset cigarette-volume declines.

What's more Altria is aggressively investing in its future. It's been introducing the IQOS heated tobacco system (licensed in the U.S. from Philip Morris International) to a number of new U.S. markets and holds a 45% equity stake in Canadian marijuana stock Cronos Group. Expect Altria to work hand in hand with Cronos to develop vape products and establish a marketing strategy.

Since Altria offers investors a dividend yield of 7.1% only modest share-price appreciation would be needed for Altria to double your money by or before 2029.

IBM: 4.7% yield

For the past decade IBM (IBM 0.37%) has had about the same amount of appeal as watching paint dry. The tech stalwart waited too long to shift its focus to cloud computing. As a result it's seen sales for its legacy operations go in reverse. But following a decade of transformation a new IBM is blossoming that can once again deliver for its shareholders.

When the June quarter came to a close IBM reported $7 billion in cloud revenue which was up 13% from the prior-year period. More importantly cloud sales made up 37% of total revenue. Since cloud margins are considerably higher than the margins associated with IBM's legacy operations they're the key to growing the company's operating cash flow. As a reminder IBM loves to use its cash flow to pay its juicy 4.7% dividend buy back its stock and make bolt-on acquisitions (mostly in the cloud space).

It's also worth pointing out that IBM chose to focus on hybrid-cloud solutions -- those that combine public and private clouds -- allowing for data to be shared between the two platforms. The hybrid cloud is perfect for big-data projects which is something IBM has always excelled at. It's also ideal for a hybrid-working world with remote workforces a common theme since the pandemic began.

IBM is unlikely to return to its former glory. However a doubling of your initial investment by 2029 vis-à-vis dividend reinvestment and share-price appreciation seems very doable.

Enterprise Products Partners: 8.3% yield

A final high-yield dividend stock that can use its superior payout and share-price appreciation to double your money by 2029 or sooner is master-limited-partnership Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.51%).

After last year I can imagine the idea of owning oil stocks is a low priority for some investors. That's because an historic drawdown in crude oil demand ravaged the operating performance and balance sheets of most drillers.

However Enterprise Products Partners was hardly fazed because it's a midstream operator. In other words it controls more than 50000 miles of pipeline and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage space in addition to more than a dozen processing facilities.

The company's take-or-pay contracts are set up in such a way that a majority of its revenue and cash flow is highly transparent. This allows the company to outlay capital for infrastructure projects without having to worry about weighing down its profit potential or adversely impacting its lucrative dividend which stood at 8.3% as of this past weekend.

Something else noteworthy about Enterprise Products Partners is its dividend. The company has raised its base annual payout for 22 consecutive years and its distribution coverage ratio didn't drop below 1.6 during the pandemic (anything below 1 would signify an unsustainable payout). With incredible cash flow clarity and a willingness to spend on new infrastructure projects Enterprise Products Partners is a good bet to double investors' money by 2029.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Accenture Interactive – the world’s largest digital agency with revenues in excess of US$10 billion – has named Australian advertising legend David Droga as its next CEO and Creative Chairman.

David Droga founded acclaimed agency Droga5 which was acquired by Accenture in 2019 and recently expanded to the Asia Pacific and is the most awarded creative at the Cannes Lions festival. He replaces Brian Whipple who has held the role for the past ten years and is retiring from the agency next month.

As a young kid growing up in the NSW ski resort of Thredbo (a population of just 450) Droga dreamed of touring the world as an instructor. Rather he found himself in the mailroom of Grey Advertising an unlikely platform that would nevertheless see him soon enough take on the world stage. At just 22 he became the Executive Creative Director of OMON Sydney before shooting up the ranks at Saatchi & Saatchi in Singapore and Asia.

Barely a decade into his career at 31 and with a slew of achievements already under his belt Droga was named Executive Creative Director of Saatchi & Saatchi in London – one of the world’s most renowned agencies. A role as Worldwide Chief Creative Officer of the entire Publicis network followed before Droga set off on his own to establish Droga5 in New York in 2006 building it into an acclaimed $200 million business.

From the 1st of September he will helm an organisation which last year pulled in revenues of $10.6 billion with 18000 employees across 40 offices worldwide. “At a time when our clients are led by purpose brand and the transformation of experience David’s global perspective and unmatched creative track record allows us to help clients unlock business and human outcomes in unprecedented ways” said Accenture CEO Julie Sweet.

Droga takes over from Brian Whipple who will retire after spending altogether 20 years at the professional services giant. First joining Accenture for a ten-year stint as a strategy consultant in 1987 Whipple then spent 12 years between advertising agencies RAPP and Hill Holliday – respectively as senior vice president and COO – before rejoining the firm in 2011 to head up Accenture Interactive shortly after its formation.

During his tenure Whipple has overseen more than 30 acquisitions including Australian indie The Monkeys (CEO Mark Green now heads up Accenture Interactive in Australia and New Zealand) and a recent entry into Southeast Asia through the pick up of Malaysian branding agency Entropia. The biggest statement though was the purchase of Droga5 which was recently named by both Adweek and AdAge as ‘Agency of the Decade’.

“Accenture Interactive has rapidly become the leading digital powerhouse at the intersection of data creativity and technology” commented Droga. “As the world seeks to build back better Interactive will continue to play a critical role in creating 360 degree value for our clients. I look forward to putting further emphasis on our creative excellence coupling it with our world-class ingenuity and proven expertise in Interactive and experiences.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzM4NjkvMTAtY2hhcnRzLW9uLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtZmFzdC1ncm93aW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2VjdG9y0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uc3VsdGFuY3kuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvYW1wLzM4NjkvMTAtY2hhcnRzLW9uLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtZmFzdC1ncm93aW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2VjdG9y?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 charts on Australia’s fast growing technology sector,"The Technology Council of Australia has commissioned consulting firm Accenture to conduct a strategic market assessment of Australia’s technology sector with the aim of shaping policy development for what is now the country’s third biggest industry behind just mining and banking. 10 charts from the report on the sector’s growth and outlook.

The technology sector is a critical pillar of the Australian economy contributing $167 billion to the economy. The sector’s contribution has increased 79% since 2016 and has outpaced average growth of other industries by more than four times in part due to an acceleration due to accelerated digital adoption during Covid-19.

The tech sector currently is the third highest contributor to GDP in Australia behind only mining and banking and ahead of healthcare construction and retail.

The direct contribution of the tech sector amounts to $76 billion. This segment includes the value generated by categories such as software analytics business applications technology intelligence technology enabling infrastructure e-commerce digital media and online payments solutions.

The majority of Australia’s direct tech contribution is derived from technology services and intelligence.

The indirect contribution of technology is however larger at $92 billion. In today’s digital era technologies are a strong part of the value chain and operations of most businesses in the economy from traditional areas such as agriculture retail and manufacturing to service businesses such as finance and professional services.

The growth potential of the tech sector means that it will actively cement its place as a pillar of the Australian economy over the next decade surpassing the contribution of the primary and manufacturing industries.

Employment in the tech sector

The tech sector is one of the biggest generators of quality jobs for a diverse range of skillsets in Australia. Tech jobs are critical to the growth of tech firms and industries that use tech in their businesses such as banking agriculture mining retail and manufacturing. Meanwhile tech firms also create broader employment opportunities as they hire support occupations in non-tech roles such as sales and marketing administration human resources and legal.

Since 2005 tech sector jobs have grown 66% compared to an average growth rate of 35% across the economy.

In terms of the total number of jobs the tech sector is seventh largest employer in Australia.

Growth in tech jobs has diversified away from major capital cities and is strongest in regional and suburban areas. The highest growth rates for ICT professionals are mostly on the outskirts of Sydney and Melbourne including Sydney’s Outer South West (including Campbelltown Camden and Narellan) and Melbourne West (including Sunshine West Williamstown and Altona).

Five of the top 10 fastest growing regions for ICT professionals are in South-East Queensland with the highest average growth rates recorded in East Brisbane. Regional cities including Adelaide and Hobart also experienced high growth in the number of ICT professionals.

Advancing the sector’s impact

According to the report by Technology Council of Australia and Accenture while Australia’s tech sector has seen strong growth in recent years ongoing barriers to innovation and development have constrained its size relative to its peers. For example the direct tech sector contributes 3.8% of Australian GDP which is significantly below the US (10.2%) UK (8.1%) and Canada (6.8%).

As a result Australia has a substantial opportunity to increase the economic contribution of the tech sector to catch up with its global peers. If Australia for instance can match Canada’s tech sector contribution (Canada is chosen as a benchmark because it has a similar economy to Australia with dominant agriculture and mining sectors) then it could generate an additional $30 billion in economic value per year by 2031.

If ambitious stretch targets were set and Australia met the UK or the US’ current sector contribution in the next decade it could achieve an additional $54 billion to $124 billion in economic value per year by 2031.

This additional growth could provide a strong boost to tech sector employment. Under a growth scenario where Australia can match Canada’s tech sector contribution the tech sector will employ 1 million people by 2025 or an additional 141000 workers in the next five years. Under the stretch UK or US scenarios between 277000 and 638000 additional workers could be employed annually by the tech sector in 2031.

Commenting on the report Kate Pounder the CEO of the Technology Council of Australia (and a former Accenture and McKinsey & Company consultant) said: “The tech sector has matured and accelerated through the Covid-19 pandemic and is now one of the most important drivers of growth in the economy contributing 8.5% to GDP and employing one in 16 Australians.”

“By addressing challenges in the sector and catching up to global peers Australia can realise a tech-supported recovery securing (hundreds of) thousands of new jobs and contributing billions annually to GDP. Government in partnership with industry should play a key role in capturing this opportunity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhYmxlLm5nL3Byb2ZpbGUtb21vYm9sYS1qb2huc29uLXBpb25lZXItbWluaXN0ZXItYm9hcmQtY2hhaXItYW5kLWEtd29tYW4tb2YtbWFueS1maXJzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROFILE: Omobola Johnson pioneer minister board chair and a woman of many firsts,"Omobola Johnson is one of Nigeria’s boardroom gurus defying societal limits and breaking new grounds with remarkable achievements.

ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9waG90b3Nob3AvaG93LW1hc3Rlci1za3ktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtcGhvdG9zaG9wLWNjLTU3NzEyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Master Sky Replacement With Photoshop CC,"Replaces skies in minutes with Photoshop CC's replace sky feature and these useful tips to get perfect results every time.

You might think that Photoshop CC's new sky replacement tool is a fix-all feature that can work magic. Largely you'd be correct. It uses AI technology to scan your images and make complex masks while overlaying some of the preset skies already installed in the software. But sometimes things can go awry as everything that involves technology does and your skies can end up looking unimpressive or worse yet downright unrealistic.

That's okay though because Adobe has thought of this by giving us users some useful controls and sliders to help the feature along a little bit. That said there are some things to look out for when matching up photographs and sky presets which I'll outline below.

In this example the misty mountain scene is not an ideal shot for a sky replacement. The gradual fading between land and featureless sky makes it almost impossible for the tool to create a realistic-looking sky.

The first big barrier is to find a photograph that is suited to a sky replacement. Not every photo will be a match such as my example above of the mist rolling in over mountains. This makes it very hard for the AI to comprehend and as you can see it ends up doing a pretty bad job despite its best efforts to fade it in with the mist. I think even a well-seasoned image editor would have their work cut out to make a brilliant job at a sky replacement for this kind of shot though. Other images that probably won't work that well are anything where the foreground and background are especially out of focus (think shallow depth of field) because Photoshop will need image data to make its calculations.

Start Sky Replacement

Start your sky replacement by choosing an image with expansive skies that is clear enough for Photoshop to easily scan and mask. Head to Edit>Sky Replacement to start.

I've chosen this shot for a sky replacement for a few reasons. First off the sky is a little drab and doesn't really enhance the scene despite taking up a large portion of the frame. The trees provide complex outlines with plenty of tiny spaces in between the leaves which if you were masking traditionally could take hours to deal with. Also it was taken at sunset so we have warmer yellow and purple tones in the sky which are clearly absorbed by the buildings and trees even though they're in shade. To start a sky replacement head to Edit>Sky Replacement.

Match the Sky to the Scene

This sunset scene doesn't work with a sky taken at twilight because the exposure and colors do not match making the effect look unrealistic

As I mentioned this shot was taken at sunset so we expect warm tones. The Sky Replacement feature has many skies presets to choose from and the first one that opened on my laptop was this sky that was clearly taken at dusk after the sun had already passed beyond the horizon. The blue tones really do not match the ambient scene at all and Photoshop is clearly having a hard time trying to fade the effect into the trees and building. Instead we'll need something much brighter and warmer.

Appropriate Sky Matching

By choosing a sunset sky we now match brightness and color tones in the original image and it already looks more convincing without any extra settings changes.

After flicking through a few options I've settled on this scene. The clouds provide rich texture which is much needed for this expansive sky view and it has rich orange hues reminiscent of a sunset. The clouds are even slightly backlit roughly matching where the sun was actually positioned in the original photo. Now that we have colors and lighting fairly close to the original it's time to refine the settings.

Fade the Edge

The edges of the sky can be faded into the original foreground quite easily with the Shift Edge and Fade Edge controls.

The Sky Replacement tool has multiple settings to allow a smooth transition from the sky to the environment. From top to bottom we have Shift Edge which allows manual control of where the mask is drawn around the foreground subjects. Next is Fade Edge which will blend the sky in with the rest of the scene. I've decided to turn this down from 100 to 65 here because I wanted this blend to be a little more abrupt. The original fade at 100 displayed a slight glow around the scene which I was unhappy with.

Sky adjustments can be found underneath these settings and provide brightness and temperature sliders which help match the exposure and white balance in the original photo. Scale either zooms in or out on the background sky image which is useful to match the size of the sky with the proximity of the foreground.

Alter the Other Parameters

Make final tweaks to brightness and temperature parameters before deciding how to output the resulting image whether on a new layer or a duplicate layer of the original photo.

There are dedicated foreground adjustment controls which I didn't need to use in this shot but the next most important control is the output box at the bottom of the window. You can switch between having the replacement sky on a new layer or a duplicate layer. A new layer will allow you to toggle between the masked sky and the original photo on a separate layer and this brings the opportunity to refine the mask manually should you wish to do so. By duplicating the layer you have a brand new layer with the applied sky replacement on it which is a little less flexible.

If you need to give a final polish then I recommend exporting it out over to Lightroom for a final sweep of exposure tone and color. But if you don't have Lightroom you could always use the adjustment layers in Photoshop which allow for non-destructive editing of your photo which can be altered at any point.

The main step to remember when using the sky replacement feature in Photoshop CC is to find a photograph with enough sky in the frame for a decent replacement devoid of any obscuring by mist or fog. This will make it easier for the software to do its job. Choose a sky preset that roughly matches the scene you have in the original photograph including color balance exposure values and light direction. Make simple adjustments to the controls available in the sky replacement feature and don't go too extreme; if you find yourself moving the sliders to either end for every setting it might be worth switching skies or re-editing the original photograph. Then finally choose which method you want to output the result to whether duplicating the original layer with the sky superimposed or on a new layer from which to edit and alter the mask or turn it on and off as this option also allows for a blend between skies by adjusting the opacity of the layer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2tvbGhhcHVyL2F1dG8tZHJpdmVycy1kYXVnaHRlci1iYWdzLWFkb2Jlcy00MWwtYW5udWFsLXBheS1vZmZlci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTY5NDk5Ni5jbXPSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9rb2xoYXB1ci9hdXRvLWRyaXZlcnMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItYmFncy1hZG9iZXMtNDFsLWFubnVhbC1wYXktb2ZmZXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1Njk0OTk2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kolhapur: Auto driver’s daughter bags Adobe’s 41 lakh annual pay offer,KOLHAPUR: In times of salary cuts and loss of job opportunities due the Covid pandemic the Rs 41-lakh annual pay packet offered to Kolhapur girl Amruta Karande certainly bucks the trend.The 21-year-old who is still pursuing her fourth year software engineering course at the Kolhapur Institute of Technology (KIT) College here got this pre-placement offer letter from US software giant Adobe to work as a software development engineer at their Noida office.Amruta hails from a middle-class family.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L3dpbGwtYW1kLWJlLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1pbnRlbC1ieS0yMDI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will AMD Be Worth More Than Intel by 2025?,"David is growing larger as Goliath shrinks.

During the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 Intel's (INTC -0.15%) market cap briefly surpassed $500 billion. At the time its smaller rival AMD (AMD 0.06%) was only worth about $12 billion.

But today Intel has a market cap of just $215 billion and AMD is worth $130 billion. Let's see why Intel's value tumbled as AMD gradually caught up and whether or not AMD could eclipse Intel by 2025.

How Intel lost its momentum

At its dot-com peak Intel was valued at nearly 50 times its 2020 earnings. Today the stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings compared to AMD's forward P/E ratio of 35.

The market's enthusiasm for Intel waned as it ceded the CPU market to AMD in the early 2000s. However AMD spread its resources too thinly after it expanded into the GPU market with its acquisition of ATI in 2006 and it struggled to battle Intel and Nvidia (NVDA 1.39%) across two different markets.

Intel struck back with new CPUs and it comfortably controlled 82.5% of the global CPU market by the third quarter of 2016 according to PassMark Software. AMD controlled the remaining 17.5%.

But over the past five years the tables turned. Intel struggled to maintain its two-year ""tick-tock"" cycle of shrinking down chips and refining them and its internal foundry fell behind TSMC (TSM 4.75%) in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips. It repeatedly struggled with delays and shortages and frustrated OEMs shifted back toward AMD.

AMD spun off its internal foundry as GlobalFoundries in 2009 and became a fabless chipmaker that outsourced its chips to third-party foundries. AMD initially outsourced most if its orders to GlobalFoundries but eventually switched to TSMC and Samsung's more advanced processes. That decision enabled AMD to produce more advanced chips than Intel while delivering a stable supply of CPUs and GPUs to OEMs.

As a result AMD claimed 39.8% of the global CPU market in the third quarter of 2021 according to PassMark while Intel held a 60% share. That stunning reversal caused AMD's revenue growth to outpace Intel's by a wide margin over the past five years:

How Intel plans to catch up

Intel recently renamed its existing processes doubled down on the expansion of its foundries and claimed it could catch up to TSMC by 2024 and reclaim the process lead by 2025. Meanwhile AMD's future will likely remain tethered to TSMC's new processes through 2025.

Therefore the upcoming battle will be between Intel and TSMC instead of AMD. But even in a best-case scenario it should take Intel a few more years to manufacture smaller chips than TSMC.

AMD's current CPUs are built with TSMC's 7nm process. Intel's latest chips are built with its own 10nm process which is comparable to TSMC's 7nm node in terms of density but larger and less power-efficient.

AMD plans to launch its 5nm Zen 4 CPUs in 2022 and those chips could include an integrated RDNA 2 GPU to simultaneously compete against Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs. Intel will launch its ""Intel 7"" (formerly 10nm) and ""Intel 4"" (formerly 7nm) chips in 2022.

Intel believes its ""Intel 4"" chips will outperform TSMC's 5nm chips (and draw some attention away from exact node sizes) but it has a lousy track record: It previously fumbled its transitions between its ""old"" 14nm 10nm and 7nm nodes. If Intel drops the ball again it could face more delays shortages and market share losses to AMD which merely needs to rely on TSMC to remain competitive.

How AMD could eclipse Intel by 2025

Analysts expect AMD to grow faster than Intel over the next two years.

Metric AMD

(FY 2021) AMD

(FY 2022) Intel

(FY 2021) Intel

(FY 2022) Revenue Growth 60% 16% (5%) (1%) EPS Growth 93% 23% (10%) (7%)

We should take those estimates with a grain of salt but they reflect the current strength of AMD's CPU and GPU businesses its robust sales of custom APUs for gaming consoles and Intel's market share losses across the desktop laptop and server markets. Intel's earnings will also likely decline as it expands its domestic foundries and develops new chips.

It's difficult to tell what will happen after 2022. Intel might miss its own targets resulting in more market share losses to AMD or it could fulfill its goals and strike back at AMD with more powerful chips.

If Intel stumbles and its growth stagnates through 2025 there's a strong chance AMD's growth will accelerate its stock will more than double and its market cap will eclipse Intel's. But if Intel's turnaround plans pay off its stock could rally and make it much more valuable than AMD again.

The bottom line

I'm not sure if AMD will be more valuable than Intel by 2025. However I believe AMD will remain a superior investment for three reasons: It's led by a visionary CEO who has skillfully boxed Intel into a corner its business is better diversified across the CPU GPU and APU markets and it wisely relies on TSMC and other foundries instead of manufacturing its own chips.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2RvZS1oZXdsZXR0LXBhY2thcmQtZW50ZXJwcmlzZXMtcG9sYXJpcy1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZG9lLWhld2xldHQtcGFja2FyZC1lbnRlcnByaXNlcy1wb2xhcmlzLXN1cGVyY29tcHV0ZXIuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Department of Energy Hewlett Packard Enterprises unveil Polaris supercomputer,"A delay in the delivery of Intel Corporation's exascale supercomputer to the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory has created a new opportunity for chipmaker rivals NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

LINDA MCMAHON TAKES DIG AT BIG TECH OVER CENSORSHIP: PEOPLE COME TO OUR COUNTRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH

On Wednesday Argonne unveiled Polaris a testbed supercomputer made up of 280 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Apollo Gen10 Plus systems and powered by 2240 of NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units and 560 of AMD's second- and third-generation EPYC processors.

Polaris is expected to deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical artificial intelligence performance up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers. (A single exaflop is equal to one ""quintillion"" calculations per second or 1000 petaflops. A single petaflop is equal to one ""quadrillion"" calculations per second.)

The machine will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications that will be used by Intel's $500 million Aurora supercomputer for a range of scientific projects from advancing cancer treatments and the nation’s energy security to expanding the boundaries of physics with particle collision research.

""Polaris is well equipped to help move the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility] into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users"" ALCF director Michael Papka said in a statement.

Polaris which was delivered and installed in August will go into use starting in early 2022 before opening to the broader high performance computing community in the spring of 2022.

A spokesperson for Argonne National Laboratory confirmed to FOX Business that the Aurora system will be faster than Polaris providing greater than 1 exaFLOP of double precision peak performance. Aurora was originally supposed to be delivered in 2021 but has been delayed for several months.

The delay is being caused by Intel's Sapphire Rapids core processing units and Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units key components of the Aurora system. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business that Aurora remains on track for delivery next year with the chips expected to go into production in 2022.

The struggle for Intel and opportunity for NVIDIA and AMD comes as the three tech giants are battling it out for dominance in the data center chip market.

In addition to Polaris AMD will help power the National Nuclear Security Administration's $600 million El Capitan supercomputer which is set to be delivered to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in early 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the world's fastest exascale computer producing record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops 10 times faster than the current most powerful supercomputer.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is currently powering Oakridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer developed in collaboration with IBM which can produce 200 petaflops or 200000 trillion calculations per second.

The fake 3DFX Twitter account is still fresh in our minds.Â

For starters ATI never closed down. ATI was purchased by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) back in 2006. ATI is still operating today albeit under the AMD brand. AMD stopped using the ATI brand name in 2010 though the company’s Radeon branding remains in active use.Â

AMD is unlikely to reforge its legacy ATI brand as it would diminish its broader AMD brand name. AMD still owns the ATI brand name and some of AMD’s Canadian locations still operate under the ATI Technologies ULC name (according to AMD’s website). Beyond that nobody can create a new entity called ATI Technologies without being sued into oblivion by AMD.Â

Unless AMD decides to revive its legacy ATI branding it is unlikely that the ATI name will return in any meaningful way. The fact that this troll account links to ati.com a website that redirects to AMD’s website and that the account’s latest Tweet uses Radeon branded imagery already confirms that there is no “new ATI” on the horizon.Â",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92aXJnaW4tcml2ZXItZmlyZWQtc2hvdy1wb3N0cy0xNjAwMDA4MjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Virgin River' Fans Are Fired Up After the Show Posts a Cryptic Instagram of Jack,"Fans of Netflix's hit series Virgin River were sent into an emotional spiral last week after the show's account posted a behind the scenes photo of Martin Henderson.

In the photo Martin is holding a baby and fans immediately flocked to the comments to swoon over his fatherly potential.

Virgin River fans were treated to a sweet behind-the-scenes snapshot last week when the show shared an adorable photo of one of the stars Martin Henderson (a.k.a Jack) holding a baby.

The show's Instagram account cheekily captioned the pic ""Jack ready to be a Dad?…BTS S3"" — undoubtedly knowing that it would cause quite the stir among dedicated fans of the series. (SPOILERS: As of the season 3 finale Mel is pregnant but she's not sure whether the baby is Jack's or her dead husband Mark's. Drama!!!)

Fans quickly flooded the comments with messages like ""Yes I believe he is ready mainly with his and Mel's baby"" and ""Cuteness overload! We are gonna die seeing Jack with their baby. 😭""

Another fan chimed in with a bit of funny skepticism: ""Ready or not there he goes😂😆""

One fan took a stand that really resonated with other users (the comment has 245 likes!) — ""While I have zero issues with looking at the show and books independently there is 1 thing that is non-negotiable. Mel and Jack need to end up happily married with kids.""

FWIW: The baby pictured in the photo is likely Chloe Lilly's daughter on the show but it sure makes it easy to imagine Jack with a baby of his own!

While the show has not confirmed well anything about the future plot we'll certainly be following along with the teasers. We can't wait to see what season 4 has in store.

Once we got over our shock—“Wait! That’s our house!”—we immediately made reservations to rent it for a family vacation. The new owners had known my parents and generously waived our rental fee upon realizing who we were. The online description—“rustic retreat”—brought back memories of countless family gatherings of summers past: taking long walks swimming in the lake eating local corn and blueberry pie. I remembered hanging out together on the deck that extended into my parents’ gentle south-sloping meadow like a pier appreciating the peaceful view of hay fields spruce trees mountains and an ever-changing sky.

I looked forward to the reunion for months. And yet as I drove with my wife and young children along winding mountain roads that I knew by heart I was surprised by the emotions stirring inside me. I began to realize something that should have been obvious. This special idealized place that I was so excited to return to wasn’t a repository of just happy memories but of difficult ones too. My parents had been concerned about the political and environmental trends in America. Their place in Vermont was meant to be a political statement in the form of a modern-day frontier house—hand-built off the grid and completely DIY. In other words it was very difficult to live in and maintain. Now that many of their worries about climate change and political unrest have become reality I understand the prescience of their vision and the virtues of the life they were designing. I also realized something even more important however when I rented their home as an Airbnb: No matter how hard you try to escape the future the future will find you anyway.

May 2015

In the 1990s my parents sold our family home in suburban Boston and moved to a virgin piece of pasture in Vermont’s rural and remote Northeast Kingdom in order to build a house—and a life—from scratch. They wanted to slow down to live simply and more in concert with nature and its seasonal rhythms. My siblings their spouses and I not only supported this new chapter but were actively involved every step of the way. Though we all had careers homes and lives in other places we would parachute in every August to help pour a foundation build a timber frame side a barn or mow a field. This collective labor gave us a sense of investment in the property—“sweat equity”—and senses of accomplishment pride and joy in its growing compound of rough-hewn structures. We finished the “little house” (which is actually tiny) in time for my sister’s wedding one August and we finished the “big house” (which is actually quite little) in time for my brother’s wedding six years (to the day) later.

Aaron Gilbreath: What I’m teaching my daughter about living in extreme heat

This property was the realization of a long-held dream. My father was an MIT-trained architect and builder with his own brand of rugged modernism. His houses were shrines to their specific surroundings made out of locally sourced wood stone and glass. After spending a lifetime building homes for others he wanted to finally build one for himself and his family.

But he wasn’t trying to construct a well-appointed vacation home and my parents weren’t hoping to retire comfortably to the country. They were hoping that their modest compound could be a refuge a place separate and protected from the evil and disease of the modern world a place to which we could all retreat when the long-prophesied and always-imminent economic and ecological disaster of Man’s own making finally came home to roost. With its solar panels windmill vegetable garden root cellar and well it was designed to be a self-sufficient place apart a lifeboat of sorts.

Though my parents’ organic less-is-more lifestyle was supposed to be simple it was never easy. Their life was intentional and incredibly labor-intensive marked by hard work and discomfort. Their property became an unrelenting taskmaster. Many projects never got completed. Some just didn’t work. The sun didn’t always shine. The wind didn’t always blow. Batteries failed. The bespoke high-efficiency refrigerator didn’t actually keep food cold. The well was contaminated with surface water from a nearby cow pasture and never produced reliably potable water. My parents’ self-imposed restrictions on energy usage—my father designed an aggressively frugal system that used only one-20th the amount of electricity of an average American family—seemed arbitrary impossibly difficult and puritanical; a dishwasher or clothes dryer was out of the question.

They—and we—argued a lot about how they lived and the choices they had made. I thought theirs should be a model home an equally attractive non-fossil-fuel alternative that others could easily emulate so that we could collectively save the planet. My father thought it should be more of a laboratory that embraced cutting-edge experimentation took risks and courted failure. He thought it should be difficult by design so as to attract only zealots purists and true believers.

August 2019; May 2015

My mother sometimes complained about the ways the house didn’t work and she felt burdened by the endless list of domestic chores that seemed to fall disproportionately on her but she nonetheless embraced this new life with passion and conviction. Why? For starters she loved my dad and believed in his genius and vision. She was also a longtime political and environmental activist. Lastly thanks to her strong Protestant work ethic and her progressive Christian faith she always believed that wisdom and virtue came from labor sacrifice and struggle. I think she loved this new difficult chapter of her life not despite the challenges but because of them. It made her feel more alive more connected to her husband and to herself her planet and her God.

One particularly hot and restless night in the summer of 2003 while sleeping in my parents’ barn I awoke with a scary premonition: Things here were not going to end well. My parents were not going to live forever and I had a feeling that their path ahead might be far more difficult and treacherous than any of us were prepared for. A few months later my mother was diagnosed with cancer. The next three years were consumed by her illness including her weekly drives across the state for radiation and chemotherapy. The August after she died we had a memorial service for her under a tent in the exact same spot in the meadow where my sister and brother had each been married years earlier.

My father lived for eight more years but his heart was never the same. First it was broken and then eventually it began to fail. What he could do—and wanted to do—shrank considerably. For the first time ever he stopped planting a garden. “What’s the point?” he said. Mail piled up. Bills went unpaid. Phone calls went unanswered. Dirt and dust collected everywhere. Necessary and long-overdue house maintenance was put off indefinitely. He would spend hours and days sitting and staring at the clouds in the summer and at the wood fire in the winter. The house he built with his own hands became a waiting room a purgatory clad in native spruce. One day in November 2013 he couldn’t get out of bed. I was visiting at the time having driven north from Rhode Island after receiving a call from a concerned neighbor. I remember the ambulance in the front yard parked on top of my mother’s perennial garden and EMTs dressed in Carhartt overalls taking my dad away on a gurney.

My father died the following August; two months later we mixed my parents’ ashes and spread them in the meadow as friends and family looked on.

After my father’s death my siblings and I debated whether to keep the Vermont property. I always thought we would. But the more we talked the more I realized it was going to be financially and logistically impossible. The buildings were not in great shape. Managing their restoration and preservation was going to be complicated and expensive and was going to take time energy and money that none of us had. Moreover the property was hard to reach. We also realized that we weren’t simply inheriting a house or a piece of land but a way of life a philosophy a set of values that we all respected but didn’t fully subscribe to. No we all decided it wasn’t right—or perhaps the right time—for any of us. With heavy hearts we decided to let it go.

October 2005

Fast-forward to the summer before last five years after my father’s death: We were returning to our family homestead but this time as Airbnb guests. As we approached the house from the long dirt driveway everything was at once familiar and surprisingly different. I instantly noticed all of the improvements: a new metal roof new wood siding and a completely rebuilt breezeway connecting the two houses; lush new landscaping featuring exotic flora and brilliant orange poppies that reminded me of California; a new well professionally dug with (I learned later) sweet cold—and E. coli–free—artesian water.

The interior was stunning and immaculate. Everything seemed carefully and painstakingly finished no more exposed electrical wires or pipes. A new floor was made out of spotted maple and a fresh coat of satin varnish covered all the wood surfaces. The decor was modern and sparse—chairs made out of soft Italian leather and German stainless-steel appliances including a dishwasher and a dryer. To my eyes the house had never looked better and had never been more beautiful more finished more realized. The future looked good on this house. My appreciation was complicated however tinged with envy and regret. Why couldn’t this beautifully designed and now brilliantly realized house still be ours?

Read: The unbearable summer

I also couldn’t help but notice what was no longer there: the vegetable garden; the windmill; the woodshed wood stoves and Finnish oven; the solar electric system. The house is now on the grid and comfortably heated with gas its massive propane storage tank elegantly concealed underground. Sure the house still looks groovy but it’s now hippie house lite like tie-dyes and distressed bell-bottoms one buys at the Gap. It has the counterculture aesthetic but all the dirt difficulty and rebelliousness have been removed. As my father might say “What’s the point?”

But I have come to realize that the new owners have actually been the perfect stewards of our old property. Their careful and systematic restoration has removed the dust decay and dysfunction while preserving the essential design and rustic charm. I also realize that it is their house now not ours and maybe that’s a good thing. The burden of the property its deferred maintenance and challenging memories was too much and is too much for me still.

The author’s brother mother and father. August 2001

Now two years—and a world of difference—later I find myself thinking about that piece of pasture in northern Vermont and my family’s 25-year adventure there. We are living through such scary and turbulent times. We are simultaneously in the throes of a resurgent global pandemic and a rapidly emerging climate crisis. Viral death tolls huge heat domes megadroughts and 1000-year floods mark our daily news. As I write this dozens of massive western fires burn uncontained their smoke turning even eastern skies an eerie and unhealthy shade of ocher. The world is changing in ways that many people find hard to believe and hard to endure but that my parents essentially anticipated. They were preparing for this future; they saw it coming and tried so hard to protect their family—and themselves—from the pain and suffering that they feared it might bring. Now that that future is here I realize we can’t really escape it. The future always catches up with us and no matter where we are or where we go we are all survivalists now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2VuLWF1L3JldHJlYXQtZmVhdHVyZWQtaW4tbmluZS1wZXJmZWN0LXN0cmFuZ2Vycy1hdmFpbGFibGUtdG8tYm9vay1vbi1haXJibmIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retreat featured in Nine Perfect Strangers available to book on Airbnb,"Audiences captivated by the new hit series Nine Perfect Strangers streaming weekly on Amazon Prime Video and starring a cast that includes Nicole Kidman Melissa McCarthy and Asher Keddie can book the wellness retreat where most of the series was filmed on Airbnb.

Or follow us on Google News

We may have experienced peak fossil car sales in the USA and the peak year wasn’t even very recently. It appears that the year that will go down in history as the peak year for fossil-powered light-duty vehicle sales was 2016. Ironically that’s also the year the Tesla Model 3 was unveiled.

Fully-electric vehicle sales aren’t anywhere close to peaking of course. A record number of nearly 250000 full-electric vehicles were sold in the States in 2020 and 2021 is likely to do better.

In 2016 the US saw a record 17500719 new auto sales. That was still a year with a rather small percentage of sales coming from full-electric car sales which didn’t start really hopping until 2018. After 4 years of auto sales declines in 2020 14697837 new passenger autos were sold across the nation. Naturally sales were hit by the pandemic (and the chip shortage) which made 2020 an especially low year for auto sales but EV sales just kept growing nonetheless (see the yellow bars in the chart above). It’s unlikely that gas-car sales will ever rebound and get to their 2016 record height.

Pure EV sales in the country went up from 1.4% of the light-duty vehicles market in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020. This is still dramatically lower than what we’re seeing in Europe and China (more than 7% market share each in 2021 — 7.6% in Europe and 9.4% in China).

Interestingly plugin hybrids saw their sales decline from a possible peak in 2018 (0.7% share of the market). Removing plugin hybrid vehicles and even conventional hybrids the sales total was just 12.7 million in 2020 almost 3 million sales lower than the 15.3 million of 2019.

As I reported recently one of our writers Maarten Vinkhuyzen laid out a couple of years ago how a big tech transition isn’t just a smooth and orderly line that the Osborne effect comes into play. It’s not a perfect representation but look at the similarities in the graph above and the graph below. Conventional auto sales are collapsing faster than electric sales are growing.

It’s long past time for both corporations and individuals to set 100% electric vehicle goals. We are far from that target but you have to start somewhere. It was not that long ago that Europe and China were down at 1.7% full electric vehicle market share. It doesn’t have to be long until the US EV market reaches 10% market share.

WWE

With this year's WWE SummerSlam now in the books there's word on where one of the company's upcoming tentpole PPV may emanate from.

As per Fightful the 2022 Royal Rumble looks likely to take place in St. Louis Missouri.

Previously there were some rumblings that WWE's annual January spectacle could be held in Seattle although the belief now is that St. Louis is the clear frontrunner to host next year's Rumble show.

On the ""annual January spectacle"" front of course there has been some internal talk of WWE moving the 2022 Royal Rumble to February for the first time in the event's history. As of this writing a formal decision has yet to be made on any such move.

Before we get to the Royal Rumble mind first up there's Extreme Rules on 26 September a return to Saudi Arabia with Crown Jewel on 21 October the 2021 Survivor Series on November 21 and a to-be-confirmed December PPV from Rosemont's Allstate Arena.

Speaking at the Allstate Soccer Show on Sunday afternoon Forge FC star Kwame Awuah and York United stalwart Jordan Wilson shared some of their thoughts on the state of the sport in Canada as well as stories from their own careers and some advice for players looking to one day break into the professional ranks as Awuah and Wilson did.

The two players have quite different backgrounds in soccer — though both hail from the Greater Toronto Area — with Awuah originally going the route of the NCAA with the University of Connecticut followed by MLS with New York City FC and Wilson instead opting to play in Denmark for the early stages of his career with Nykøbing FC.

Awuah having been at NYCFC in the club’s early days while David Villa Andrea Pirlo and coach Patrick Vieira were still there has no shortage of stories about the footballing legends from whom he certainly learned a lot. After an anecdote about his first meeting with Vieira — in the World Cup-winning Frenchman’s hotel room at the MLS SuperDraft combine — Awuah went on to share how those monumental figures helped shape him as a player.

“(Vieira) gave me the ability to understand the game better” Awuah said. “Where the ball should be played where your options are every little minor detail he helped me to learn all that. Playing with Pirlo you can tell those guys played at the highest level. When the ball touches their foot when they strike the ball the way they carry themselves — obviously their personalities are different Pirlo was more reserved or relaxed and Villa’s more… how can I say it? I guess egotistical.”

Certainly playing with those who have seen the highest levels of the sport is motivating and it can help a young player — which Awuah was at the time — with their own game.

How though does one get to those high levels?

Asked what advice they would offer to young players in academies or youth teams still trying to make their way up the footballing ladder both Awuah and Wilson reflected on their own experiences in the youth game.

“For me I think the most important thing was just having fun” Awuah said. “I look back at the times I used to play club soccer and those were really the happiest times in my life. Win or lose I always knew I’m playing with my best friends I’m getting better enjoying it and I knew that when it came to the game plan everything you did in training was going to be implemented in a game.”

Wilson added that there’s plenty a player can learn from not being the most talented or the best in their team or age group.

“I grew up in ’91 that class was ridiculous in terms of talent and players coming out” he recalled. “So for me I actually relish the fact that I wasn’t the cat’s meow I wasn’t a big dog. I was playing with big dogs… Even now when I talk to someone who’s younger I say it’s a blessing in disguise to always be chasing always working and aspiring to be one of the better players or one of the best players is amazing. I think for younger players I would just say don’t compare yourself to others. Everyone’s on a journey I remember being 14 and not getting caught up with the guys who were fast at 14 because I just wanted to be the best for myself.

“Eventually it wasn’t all at once but maybe 18 19 20 I started to surpass people but if you’re always measuring up against someone you’re always gonna be chasing it.”

Awuah agreed: “I always say comparison’s a thief of joy. It really is you compare yourself and you’re like ‘Damn this guy’s doing this how come I’m not doing it’ then you easily forget everything that you actually are doing well.”

Of course both players agreed that the pathway for young soccer players in Canada has been steadily improving over the years particularly with the advent of the Canadian Premier League.

“I think the system that’s in place right now with the CPL is great” Wilson said. “I think it’s a long time coming we’ve always had so many creative talented players and it’s just been a big disservice that if you didn’t go to a good school and then go to the draft possibly play in MLS then you’d have to go abroad. I think it’s perfect now that you have players aspiring to play in a league that is homegrown and you can still be at home don’t have to learn another language not be in a different time zone.”

Awuah who played for quite a while in the United States and saw how the sport has been growing there feels there’s still plenty of potential in Canada — in fact he thinks the players that come out of this country may even be better.

“I think football-wise I think we’re more intelligent” Awuah said of Canadian players. “Going into college there were a lot of athletes not really soccer players so then we were able to make our way around the college game because we were also athletic but we understood the game a lot better. You see guys like Cyle Larin or Richie (Laryea) then me and Tajon (Buchanan) a lot of us came through the system — like look at Kyle Bekker he’s not the most athletic player but he was so much smarter than everyone in college soccer… We were able to use our soccer IQ a lot better than the Americans.”

Both players each enjoying excellent seasons with their respective clubs have plenty of wisdom and insight to offer the Canadian soccer community. They have but two of the hundreds of stories that make up the Canadian Premier League but there’s certainly something to be learned from every player’s experiences.",,,,,,

If Betamax tapes were not followed by VHS and then DVD and digital the loss of that pioneering medium might have seemed tragic but it wasn’t. Betamax had its flaws but in the 1980’s it was all we knew. One day so-called “third-party cookies” — the root instrument for behaviorally targeted digital advertising — may seem equally quaint and irrelevant.

Today most programmatic marketers use third-party cookies to build audiences target and retarget ads segment audiences and provide ad personalization as well as attribute conversion events to ad exposure. Google has announced that by 2023 third-party cookies will not be used within its Chrome browser following Apple’s work over the past few years to phase out third-party cookies from the Safari browser. There are a number of reasons for these changes but the most obvious is that cookie-based ad-targeting is out of step with digital privacy expectations in 2021. Meanwhile cookies aside Google and Facebook know virtually everything about all of its users and they advertise to them with near impunity and a massive competitive edge.

What happens next will be both important and fascinating. Of course Google has an incentive to use its virtually monopolistic power to control the new paradigm and it is leading that charge through its Google Privacy Sandbox initiatives and programs.

OAKLAND Calif. (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google generated $11.2 billion in revenue from its mobile app store in 2019 according to a court filing unsealed on Saturday offering a clear view into the service's financial results for the first time.

Attorneys general for Utah and 36 other U.S. states or districts suing Google over alleged antitrust violations with the app store also said in the newly unredacted filing that the business in 2019 had $8.5 billion in gross profit and $7 billion in operating income for an operating margin of over 62%.

The figures include sales of apps in-app purchase and app store ads. Google told Reuters the data ""are being used to mischaracterize our business in a meritless lawsuit.""

The company and its accusers said in a separate filing on Saturday a trial in late 2022 is possible over whether Google abuses its alleged monopoly in app sales for Android devices.

In its quarterly financial disclosures Google groups Play app revenue with that of other services and accounts for the store's ad revenue as part of another broader category.

Attorneys general as well as mobile app developer Epic Games and others separately suing Google have contended that it generates huge profits through the Play Store by taking 30% of the fee for every digital good sold inside an app. The plaintiffs say Google's cut is arbitrarily high siphoning app developers' profits.

Google argues that alternatives exist to Google's store and payment systems though critics say those routes are unfeasible and were sometimes blocked.

Plaintiffs allege Google through anticompetitive deals extended benefits to and imposed restrictions on major developers such as ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games to keep them from leaving the Play Store.

A filing by Epic Games unsealed this month said Google according to internal documents feared losing $1.1 billion in annual app store profit if the Play Store was successfully bypassed.

Almost every major carmaker was introducing Level 2 and 3 autonomous driving features that are almost ready for full Level 4 and 5 self-driving.As a refresher there are five levels on the road to fully autonomous driving so let me give you some examples.Pretty much all premium cars homologated to be sold as new on Western markets now come with Level 1 autonomous driving which is not exactly fully autonomous at all. For example if you own a car that beeps at you if it encounters an obstacle in front of it going as far as slowing down on its own or even stopping by itself then your ride is at Level 1.Level 2 is just a bit more techy since cars belonging to this group come with driving assistance systems than can also take over steering not just the accelerator or brake. If you own a vehicle that has stuff like Active Lane-Keeping Assist or Traffic Jam Assistant which allows the car to automatically brake accelerate and switch lanes without driver input then it’s a Level 2.Level 3 is the (long and treacherous) bridge to fully autonomous driving since it includes systems that can take full control of the car over long distances giving the driver freedom to take his eyes from the road for most of a highway trip for example.It’s treacherous because this is where carmakers like Tesla  and its infamous lidar-free ‘Autopilot’ system is and for various reasons not every driver understands that it’s not exactly an autopilot system.

Or a car that gets 4 stars out of 5 at Euro NCAP but has all the assistance systems to make it to 5 stars if you pay enough money to unlock them.Level 4 is where companies like Waymo or Uber are at least in theory. Considered to be fully automated when it comes to driving Level 4 cars can handle most driving situations on their own but they still have a steering wheel and pedals available for the driver who should remain fit to drive and take over the controls whenever the situation requires it such the sudden appearance of a ‘road under construction’ zone a highway pileup or a bunch of zoo-escaped animals on the road.You’ve guessed it Level 5 is where we are no longer talking about cars but about ‘horizontal elevators’ appliances on wheels that take you from point A to point B. Eventually when these ‘pods’ arrive they will have no steering wheel or pedals and will make all drivers obsolete.I’m not going to say that the technology or regulations aren’t there yet because in some parts of the world they are but there is a problem.Google’s Waymo recently announced that it has ended a two-year effort to sell its in-house developed light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors to other companies.""We're winding down our commercial lidar business as we maintain our focus on developing and deploying our Waymo Driver across our Waymo One (ride-hailing) and Waymo Via (delivery) units"" a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement.As another refresher Waymo is part of Alphabet Inc which also owns Google and has been working on self-driving cars since 2009 back when it was called the ‘Google Self-Driving Car Project.’A lot of things have happened in those 12 years including the launch of several public road testing of robo-taxis and even autonomous freight trucks all powered by proprietary technology that even got ‘borrowed’ by Uber and evolved into a lawsuit at one point.In an effort to finally make a buck for its continuous efforts Waymo had started to sell its lidar systems and similar technology to customers in areas like robotics and even farming from bac in 2019.They tried to sell it to everyone except their rivals but after 12 years of existence Waymo is still billions away from making a profit and has just stopped its largest revenue-making strategy.According to some unknown sources that are close to the matter Waymo is planning both in-house developed tech AND external suppliers for its future generation of lidars which kind of contradicts everything they tried to do until now.The main question is is there not a market for autonomous taxis and freight trucks yet? Because to me the answers seems ‘no.’ Hundreds of millions of people would be put out of their jobs if Level 5 autonomous driving is magically overnight is that not a probable reality that had should have been previously discussed by every company working on self-driving technology?Like every company they’re main raison d'être is to make a profit otherwise they’re just a non-profit foundation which they clearly aren’t. So if Waymo arguably one of the top two companies that has reached the highest levels on the road to fully autonomous driving is failing to make a dime after 12 years of being at the forefront of this technology what are the chances of it to reach mass market in the years it was supposed at least according to press releases from the 2010-2020 decade?"

Eventually when these ‘pods’ arrive they will have no steering wheel or pedals and will make all drivers obsolete.I’m not going to say that the technology or regulations aren’t there yet because in some parts of the world they are but there is a problem.Google’s Waymo recently announced that it has ended a two-year effort to sell its in-house developed light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors to other companies.""We're winding down our commercial lidar business as we maintain our focus on developing and deploying our Waymo Driver across our Waymo One (ride-hailing) and Waymo Via (delivery) units"" a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement.As another refresher Waymo is part of Alphabet Inc which also owns Google and has been working on self-driving cars since 2009 back when it was called the ‘Google Self-Driving Car Project.’A lot of things have happened in those 12 years including the launch of several public road testing of robo-taxis and even autonomous freight trucks all powered by proprietary technology that even got ‘borrowed’ by Uber and evolved into a lawsuit at one point.In an effort to finally make a buck for its continuous efforts Waymo had started to sell its lidar systems and similar technology to customers in areas like robotics and even farming from bac in 2019.They tried to sell it to everyone except their rivals but after 12 years of existence Waymo is still billions away from making a profit and has just stopped its largest revenue-making strategy.According to some unknown sources that are close to the matter Waymo is planning both in-house developed tech AND external suppliers for its future generation of lidars which kind of contradicts everything they tried to do until now.The main question is is there not a market for autonomous taxis and freight trucks yet? Because to me the answers seems ‘no.’ Hundreds of millions of people would be put out of their jobs if Level 5 autonomous driving is magically overnight is that not a probable reality that had should have been previously discussed by every company working on self-driving technology?Like every company they’re main raison d'être is to make a profit otherwise they’re just a non-profit foundation which they clearly aren’t. So if Waymo arguably one of the top two companies that has reached the highest levels on the road to fully autonomous driving is failing to make a dime after 12 years of being at the forefront of this technology what are the chances of it to reach mass market in the years it was supposed at least according to press releases from the 2010-2020 decade?"
MO,Altria,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzI4LzUtaGlnaC15aWVsZC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtZG91YmxlLW1vbmV5LWJ5LTIwMjkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Can Double Your Money by 2029,"These income stocks with yields ranging from 4.4% to 10.3% are investors' tickets to riches.

There are a lot of ways to make money on Wall Street. But if there's one common theme among the best-performing portfolios it's that they're often reliant on dividend stocks.

In 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management released a report that demonstrated just how dominant dividend stocks are relative to public companies that don't pay a dividend. Between 1972 and 2012 companies that initiated and grew their payouts averaged an annual gain of 9.5%. By comparison non-dividend-paying stocks only managed a meager annualized return of 1.6% over the same time frame.

These results shouldn't be a surprise. Since most dividend stocks are profitable and have time-tested operating models they're the ideal place for long-term investors and income seekers to park their money.

The quandary for income seekers is that they want the most income possible with the least amount of risk. However risk and yield tend to be correlated once you get into the high-yield category (above 4%).

But that's not the case with the following five high-yield stocks. These time-tested companies should continue to deliver for investors via share-price appreciation and yield. I believe they can double your initial investment by 2029 (or sooner).

Annaly Capital Management: 10.3% yield

For income seekers who'd prefer the dividend to do most of the heavy lifting mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management (NLY 0.35%) is a good bet to double your money by or before 2029. If you were to reinvest your payouts at this 10.3% yield Annaly's dividend alone would double your initial investment in seven years.

Mortgage REITs like Annaly aim to borrow money at lower short-term rates to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS) with higher long-term yields. The goal here is to maximize the difference between the average long-term MBS yield and the average borrowing rate which is known as net interest margin. Typically as the yield curve steepens during an economic recovery net interest margins widen. Thus as the U.S. economy finds its footing Annaly's core operations and profit potential should improve.

Annaly is also aided by its ability to prudently lean on leverage to pump up its earning potential. Since the bulk of its assets are agency securities -- i.e. those protected from default by the federal government -- Annaly can borrow money to a greater degree in order to increase its profits and fund its juicy dividend.

As one final note over the past two decades Annaly has averaged around a 10% dividend yield and it's paid out over $20 billion in dividends since its inception nearly a quarter-century ago.

AbbVie: 4.4% yield

On the other end of the high-yield dividend spectrum at least on this list is pharmaceutical stock AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%). Considering its 4.4% yield its modest growth potential and its insane value proposition AbbVie has all the tools needed to double investors' money by 2029 if not sooner.

There's no question that anti-inflammatory drug Humira is going to play a big role in AbbVie's long-term success. Prior to the mammoth sales associated with coronavirus vaccines Humira was the top-selling drug in the world. It has 10 approved indications in the U.S. 14 internationally and is pacing nearly $20 billion in annual sales for 2021 based on the $9.94 billion registered through the first six months of the year. Even with the potential for biosimilar competition in the U.S. in the coming years Humira's multiple approved indications and generally strong pricing power provide a runway for AbbVie to generate significant cash flow from its top drug.

Beyond Humira AbbVie has turned to acquisitions to diversify its revenue stream and further shore up its cash flow. In May 2020 it completed a cash-and-stock deal to buy Allergan. Aside from being immediately accretive to earnings the deal provides added cash flow for research and development and gives AbbVie another blockbuster presence with Botox which has cosmetic and therapeutic applications.

At less than nine times forward earnings AbbVie looks every part a steal for value investors and income seekers.

Altria Group: 7.1% yield

I'll be the first to admit that tobacco stocks aren't the sexy growth story they once were. But when push comes to shove few industries have more consistently delivered for investors over the long run. By 2029 Altria Group (MO 0.26%) the company behind the premium Marlboro cigarette brand in the U.S. is a good bet to double investors' money.

To state the obvious tobacco volume metrics have been headed in the wrong direction for decades. As people have become better educated about the negative health effects of tobacco use fewer adults have chosen to light up. Interestingly though this hasn't hurt Altria as much as you'd think. The company has exceptionally strong pricing power thanks in part to the addictive nature of nicotine and has been able to raise prices to offset cigarette-volume declines.

What's more Altria is aggressively investing in its future. It's been introducing the IQOS heated tobacco system (licensed in the U.S. from Philip Morris International) to a number of new U.S. markets and holds a 45% equity stake in Canadian marijuana stock Cronos Group. Expect Altria to work hand in hand with Cronos to develop vape products and establish a marketing strategy.

Since Altria offers investors a dividend yield of 7.1% only modest share-price appreciation would be needed for Altria to double your money by or before 2029.

IBM: 4.7% yield

For the past decade IBM (IBM 0.37%) has had about the same amount of appeal as watching paint dry. The tech stalwart waited too long to shift its focus to cloud computing. As a result it's seen sales for its legacy operations go in reverse. But following a decade of transformation a new IBM is blossoming that can once again deliver for its shareholders.

When the June quarter came to a close IBM reported $7 billion in cloud revenue which was up 13% from the prior-year period. More importantly cloud sales made up 37% of total revenue. Since cloud margins are considerably higher than the margins associated with IBM's legacy operations they're the key to growing the company's operating cash flow. As a reminder IBM loves to use its cash flow to pay its juicy 4.7% dividend buy back its stock and make bolt-on acquisitions (mostly in the cloud space).

It's also worth pointing out that IBM chose to focus on hybrid-cloud solutions -- those that combine public and private clouds -- allowing for data to be shared between the two platforms. The hybrid cloud is perfect for big-data projects which is something IBM has always excelled at. It's also ideal for a hybrid-working world with remote workforces a common theme since the pandemic began.

IBM is unlikely to return to its former glory. However a doubling of your initial investment by 2029 vis-à-vis dividend reinvestment and share-price appreciation seems very doable.

Enterprise Products Partners: 8.3% yield

A final high-yield dividend stock that can use its superior payout and share-price appreciation to double your money by 2029 or sooner is master-limited-partnership Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.51%).

After last year I can imagine the idea of owning oil stocks is a low priority for some investors. That's because an historic drawdown in crude oil demand ravaged the operating performance and balance sheets of most drillers.

However Enterprise Products Partners was hardly fazed because it's a midstream operator. In other words it controls more than 50000 miles of pipeline and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage space in addition to more than a dozen processing facilities.

The company's take-or-pay contracts are set up in such a way that a majority of its revenue and cash flow is highly transparent. This allows the company to outlay capital for infrastructure projects without having to worry about weighing down its profit potential or adversely impacting its lucrative dividend which stood at 8.3% as of this past weekend.

Something else noteworthy about Enterprise Products Partners is its dividend. The company has raised its base annual payout for 22 consecutive years and its distribution coverage ratio didn't drop below 1.6 during the pandemic (anything below 1 would signify an unsustainable payout). With incredible cash flow clarity and a willingness to spend on new infrastructure projects Enterprise Products Partners is a good bet to double investors' money by 2029.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The umbrella group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil or APIB put together the protests as part of the weeklong “Struggle for Life” protest in the capital Brasília in anticipation of a decision from the Supreme Court that could invalidate Indigenous land claims.

“Our struggle takes as its target all governments that are complicit in Bolsonaro’s campaign of genocide all corporations that seek to profit from it” APIB said in a joint statement with Progressive International a left-wing coalition that sent a delegation to survey the situation. “The fight against Bolsonaro extends far beyond the borders of Brazil.”

“We are the ones suffering. The government doesn’t suffer. So that’s why we’re here to fight.”

APIB expected the Supreme Court would strike down a challenge to Indigenous land claims during its protest but the court postponed the judgment to next week after one vote was cast in favor of Indigenous rights. One right-wing lawmaker whose fortune comes from agriculture said he and his colleagues lobbied the justices to further delay the ruling so that Congress has time to pass measures that would strip Indigenous land rights through legislation instead of the courts.

Since 2019 Bolsonaro has used his executive authority to aggressively attack Indigenous rights slash environmental protections and cripple relevant law enforcement efforts — moves that have drawn international condemnation. Closely aligned with the powerful agribusiness lobby the government has also pushed forward a slew of consequential bills in Congress that if passed would be a death sentence for many of Brazil’s Indigenous communities and critics warn the entire Amazon rainforest.

“We are the ones suffering. The government doesn’t suffer” said Pasyma Panará president of the Iakiô Association in the Xingu region of the Amazon. “So that’s why we’re here to fight.”

The delegation from Progressive International included a member of the Spanish parliament Indigenous leaders labor activists and two U.S. congressional staffers who were participating in a personal capacity. The group traveled to Brasília and the Amazonian cities of Belém and Santarém for a week of meetings with Brazilian politicians and environmentalists and groups representing Indigenous communities labor and landless peasants.

“This delegation aims to bring the eyes of the world to Brazil” David Adler general coordinator of Progressive International told The Intercept. “We are here to develop a common strategy to confront the crises that are facing Brazil.”

Struggle for Life

More than 6000 representatives of 176 Indigenous groups pitched tents and lashed together bamboo shelters for seven days of protest and cultural exchange. The encampment sat on a dusty patch of land in the capital less than a mile up the main promenade from Congress the Supreme Court and the presidential palace.

To participate delegates from the most far-flung corners of Brazil’s massive expanses spent as many as three days on packed buses that navigated washed-out dirt roads traveling under the threat of ambushes from paramilitary gangs.

Before rousing speeches by movement leaders and allies could begin on the main stage groups of Xikrin Munduruku Xukuru and others dressed in full ceremonial regalia and performed traditional dances and songs for the crowd. Tech-savvy Indigenous influencers and journalists livestreamed the proceedings on social media engulfed in plumes of red dust.

“We know what evil is. Evil is the agribusiness invading our territories.”

“We know what evil is” said one speaker to applause. “Evil is the agribusiness invading our territories.”

Brazil’s Indigenous people have no shortage of reasons to protest. Their ancestral lands are increasingly threatened by major agricultural infrastructure projects and violent land thieves aided by government agencies. Violent attacks are on the rise and environmental degradation is making traditional ways of life less tenable.

Meanwhile Congress has been voting on one bill after another that would undo the hard-fought protections written into the 1988 constitution. Under Bolsonaro everything has gone from bad to worse.

For weeks organizers have been primarily focused on the Supreme Court decision that could substantially reduce constitutionally protected Indigenous territories. “It is one of the most important judgments in history” said APIB leader Sônia Guajajara in a livestreamed event last Thursday. “The struggle of Indigenous peoples is a struggle for the future of humanity.”

The measure known as the “Milestone Thesis” or “Marco Temporal” in Portuguese would invalidate the land claims of Indigenous groups that did not physically occupy the territory on the day the new constitution was signed in 1988 ignoring centuries of genocidal oppression that forced many tribes to flee their ancestral homes.

Indigenous land rights are enshrined in Brazil’s Constitution but the government has moved at a snail’s pace over the last three decades to process claims. Meanwhile Brazil’s agribusiness mining and lumber industries with their international backers have their eyes on many of the vast tracts of land mostly located in the Amazon that are claimed by natives. The business interests have been chipping away at the protections by any means necessary in the courts in Congress and on the ground.

Illegal invasions into Indigenous lands by violent heavily armed groups have been on the rise in recent years. Criminal groups have been emboldened by Bolsonaro who campaigned on the promise that if elected president “there won’t be a centimeter demarcated for Indigenous reserves” and has made racist genocidal comments about Indigenous peoples throughout his career.

“The Marco Temporal represents for us Indigenous peoples a declaration of extermination” said Eloy Terena a lawyer and Indigenous rights activist during an event last Thursday. Terena pointed out that many of Brazil’s 114 uncontacted tribes which rely on government protection live in territories that could be threatened if the Marco Temporal legal thesis is upheld.

Fight for Representation

The only way to put the brakes on the tractors that are plowing through the Amazon Rep. Joênia Wapichana told The Intercept is a “political renewal.” Indigenous people and their allies must “attain the majority within Congress” she said something that has never happened. “Maybe that way they might think twice before putting forward a proposal to reduce Indigenous rights.”

Wapichana 47 is Brazil’s first female Indigenous lawyer and member of Congress. She is currently the country’s sole Indigenous representative. At the “Struggle for Life” protest she got the rockstar treatment: Wherever she went adoring fans lined up to snag selfies.

In a meeting with a dozen leaders from some of Brazil’s hardest-hit Indigenous communities a Progressive International delegate asked which politicians they considered solid allies. The group hesitated to respond whispering among themselves until one of them spoke up: “Rep. Joênia has fought alongside us a lot” one Indigenous leader said going on to name a handful of nongovernmental organizations. None of them were from Wapichana’s state of Roraima. Any other names? This time the answer was quick: “No not that I remember.”

“Agribusiness not only buys advertising it also buys the editorial line and influences news coverage.”

The Mixed Parliamentary Front in Defense of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples launched in 2019 by Wapichana is comprised of 237 of Brazil’s 594 members of Congress. But during the first four days of the protest only two federal elected representatives stepped foot on the protest’s main stage and only a handful visited the encampment. No major presidential hopefuls or prominent government officials attended.

In a change from recent Indigenous protests — which ended in violent repression — police kept their distance. Coverage from major national news outlets has also been hard to come by. On Wednesday APIB’s executive coordinator Dinamam Tuxá lamented to The Intercept that none of the three main newspapers in Brazil — which rely on agribusiness advertising — had yet run a cover story on the historic protest. “Agribusiness not only buys advertising” he said “it also buys the editorial line and influences news coverage.”

International Solidarity

Even if the Marco Temporal is defeated in the Supreme Court dozens of other proposals and government actions threaten Indigenous lands and serve to push the Amazon rainforest closer to a deforestation “tipping point.” The result would be an irrevocable collapse of the ecosystem.

Leading scientists believe that the tipping point will come at 20 to 25 percent deforestation causing the lush Amazon to dry up and turn into a savanna provoking catastrophic carbon emissions and severe droughts throughout the continent. Eighteen percent of the Amazon has already been cut down and the rate of destruction has only increased under Bolsonaro.

“Our lives are at risk and we are asking for help” Auricélia Arapium a native leader from the Tapajós region told the Progressive International delegation during a meeting at the encampment on Monday. “We no longer have anyone to turn to in Brazil. That’s why we have approached international organizations so that our rights which are being threatened are preserved.”

In a press conference later that day Progressive International announced that it plans to work with partners around the globe to launch a boycott of foreign companies responsible for the destruction of the Amazon and the trampling of Indigenous rights. The investment giant Blackstone and the private agricultural conglomerate Cargill are at the top of their list.

“We need to look at the corporations that are fueling this and the U.S. and international foreign policy that’s enabling these corporations” said Nick Estes a professor at the University of New Mexico a Progressive International delegate and a citizen of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.

“The practices of these corporations like Cargill are fundamentally racist” said Estes who has contributed to The Intercept. “If more people understood how much Indigenous blood how much Black blood how much blood from Brazilians living on the land is spilt just for them to have a cheeseburger I think there would be much more outrage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvY2FyLWJ1eWluZy1hbWF6b24tY3VzdG9tZXJzLXJlYWR5L3N0b3J5P2lkPTc5NjM3MDU30gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvY2FyLWJ1eWluZy1hbWF6b24tY3VzdG9tZXJzLXJlYWR5L3N0b3J5P2lkPTc5NjM3MDU3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car buying goes the way of Amazon: 'Customers are ready',"Car buying goes the way of Amazon: 'Customers are ready'

Imagine buying a new car at your home computer in 19 minutes. That's what MINI the funky British marque says is now possible.

The brand recently introduced MINI Anywhere a pilot program in California where MINI enthusiasts can choose their vehicle apply for financing and sign all necessary paperwork in under 30 minutes. The majority of credit applications are approved instantly according to MINI executive Patrick McKenna.

MINI Anywhere is headed next to Florida and Texas and a nationwide rollout to MINI's 115 dealers is planned by year-end.

""This definitely is the future"" McKenna who oversees MINI's marketing and product teams told ABC News. ""We're making dealers digitally savvy in the marketplace.""

The program was designed to make the car buying process easy: Shoppers can see what the car looks like in their driveway or parking garage via augmented reality. Virtual test-drives and walk-arounds are possible too said McKenna who helped spearhead the program last July.

Plus buying a car with a few clicks of a button is not too different from shopping for groceries on Amazon McKenna noted.

""The younger generation is fine doing a transaction online without driving a car"" he said.

Karl Brauer executive analyst at iSeeCars.com said many consumers would be happy to eliminate the dealership experience -- the haggling the long hours -- entirely. The pandemic forced shoppers to be independent and choose vehicles without sales assistance a scenario that has been largely positive and beneficial he said.

""We have a new awareness of how much easier it can be to buy a car online with minimal to no physical requirement to visit a dealership"" he told ABC News. ""Digital options existed for years. Automakers were ready. The pandemic pushed it along.""

There are drawbacks of course. Higher prices. Zero negotiating. The inability to see or touch the new vehicle in person. Even impulsive decisions.

""You could end up with buyer's remorse"" Brauer explained. ""Car purchases can be highly emotional and it's not wise to make a big financial decision based on emotion.""

McKenna acknowledged MINI Anywhere may not be the cheapest way to buy a car. The program could also potentially impact MINI's sales associates or ""motoring advisers"" in MINI speak. But dealers can ""reinvent"" the delivery he said.

""They have a chance to build [a customer] relationship by making it a personal exciting delivery -- a 'wow' experience"" he explained.

Carvana an online dealer for used cars has sold more than 750000 vehicles since its launch in January 2013. Last quarter it moved 107815 retail units an increase of 96% year-over-year. Second-quarter revenue topped $3.3 billion a rise of 198% YoY.

""For most customers buying a car online is simpler and a better experience"" Ernie Garcia CEO of Carvana told ABC News. ""The biggest hurdle for online is establishing trust.""

Carvana gives customers seven days to return a vehicle if they're not completely satisfied. The return rate is the mid- to high-single digits and more than half of returns are swapped for another vehicle Garcia noted.

""We found undoubtedly that customers are ready and willing to buy cars this way"" he said. ""That's what's driven our growth year after year. COVID accelerated people's willingness to try new experiences.""

And the test-drive that's missing when buying a vehicle online? Not a huge factor in the buying decision according to Garcia.

""Consumers don't even know what they are trying to learn in a test-drive"" he said. ""People don't have a great sense of how cars feel differently. Consumers are looking for a deal a good price and a seamless experience.""

Lincoln like MINI has been vocal about sending consumers online to buy its SUVs. Not every automaker though is ready for the digital shift. Genesis the 6-year-old Korean luxury brand from Hyundai has been ramping up its dealership presence in the U.S. building new ""permanent residences"" in various U.S. cities and markets to boost sales.

""Many people still want to go into a dealership and compare vehicles and test-drive them and shop at their convenience"" Tedros Mengiste executive director of sales operations at Genesis North America told ABC News. ""You can't buy a [Genesis] car online yet but can send exact specifications to a dealer.""

Mark Takahashi senior reviews editor at Edmunds has not heard of any online car buying horror stories. Going to a dealership can be ""an ordeal"" he argued adding ""There really aren't any disadvantages to buying online.""

""Dealers are trying to do better ... but it's still unknown if the dealer model will survive"" he told ABC News. ""I don't think shoppers are going back to dealerships 100%.""

Brands that tout their personalized service and intricate customizations can also move the entire process online Takahashi said.

""This model can apply to every automaker"" he said. ""Online shopping is getting more ubiquitous and consumers are trusting it a lot more for larger purchases. But there will always be holdouts who want to see the car and samples in person.""

MINI of San Diego formally launched the MINI Anywhere program on Monday after a ""dress rehearsal"" and is busy notifying current clients about the online tool. So far one customer has purchased a MINI online with the help of Lisa Mitchell the dealership's finance director.

""We did it together [on Zoom] and it took about 45 minutes"" she told ABC News. ""We're letting guests be more empowered now -- they get to do it their way. I am excited.""

Whether it's via a computer screen or in person Brauer applauds the moves automakers are implementing to improve the shopping experience.

""Buying a car should be one of the most enjoyable things you do"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9hbWF6b24tZmlyZS10di00MTUyODg30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Fire Stick: What You Need to Know,"Amazon's Fire TV aka Fire Stick is a series of devices from Amazon that physically connect to your television and uses your home network to stream digital audio and video from media providers such as HBO and Netflix directly to you.

Setting Up and Using Fire TV Devices

Sure clicking ""Add to Cart"" within 30 seconds of the collection's drop felt impulsive but Blake ensured customers had a full preview of pieces before the collection's launch detailing fit and sizing. The strategy helped me plan ahead; I had decided which pieces fit personal style and complement my current closet weeks before the collection went live.









I have to say it was a unique shopping experience. After some Googling I had a hunch that Blake's collection would launch at 12PM noon EST. Why? To ensure West Coast customers could shop at a reasonable hour (9AM). Turns out I was right.





At 11:59AM I refreshed Blake's page hit ""Add to Cart"" and checked out within seconds.





Due to the overwhelming demand for Blake's SS21 Collection Amazon the Drop acquired more fabric and did another drop re-releasing the most popular items. After seeing so many people ROCK the strappy midi dress  I took a shot at the second drop...and scored!

Today cloud computing and more specifically infrastructure as a service is a staple of how businesses use computing but at that moment it wasn’t a well known or widely understood concept.

The EC in EC2 stands for Elastic Compute and that name was chosen deliberately. The idea was to provide as much compute power as you needed to do a job then shut it down when you no longer needed it — making it flexible like an elastic band. The launch of EC2 in beta was preceded by the beta release of S3 storage six months earlier and both services marked the starting point in AWS’ cloud infrastructure journey.

You really can’t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish with these moves. It was able to anticipate an entirely different way of computing and create a market and a substantial side business in the process. It took vision to recognize what was coming and the courage to forge ahead and invest the resources necessary to make it happen something that every business could learn from.

The AWS origin story is complex but it was about bringing the IT power of the Amazon business to others. Amazon at the time was not the business it is today but it was still rather substantial and still had to deal with massive fluctuations in traffic such as Black Friday when its website would be flooded with traffic for a short but sustained period of time. While the goal of an e-commerce site and indeed every business is attracting as many customers as possible keeping the site up under such stress takes some doing and Amazon was learning how to do that well.

Those lessons and a desire to bring the company’s internal development processes under control would eventually lead to what we know today as Amazon Web Services and that side business would help fuel a whole generation of startups. We spoke to Dave Brown who is VP of EC2 today and who helped build the first versions of the tech to find out how this technological shift went down.

Sometimes you get a great notion

The genesis of the idea behind AWS started in the 2000 timeframe when the company began looking at creating a set of services to simplify how they produced software internally. Eventually they developed a set of foundational services — compute storage and database — that every developer could tap into.

But the idea of selling that set of services really began to take shape at an executive offsite at Jeff Bezos’ house in 2003. A 2016 TechCrunch article on the origins AWS described how that started to come together:

As the team worked Jassy recalled they realized they had also become quite good at running infrastructure services like compute storage and database (due to those previously articulated internal requirements). What’s more they had become highly skilled at running reliable scalable cost-effective data centers out of need. As a low-margin business like Amazon they had to be as lean and efficient as possible.

They realized that those skills and abilities could translate into a side business that would eventually become AWS. It would take a while to put these initial ideas into action but by December 2004 they had opened an engineering office in South Africa to begin building what would become EC2. As Brown explains it the company was looking to expand outside of Seattle at the time and Chris Pinkham who was director in those days hailed from South Africa and wanted to return home.

Brown was hired right around this time and went to work with Pinkham and a team of 14 people in a small office in Cape Town working on what was known at the time as the “Amazon Execution Engine.” Brown says that Amazon executives saw this as a potentially decent business but nothing at the scale they are seeing today as they approach a $60 billion yearly run rate.

“When I joined I think there were like 14 of us in the Cape Town office working on EC2 bringing in some of the very early preview customers at the time and telling us what they wanted. [ … ] We often had leaders come to the office and talk about how AWS could be a billion dollar business one day and that just seemed so far away for us to ever get to that. It just seemed crazy” he said.

Getting down to business

Brown says when it came to building a workable solution they just rolled up their sleeves and got down to it. As they do today they spoke to customers and tried to give them what they need while iterating on their design as they went. It would take 21 months from the time the office opened to the time they launched the beta and it had to be an enormous engineering challenge to take the technology that was available in that time period and turn it into flexible compute resources that were available with a credit card.

One way they did that was emulating what a rack could look like in the data center they were building in Virginia to house this project. This was long before any racks had been ordered or built so they had to fake it. “In fact in the early days of building EC2 we were iterating so quickly on various prototypes that we ended up mocking a data center rack with a stack of laptops in the corner of the Cape Town office” he said.

While VMware had built its first hypervisor a couple of years earlier the EC2 team decided to go with an open source product the Xen hypervisor that they found that was more flexible for their purposes even though there were many challenges trying to make the virtualization work in an efficient way at the time. They would eventually move on from Xen a few years later but it enabled them to get the product off the ground.

“We actually chose Xen as our hypervisor and just used that as the underlying technology. There were a number of challenges with virtualization. Many people loved what it could do but from a performance point of view there were challenges with getting the same performance that you would get out of bare metal” he said. Bare metal refers to a single tenant server running one operating system. With cloud computing the idea mostly is having multiple tenants sharing various virtual machines with each one running its own operating system.

Expecting to scale

Over the almost two year period they were building EC2 they overcame a slew of challenges and eventually got a beta product up and running on August 25 2006. While it was a big moment there would be additional problems especially when it came to scaling this idea which was and remains one of the primary value props cloud computing.

“I always talk about this idea of ‘the illusion of infinite capacity’ and what we’re shooting for in the cloud is that anytime a customer comes along and says I need a machine we never say no to them. And that’s incredibly difficult to scale. And so it means that we have to have really good algorithms so they manage our supply chain really well as well” Brown said.

That was the goal but it didn’t always go as planned and they were often putting out fires in the early days. He tells the story of how they almost ran out of capacity early on and had to make use of a bunch of test machines to keep the operation going. “Peter DeSantis who was leading our cloud businesses at the time (and today runs worldwide infrastructure for AWS) ran out of his office and asked everyone on the team to shut down any [test] instances we were using. We managed to find about 70 [available servers] and that was good enough to get us through the next few days when the next group of racks landed” Brown explained.

They would get better and better at managing capacity of course but the early days brought a constant set of problems to deal with and solve. It took two years to reach a million instances which was a major milestone for the group. Just two months later it reached 2 million and a couple of months after that 3 million. Brown says they stopped counting after that and today they deliver 60 million instances every single day.

They got the vision right and the technology matured along the way. Over time formidable competitors like Microsoft and Google eventually entered the fray. Brown considers himself fortunate to have been along for the entire 15 year journey and to be part of a team building technology that had such a huge impact on computing.

Today no startup launching is running their own infrastructure unless their solution has a unique requirement that demands it and the flexibility of cloud infrastructure means these young companies can concentrate on their core competencies to build the business instead of racking and stacking servers and worrying about budgeting for resource capacity. That is a huge advantage and one that wasn’t really possible at scale prior to AWS starting this business.

AWS was first to market and has maintained that first mover advantage all these years. Today the company has around 33% market share according to Synergy Research a percentage that has remained remarkably steady over the years even as the market keeps growing. In the most recent Amazon earnings report AWS generated over $14 billion for the quarter a far cry from the $1 billion the company was envisioning when it launched EC2 fifteen years ago."

AEE,Ameren,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tZXRyby9leHBlcnRzLXRlbGwtYW1lcmVuLXRvLWR1bXAtdGhlLXNjcnViYmVycy1jbG9zZS10aGUtY29hbC1wbGFudC9hcnRpY2xlXzViN2VjNWI3LWI3MGMtNTk3My04Y2QyLWRjZGVkOWQxODY3Yi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts tell Ameren to dump the scrubbers close the coal plant,"Ameren is likely to mothball its second-largest coal-fired power plant rather than install costly pollution controls ordered by federal courts after years of Clean Air Act violations experts and analysts say.

The St. Louis-based power company said in financial filings Wednesday that it is not sure what it will do following the appeals court ruling last week that upheld a judge’s 2019 requirement for the company to put pollution-control technology — often called “scrubbers” — on its Rush Island Energy Center in Jefferson County.

The plant is currently set to retire in 2039. But several experts said this week that they now expect that to happen much sooner as Ameren faces the prospect of adding scrubbers at a cost it estimates at a billion dollars. Moreover critics and analysts alike say it is unlikely state regulators would allow Ameren to recover those costs from ratepayers.

Coal plants across the nation are already struggling to compete economically — leaving Ameren with a set of relatively easy decisions several said.

“It definitely doesn’t make any sense to actually put the scrubbers on” said Ashok Gupta a Kansas City-based energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

To him the solution is obvious.

“It’s time for them to accept the reality that this plant needs to be retired” he added. “Time for them to turn the page.”

Investors shared that stance with an energy-focused analyst at Bank of America saying it is “exceedingly unlikely” that the company’s regulators would allow it to collect returns on such a large investment made at this stage of the 45-year-old coal plant’s life cycle.

“We view an accelerated retirement as the far more likely outcome” the company said in an analyst note.

‘The right opportunity’

Multiple experts said the likelihood of that outcome is further reinforced by Missouri’s recent authorization of a financing technique that would allow utilities to retire coal plants more quickly. The tool called securitization would let power companies sell bonds to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding coal plant debt enabling a fresh wave of investments in cheaper cleaner forms of generation such as renewables.

The policy which was nearly unanimously approved by the Missouri Legislature gives Ameren a relatively clear path to transition away from coal plants like Rush Island experts say — particularly when compared with the alternative of making expensive upgrades. Customers still have about $400 million to pay off at Rush Island. The $1 billion cost of scrubbers if passed on to customers would more than triple that debt.

“Why do all that when you can simply close them down in an economic way that the Missouri Legislature has provided for?” said James Owen the executive director of Renew Missouri a nonprofit based in Columbia that advocates for increased adoption of renewable energy in the state. “I think that makes it easier to shut down these plants sooner.”

Ameren has already committed to renewable energy generation in a plan that aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The appeals court ruling gives Ameren a convenient opportunity to use securitization and accelerate that plan Gupta said.

“This is the right opportunity for them to do the things they say they want to do” he said.

Sioux the only Ameren coal plant equipped with scrubbers installed them at a cost of about $600 million in 2010. And there are relatively few recent examples of U.S. power companies retrofitting coal plants with the technology as it has become hard to economically justify the expenditures.

“You’re seeing less and less of that” said Mike Doyle an analyst focused on utilities for Edward Jones the St. Louis-based investment firm. “Generally there has not been a lot of investment in coal plants.”

‘This is the future’

Should Ameren decide to shutter Rush Island ahead of schedule there’s a widespread assumption that the company would fill the void by turning to renewable energy projects such as solar and wind given their low costs.

“I would bet my bottom dollar that it would be replaced with renewables” said David Woodsmall a Jefferson City-based attorney who represents the Midwest Energy Consumers Group which advocates for large commercial and industrial power customers — from AT&T and Tyson Foods to Walmart. “The current trend in the industry is that renewables have much better economics than building gas coal or nuclear.”

Others though aren’t treating renewable replacements as an inevitability.

Owen for instance is bracing for a public and political debate. He thinks “all options will be on the table” if a major coal plant is shut down and he expects to see “a lot of people pushing for natural gas.”

In 2019 when Ameren was first ordered to outfit Rush Island with scrubbers the company was given a 2024 deadline to comply. The Sierra Club an intervenor in the case that was originally filed at the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that deadline hasn’t changed.

The appeals court has remanded the case back to Judge Rodney Sippel in federal court in St. Louis.

Ameren has said it disagrees with the latest decision. It still could request the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review the case “en banc” or even appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court in both cases buying time for the company and its operations at Rush Island.

For years now there’s been industrywide recognition that Missouri needs to dial back its dominant reliance on coal power — but even now Ameren’s latest long-term plans call for running its two largest coal plants into the late 2030s and 2040s.

It’s not difficult to reframe the new ruling as a cue to embrace the change that is in motion.

“Ameren probably sees this as bad news” said Owen. “I think it’s going to end up being good news for them. They know that this is the future.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The terminal itself hasn’t seen a lot of love but it’s a place where American has focused its European departures – and even domestic flights very much rely on bringing passengers to those Europe flights.

The summer before the pandemic American was sending flights out of remote stands in Philadelphia and building a new Flagship lounge. Now there’s no announced plan to open that lounge and the airline is operation just 850000 departing seats this month – down a third from 1.3 million in August 2019 according to schedule data from Cirium Diio Mi.

Brian Znotins American’s Vice President of Network and Schedule Planning laid out the airline’s vision for Philadelphia – which is many ways is what is was before the pandemic. Even though American will be able to support more transatlantic flying from New York JFK with their JetBlue partnership Philadelphia will remain their primary connecting gateway to Europe.

And with smaller and more fuel efficient Airbus A321XLRs coming into the fleet they’ll be able to serve summer seasonal Europe destinations year-round – and more destinations than they’ve served in Europe as well.

Obviously there hasn’t been a lot of demand transatlantic and we’ve had to reduce capacity there to match demand. Over the course of this winter we’ll start trickling flights back in. But where we’re bullish is for the summer of 2022. We’ve had a number of travelers who have postponed their Rome trip for two years in a row now. So we expect the summer of 2022 to be our best summer ever transatlantic. And Philadelphia will continue to play a primary role in getting those passengers across the ocean. What I’m most excited about for Philadelphia is the A321XLR airplane that’s coming in 2023 for us. That will allow us to fly more year-round destinations out of Philadelphia. For those of you that are familiar with Philadelphia flying we’d do a lot of European flying for 3 months in the summer and then it would go away and we’d fly that widebody somewhere domestically. That widebody domestically wouldn’t actually make money for us. If you add up the whole year the three months in the summer making money in Philadelphia and the other 9 months of the year losing money domestically that airplane lost money for us on a year-round basis. And that’s one of the reasons we took the fleet consolidation that we did. But the A321XLR has a lower departure cost and it has a lower seat cost. So we’ll not only be able to add new flights to Philadelphia that will be profitable and sustainable but we’ll be able to fly our existing markets more on a year-round basis. So you won’t see that buildup capacity in the summer and it disappears in the winter and you’ve got all that variability in our plan. So overall Philadelphia will remain our primary transatlantic gateway. We’ll fly other markets transatlantic as well but Philadelphia is our best connecting gateway geographically and we plan to keep it that way going forward.

It’s interesting to hear this A321XLR vision for Philadelphia since two and a half years ago they were talking up plans for long haul 787 flying there as the future while it seems we’ll be seeing much more A321XLRs in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWV5ZXMtY29kZXNoYXJlLXdpdGgtdG9yb250by1zdGFydHVwLWNvbm5lY3QtYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Eyes Codeshare With Toronto Startup Connect Airlines,"[ News ] By Winston Shek

American Airlines plans to launch a codeshare with a new airline startup Connect Airlines allowing American Airlines to gain access to Connect’s base at Toronto’s city-center airport: Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.

In March 2021 American Airlines and Connect Airlines signed an interline agreement allowing tickets from both carriers to be booked and included on the same itinerary. The airlines now expect to finalize a codeshare agreement before the launch of Connect’s operations in the coming months allowing Connect Airlines passengers to use miles on American Airlines flights via American’s AAdvantage loyalty program.

In a Department of Transportation (DOT) filing Connect Airlines detailed its expectations of the codeshare expecting higher yields and load factors on its routes boosting its revenue forecast for its first year of operations. In order to feed into American Airlines’ network Connect Airlines intends to operate services to Chicago and Philadelphia — two American Airlines hubs in the U.S. — from its base at Toronto’s Billy Bishop Airport.

In a statement to AirlineWeekly John Thomas CEO of Connect Airlines parent company Waltzing Matilda Aviation said “Our view is how do we give people in Toronto more than just a flight to Chicago — or some point in the U.S. — how do we make this a one-stop connection into a massive network.”

Conversely American Airlines could target business travelers looking for a convenient and accessible option to Toronto’s downtown area via Billy Bishop Airport instead of Toronto’s primary international hub Pearson International Airport which is busier though much farther from the city.

In addition to flights to Chicago and Philadelphia Connect Airlines filed its initial route network plans with the DOT in April highlighting plans to fly from its Toronto’s Billy Bishop base to American’s New York John F. Kennedy International Airport hub as well as to airports in Boston and Baltimore. Furthermore the airline will fly intra-U.S. routes carrying passengers from Boston to Baltimore and Philadelphia.

A New Launch

To launch intra-U.S. routes Boston-based Waltzing Matilda Aviation aims to receive its U.S. Air Operating Certificate for Part 121 commercial operations by Sept. 29 ending its proving runs by Sept. 27. Currently the parent company of Connect Airlines holds FAA Part 135 operational authority allowing it to fly private charters but not regularly scheduled commercial operations.

Connect Airlines plans to lease two former FlyBe Bombardier Dash 8 Q-400 aircraft from Chorus Aviation seating 74 passengers the first of which will arrive in mid-September. In addition the airline intends to lease three more Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft by the second half of 2022.

On its flights Connect Airlines will compete with Porter Airlines a Canadian airline that flies similar transborder hops and an expansive intra-Canada network from Billy Bishop Airport using Bombardier Dash 8 Q-400 aircraft. Both airlines could go head-to-head on their Boston flights while serving similar airports in the vicinity of New York Washington D.C. and Chicago. For example Connect Airlines plans to service Chicago O’Hare while Porter Airlines serves Chicago’s Midway Airport.

First announced in April Connect Airlines aims to target the “day-tripping” business traveler with transborder flights from Toronto’s Billy Bishop Airport to Northeast and Midwest U.S. cities complementing the offering of Porter Airlines.

American Airlines Codeshares

If a codeshare agreement is reached American Airlines is continuing its streak of strengthening gaps in its network. Earlier this year the Fort-Worth Texas-based airline boosted its partnerships with Alaska Airlines for its west coast network and JetBlue in the Northeast. In addition the airline revealed a new venture with Chilean low-cost carrier JetSMART to improve its South American codeshare network.

However codeshares between Delta Airlines and WestJet and United Airlines and Air Canada will ultimately provide much broader connectivity throughout Canada than a codeshare between Connect Airlines and American Airlines due to Connect Airlines’ minuscule network and its lack of domestic Canadian operations.

But Charlotte’s dominant carrier American Airlines hasn’t changed its policy yet.

What’s happening: Earlier this month United became the first major airline to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all of its 67000 employees as Axios reported. Those employees risk being terminated if they don’t get the jab by Oct. 25.

And this week Delta announced it’ll impose a $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated employees enrolled in the company’s health care plan.

This makes Delta the first carrier to impose a monetary penalty on employees who choose not to get the vaccine per Bloomberg.

Why it matters: The moves by both these companies aim to increase vaccination rates among their employees.

The pandemic has crushed the travel industry and the Delta variant has further sapped demand for air travel.

It’s therefore in airlines’ best financial interest to help bolster vaccination rates.

More airlines could start adding vaccine mandates following their competitors’ leads as Axios’ Joann Muller reported.

United CEO Scott Kirby told Muller that he’s tired of seeing his employees die. United’s had dozens of employees die from COVID-19 — all of them unvaccinated Kirby said.

“For me the fact that people are 300 times more likely to die if they’re unvaccinated is all I need to know” Kirby told Muller. “It’s about saving lives.”

The local angle: American Airlines operates 90% of the daily flights at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Here the carrier employs about 12000 people spokesperson Andrew Trull said. But the company has not yet made any changes to its employee vaccine policy Trull told Axios.

“We are strongly encouraging our team members to get vaccinated and we are offering an incentive for those who do” he added.

Everyone who gets a shot gets an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through American’s employee recognition platform.

American won’t say how many of its employees are vaccinated.

These recent decisions by airlines to crack down on vaccines are of course financial ones says Peter Schwarz an economist at UNC Charlotte’s Belk College.

“The big financial ramification is the question of the tradeoff between greater passenger comfort — more people flying on Delta — versus the possible loss of employees at a time when they already seem to be short staffed” Schwarz tells Axios.

Airlines could also consider vaccine mandates for passengers ultimately he adds. Unlike other venues that’ve implemented vaccine mandates recently (like outdoor stadiums and concert amphitheaters) airplanes are enclosed spaces designed to fit as many people in as possible.

“You would think (mandates are) something they would need to look at” he says.

Public officials here have urged private companies to implement their own vaccine mandates. Speaking at Pizzeria Mercato a Carrboro pizza joint that requires customers to be vaccinated Gov. Roy Cooper said last week that when businesses and employers require vaccines they’re protecting the community.

“Policies like these will get more shots in arms that in turn will boost our economy and get us more quickly to the end of the pandemic” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvbWlsaXRhcnktdmV0ZXJhbi1nb2VzLWJlcnNlcmstYXQtbWlhbWktYWlycG9ydC1hdHRhY2tzLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWVtcGxveWVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Military Veteran Goes Berserk at Miami Airport Attacks American Airlines Employees,"A military veteran in crisis was detained by officers from the Miami Dade Police Department and later hospitalized after going berserk and attacking American Airlines gate agents at Miami International Airport on Friday night.

Video footage showed the unmasked vet screaming profanities at airline staff after he was denied boarding as passengers and employees looked on. In what appeared to be an attempt to provoke a reaction the man picked up and hurled barriers in a fit of rage.

Onlookers can be heard asking where the police are as the man continues to threaten employees. The Miami Police Department later tweeted that officers immediately responded to the incident after receiving a call for help from airport staff.

“This incident involved a military veteran in crisis” the tweet explained. “Our Airport District officers immediately responded to the call by airport staff and transported him to a local hospital for treatment and evaluation. The MDPD is committed to the safety of all our residents and visitors.”

Before it was revealed that the man was apparently suffering from a mental health crisis Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) tweeted: “This one checks all the boxes. Criminal prosecution now!”

Nelson was responding to the fact that despite the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) being deluged with nearly 4000 reports of unruly passenger behaviour the vast majority escape criminal prosecution. The FAA has slapped unruly passengers with over $1 million in civil penalties since the start of the year but the agency continues to press law enforcement to press criminal charges against more rule-breakers.

A spokesperson for American Airlines later said of the incident: “When traveling with us we expect all customers to follow our policies and we will not tolerate violence of any kind toward our team members.”

But every now and again something that is decidedly vintage catches my eye as was the case with this funny little electric car that appears to be heavily inspired by the original Ford Model T. And fortunately for whatever random factory seems to be hawking this hot mess it tickled my fancy enough to land it a coveted spot as the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week!

This isn’t exactly the first vintage-styled electric car to hand-crank my starter.

I’ve stumbled upon other hidden EV gems such as a distinctly debonair British roadster and a quaint electric horseless carriage fit for Cinderella herself.

But none of those would have one of America’s most celebrated bigots Henry Ford rolling over in his grave more than this awesome little electric Model T knockoff.

It might not have the same giant wagon wheels or leak as much (or any) oil as the original but damn if it doesn’t have charm in spades.

Chugging along at its top speed of 30 km/h (19 mph) it’s only about half as fast as the original. It’s also rocking a third of the original’s motor power with just a modest 5 kW electric motor on its rear axle.

So horsepower for horsepower I’ll chalk that up as a win for the Chinese version here.

It doesn’t quite match the original Model T’s range as the imitation T only packs a 7.2 kWh battery that is sufficient for a claimed 100 km (62 mi) per charge. The good news is that it will do those miles without vibrating and shaking its occupants until the contents of their change purse are lost in the upholstery.

Those batteries are also lead acid instead of lithium-ion which I can only assume is a throwback to the former car’s era. The original Model T debuted just over a century ago and that lead acid battery technology is definitely period correct.

But even though this knockoff doesn’t exactly excite the senses with its power speed or range it makes up for it with class.

Check out that gold-plated (or more likely gold-painted) trim and classy convertible top. And take a gander at those big ol’ headlamps from back when the glass protected an actual oil flame. It even has the old-school folding windshield and a spare tire. You probably wouldn’t even need a jack to change a tire — just grab a fender and lift up one corner of the car.

I also love that slick-looking wooden dashboard and giant steering wheel which comes complete with power steering. This thing actually looks pretty darn well outfitted. I can’t speak to the quality of course. That sheet metal might be thinner than paper for all we know. But it definitely looks the part!

Surely these things are meant for novelty purposes like rental rides in the park or birthday parties. But that’s not how I’d use one.

Imagine the looks you’d get driving this car to the coffee shop — or picking up a few gallons of paint at Home Depot.

Anyone with money can have a fancy Ferrari or a lifted truck. Driving one of these bad boys around town takes a certain amount of spunk and a distinct lack of giving a flying flip what others think.

And as the sales page on Alibaba tells me it also takes $6300 smackeroonies. Fortunately the vendor only requires a minimum order of quantity of one unit.

Booking a $20000 shipping container though that’s going to be the trickier part…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJpZnktYW1lcmljYS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LW9uZS1zdG9wLW1vYmlsZS1zb2x1dGlvbi1hcHBsZS1jYXJwbGF5LWFuZHJvaWQtYXV0by0xNjIzNzE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electrify America Announces New 'One Stop' Mobile Solution for Apple CarPlay Android Auto,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/electrify-america-announces-new-one-stop-mobile-solution-apple-carplay-android-auto-1623714 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJpZnktYW1lcmljYS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LW9uZS1zdG9wLW1vYmlsZS1zb2x1dGlvbi1hcHBsZS1jYXJwbGF5LWFuZHJvaWQtYXV0by0xNjIzNzE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvdXMvc3RhdGUtbGVnaXNsYXR1cmVzLXZvdGluZy1ncmlkbG9jay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Washington Stews State Legislatures Increasingly Shape American Politics (Published 2021),"With the release of the 2020 census last month the drawing of legislative districts that could in large part determine control of Congress for the next decade heads to the nation’s state legislatures the heart of Republican political power.

Increasingly state legislatures especially in 30 Republican-controlled states have seized an outsize role for themselves pressing conservative agendas on voting Covid-19 and the culture wars that are amplifying partisan splits and shaping policy well beyond their own borders.

Indeed for a party out of power in Washington state legislatures have become enormous sources of leverage and influence. That is especially true for rural conservatives who largely control the legislatures in key states like Wisconsin Texas and Georgia and could now lock in a strong Republican tilt in Congress and cement their own power for the next decade. The Texas Legislature’s pending approval of new restrictions on voting is but the latest example.

“This is in many ways genuinely new because of the breadth and scope of what’s happening” said Donald F. Kettl a scholar of state governance at the University of Texas at Austin. “But more fundamentally the real point of the spear of Trumpism is appearing at the state and local level. State legislatures not only are keeping the flame alive but nurturing and growing it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL2F1Zy8yOS9mbG9hdGluZy13aW5kLXR1cmJpbmVzLW9jZWFuLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1wb3dlctIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL2F1Zy8yOS9mbG9hdGluZy13aW5kLXR1cmJpbmVzLW9jZWFuLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1wb3dlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Floating wind turbines could open up vast ocean tracts for renewable power,"In the stormy waters of the North Sea 15 miles off the coast of Aberdeenshire in Scotland five floating offshore wind turbines stretch 574 feet (175 metres) above the water. The world’s first floating windfarm a 30 megawatt facility run by the Norwegian company Equinor has only been in operation since 2017 but has already broken UK records for energy output.

While most offshore wind turbines are anchored to the ocean floor on fixed foundations limiting them to depths of about 165ft floating turbines are tethered to the seabed by mooring lines. These enormous structures are assembled on land and pulled out to sea by boats.

The ability to install turbines in deeper waters where winds tend to be stronger opens up huge amounts of the ocean to generate renewable wind power: close to 80% of potential offshore wind power is found in deeper waters. In addition positioning floating turbines much further off the coast helps avoid conflicts with those who object to their impact on coastal views.

Floating offshore wind is still in its early stages: only about 80 megawatts of a total of about 32 gigawatts (0.25%) of installed offshore wind capacity is floating. But some experts say the relatively new technology could become an important part of the renewables mix if it can overcome hurdles including cost design and opposition from the fishing industry.

The US has traditionally lagged behind Europe when it comes to offshore wind power but that may be changing. Joe Biden has pledged to build more than 30GW of offshore wind by 2030. The Department of Energy says it has invested more than $100m in researching and developing floating offshore wind technology in an attempt to establish itself as a leader in the sector.

While the reliable winds and relatively shallow waters of the US east coast have made it the favored target for offshore wind projects such as the recently approved large-scale Vineyard Wind off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard on the west coast the waters are mostly too deep for fixed-platform turbines. It’s here that advocates hope floating wind will take off.

In May the Biden administration and California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to bring floating offshore wind to California. They have identified two sites: a nearly 400-square mile area north-west of Morro Bay which could host 380 floating wind turbines and another further north off Humboldt Bay. Together these projects could bring up to 4.6GW of clean energy to the grid enough to power 1.6m homes.

“[The announcement] was a real breakthrough” said Adam Stern executive director of the trade association Offshore Wind California. “At a time when the effects of climate change are evident in California every day in the form of wildfires and drought conditions” he said “offshore wind can provide clean reliable electricity for millions of California residents.”

The International Energy Agency estimates that for the world to stay on the pathway to carbon neutrality by 2050 it needs to add 390GW of wind power (80GW of which would be offshore) every year between 2030 and 2050.

It’s a big jump from current numbers especially for the offshore wind industry which installed just over 6GW of new capacity in 2020. But wind power has been growing as costs fall and countries look to move away from fossil fuels to meet climate goals.

How much floating wind will factor in is unclear. Countries including Norway Portugal South Korea and Japan are installing or planning floating wind projects with more than 26GW of capacity estimated to be in the pipeline according to one estimate.

“Without a doubt wind is a big part of the solution for going to zero” said Michael Webber an energy expert and engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. But he believes floating wind is likely to take time to scale up predicting that onshore wind and fixed-bottom offshore wind would dominate for the next decade.

Big hurdles certainly remain. Cost is a significant one. Floating offshore wind generation costs are about double those of fixed offshore wind although these are expected to fall as technology advances and supply chains improve. Estimates by the research body the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) suggest floating turbine projects could achieve cost parity with their fixed-bottom counterparts around 2030.

One wrinkle is the number of designs to anchor the floating turbines which some experts believe will make it harder to drive down costs.

There are three main designs. The spar-buoy – the design of the Hywind floating turbines in Scotland – has a long weighted cylinder tube which extends down from the turbine and below the ocean’s surface to balance it. Semi-submersible platforms which are the most common for installed and planned projects are modular and made up of floating cylindrical structures secured by mooring lines. The tension-leg structure has a smaller platform anchored to the seabed with taut mooring lines.

“I’ve lost count of how many concepts are actually out there” said Po Wen Cheng head of wind energy at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. “Ford didn’t make the car affordable for the big masses by making 30 different types of car – they just made a Model T. If we really want to lower the cost we cannot tolerate so many different concepts” he said.

Parts of the fishing industry have also expressed concerns that offshore wind could interfere with their equipment obstruct fishing areas and negatively affect their livelihoods.

The first floating windfarm in the US may end up in Maine where the University of Maine RWE Renewables and the Mitsubishi subsidiary Diamond Offshore Wind are developing a small demonstration project that would generate 12MW of energy.

It has faced enormous opposition from lobster fishers who say the turbines interfere with their business. They reached a compromise in July: this pilot project will go ahead but the state legislature approved a ban on new industrial wind projects in state waters until March 2031.

Fishermen have rung alarm bells about California’s projects too. “Far too many questions remain unanswered regarding potential impacts to marine life” said Mike Conroy the executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations in a May statement about plans for floating wind in the state.

Walt Musial NREL’s lead of offshore wind research said even a large-scale deployment of offshore wind along the east or west coast would take up only a tiny portion of the ocean and turbines would be carefully sited. But he stressed the continued need for good communication “to ensure optimal coexistence and to help the fishing community adapt and continue to access the space within the turbines for fishing”.

The California government foresees offering commercial leases for Morro Bay and Humboldt Bay next year. Stern is hopeful that floating offshore wind would create thousands of well-paying clean energy jobs in the state as well as accelerating the retirement of natural gas plants reducing pollution in communities that disproportionately bear the burden of environmental impacts.

“There are a lot of challenges to get floating wind turbines running in US waters” said Po Wen Cheng “but there’s no doubt about the potential.”"

In particular data science practices methodologies tools and technologies give organizations the capabilities they need to gain valuable information from ever-increasing amounts of highly variable data.

Big data tooling and artificial intelligence provide the power needed to wrangle and analyze large pools of data for applications as diverse as predictive modeling pattern recognition anomaly detection personalization conversational AI and autonomous systems. Indeed data science and the data scientists who primarily perform it have been elevated from what was once considered a wonky academic side of IT to now be a core part of business operations.

While many different types of organizations are implementing analytics applications driven by data science those applications are mostly focused on areas that have proven their value over the past decade. By digging deeper into them businesses can gain benefits that include competitive advantages over business rivals; better service to customers citizens users and patients; and the ability to respond more effectively to a rapidly changing business environment that demands continuous adaptation.

Let's look more closely at eight common data science applications.

2. Pattern recognition Likewise identifying patterns in data sets is a fundamental data science project. For example pattern recognition helps retailers and e-commerce companies spot trends in customer purchasing behavior. Making product offerings relevant and ensuring the reliability of supply chains is crucial for organizations that want to keep their customers happy -- and stop them from purchasing from competitors instead. Companies such as Amazon and Walmart have long used data science approaches to discover purchasing patterns. In one interesting early example Walmart noticed that many customers making purchases in anticipation of a hurricane or tropical storm also bought strawberry Pop-Tarts. Such correlations often unexpected can help drive more effective purchasing inventory management and marketing strategies. Pattern recognition also has a wide variety of other data science use cases. For example it can aid in stock trading risk management diagnosis of medical conditions seismic analysis and things like natural language processing (NLP) speech recognition and computer vision.

3. Predictive modeling In addition to spotting patterns and outliers data science aims to make predictive modeling more accurate. While predictive analytics has been around for decades data science applies machine learning and other algorithmic approaches to large data sets to improve decision-making capabilities by creating models that better predict customer behavior financial risks market trends and more. Predictive analytics applications are used in a wide range of industries including financial services retail manufacturing healthcare travel and government. For example manufacturers use predictive maintenance systems to help reduce equipment breakdowns and improve production uptime. Airplane makers Boeing and Airbus also depend on predictive maintenance to improve their fleet availability. Similarly Chevron BP and other companies in the energy sector use predictive modeling to improve equipment reliability in settings where maintenance is costly difficult and expensive to perform. In addition organizations are using the predictive power of data science to improve business forecasting. As an example formulaic approaches to purchasing by manufacturers and retailers failed in the face of the sudden changes in consumer and business spending driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. In forward-looking companies though these brittle systems have been replaced with data-driven forecasting applications that are better able to respond to evolving customer behavior.

4. Recommendation engines and personalization systems User and customer satisfaction typically is highest when products and services are tailored to people's needs or interests -- especially if they can get the right product at the right time in the right channel with the right offer communicated using the right message and the right level of service and attention. And keeping customers happy and engaged means they likely will continue to return. However it traditionally has been very difficult to tailor products and services to the specific needs of individuals; doing so was too time-consuming and costly. As such most systems that personalize offerings or recommend items need to group people into buckets that generalize their characteristics. While this approach is better than no customization at all it's still far from optimal. Fortunately the combination of data science machine learning and big data now enables organizations to build a detailed profile of individual customers. Over time their systems can learn people's preferences and match them with others who have similar preferences -- an approach known as hyper-personalization. Companies such as Home Depot Lowe's and Netflix use hyper-personalization techniques driven by data science to better focus their offerings to customers through recommendation engines and personalized marketing. Financial services firms are also making hyper-personalized offers to customers while healthcare organizations are using the approach to provide treatments and care to patients and educational institutions are delivering highly tailored adaptive learning to students.

5. Classification and categorization Data science tools have shown real capabilities to sort through large volumes of data and categorize or classify it based on learned characteristics. This is especially useful with unstructured data. While structured data can be easily searched and queried through a schema unstructured data is much harder to process and analyze. Emails documents images videos audio files text and binary information of all sorts are forms of unstructured data. Until recently mining that data for valuable insights proved to be a challenge. The emergence of deep learning which uses artificial neural networks to analyze large data sets has better enabled organizations to do unstructured data analysis from image object and audio recognition tasks to classification of data based on document type. For example data science teams can train deep learning systems to recognize contracts and invoices among piles of documents and do various types of information identification. Government agencies are also getting into classification and categorization applications powered by data science. Examples include NASA using image recognition to help uncover deeper insights about objects in space and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics automating classification of workplace injuries based on analysis of incident reports.

6. Sentiment and behavioral analysis Building on the data analysis capabilities of machine learning and deep learning systems data scientists are digging through reams of data to understand the sentiments of customers or users and their behavior. Through sentiment analysis and behavioral analysis applications data science enables organizations to more effectively identify buying and usage patterns and know what people think about products and services and how satisfied they are with their experience. These applications can also categorize customer sentiment and behavior and track how they change over time. Travel and hospitality companies have adopted this high-powered approach to sentiment analysis to identify customers who have had highly positive or negative experiences so they can respond quickly. Law enforcement operations are also tapping into sentiment and behavior analysis to spot incidents situations and trends as they emerge and evolve -- for example by analyzing social media posts.

7. Conversational systems One of the earliest applications of machine learning was the development of a chatbot that could have somewhat lifelike conversations without human intervention. In fact the Turing Test devised in 1950 by computing pioneer Alan Turing uses a conversational format to indicate if a system can mimic human intelligence. As such it's no wonder that organizations are looking to chatbots and other conversational systems to help augment existing workflows and take over some tasks previously handled by humans. Data science has been extremely helpful in making conversational systems useful to businesses. Data scientists use machine learning algorithms to train these systems on large amounts of text so they can derive conversational patterns from the data. Combined with advanced NLP technology chatbots intelligent agents and voice assistants are now popping up everywhere from phones and websites to cars to engage in both text- and voice-based interactions with people -- for example to find information help process transactions and provide customer service and support.

8. Autonomous systems Speaking of cars one long-held dream of AI aficionados is the self-driving car. Wouldn't it be great to get in a car or truck and let it do the driving while you do other things without having to pay attention to what's happening on the road? Data science is playing a large role in the ongoing development of autonomous vehicles as well as AI-driven robots and other intelligent machines. As the use of data science tools and techniques continues to expand in the enterprise so too will the types of applications they enable. There are a multitude of challenges in making autonomous systems a reality. In a car for example image recognition tools must be trained to identify all sorts of relevant elements: the roads other cars traffic control devices pedestrians and anything else that can affect a successful driving experience. Furthermore self-driving systems need to know how to make split-second decisions and accurately predict what will happen based on real-time data analysis. Data scientists are producing machine learning models that can act in concert to help make fully autonomous vehicles more feasible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWRpYW1vbmQtcGxhbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Closing the gap: My plan to qualify for Delta Diamond status this year,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

As discussed in previous articles I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member. Most of my flights this year have been on Delta or its SkyTeam partners and various promotions like the 2020 Medallion Qualifying Mile (MQM) rollover Status Accelerator and bonus MQM earning on Delta cobranded credit cards helped me earn Platinum by the beginning of July.

Now with just over four months left in 2021 I am planning to go for top-tier Diamond status. In theory I am close to the status now and can reach the MQM and MQD requirements so long as I plan my future travel accordingly. I think the extra effort is worth it for Choice Benefits and higher upgrade priority — something that may be useful after Delta's most recent round of status extensions.

Here I'll show you my current progress toward Delta Diamond and discuss how I plan to close the MQM and MQD gap. I'll also discuss why I think it's worth going out of my way to earn Diamond even when Platinum is a great airline elite status to hold.

I've long been a fan of Delta Air Lines — its NYC route network is great it has a solid on-time performance and its in-flight product is good. Moving up to Delta's top-tier status would give me more benefits on my frequent flights with Delta including the ability to select Choice Benefits.

Delta Diamond members get to select three Choice Benefits every year they requalify for benefits. When I qualify I plan to select these benefits:

Delta Sky Club Credit Card Guest Access: Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card.

Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card. 4 Global Upgrade Certificates: These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights.

These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights. 25000 SkyMiles: This is worth $275 per TPG's most recent valuation but I can likely get more value when redeeming for expensive last-minute flights.

Effective 2/1/25 Reserve Card Members will receive 10 Visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of Visits each year starting on 2/1/25 the total eligible purchases on the Card must equal $75000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24 and each calendar year thereafter.

Depending on how (and how often) I use these benefits they have the potential to be worth thousands of dollars. I plan to use the Global Upgrade Certificates on long-haul 2022 travel to Europe and Asia on routes with Delta One Suites business class. Further the Sky Club guest access will be great for when I travel with friends and family.

Additionally higher upgrade priority will come in handy next year. Delta extended elite status for all existing elites through 2022 and will roll over all 2021 MQM to 2022. This means there will be a ton of Delta elites and upgrades will be more competitive than in past years. Having top priority for upgrades will be extremely useful.

Closing the gap for Delta Diamond status

I'll leverage partner flights to quickly earn MQD. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As of writing this article I am sitting on a stash of 99576 Medallion Qualifying Miles and $4950 Medallion Qualifying Dollars. This puts me roughly 25500 MQM and $10000 MQD away from earning Delta Diamond. I have plans to meet this threshold without breaking the bank on two upcoming international trips and a handful of domestic trips.

Let's take a closer look at my plans.

Upcoming Delta domestic trips

As of writing this article I have a four trips planned with Delta. Here's a quick breakdown of each trip and how many MQM and MQD I'll earn for each trip. Note that I am factoring in the Status Accelerator promotion for each ticket.

LGA-ORD-LGA economy — 2200 MQM $232 MQD

JFK-SLC-JFK economy — 5968 MQM $420 MQD

LGA-MIA-LGA economy — 3274 MQM $206 MQD

LGA-ORD first class — 1283 MQM $367 MQD

This means that I will earn 12725 MQM and $1225 MQD from already booked travel. This brings me to 112301 MQM and $6175 MQD meaning I still need to account for 12699 MQM and $8825 MQD by the end of the year. There's a chance some of this will be taken care of with work travel and other domestic trips but I've made a plan to make up at least 90% of both requirements.

Leveraging partner trips for more MQD

So that I don't need to spend $5000+ on Delta first class tickets (with the 75% bonus) I've devised a plan to earn MQM and MQD quickly with partner flights. SkyTeam and non-alliance partner flights earn MQM and MQD based on a percentage of miles flown which means that you can stock up on MQD at a discount if you find inexpensive partner flights in premium cabins.

I started exploring different partner options and found a way to earn the bulk of the miles by booking a trip to Europe. It would be a non-traditional routing however as the flights take me through Los Angeles and Mexico. I'd start by booking this Delta round-trip ticket between New York-JFK and Los Angeles (LAX) it would earn 7426 MQM and $360 MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

From there I'd continue on to Madrid (MAD) via Mexico City (MEX) with Aeromexico for $1827.15 round-trip in business class. This fare earns 150% MQM and 40% MQD and the trip is 14390 miles round-trip. This earns 21585 MQM and $5756 MQD. Together with the LAX round-trip and my existing year-end balance I'll have a total of 133886 MQM and $12291 MQD.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

Then I would take my usual year-end trip from New York-JFK to Prague (PRG) on this Air France premium economy ticket. It costs $994 but earns 150% MQM and 30% MQD. The itinerary is 8332 miles round-trip so it earns $12498 MQM and $2500 MQD. This brings my MQD count to $14791.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

I can make up for the remaining $209 MQD by booking my flight home to Chicago for the holidays with Delta. I would earn $320 MQD by booking this round-trip ticket from New York to Chicago and would have myself well over the qualification threshold.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

This means I would spend a total of $3363 for roughly $8936 MQD which would give me Diamond status through 2022. I need to take the trips to Prague and Chicago anyway and the trip to Madrid would let me visit a new city and visit friends in Los Angeles along the way. Plus I can book some of it with flight credits and cover some expenses by redeeming Capital One points at a fixed value toward these flights.

Bottom line

Qualifying for Delta Diamond Medallion elite status isn't easy but you can get there quicker and less expensively when you leverage partner flights. Consider doing something similar to close the gap on your Delta elite status this year. Also remember that you can earn up to 75% bonus MQM and MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion and that award tickets earn MQM and MQD through 2022.

The Schwab card has been a favorite among many Amex Platinum members and anyone is able to apply as long as they’re an active Schwab customer with a brokerage account that can be opened free of charge.

Schwab even provides discounts for those customers who have a high amount of money invested with them. You receive a $100 Card statement credit if your qualifying Schwab holdings are equal to or greater than $250000 or receive a $200 Card statement credit if your qualifying Schwab holdings are equal to or greater than $1000000.

The entire portfolio can be found on the Schwab website (see here) or Amex itself.

Pretty much the main reason why the Schwab card was so popular rather than the plain “Vanilla Platinum” as it’s often called is that you can – at least for a few more days – move the Membership Rewards points in the account to your Schwab brokerage account at a ratio of 1 point to 1.25 cents.

This is considered pretty good as it’s a clean cash out (you can send the money immediately to your checking account or spend it with the Schwab debit card).

Effective September 1 2021 this ratio will change:

Starting Wednesday Amex will only give 1.10 cents per 1 Membership Rewards point for transfers effectively de-valuing the points for this specific purpose.

Now you will always be able to argue from a perspective saying that even 1.25 cents per point isn’t a great redemption as you can do a lot better by redeeming points to airline miles and then book First & Business Class tickets. This might be true but then again this would be cash. Many Amex Platinum members already have full mileage accounts and no need to convert even more.

It was always a nice choice and it will remain a choice for the time to come just not as attractive anymore after this devaluation.

Generally speaking with the regular Amex cards the only way to redeem Amex MR points for cash is through a statement credit or maybe a gift card. Both options are bad because the ration is horrible below 0.75 cent per point. That’s why the Schwab card is still a sweet spot especially if you have substantial assets to invest and can profit from the annual discount.

Conclusion

Cardholders with the Schwab Platinum card and sufficient points might want to consider moving the points out to their brokerage account under the current 1 MR : 1.25 cpp ratio in the next couple days.

I’ve grown more and more into a fan of cashing out points if the ratio is right such as under the Chase Pay Yourself Back promotion with 1.5 cents per point. It’s very hard to beat that even with great redemptions at luxury hotels and with that I’m talking realistic prices one would actually pay. Not “$20000 First Class Tickets” fantasy tickets hardly anyone buys.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvc2F2ZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctdGhyb3VnaC15b3VyLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWNvbXBhbnktd2lyZWxlc3MtY2Fycmllci81NjAyODQ0MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save on streaming through your credit card company or wireless carrier,"Rob Pegoraro

Special to USA TODAY

With competition between streaming video services growing ever more intense the contestants in this crowded category are taking their marketing pitches to some unusual places.

They’re trying to win new subscribers with cash-back discounts on some credit cards and offers of free service on some wireless plans opening new ways for cost-conscious customers to trim their entertainment budgets and offset recent rate hikes.

“The partnership activity has just ramped up” says Steve Nason research director with Texas-based tech consultancy Parks Associates. Even though some customers will drop a service after its deal expires enough subscribers do stick around: “There’s a lot of value in bringing them in.”

Certain credit cards – not only high-end rewards cards but no-annual-fee options – have increasingly featured streaming services among their merchant-specific cash-back deals for customers who opt into these deals.

At the end of July for example my American Express account listed an offer of $20 back off $60 or more spent at the sports-centric service FuboTV good for up to three times plus $25 back on $99 or more spent on an HBO Max annual subscription.

► Streamline your streaming expenses: 8 proven ways to lower monthly internet cable and streaming bills

At various points this year I’ve seen comparable cash-back deals via Amex and Chase from Discovery+ Disney+ Paramount+ Peacock and Showtime.

“Streaming services is an easy category for issuers to offer high rewards since it seems exciting/young and has easily built-in limits as to how much people can spend there” writes Chuck Sithe senior editor at the Doctor of Credit blog.

Sithe added that some cards now offer their own credits and bonuses for streaming expenses; Chase’s no-fee Freedom Flex for example has once again made streaming one of the categories eligible for 5% cash back this quarter for customers who opt in.

(Doctor of Credit often recommends particular cards but unlike many rewards-cards blogs does not collect affiliate payments from card issuers.)

The three nationwide wireless carriers represent another route to get streaming services for free or discounted. AT&T throws in HBO Max with its highest-end plans; T-Mobile provides the basic (as in non-HD) version of Netflix on plans with two or more lines; Verizon offers six or 12 months of Discovery+ and either provides 6 months of Disney+ or bundles it outright depending on the plan.

Nason points to the Verizon-Disney deal as an example of effective promotion: “Disney+ would not be where it’s at without Verizon.”

Because streaming services almost never impose the contracts that remain common (and poorly documented) in cable TV subscribers can take advantage of these discounts and freebies to binge-watch a series they like and then cancel.

That represents a real risk for these firms. The market-research firm Screen Engine-ASI’s Diffusion Group subsidiary surveyed 644 people currently on free trials from various subscription streaming services and found that 45% said they were likely or certain to drop the service after the trial ended 38% said they’d pay and 17% weren’t sure.

Nason however suggests that customer churn would be less likely to limit future streaming deals than potential media mergers between some of these rivals especially now that so many media companies have already launched streaming services.

“The playing field to a large extent has been set” he says. “If there’s a lot of consolidation then the big guys will just get bigger and they may not need to rely as much on these partnerships.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3Blb3BsZS5jb20vdHYvZXJpa2EtZ2lyYXJkaS1zbGFtbWVkLWluLWJhbmtydXB0Y3ktbGF3c3VpdC1mb3ItZnJhdWR1bGVudC10cmFuc2ZlcnMtdGhlLWdsYW0tY2Fubm90LWJlLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1hLXNoYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erika Girardi Slammed in Bankruptcy Lawsuit for 'Fraudulent' Transfers: 'The Glam Cannot Be Supported by a Sham',"Erika Girardi's involvement in her estranged husband's bankruptcy case continues.

In new legal documents filed in Los Angeles on Thursday and obtained by PEOPLE the trustee overseeing the case involving Tom Girardi's law firm claims the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star knew her ""expensive to be me"" lifestyle was being paid for by her husband's company and cite ""fraudulent transfer"" of assets.

""Erika has direct knowledge that for at least 12 years all of her expenses were being paid by [Girardi's firm] as she was generating them. Moreover Erika has repeatedly contended 'It is expensive to be me' "" the document states adding: ""The glam cannot be supported by a sham.""

Some of Erika's alleged expenses documented in the filings include over $14000000 in American Express charges as well as payments for glam squad dancers travel clothes purses shoes jewelry and other ""lavish expenses.""

Tom 82 and Girardi Keese were previously accused of embezzling funds from several families who lost loved ones in a 2018 Boeing plane crash and he was later sued by his business partners resulting in a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in December — one month after Erika 50 filed for divorce.

In July Erika was accused of hiding asset transfers and owing the firm $25 million. Documents filed last month by the attorney for the bankruptcy trustee Ronald Richards claim that Erika and two of her businesses EJ Global LLC and Pretty Mess Inc. received jewelry and other luxury items purchased using funds belonging to Girardi Keese.

In response to the lawsuit a source close to Erika told PEOPLE that the case had ""no merit"" but in the documents filed on Thursday Richards insists ""it would be a miscarriage of justice if [Erika] was allowed to simply walk completely free of owing over $25000000 to the Estate.""

""Erika signed all of her tax returns numerous credit card slips and was well aware of the money she spent on the Debtor's credit cards and the Debtor's payment of her personal expenses"" the documents state. ""Her feigned willful blindness and ostrich approach to these expenditures will do absolutely nothing to limit her liability.""

According to the documents Erika ""attempts to create a distinction between handing her money directly versus paying all of her bills directly."" However ""the distinction like her prior motion for reconsideration is meritless.""

In a statement to PEOPLE on Friday Richards said his firm hoped that the newest filing would ""provide a come to Jesus moment"" for Erika.

""The evidence is undeniable"" Richards continued. ""We are hopeful that Ms. Girardi comes down the mountain from a place of privilege and obscene wealth and returns some of these expenses so the former clients and creditors of this law firm can mitigate the horrific and unfair losses perpetrated by her husband and others...We are hopeful she finds it a better path to resolve this matter without any further avoidance of her obligations to this Estate instead of constantly draining Estate resources with meritless legal positions and threats. No more investigation is needed to prove the money traveled in one direction: To Erika Girardi.""

An attorney for Erika did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

Erika's legal team previously requested that the court reconsider its decision to appoint Richards as the special counsel to the trustee in the bankruptcy case accusing him of making ""false and inflammatory"" statements about her on social media.

The motion filed in June claimed that Richards has engaged in ""vicious conclusory and speculative public vilification — all without evidence which even if it existed should and must be presented to and adjudicated by this Court.""

That week the petitioning creditors in the bankruptcy case filed three separate motions that accused Erika of refusing to turn over bank statements and other documents to the bankruptcy trustee according to copies of the motions obtained by PEOPLE.

The other Marines were assigned to 2nd Battalion 1st Marine Regiment 1st Marine Division I Marine Expeditionary Force Camp Pendleton California.

Maj. Gen. Roger B. Turner Jr. commanding general of the 1st Marine Division said in a Saturday statement “I extend my deepest heartfelt condolences to the families friends and loved ones of the 1st Marine Division servicemen who lost their lives while heroically safeguarding the evacuation of thousands of U.S citizens and faithful allies from Hamid Karzai International Airport.”

They “paid the ultimate price to defend our nation and extend the reach of freedom beyond our shores. We cherish the legacy these warriors leave behind and commit our resources to support the wounded and bereaved.”

The servicemen were members of 2nd Battalion 1st Marine Regiment currently forward-deployed with the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force–Crisis Response–Central Command which deployed in February and is scheduled to return later this fall Turner said in a statement.

“They were tasked to assist with the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy U.S. citizens special immigrant visa applicants and those Afghans who worked alongside us served alongside of us and provided invaluable assistance to us” Turner said.

“Max was a wonderful son who loved his family his community and was proud to serve in the U.S. Navy” his family said in a statement. “He was excited about the opportunities the Navy would offer him and planned to make the Navy a career. We are incredibly proud of his service to our country.

Words cannot express how heartbroken we are with this news and we will miss Max tremendously. We are struggling to come to grips with this personal tragedy and prefer to grieve with close family and friends.

Maxton was an awesome young man who was well liked in the community as evidenced by the outpouring of condolences from teachers coaches employers family and friends.

W HEN A NEW American president takes office the leaders of other countries compete to be the first to speak to him. When the Taliban took over Kabul there was a similar rush to speak to Abdul Ghani Baradar the public face of the Afghan militant group’s leadership. The winner was Ismail Haniyeh the leader of Hamas the Islamist group which controls the Gaza Strip. The read-out of the call posted on Hamas’s website has Mr Haniyeh congratulating Mr Baradar on his victory against the “American occupation” of Afghanistan. It would he said be “a prelude to the demise of all occupation forces foremost of which is the Israeli occupation of Palestine”.

Time was of the essence following the rapid and chilling Taliban takeover of their country.

They burned their football team uniforms deleted their social media accounts and went into hiding. They “narrowly avoided gunfire were trampled” and “beaten by the Taliban.” Then as Haley Carter describes on Twitter they had to wade through sewer water in search of salvation.

Eventually however 86 Afghan athletes officials and family members were airlifted to safety. Their successful evacuation was the result of an internationally coordinated effort involving six countries but even those who’d scrambled to get them out had to concede that it was still “nothing short of a miracle.”

Speaking with CNN Sport from her home in Houston Texas Carter described the overwhelming relief that the operation had succeeded “I can’t believe that a ragtag group of six women some human rights lawyers football coaches and a program director managed to use our networks and our resources to get these women out” she said.

But what those women had experienced was almost unspeakable and the people who had worked so tirelessly to save them are now experiencing profound feelings of guilt that they couldn’t help any more.

Empowerment through sport

Haley Carter knows all about stressful work environments – she spent nearly eight years in the US Marine Corps deploying to Fallujah and Al Asad Air Base in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The 37-year-old American also played Division I college soccer as a goalkeeper and signed for the Houston Dash before moving to the sidelines to become a coach.

But over the last few days her two career paths have converged in a critical way.

It was in April 2016 that Carter joined the Afghanistan National Women’s team as an assistant coach. It was a fledgling team with a limited history formed only in 2007 and which was only made possible by a more tolerant approach to equality and human rights.

In a country where previously girls and women were barely allowed out of the house let alone provided an education or the chance to work in positions of authority Carter knew that the potential of the team was to score more than just a few goals on the field.

“We made it our mission to empower those women” she told CNN Sport. “We wanted to create a football team that could compete at the international level. But we all knew that this effort was something much much bigger than football. We gave them the opportunity to use sport to get out of the house to get an education.”

The ultimate realization of their power also meant the end of Carter’s involvement with the team.

In 2018 the players accused several male members of the Afghanistan Football Federation (AFF) of sexual physical and mental abuse. At the time the AFF rejected the allegations and said it had a “zero tolerance approach” to abuse.

Football’s world governing body FIFA opened an investigation but the evidence presented was enough to prompt the AFF’s principal sponsor Hummel to walk away and the American coaching team who were all volunteers were not invited back by the AFF. Technically they say they were never actually fired.

Nonetheless the players’ brave stance for which any of them could have been killed set in motion a chain of seismic events. “They fundamentally changed the criminal justice system for sexual assault victims in Afghanistan” said Carter. “They inspired other women. Not only were these women playing sport they were truly game changers in society.”

An unbreakable bond

Carter now coaches the Antigua and Barbuda team and is no longer professionally involved with the Afghan women’s team but she says the relationships she forged with them are unbreakable. “Those players will always be our players” she said. “There is a bond that we have developed a trust. Some of those girls are like family to me.”

Recalling trips to India and Jordan she smiles at the memories. “They built us a Christmas tree with all sorts of decorations anything they could find around the hotel. We had private dance parties players only an opportunity to be themselves and enjoy themselves.

“I think my happiest times were when we were able to bring women who were refugees or children of refugees outside Afghanistan together with the players in Kabul to share experiences and to recognize that it doesn’t matter where they live – they’re all part of the Afghan diaspora.”

Those relationships certainly weren’t forgotten when the Taliban effortlessly took control of Afghanistan in the middle of August. Those who had enjoyed freedom and opportunity over the last two decades quickly realized that their lives were about to dramatically change.

Khalida Popal the team’s former captain who fled to Denmark in 2016 laid bare the stark reality now facing the football players in an interview with CNN. “They will take us and we stay as their slaves. We don’t want that and we are hoping they kill us in first.”

So: Popal and Carter helped form an emergency coalition to try to evacuate them to safety.

Human rights advocates Kat Craig and Alison Battisson plus former Afghanistan women’s football coach Kelly Lindsey and the Olympic swimmer Nikki Dryden completed the “ragtag” group of six. “Never underestimate the power of a group of women with smart phones” Carter quipped.

Alongside former Australian football captain Craig Foster and global players’ union FIFPRO they left no stone unturned. “NGOs state entities military and non-military” Carter explained. “We have a team that’s working 24 hours taking tactical naps to tag out for each other. Last night I got three-and-a-half hours sleep and I feel like it was the best sleep I’ve gotten in days.”

There wasn’t a moment to spare as soon as the security situation began to deteriorate visa applications and evacuation lists were hurriedly drawn up. Weighing on Carter and her team was the knowledge that the atmosphere at the airport in Kabul was unraveling and danger lurked around every corner.

Speaking before the evacuation Carter told CNN “What’s happening at the airport is highly dangerous highly volatile. They’re (the Taliban) setting up checkpoints they’re beating people they’re stealing their phones going through their phones.”

“You’re going to have to fight” she would communicate to the players. “You’re going to have to fight and you’re going to have to be smart about what you’re doing. Be prepared and really take care of yourself. You’re going to have to put yourself in some situations that you’re not going to feel comfortable with in order to get through this.”

‘It’s unbelievable’

The world had already been watching in horror as desperate civilians including a young male footballer clung to an American C-17 transport plane and fell to their deaths from the sky. People were crushed to death in the chaos outside of the airport and the clock was ticking ever-louder towards the end of August when the US government said evacuation operations would come to an end.

Once the players had been airlifted to safety Carter revealed more details of what they had endured: two days with limited supplies camping three nights to survive. “The things that the players had to endure is just it’s unbelievable. I got voice memos from some of them once they had made it inside the terminal and they couldn’t even describe how horrible it was. They couldn’t even find the words to describe how horrible their experience was trying to get in. They couldn’t even process it yet.”

When she received visual confirmation of their safety at three o’clock in the morning – a photograph of some of the women on board a flight to Australia – Carter described a wave of emotions. “I’ve never cried tears of relief like I cried when I got the last pic” she wrote on Twitter. “We’ll all come out of this incredibly thankful for what we accomplished and utterly heartbroken for what we did not.”

Carter says that when she received visual confirmation of the players boarding their flight from Kabul to Australia she and her team felt ""incredibly thankful."" Courtesy Haley Carter

In a statement FIFPRO confirmed the success of the mission “We are grateful to the Australian government for evacuating a large number of women footballers and athletes from Afghanistan. These young women both as athletes and activists have been in a position of danger and on behalf of their peers around the world we thank the international community for coming to their aid.”

Football’s world governing body FIFA is also following the situation closely a spokesman told CNN in part “FIFA’s leadership is personally involved in negotiating the complex evacuation of footballers and other athletes. This is an extremely challenging environment.”

The players might be out of immediate danger but as refugees their future is inevitably uncertain. FIFPRO said “There remains much work to do to support and settle these young women and we urge the international community to make sure that they receive all the help they need.” The fate of their project – the Afghanistan National Women’s Football team – is certainly unclear not that the game of football even matters right now.

‘They made very hard decisions’

“They made very hard decisions to leave their families” Carter explained “and everything that they knew. And those individuals are still at home in Kabul they’re still at risk. Everyone needs to understand the trauma that these women have endured over the last 96 hours. Our team isn’t even there and we’re all struggling to process what is happening.”

The only thing for sure is that one day the players will be reunited with their guardian angels on the other side of the world. “Wherever these women go wherever they wind up we’re going” said Carter before she knew for sure that they’d even be safe.

“I will be on the next flight to wherever we can get them to for many many many reasons. That is the kind of family that the Afghanistan Women’s National Football team is. I assure you everybody will be getting on a plane.”

In the meantime Carter herself must process the emotional magnitude events of the last few days and her own involvement in trying to make the world a better place.

“I feel accountable and I feel responsible for our strategy of Western nation-building and democratization” she said. “When we take on strategic initiatives like that we inherently fight to empower women and minorities. And now we’re just abandoning them and hoping that things work out. That’s soul crushing.”

More pressing right now though is the emotional pressure of wondering if they did enough.

“Being in a position to put people on a list and get them out there’s this guilt that accompanies that because you are essentially choosing who lives and who could potentially die. That’s a very heavy feeling.

They remember the airplane hijackings the attacks and the collapse of the twin towers. They remember the nearly 3000 who perished that day. They remember the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan the long war and now its end. In this September 11 2001 file photo smoke billows from World Trade Center Tower 1 and flames explode from Tower 2 as it is struck by American Airlines Flight 175 when terrorists crashed hijacked airliners into the buildings.

In response to 9/11 Congress authorized the creation of a commission to provide a “full and complete accounting of the circumstances surrounding the attacks.” The families of 9/11 were powerful advocates for the commission’s creation. Their persistence and dedication helped bring it to life.

We were honored to serve as the chair and vice-chair of the 9/11 Commission. Over 18 months we reviewed more than 2.5 million pages of documents and conducted 1200 interviews. We sought to be independent impartial thorough and non-partisan. Our efforts had strong support from Congress the president and the American people. The families too were with us each step of the way as partners and witnesses. We joined our commission colleagues equal in number from both sides of the aisle in issuing a bipartisan unanimous report.

The 9-11 Commission sits in the conference center of the National Transportation Safety Board during its final two-day public hearing on Wednesday June 16 2004 in Wasshington.

What we learned

We learned many lessons from our experience on the 9/11 Commission that we believe are still valid today.

We learned the importance of good process and a clear legislative mandate. Our charge was simple the task hard: to find the facts of 9/11 and to make recommendations to make the country safer. In the swirl of politics we stuck to this mantra: Get the facts and make recommendations based on the facts.

We learned that there’s a thirst for accountability in this country. Americans expect their country to work and they’re disappointed when it does not. They react negatively to the bureaucratic tendency to say “trust us.”

We pursued our inquiry in an open manner not behind closed doors. Transparency helped the public gain confidence in our work.

We thought that key documents should be declassified for discussion. We wanted the public to understand in detail what happened and how the government responded.

We learned the importance of having an extraordinarily capable staff when conducting investigations — a unified staff selected on merit not political affiliation.

We learned the necessity of pursuing consensus. If we did not have a unanimous report our effort would have failed. Ordinary Americans appreciated us getting together across partisan lines to tell the story of 9/11.

We learned that you get much more done with a cooperative effort rather than a confrontational approach. We had subpoena power but seldom actually invoked it.

We learned how important it is to work together as a team. We always appeared in the media together departing from the usual Washington practice.

We undertook seriously the necessity to report to the American people in plain English so that all Americans could understand the 9/11 story.

What we did

Turning to the report itself we told the story of an enemy that was and to some degree still is sophisticated patient disciplined and lethal. The institutions charged with protecting our borders civil aviation and national security did not understand how grave this threat could be. They failed to adjust their policies plans and practices to deter or defeat it.

We told about fault lines within our government — between foreign and domestic intelligence and between and within agencies.

We told of the pervasive problems of managing and sharing information across a large and unwieldy government that had been built in a different era to confront different dangers.

Based on those findings our foremost recommendation was information sharing to create unity of effort across the government.

The commission recommended the creation of a director of national intelligence to pull together the work of the country’s 16 intelligence agencies and the creation of a National Counter Terrorism Center to ensure that analysts worked together to connect the dots and prevent future attacks.

Every expert in the country predicted more terrorist mass attacks after 9/11. The record of the past 20 years is far from perfect. It includes the tragedies of the Fort Hood Boston Marathon and San Bernardino attacks.

Yet the reforms we recommended also made a difference. Intelligence and law enforcement disrupted scores of plots. Our aircraft and borders are more secure. Our military eliminated the leadership of Al Qaeda and ISIS and decimated their capabilities. The institutions created after 9/11 have made us more secure.

What remains to be done

In the aftermath of the collapse in Afghanistan the question before us is whether these same institutions will still keep us safe. They protect us today from terrorist threats worldwide. Will they do the same against future threats from Afghanistan? With proper funding and commitment we believe they can. Time will tell.

An unfinished recommendation from the 9/11 Commission is congressional reform. Because the commission recommended the creation of powerful executive branch institutions it also recommended powerful committees in Congress to serve as watchdogs over them.

Unfortunately the Department of Homeland Security continues to report to dozens of oversight committees. Agency leaders spend precious time before them and receive muddled guidance. When everybody is in charge nobody is in charge. Congress has yet to pass an authorization bill for the Department of Homeland Security since its creation in 2003.

The challenge of domestic terrorism also requires strong government powers checked by rigorous oversight. The Justice Department and the FBI must lead the effort against domestic terrorism carefully monitored by watchdogs including the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and above all by Congress and the courts. We can and must preserve protect and defend both our institutions of government and individual citizens’ rights.

The United States has also fallen short in addressing the upstream causes of terrorism. In the 9/11 Commission Report we noted that “offensive operations to counter terrorism” must be “accompanied by a preventive strategy that is as much or more political as it is military.”

Our military and intelligence services are superb at finding tracking and eliminating terrorists. Yet it is easier to destroy threats than it is to rebuild societies as Afghanistan shows.

We joined together in 2019 to issue a report on extremism in fragile states proposing a new non-military approach focused on preventing new terrorist threats from emerging. Our goal should be to strengthen vulnerable societies in the Middle East and Africa so they can become resilient and resist the spread of extremism. Prevention is less costly than military intervention. It also requires time and patience.

Finally we want to close with what we believe is the most important lesson of the 9/11 Commission: To address the multitude of problems before our country we must work together.

Our greatest challenges are internal. They require us to overcome our divisions if as Abraham Lincoln said our nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to equality is to long endure. Can we summon unity of purpose? Can we achieve the mutual understanding needed to share power solve problems and coexist across this vast diverse continental nation? Can we heal wounds inherited from our history while unifying around the shared ideals of that define us as Americans?

Our experience on the 9/11 Commission and the nation’s experience rallying together after the attacks shows that we can. Americans and their leaders will determine whether we will. We remain optimistic that our system of self-government can rise to meet the challenges before us.

UPDATE: Daylight has unveiled a harrowing scene as photos and videos of the tower damage have some believing that power could be out for an estimated six weeks.

An interview from Joe Valiente (Emergency Management for Jefferson Parish) gives an idea of what they think recovery looks like based on an initial assessment of the damage that is still ongoing in the wake of Hurricane Ida.

ORIGINAL STORY: According to Entergy a major transmission tower has collapsed into the Mississippi River leaving Orleans Parish completely without power as Hurricane Ida continues to devastate south Louisiana.

Officials in Jefferson Parish confirmed to FOX 8 that a transmission tower that provides all power to the city of New Orleans as well as the east bank of the parish "" has collapsed into the river near Bridge City.""

According to the parishes Emergency Management Director cables strung across the Mississippi River are now in the water but darkness is hampering visibility.

Weather conditions have made it impossible for authorities to safely assess damages but Entergy has confirmed that ""all eight major transmission lines are down.

Entergy did say they are providing backup power to the city of New Orleans' Sewerage and Water Board but impacts described as ""significant"" are hampering the pumping stations.

Reactions poured in on social media with people shocked to hear the devastating news.

As far as a timetable goes when it comes to when New Orleans will see power restored—well that may be hard to determine now as we are still feeling the effects of Ida as she continues to move through south Louisiana.

We will update you when we hear more confirmed information from authorities in the area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5LzkxMS1vbmUtZGF5LWluLWFtZXJpY2EtcmV2aWV3LW5hdC1nZW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nat Geo's ""9/11: One Day in America"" takes us inside the terror attacks with those who survived them","Ron Clifford remembers sharing the details of an important business meeting with his sister Ruth who advised ""Ron stand out."" So he wore a new suit and a bright yellow tie. On that morning's ferry to Manhattan a man drinking champagne complimented his clothes boosting his confidence.

Kevin Leary worked as a chef at the time preparing sauces and pasta for a luncheon.

Joseph Pfeifer a battalion chief with the Fire Department of New York had 20 years and six days on the job. That meant he could have retired six days prior but he was enjoying his time with the department so much that he wasn't even thinking about leaving.

It was a beautiful day all told. Pfiefer and his crew were checking out a reported gas leak in a street. One of them was filming the job when American Airlines Flight 11 roared over them seizing their attention before slamming into the World Trade Center's North Tower.

On September 11 2001 terrorists attacked the United States by slamming that passenger jet and United Airlines Flight 175 into the World Trade Center's buildings and a third American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon. But most Americans experienced these terrible events from through our televisions and radio reports shocked and yet only able to imagine what New Yorkers were enduring. National Geographic's ""9/11: One Day in America"" closes that distance taking everyone inside the smoke and flames and terrible collapses of the buildings to relive each minute of those attacks with those who survived them.

The active horrors the disaster wrought unfolded in the span of a few hours from the time the first plane hit through the second tower's collapse. But the accounts given by those who lived to talk about them fill every moment of this four-night six-episode documentary series making footage from that day come alive in ways few other reports have.

""9/11: One Day in America"" produced in official partnership with the 9/11 Memorial & Museum may be the most emotionally taxing examination of the events surrounding those attacks that you'll see this year. Hopefully the weight of that statement lands as it should considering the slew of 20th anniversary commemorations debuting over the next couple of weeks. Encore presentations of previously released productions will certainly be part of this observance; we're not lacking for coverage of that day's events.

But as you experience these hours – not just watch but feel them – what may immediately strike you is how antiseptic most of the documentary reports or news coverage have been. After the attacks the media's attention turned to the how and the why of them offering deep dives into the structural collapse of the Towers the government's failure to act on intelligence tip-offs or insights into how the hijackers planned and trained to turn passenger planes into weapons of mass destruction. Close your eyes and you can probably picture George W. Bush's grim face as he sat in that classroom receiving the news. And there are all the accounts of those mourning their dead.

For the most part though coverage of the September 11 2001 attacks all these years later enables us to emotionally separate from the human nightmare of it. To take that part in requires us to accept the fact that we are indeed vulnerable that the actions of 19 zealots could take the lives of 2977 people and injure more than 6000 others.

If we couldn't do that before executive producers Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin make that possible by placing viewers inside the frightened thumping hearts of people who were inside the towers and the first responders who ran in and up the nearly 100 flights of stairs of the North Tower to get people out. Through footage featuring Pfeifer and his team we see the first plane hit. We watch their reactions and those of other New Yorkers in that moment as that flawless Tuesday explored in flames and disintegrating concrete and steel. We watch as bystanders head toward the blast out of curiosity and hear as their companions scream at them to run for their lives. Then we see the disaster unfold in real time from different angles from the air and on the ground outside the rolling poisoning clouds and from inside watching abandoned cameras continue rolling as the world darkens in the moments after the buildings crash to Earth.

""9/11: One Day in America"" is the product of a massive undertaking involving sorting through 951 hours of archival footage including shots never seen before on TV to build out a narrative of that day told by those who survived it and in chronological order.

The filmmakers contextualize the footage from that day by editing present-day interviews with 54 survivors around it some of which prominently features the interviewees. Seeing archival footage of a younger Pfeifer on that day directing his men from the lobby of the North Tower while its top floors were in flames is extraordinary in the way that it showcases his composure in the face of imminent death. His description of his inner turmoil in those moments places puts us right in the midst of anxious uncertainty with him.

And this experience isn't limited only to his portion. Footage of Clifford with a gravely injured woman he assisted that day reveals their panic and fear as they're running for their lives but only after he describes every moment leading up to it – finding her still smoking from flames that burned her alive sitting and praying with her to assure her she won't die.

The highly sensory focus of these hours can be overwhelming especially when we see those unforgettable shots of of people jumping from the highest floors of the North Tower choosing that kind of death over immolation. But in keeping with its insistent focus on the living what stays with us is how those moments register from the firefighters' perspective that day – the dreadful thud of bodies hitting the ceiling above them the absolute shock registering on their faces as they realize what's happening.

You may want to look away but the eyes of the men remembering that day as they lived it hold us. By having subjects speak directly into the camera the filmmakers create an intimacy between the survivors and the viewers that makes is easier to bear witness and relive that nightmare with them and for them. To absorb the enormity of it. Leary for example talks about a choice he made that saved his life by a matter of seconds whereas another wasn't so lucky. He still wears the wide-eyed shock of it as he recounts the memory. If you're moved to weep in the course of watching this or have other intense reactions that's part of bargain. It's only a portion of what these survivors felt and continue to feel.

""9/11: One Day in America"" isn't entirely immersed in horror however. The filmmakers include notes of hope at every turn structuring each episode around a particular story that contains the simplest of mysteries. Will anyone come to save me? Did my friend survive? How am I going to make it out of this hell? Will I get to walk my daughter down the aisle on her wedding day?

Episodes are edited in such a way to make the most of this human drama without cheapening each individual's accounts circling back to reveal endings of rescue efforts that sound hopeless at first. Sometimes it turns out that they are. But the editing choices maintain the tension of not knowing even though those telling these stories know how they end without robbing them of their integrity. Then by sticking us back inside blinding clouds cut by falling flaming debris as the tales unfold we obtain a visceral sense of how dire every second was that living through it was indeed a miracle.

Through its subject the documentary carefully honors the people whose sacrifices made all the difference like the small team of firemen who kept heading up stairs to save more than 70 people and never made it out. Or the three-man security team who stayed behind to make sure all of their 2000 people escaped and were still inside when the second Tower collapsed on top of them. Or of course the group of people who overpowered the hijackers of United Airline Flight 93 including a young man whose mother called him to tell him what was going on and encouraged him to fight for his life – hoping she says that her son could be a killer.

For all the devastation Pfeifer recalls ""There were also signs of hope. And at this extraordinary time in history those little moments of caring for another were the difference between life and death.""

Twenty years hence America is contending with other disasters. The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives and the death toll is still escalating. In Afghanistan the war launched in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks is finally ending; America is not victorious and worse other terrorists are attacking personnel on their way out. It all has a terrible symmetry to it.

And yet the main message ""9/11: One Day in America"" leaves with us is a reminder of how delicate and precious life is. Sometimes it does this joyfully as with one subject who attributes her survival to simply being determined that the building was not going to take her away from her family.

Others like Frank Razzano a lawyer who barely made it out of the North Tower's adjoining Marriott Hotel make that point sorrowfully as he explains that his reflexive instinct upon heard the first crash was to secure the legal documents he had with him. ""I was at the apex of my career at this time"" he said acknowledging how silly that sounds in the face of death.

All this is completely relatable because we view September 11 2001 through his eyes and his memory not through a newscaster's lens. To him and everybody else it was a normal peaceful day.

""Not a cloud in the sky"" Clifford recalls at the top of the premiere installment. Who would have guessed that a few hours later the World Trade Center towers would be gone that ash would black out the sun and concrete particulates choke the air? It was still the same day and yet in the space of a few hours a new era began. ""This was my world"" Clifford observed ""never to be the same again.""

9/11: ONE DAY IN AMERICA: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?

Opening Shot: As we hear first responders yelling to each other in the darkness of the World Trade Center wreckage we can see flashlights and shadows of people through the haze of dust.

The Gist: Part one starts in the early morning of September 11 2001 a few hours before American Airlines flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. People are commuting into Lower Manhattan on the warm cloudless late summer day including Ron Clifford who was excited to have a big meeting in the hotel between the Twin Towers. Then we see NYFD battalion chief Joseph Pfeifer followed by filmmaker Jules Naudet as he gets called out to a gas leak a few blocks away from the WTC.

Combined with the various footage we also hear audio of air traffic control trying to figure out where AA 11 is then United Airlines Flight 175 which crashed into the South Tower 17 minutes after the first crash.

When AA 11 hits the North Tower at 8:46 AM — Naudet’s footage is the only clear footage that exists of the first plane’s impact — we then switch between the footage Naudet shot of Pfeifer and his squad responding to the scene and setting up command in the North Tower but then we also see cell phone footage of what was going on outside and inside. We also hear from other survivors like chef Kevin Leary working in the hotel between the towers and Lynn Simpson who was on the 89th floor of the North Tower and was rescued by firefighters who went up to rescue more people.

We also see footage of Clifford helping a severely burned woman get to an ambulance all the while not knowing that his sister and niece were in UAL 175. Some of the most harrowing footage though is of the people at or near the impact areas hanging from the windows rather than burn to death and the crashes of bodies hitting the ground as firefighters gather in the lobby of the North Tower to go up and rescue as many people as possible.

What Shows Will It Remind You Of? A lot of Naudet’s footage was in the 2002 film 9/11 but 9/11: One Day In America is looking to break down the tragedy into its various catastrophic events from the planes hitting to each tower’s collapse and the rescue of survivors from the rubble.

Our Take: 9/11: One Day In America is one of many many specials movies and docuseries that will roll out in and around the 20th anniversary of 9/11. Because this docuseries is made in conjunction with the 9/11 Memorial and Museum though it feels like it’s the most comprehensive look at what that day felt like.

They have gathered all of this footage and audio over the past two decades and Bogado manages to stitch together the hundreds of hours of footage into a recounting of the day that will bring back all of the visceral emotions that anyone who remembers that day had and make it feel like it just happened a month ago.

At least that’s what I felt when I watched it. The heart palpitations of anxiety that I and millions of other suffered that day and for weeks afterwards came right back and seeing the footage of the planes hitting the towers hurt just as much as they did 20 years ago.

But when paired with survivor and first responder accounts it does show that among all the tragedy and death there were heroes of all types from the firefighters who went up the stairs to what many thought was likely doom to the ordinary workers like Clifford who tried to help those that needed it. In fact what has always been remarkable about that day was how little people panicked whether they were in the towers themselves or in the area around them. People helped each other and no one seemed to be looking out for only themselves.

Still seeing the footage of the firefighters rattled by the constant crashing of bodies through glass and metal damn near gave me a panic attack. Believe it or not though that’s not a bad thing. One of the things that a show like 9/11: One Day In America should help with is to show those people who were either not born yet or were too young to remember much about that day how truly horrific the day was.

The close to 3000 people that died between the flights that were downed the Pentagon and the WTC all suffered horrific fates as have the first responders who have gotten sick and died in the years since due to the toxins they inhaled during the rescue efforts after the towers fell. For all of their sakes we’re glad documentaries like this are out there as tough as they are to watch.

Parting Shot: Pfeifer talks about how FDNY chaplain Father Mychal Judge who will end up getting killed as the North Tower fell is mouthing a prayer in the lobby of that tower; we see footage of the priest doing just that. “It’s almost like something bad’s about to happen” says Pfeifer. This is right before the North Tower collapsed.

Sleeper Star: Everyone the filmmakers talked to is a star as recalling that day must be extremely painful for all of them Pfeifer lost his younger brother that day and just the vision of body parts everywhere would be enough to make anyone catatonic.

Most Pilot-y Line: None.

Our Call: STREAM IT. Like all of the 9/11-related documentaries we’re going to be seeing over the next few weeks 9/11: One Day In America is tough to watch. But it very effectively brings back the feelings from that harrowing day even as it highlights the moments of kindness that filtered through all the darkness and death. It’s a great illustration of what that day was like and should be shown to students for decades to come.

Amida who for more than seven years was part of the finance and leadership team of IHS Towers the world’s largest independent tower company will now oversee the support functions of finance human resources as well as regulatory and legal departments at EastCastle Infrastructure.

Launched in 2020 to “pursue new build-to-suit telecom tower and related infrastructure opportunities” for mobile network operators (MNOs) EastCastle’s growing enterprise extends beyond Nigeria into the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast.

In recent years EastCastle Infrastructure team members have helped structure and complete 14 African telecoms tower acquisitions and disposals including the sale of Eaton Towers’ operations in Ghana Uganda Kenya Niger and Burkina Faso to American Tower for $1.85 billion at the end of 2019.

Before his departure from IHS Towers Amida who had previously worked as director of financial planning and analysis at IHS Nigeria before being named CEO of HIS Rwanda was credited with turning around the Group’s Rwanda operations by setting structures and processes that propelled the business into growth opportunities the company had never experienced in seven years.

In his year as CEO the company which until 2020 was a monopoly in Rwanda added more than 250 towers including the Airtel Rwanda sites it acquired and more than 100 built-to-suit sites. Employing 90 direct and 30 indirect staff across the country IHS Rwanda earned up to $50 million in annual revenue.

Amida’s optimisation of IHS Rwanda also resulted in the entity becoming the fastest growing OpCo in the IHS Group. According to industry reports Amida’s strategy to pursue more market opportunities despite rising competition and incentivise existing customers to make timely payments resulted in significant growth for the organisation.

The 38-year-old executive has said his personal key performance indicator at EastCastle would be to help set “efficient processes and grow the company.”

EastCastle Infrastructure was founded by Peter Lewis former Group CFO; and Pankaj Kulshrestha former Group COO of Eaton Towers. The company’s investors include the International Financial Corporation (IFC) African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM) and Adenai Partners.

Special to Ventura County Star

In prison inmates discourage reporting misbehavior to authorities using the slogan “Snitches get stiches.” In high school reporting infractions of the rules might earn someone the insult of being called a “narc” short for “narcotics officer.” But in both cases telling on someone is probably actually good for them in the long run.

Reporting a water waster is similar. Rather than assessing penalties for first offenses water purveyors generally issue warnings and if the wasteful behavior stops the offending party saves money on their water bill.

The list of infractions and the number to call to report water wasters depends on where you live. Look at the phone number on your water bill to determine who to call for water reporting in your area and look at the website of your water purveyor to find out the rules.

More eco-tips: Report leaks because every minute matters

For example in areas served by California American Water it is a violation to run sprinklers during rainfall or for 48 after rainfall; water may not be used to wash hardscape; no irrigation runoff or overspray is allowed on sidewalks streets or driveways; vehicles may be washed in driveways only if a hose has a positive shutoff valve; all leaks must be fixed within 72 hours and the list goes on.

As I noted in my column last week it is also important to report when water is being wasted on an enormous scale through breaks of main lines or service lines but there is one activity often mistaken for either a main line break or a waste of water.

Line flushing uses tremendous amounts of water but it is necessary to maintain water quality by removing sediment and the build-up of internal corrosion over time. Water crews force water through mains at high speed and discharge the water through hydrants usually for at least 30 minutes until the water runs clear.

For safety and so they can immediately see when the water is running clear and stop the flow of water as quickly as possible they either do this work during the day or use bright lights for work at night.

In addition to the high use of water and the potential inconvenience of puddling line flushing is also a source of complaints because minerals such as iron removed by the flow can discolor water in homeowner’s pipes. In some cases this tinted water may discolor white laundry. Running cold water through a faucet clears discolored water.

While some water line maintenance crews simply open hydrants and flush water into storm drains others have better opportunities. For example the city of Thousand Oaks is fortunate to have its wastewater treatment system in Hill Canyon downhill from the city and is also fortunate this system has permits to discharge into Conejo Creek which the Camrosa Water District then mostly diverts and sells to landscape and agricultural customers.

Water crews in other areas also run hoses from fire hydrants into utility service accessways (USAs formerly called manholes) sending water to sewers instead of storm drains but pumping costs are higher and availability of USAs is often lower.

For example since nearly all of Camarillo’s wastewater is recycled for golf courses agriculture and other uses crews there flush to sewer whenever possible but flush to storm drains in some parts of the city.

City of Ventura water administrators’ solution for saving line-flushed water is a ""neutral output discharge elimination system called “the NO-DES truck.” The truck accompanies crews to line flushing sites captures discharge filters and disinfects the water and puts it back into the distribution system minimizing waste. In cases where water cannot be recirculated the NO-DES truck hauls away the water for use on city trees landscapes and park grass.

So report waste but not line flushing.

Looking for an exhaustive list of the best pomades money can buy? Here you go; shop there. However the entries below are best saved for those in a pinch: those fresh out of product and unable to wait for another tin to ship; those touching down in another city with a few items missing from their Dopp kit; or those with a fresh haircut they suddenly need to style. You can find all of these at your local drugstore big box retailer or grocery store — and as evident below on Amazon too.

Ranked from best to worst each one is a sub-$20 pomade made by a company you probably already know: Cremo Axe Murray’s Old Spice American Crew and Fix Your Lid. Perhaps you’ve seen them in the aisles of your favorite convenience store and wondered whether they’re worth a try. Hair styling is a highly personal process and thus choosing the right product for your preferred look is too. Preference plays a role in whether we like how it feels in our hands or hair how it smells and of course how it looks when applied. I’d be wrong to say absolutely none of these are worth trying. That’s simply not true and a few are actually quite good. Would they be my ideal choice? Certainly not but if I’ve forgotten to reorder the stuff I trust you’ll find me in Target copping two tins of Cremo.

This list starts there with Cremo’s Barber Grade Pomade and ends with an option from a grooming brand every man’s familiar with. (It rhymes with Mold Twice.) For those two and the options in-between we’ve provided essential details on texture and smell hold and shine strength and how easy it is to wash out.

Amazon Barber Grade High-Shine Pomade

Cremo cosplays as an old-timey Italian grooming brand when it’s really a line of men’s products founded in Laguna Beach California. And it was just acquired by Edgewell Personal Care for over $200 million dollars. Cremo’s products are everywhere propelled to popularity by its convincingly retro aesthetic and its decent quality.

It’s water-based thus easily restyled by rewetting and has a high shine and hold. It’s darker than most and has an almost gel-like feel. The scent proves reminiscent of musky dark-note fragrances but it isn’t quite as deep as a designer cologne of course. Our primary complaint is that Cremo’s pomade crystalizes like a gel instead of “melting” —essentially softening with wear — like most other pomades.

Hold: High. As it is a sort of gel concentrate and maybe less of a pomade after all Cremo’s option holds the hair in place without a problem.",,,,,,

Chandler '49,"Share this page on Facebook Share this page on X (formerly Twitter) Share this page on LinkedIn Email this page to a friend Print this page

Wallace L. Chandler ’49 Henrico Virginia who spent more than 40 years as one of Elon’s most active and visionary trustees died Aug. 25 at the age of 94. Chandler served three years as chair of the board of trustees and was a trusted adviser to Elon presidents J. Earl Danieley J. Fred Young and Leo M. Lambert.

“Wallace Chandler is recognized among the most influential alumni leaders in Elon’s history” said President Connie Ledoux Book. “He had a lifelong drive for his alma mater to achieve ever-higher levels of excellence. His passion and commitment to Elon was steadfast and can be seen across the campus and throughout the university’s programs.”

He was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Service Award in 1978 an Elon honorary doctorate in 1983 and the Elon Medallion in 2007. The Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) recognized him in 2005 with the Ernest T. Steward Award for Alumni Volunteer Involvement a national award for service to one’s alma mater.

Chandler was elected to the board of trustees in 1967 and was elected as a life trustee in 2008. Through four decades of service as a trustee he never missed a board or committee meeting. He served on virtually every board committee and was longtime chair of the board’s investment committee working to increase the university’s endowment. He also served on the presidential search committees for both presidents Young and Lambert Elon.

Chandler was generous to the university and many facilities and scholarships bear his name including Chandler Fountain and Plaza at the Ernest A. Koury Sr. Business Center Wallace L. Chandler Residence Hall the Chandler Lounge at Rhodes Stadium and the Wallace L. Chandler Scholarship Fund. He was a member of the Numen Lumen Society which recognizes donors with lifetime giving of $1 million or higher.

Chandler’s leadership was instrumental in the development of the Elon Vision strategic plan (1994-1999) which transformed Elon from a regional college into one of the premier undergraduate institutions on the Eastern Seaboard. President Young recalled that Chandler continually pushed him to improve everything at a time when all colleges were worried about falling enrollment and tight finances. “I was much more cautious” Young said. “We worried that raising our cost and SAT scores would decrease enrollment but Wallace finally convinced us he was right and the results were dramatic. He saw before most of us that there was a market for quality. That’s the fundamental thing that drives Elon today.”

Chandler was a leading advocate for Elon’s effort to achieve university status in 2001 and to establish a school of law in 2006. He often said it was his job as a trustee to challenge university leaders to “think scary thoughts” and have great dreams about what Elon could be.

Chandler’s aspirations for Elon grew out of his work during his senior year in college to establish a new student government with a new constitution giving students more of a voice at the college. “I guess that was the moment that I decided Elon could be better than it was” he recalled in a 2005 interview for the Magazine of Elon.

Chandler was born on Oct. 18 1926. He grew up on a tobacco farm near South Boston Virginia and first enrolled at Elon in 1943. After a year he left Elon to join the Army at age 17 serving as a second lieutenant in the tank corps in Europe. When World War II ended he was stationed in Germany but rushed home in November 1946 when his mother became seriously ill. Shortly after he returned home Chandler’s mother’s health improved so he took a drive back to Elon to see friends and decided to re-enroll.

“He had a lifelong drive for his alma mater to achieve ever-higher levels of excellence. His passion and commitment to Elon was steadfast and can be seen across the campus and throughout the university’s programs.” —President Connie Ledoux Book

Following his graduation in 1949 he joined Universal Leaf Tobacco Company Inc. in Richmond Virginia. He graduated from law school in 1953 and was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1954. He was elected an officer of the corporation at age 27 the youngest person ever elected to that position. During his 48-year career with Universal he served in many capacities including general counsel senior vice president executive vice president five years as vice-chairman and many years as member of the board of directors and executive committee. He also served on the boards of most of Universal’s major subsidiary companies.

In his work Chandler focused on diversifying the company so it would be ready for the inevitable decline of the tobacco business. He was a risk taker moving the company into businesses such as modular housing agriculture products property title insurance and home building materials. He retired in 1990 as vice chairman and continued service on the Universal Corporation Board of Directors until 1997.

Chandler served as Director of Landamerica Corporation (formerly Lawyers Title Insurance Co.) AON Asset Management Funds Regency Bank and the Regional Board of the original Bank of Virginia. His record of community service included work with the Boy Scouts of America the Virginia Society for Crippled Children and Adults The Virginia Home the Metro Richmond Chamber of Commerce Richmond Renaissance and the Metropolitan Business Foundation. Chandler received three appointments from Virginia governors to the board of visitors of Madison College (now James Madison University) serving a total of 10 years two years as chairman. He served on the JMU Foundation Board for 23 years nine years as chairman. He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from JMU in 1983 the first awarded by the university. A mini-student center and dormitory at JMU was named Wallace L. Chandler Hall in 1973.

Chandler and his wife Juanita Hodnett Chandler were married for 64 years. She died in 2014. Three of Chandler’s grandchildren attended Elon: Tripp Bell IV ’07 Currie Bell ’10 and Brittany Hallberg Rosell ’11.

Chandler is survived by his daughters and sons-in-law: Elizabeth and Marc Hallberg; Brenda and Frank Bell; and Blair and Mike Grappone. Other survivors include grandchildren Lee and Katie Hallberg; Heather and Matt Donohue; Brittany and Bruce Rosell; Tripp Bell; Currie and Anna Bell; Christopher and Emily Bell; Ashley Grappone and Lawrence D’Archangelo; Michael Grappone; and eight great-grandchildren.

Funeral arrangements are being handled by Woody Funeral Home – Parham. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday Sept. 1 at River Road Church Baptist located on River Road at Ridge Road in Richmond. The family will receive friends on the front lawn immediately following the service. A graveside service and burial will be at Oak Ridge Cemetery in South Boston Virginia at 11 a.m. Thursday Sept. 2 for family and friends from that area.

Exclusive: Brit who lost dad in 9/11 after 'sledgehammer' phone call becomes father 20 years on

The voice on the phone was a comfortingly familiar one - but the words struck like a sledgehammer.

“It was mum” Jon Egan recalls. “I remember it like yesterday. She just said: ‘Your dad’s gone.’

“I asked her how she knew.

“‘I was on the phone with him’ she said.

“‘He was 103 floors up.

“He said ‘can you kiss the boys for me?’

“He told her that he loved her.”

Like millions across the world left dumbfounded by footage of two planes veering into New York’s World Trade Centre Jon will never forget 9/11.

The man he’d idolised since childhood - his British-born dad Michael Egan and his beloved auntie Christine were among the 2996 people whose lives were lost that day.

Jon was an 18 year-old student at the time. Now 38 his dad is never far from his thoughts.

On his right arm is a very poignant tattoo.

Above the drawing of an unofficial family crest reads the word ‘Imagine’.

It’s a reference to his dad’s favourite band The Beatles.

Beneath are Michael’s initials.

Like that symbol of ever-lasting love Jon hopes that as we commemorate the 20th anniversary of the world’s worst ever terrorist atrocity next month it will never be forgotten.

He says that educating future generations about extremism is the key to stamping out violent acts - like the devastating bombings at Kabul airport in Afghanistan this week.

He tells how helping other children from 9/11 and other massacres like Sandy Hook to deal with trauma and build a new future has been the best therapy for dealing with his loss.

And he speaks of his joy at becoming a father himself - but wishes his dad was there to share in the happy memories.

Christine and Michael were born in Hull East Yorkshire and grew up on the Orchard Park Estate to the north-west of the city.

After graduating from the Hull School of Nursing Christine moved to Canada to work.

Despite his deep-rooted affection for Hull and a desire to one day be buried there Michael moved to America for work.

He was hugely successful becoming managing director of insurance giant AON.

His office was on the 105th floor of Tower Two.

In a cruel twist of fate Christine 55 had decided to visit New York.

She had dropped by the offices to see Jon when the hijacked planes struck on September 11th 2001.

Michael helped get many of his employees out of the office after they were told to stay inside after the first building was hit.

He rang his wife of 20 years - Anna - before dying alongside Christine when the building collapsed.

It was the early morning when Jon studying Finance at college in Los Angeles got woken up by a college superior.

“It still feels like yesterday” he says.

“It was my first week of college. I was told by my resident director to come with them.

“I thought I was in trouble.

“Some of my roommates were watching the television in the living room as I walked past them.

“One said ‘Hey Jon look what’s happened to your city.

“I saw the re-play of the Towers coming down.

“I immediately thought of dad.

“He used to say ‘it’s Murphy’s law’ about things - meaning anything that can happen will happen. And here it was. Murphy’s Law. The most extreme example of it.

“I’d been to those Towers to his office many times.

“It all felt so surreal - to see this attack on our world and our freedom. I think perhaps it was easier for me to depersonalise it initially.”

Within the week he had flown to New York to the site of the Twin Towers now known the world over as Ground Zero.

The enormity of what had just happened and the scale of the rescue operation was overwhelming - as was the site of bodies being hauled from the rubble.

“I remember it so clearly” he says. “It was like a war zone down there at the pit.

“The smell the sight of all the first responders digging the processing of bodies the people still searching for families - I will remember it all to this day.

Image: Jonathan Egan) Jonathan Egan)

“I was the closest DNA match to my father and auntie so I was sat there in that little refrigerated trailer having bloods taken just looking at these bags of body parts stacked on top of each other.

“It took me a few days to really just let it out and say this isn’t a dream I’m going to wake up from. That this is really happening. That my father the man I looked up to the most was gone forever and I’d lost him.

“For a while I was angry about everything - with the terrorists the politics the world.

“In the early years I tried to remove myself from the reality of what had happened. It was only afterwards that I realised god this really fricking matters and I have to do something.”

He transferred colleges from LA to Boston to be near his mother Anna now 67 and brother Matthew now 36 who has Down’s Syndrome.

“I felt like I was the head of the house even though I probably wasn’t” he jokes.

“The focus was on my brother. It was loving him so much and him being a beacon of light that helped us work through those harder times.

He buried his head in work - swapping party nights for academia. After University in America Jon a British citizen himself lived in London as he studied for an MBA.

The hard graft paid off. He is now partner of Lockton - the biggest independent insurance brokerage in the world.

“I used the tragedy and pain that came out of 9/11 to help me focus on getting into a good uni and getting internships because I wanted to follow in my father’s footsteps.

""I definitely used my ambitions to hide from dealing with the reality of what was happening in my life to my family and in the world.”

After graduating in 2005 he moved to New York and that’s when the real therapy came into play.

It was here in the city he now resides in with his wife Audrey 34 that the 38 year-old became involved in two very instrumental charities.

The first was New York’s Queen Elizabeth II 9/11 memorial garden - where he commemorates the anniversary most years and goes to find comfort and meet others affected by 9/11.

The second was a charity called Tuesday’s Children which helps young people and children effected by trauma.

He sits on the board and fundraises for both. He’s an Ambassador and volunteer for the latter.

“There are children who were ten when they lost parents or loved ones. Others have been caught up in the Sandy Hook massacre and other shootings.

“When I speak to them as someone who has gone through something big you can see that relief in their eyes. They know I can understand where they are coming from.”

It was through his involvement with Tuesdays Children that he was contacted by a UK education charity called SINCE 9/11.

It was set up to ensure that the legacy of 9/11 is one that builds hope from tragedy.

“That was where the therapy came in” he says.

“My involvement with them and SINCE 9/11 has been how I have faced the truth of what happened.

“Putting myself in the heart of the issue was and still is tough.

“But I do it because I think that there’s a therapeutic benefit for me personally but also because of the positivity of what these organisations do for people in promoting long-term healing and education.

“That helps me to deal with the tornado of losing my dad and my aunt in the way that I did.”

Next month he will commemorate the 20th anniversary by flying to England for a special “We Stand Together” event set up by SINCE 9/11.

In March Jon and Audrey married in Naples Florida. When Jon read his wedding vows to Audrey in  the last line was ‘and I know my dad would have loved you’.

It’s a memory that leaves Jon choked.

Nine weeks ago the couple - who live in Midtown Manhattan - gave birth to their first son Dean.

Dean’s middle name is Michael - a touching tribute.

“People ask me all the time ‘how do you cope?’

“Whenever you think you’ve turned a corner you’re OK now you hit a milestone in life and realise your father is not there.

“You’ve got chats you want to have and you just miss him.

“Becoming a dad has been the biggest milestone of my life and 20 years after that makes me miss him think of him and want to ask how he managed that balance of work and fatherhood.”

His heart goes out the the Afghans - following this week’s ISK bombings at Kabul airport.

“People sometimes try to use my story as a reason for hatred and anger towards Muslims and the Middle East he says. “I have always been clear. There’s terrible people in every country and every culture.”

How does he think we can prevent future atrocities?

“I think it’s about education” he says. “We do need a strong military and controls so these things can’t happen but there needs to be a level of respect and information-sharing to care for people around the world so these types of extreme animosity don't happen.

“I think it’s so important we don’t forget.

“Our history tells us our future. We should remember those who were lost and those lost since so we can grow and so we don’t make the same mistakes that led to such a tragic day.”",,,,,,,,,

It is the world’s most valuable firm with a market value of $2.5trn. Over 80% of that has been amassed during the tenure of Tim Cook. No other chief executive has created more absolute value for shareholders. As he celebrates his tenth anniversary at the helm this week he can look back with satisfaction. Instead of trying to imitate Apple’s co-founder he took Steve Jobs’s creation and made it better and bigger. Much of that success has come from maintaining Apple’s record of innovation and its brand. But Mr Cook has also made the most of an era of open globalised capitalism that is fading away. He plans to stay in charge for five years or more. How he deals with the new environment will form the next epic chapter in Apple’s story.

Even by the standards of other tech giants Apple is unusual. It is older (established in 1977); it mainly sells hardware; it is controlled by investors not founders; and it is more global with a higher share of sales outside its home market than Alphabet Amazon Facebook Microsoft Alibaba or Tencent. Under Mr Cook’s supervision it has exploited four trends. One is global supply chains: it has built an immense production network with China at the centre and components coming from around the world. This machine is being cranked up ahead of the launch of the new iPhone 13 next month with unit sales of some 90m expected. As well as employing Chinese workers Apple has made a killing from Chinese consumers the second big trend. Its annual sales from China have roughly quintupled from a decade ago to $60bn more than those of any other Western firm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvZXZlLWpvYnMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItc3RldmUtam9icy1zdWNjZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Eve Jobs: Daughter of Apple Co-Founder Finding Her Own Success,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvZXZlLWpvYnMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItc3RldmUtam9icy1zdWNjZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBsZS13aWxsLXJlcGFpci1pcGhvbmUtMTItbW9kZWxzLXRoYXQtaGF2ZS1hdWRpby1wcm9ibGVtcy03NDc1MDI5L9IBiwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBsZS13aWxsLXJlcGFpci1pcGhvbmUtMTItbW9kZWxzLXRoYXQtaGF2ZS1hdWRpby1wcm9ibGVtcy03NDc1MDI5L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple will repair iPhone 12 models that have audio problems,"Apple Inc. said a “very small percentage” of iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro devices have an audio problem and pledged to repair the products for affected customers.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Présidentielle une rentrée dans les starting-blocks pour les communistes,"Aix-en-Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône) envoyée spéciale.

Trente-deux semaines soit 225 jours très précisément. Le candidat communiste à l’élection présidentielle n’a pas manqué de faire le compte du temps imparti d’ici le premier tour pour « relever le défi des jours heureux » samedi lors de l’université d’été du PCF qui a réuni à Aix-en-Provence quelque 500 militants venus de toute la France. « Nous n’allons pas à cette élection pour faire de la figuration nous y allons pour gagner pour diriger le pays pour redonner le pouvoir aux citoyens au monde du travail » a lancé Fabien Roussel à ses troupes assurant voir « grandir l’intérêt pour notre candidature » qui n’a rien d’une « aventure personnelle ».

Pour cette rentrée les communistes poursuivent « deux objectifs » précise Igor Zamichiei membre de la direction : « Progresser sur l’identification de notre candidature et avancer aussi sur le rassemblement autour de celle-ci » explique le responsable départemental de Paris assurant que dans les mois à venir emploi jeunesse et écologie seront à l’honneur.

L’emploi au cœur de la campagne

Dès ce week-end le candidat du PCF l’a martelé : « Je veux être le président du pouvoir d’achat de la lutte contre la vie chère et en faire une priorité nationale ». Lors de son discours le gouvernement en a pris pour son grade. « Le ministre de l’Économie et des Finances a beau dire que la croissance est de retour franchement ce que voient les gens c’est la croissance des factures par contre les salaires et les pensions c’est au ras des pâquerettes » tacle Fabien Roussel. Comme il le fait dans son livre Ma France (Éditions Le Cherche midi) le secrétaire national illustre son propos de situations puisées dans ses rencontres.

Il rapporte ainsi le témoignage d’une caissière à temps plein payée 1 280 euros par mois après douze ans d’ancienneté rencontrée quelques heures plus tôt avec ses collègues de Carrefour ou encore celui de Danièle désormais retraitée dont la pension d’élève à 920 euros. Or « la France est riche très très très très riche » assène le député du Nord ciblant les 500 plus grosses fortunes dont « le patrimoine pendant le quinquennat Macron a doublé » pour atteindre « 1 000 milliards » ou les profits du « CAC 40 (qui) sabre le champagne » avec « en pleine crise 60 milliards de dividendes ».

« Nous allons mettre l’emploi au cœur de la campagne » promet le candidat qui loin de miser sur les « premiers de cordées de Macron qui nous tirent vers le bas » plaide pour « un changement total de l’utilisation de l’argent » pour « s’attaquer au capitalisme prédateur » et « donner le pouvoir aux salariés dans les entreprises ».

Avec l’objectif de parvenir à « l’éradication du chômage » une série de propositions est mise sur la table : Smic à 1 800 euros brut suppression de la CSG pour les retraités 1 200 euros de pension minimum réduction du prix du gaz et de l’électricité avec une « nationalisation tout de suite d’EDF et GDF ». Ou encore des « peines planchers » pour « les fraudeurs fiscaux ». Aux côtés de cette priorité figure aussi « la révolution écologique ». « Le problème avec le capitalisme vert ce n’est pas la couleur c’est le capitalisme » sourit Fabien Roussel qui résume l’enjeu comme un « choix de civilisation : la finance ou l’existence ».

Priorité à la jeunesse

Dans les couloirs de la fac de lettres qui accueille l’université d’été le parcours de certains participants aurait pu trouver leur place parmi les histoires de vie racontées par le candidat. « Je suis boursier je n’ai que 460 euros par mois 20 euros de plus dans le loyer plus l’électricité et le gaz qui augmentent pour moi c’est compliqué » raconte Kilian un étudiant toulousain. D’ailleurs « la jeunesse sera un sujet incontournable de 2022 Emmanuel Macron ne s’y trompe pas notamment avec sa garantie jeune universelle qui n’est clairement pas à la hauteur » pointe Léon Deffontaines dirigeant des Jeunes communistes (MJCF) lors d’un débat avec Maryam Pougetoux la vice-présidente de l’Unef. Une question que les communistes comptent aussi mettre en avant en proposant un « pacte pour la jeunesse » avec notamment un « revenu étudiant au-dessus du seuil de pauvreté » rappelle le secrétaire général du MJCF. « Pour moi cette proposition c’est tout simplement la perspective de sortir de la précarité » assure Kilian.

Le jeune militant de vingt ans est aussi enthousiaste pour la campagne qui s’annonce que son candidat : « On est là pour être majoritaire et gagner » affirme-t-il conscient toutefois que le défi est de taille alors que les sondages attribuent pour l’heure moins de 5 % au PCF. Mais « le scénario promis en septembre n’est jamais celui qui se réalise en avril » glisse Sébastien Laborde de la fédération de Gironde.

De son côté Martin étudiant marseillais est un peu plus pessimiste : « Si quelqu’un de gauche gagne ce serait quand même un miracle… Entre Roussel Mélenchon on va voir comment les choses tournent mais je suis un peu désespéré » regrette le tout nouveau militant qui a adhéré il y a moins d’un an. La plupart de ses camarades se lancent cependant avec optimisme. À l’instar de Catherine La Dune fraîchement élue en région Nouvelle Aquitaine : « Puisqu’on a réussi aux régionales à avoir davantage d’élus j’ai pas mal d’espoir aussi pour Fabien Roussel au moins pour avoir de la visibilité et ça commence à marcher ».

Rassembler jusqu’au-delà de la gauche

Le climat n’en est pas moins inquiétant selon Mireille qui patiente dans le plus grand des amphis en compagnie d’Henri avant la tenue de leur atelier. L’enseignante à la retraite pointe la « confusion » ambiante alimentée par la crise sanitaire et une « énorme méfiance dont l’extrême droite profite pour faire des amalgames crapuleux » notamment via un discours antisémite lors des manifestations anti-passe.

Alors dans les travées des amphis aixois on en est plutôt persuadé : l’enjeu numéro un c’est de convaincre les déçus les désabusés de la politique les abstentionnistes. « Nous devons plaide Fabien Roussel rassembler bien au-delà de notre électorat au-delà même de la gauche il faut voir loin aller toucher tous ceux qui ne votent plus. » Mais comment ?

« Il faut mettre en avant nos propositions notamment les lois déposées par les communistes comme celle pour la sécurité de l’emploi et de la formation » avance Henri venu de l’Aisne quand Mireille croit nécessaire de démontrer concrètement l’utilité des communistes comme « la façon dont le député André Chassaigne s’est battu pour faire revaloriser les retraites agricoles ». « C’est une absence de près de vingt ans du parti il faut bien reconstruire retrouver notre électorat c’est un travail de longue haleine mais qui sera payant » complète Kilian de son côté.

Pour un pacte aux législatives

Quant au reste de la gauche Fabien Roussel a renouvelé samedi la proposition d’un « pacte d’engagements communs » aux législatives pour « bâtir une large majorité de gauche à l’Assemblée nationale ». Car sa candidature promet-il vise à « contribuer à créer les conditions d’une nouvelle majorité politique ». Passage à l’acte dès ce week-end avec l’un des ateliers consacrés aux retraites auquel Caroline Fiat (FI) et Alain Coulombel (EELV) ont participé. « Je ne crois pas à la possibilité d’emporter une majorité parlementaire si nous ne gagnons pas la présidentielle et nous n’y arriverons pas avec cinq candidats » lâche à cette occasion le porte-parole des écologistes plaidant pour « se retrouver très vite autour d’une table pour se mettre d’accord sur 15-20 propositions ». L’écologiste reconnaît toutefois qu’il ne fait pas l’unanimité y compris dans son parti.

Son avis est d’ailleurs loin d’être partagé par le secrétaire national du PCF : « Le problème de la gauche ce n’est pas la division c’est de faire en sorte que la somme des candidats de gauche fasse 501 % assure Fabien Roussel. Il faut s’attaquer aux raisons pour lesquelles elle plafonne à 20 % sinon on ne l’emportera jamais. Elle est faible d’abord de ses renoncements et trahisons lorsqu’elle était au pouvoir elle l’est aussi de son incapacité à s’adresser au monde du travail à la jeunesse. »

Rendez-vous à la Fête de l’Humanité

En la matière les bouleversements engendrés par la pandémie pourraient aider. « L’expérience que nous traversons casse abîme contrarie l’idéologie dominante étouffoir de l’action populaire » assure le directeur de l’université d’été Guillaume Roubaud-Quashie en référence aux dogmes libéraux – de l’efficacité des marchés à la réduction de la dépense publique – mis en cause ces derniers mois. Mais il s’agira avant tout de passer à l’action sans attendre.

« Créons partout dans nos communes les villes les villages sur les lieux de travail dans les universités des comités locaux pour les jours heureux » invite Fabien Roussel tout en appelant à désigner « dès maintenant » des candidats aux législatives. Un « grand rassemblement national » pour l’emploi et le pouvoir d’achat est également prévu le 20 novembre à Paris précédé « d’une semaine d’action dans tout le pays du 9 au 16 octobre ».

En attendant le prochain rendez-vous aura lieu du côté de La Courneuve à la Fête de l’Humanité où Fabien Roussel tiendra un meeting le samedi 11 septembre à 17 heures.

Jim (as he preferred to be called) was an award-winning mathematician a legend in quantitative investing and an inspired and generous philanthropist.

Together with his wife Simons Foundation chair Marilyn Simons he gave billions of dollars to hundreds of philanthropic causes particularly those supporting math and science research and education. In 1994 they established the Simons Foundation which supports scientists and organizations worldwide in advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.

Jim was active in the work of the Simons Foundation until the end of his life and his curiosity and lifelong passion for math and basic science were an inspiration to those around him. He was determined to make a meaningful difference in the level of support that mathematics and basic sciences received in the United States notably by sponsoring projects that were important but unlikely to find funding elsewhere.

Over its 30-year history the Simons Foundation’s work has led to breakthroughs in our understanding of autism the origins of the universe cellular biology and computational science. Jim and Marilyn’s giving continues to support the next generation of mathematicians and scientists at schools and universities in New York City and around the world.

Jim frequently said that he went through three phases in his professional life: mathematician investor and philanthropist. He previously chaired the math department at Stony Brook University in New York and his mathematical breakthroughs during that time are now instrumental to fields such as string theory topology and condensed matter physics.

In 1978 Jim founded what would become Renaissance Technologies a hedge fund that pioneered quantitative trading and became one of the most profitable investment firms in history. He then turned his focus to making a difference in the world through the Simons Foundation Simons Foundation International Math for America and other philanthropic efforts.

“Jim was an exceptional leader who did transformative work in mathematics and developed a world-leading investment company” says Simons Foundation president David Spergel. “Together with Marilyn Simons the current Simons Foundation board chair Jim created an organization that has already had enormous impact in mathematics basic science and our understanding of autism. The Simons Foundation an in-perpetuity foundation will carry their vision for philanthropy into the future.”

Jim Simons is survived by his wife three children five grandchildren a great-grandchild and countless colleagues friends and family who fondly recall his genuine curiosity and quick wit.

We know that many people have stories messages and memories they would like to share about Jim. Please send them to [email protected].

Information on memorial services and other events honoring Jim’s life and legacy will be posted on the Simons Foundation website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2ppbS1zaW1vbnMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcXVhbnRpdGF0aXZlLWludmVzdGluZy1waW9uZWVyLXdoby1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtZXllLXBvcHBpbmctcmV0dXJucy1kaWVzLWF0LTg2Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvamltLXNpbW9ucy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1xdWFudGl0YXRpdmUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLXBpb25lZXItd2hvLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1leWUtcG9wcGluZy1yZXR1cm5zLWRpZXMtYXQtODYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Simons billionaire quantitative investing pioneer who generated eye-popping returns dies at 86,"Jim Simons a mathematician who founded the most successful quantitative hedge fund of all time passed away on Friday in New York City his foundation announced on its website.

Pioneering mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions Simons left behind a track record at Renaissance Technologies that bested legends such as Warren Buffett and George Soros. His flagship Medallion Fund enjoyed annual returns of 66% during a period from 1988 to 2018 according to Gregory Zuckerman's book ""The Man Who Solved the Market.""

During the Vietnam War he worked as codebreaker for U.S. intelligence monitoring the Soviet Union and successfully cracking a Russian code.

Simons received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1958 and earned his PhD in mathematics from the University of California Berkeley at the age of 23. The quant guru founded what became Renaissance in 1978 at the age of 40 after he quit academia and decided to give a shot at trading.

Unlike most investors who studied fundamentals such as sales and earnings and profit margins to evaluate a company's worth Simons relied entirely on an automated trading system to take advantage of market inefficiencies and trading patterns.

""I have no opinion on any stocks... The computer has its opinions and we slavishly follow them"" Simons said in a CNBC interview in 2016.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9idXNpbmVzcy9hcHBsZS1sYWJvci11bmlvbnMtc3RvcmVzLXJldGFpbC1zdHJpa2UvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXBwbGUtbGFib3ItdW5pb25zLXN0b3Jlcy1yZXRhaWwtc3RyaWtl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple faces growing labor unrest at its retail stores,"New York CNN —

Apple faces plenty of challenges this year including regulatory scrutiny in Washington sluggish sales in China and a competitive landscape in AI. Now its leaders also have to contend with labor unrest.

Apple store workers in Towson Maryland made history in June 2022 when they voted to form the first union at one of the tech giant’s sleek US stores. Since 2023 the worker group outside of Baltimore has been in contract negotiations with Apple management. Now workers are weighing a strike.

Saying management has yet to meet their core demands the Maryland workers are holding a strike authorization vote on Saturday one of the strongest labor actions taken against the Big Tech company yet. And it’s far from the only labor challenge Apple is battling in the US.

Employees in New Jersey are holding a union election this weekend. In addition the National Labor Relations Board this week upheld a decision alleging Apple’s union-busting tactics in New York City. The company also has unfair labor practice complaints against it in front of labor judges right now (Apple denies these allegations).

The labor wave that has hit Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become the world’s first $3 trillion company a tight labor market coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities front-facing workers in places such as stores and warehouses faced.

“It speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others” Kate Bronfenbrenner the Director of Labor Education Research at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations said.

So far workers at two Apple store locations – Towson Maryland and Oklahoma City – have voted to unionize. But the union vote in New Jersey this weekend along with other efforts across the country could just be the beginning.

Apple is a high profile company – and many many Americans have at least one Apple product.

“This whole segment of the economy that didn’t have a lot of activity suddenly has activity. The Apple workers (possibly) going on strike is going to be a spark for other workers” Bronfenbrenner said.

“At Apple we work hard to provide an excellent experience for our retail team members and empower them to deliver exceptional service for our customers. We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits. As always we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith” an Apple spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CNN.

A possible strike

The Maryland workers are considering a strike because after over a year of negotiations management had yet to come up with solutions to core issues such as “work-life balance unpredictable scheduling practices that disrupt personal lives and wages that do not reflect the cost of living in the area” a release by the union said.

A strike sanction vote doesn’t mean the store is going on strike. It’s one step of a longer process that ends with a final strike authorization vote.

The workers at the Maryland Apple store are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM COTE).

“This strike sanction vote sends a strong message that the workers want Apple to recognize the need for an equitable and respectful work environment for all its employees” IAM District 4 Directing Business Representative Jay Wadleigh said in a statement.

The Maryland store has an ongoing complaint filed against Apple which alleges the company provided improved health and education benefits to non-union employees and not the unionized employees.

Bronfenbrenner said a big motivation behind organizing is the gap between corporate profits in America’s biggest companies – such as Apple Amazon and Google – and worker wages and benefits especially for workers in retail stores or warehouses.

“There’s just a lot of anger. And the corporations like Apple have made huge profits while the workers feel like their wages have stagnated” Bronfenbrenner said.

Union drives in full swing

Apple like other big companies is cracking down on union activities. The NLRB found that Apple went too far in trying to crack down on a union drive in New York City.

The NLRB ruled this month that Apple unlawfully interrogated employees and confiscated and prohibited union flyers while allowing non-union materials at the World Trade Center location in 2022.

The NLRB held up the US Labor Board judge’s decision from last year – which was the first time a labor judge ruled against Apple. The affirmation from the NLRB is a win for labor organizers.

But across the river in New Jersey there is a union election for employees in Short Hills a New York City suburb.

There are other unfair labor practice complaints against Apple before labor judges at the moment.

Similar to New York City workers in Atlanta issued a complaint in 2022 alleging Apple illegally interrogated employees about union support and tried to convince them not to join one.

The labor action is not just taking place at Apple’s front-facing retail stores. In its Cupertino California headquarters a decision is pending for a complaint that alleged Apple illegally fired disciplined threatened and interrogated an employee for “engaging in protected concerted activity.”

Big Tech traditionally seen as a prestigious and secure field has been hit with mass layoffs. These workers “tend to be higher paid positions and more technological positions. And those are workers that traditionally were not seen as organizing” Bronfenbrenner said.

In a statement regarding the open complaints Apple said “We strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the NLRB.”

More women becoming single parents by choice

New York City — Up against her biological clock Traci Kodeck faced a tough decision at age 39.

She says she remembered the moment she decided to have a baby on her own.

""I was with my best friend and I said 'I don't have a partner I need to be a mom'"" Kodeck told CBS News.

She emptied her savings to cover fertility treatments ultimately using sperm donated by a friend. After three years of trying she had Zola.

""Then it was 'Oh my gosh I'm taking home a human.' And she was perfect"" Kodeck said.

Kodeck belongs to the organization Single Mothers by Choice. Its 30000 members are part of a growing trend of women having babies alone because they're tired of waiting for ""the one"" or they simply want to parent solo like Emma Ramos mother to 2-year-old Michael.

She describes her life as a single mother by choice as ""beautiful chaos.""

As a teenager Ramos dreamed of having a child not a partner. Modern attitudes have helped make that possible. According to a Pew Research Center survey from last year 78% of Americans find single parenting acceptable. Although more 93% support a two-parent household.

""That speaks to the misconception...that we have somehow purposefully handicapped our children by…only bringing them into the world with one parent"" Ramos said.

Ramos admits that the responsibility of shouldering the decision-making for her family does come with challenges.

""Decision-making I would say is a blessing"" Ramos said. ""But then I suppose if I make the wrong decision I'm the only one…to blame I guess.""

Zola Kodeck recently turned 11 just in time for Mother's Day.

""Having a single mom by choice can be hard like when you're first growing up but then my mom just wanted me nobody else"" Zola said. ""…Every day to me is like a Mother's Day.""

""Everything I do I do for her"" Traci said of her daughter. ""This house is for her. My job it's all for her.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2ctYml0ZXMtdHJhbnNpZW50LXdoby13YXMtYXR0YWNraW5nLXdvbWFuLWF0LWEtcGFyay_SAVBodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvZG9nLWJpdGVzLXRyYW5zaWVudC13aG8td2FzLWF0dGFja2luZy13b21hbi1hdC1hLXBhcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dog bites transient who was attacking woman at a park,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/dog-bites-transient-who-was-attacking-woman-at-a-park/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kb2ctYml0ZXMtdHJhbnNpZW50LXdoby13YXMtYXR0YWNraW5nLXdvbWFuLWF0LWEtcGFyay_SAVBodHRwczovL2t0bGEuY29tL25ld3MvZG9nLWJpdGVzLXRyYW5zaWVudC13aG8td2FzLWF0dGFja2luZy13b21hbi1hdC1hLXBhcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Introduction

XGBoost or eXtreme Gradient Boosting is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms nowadays. It is famously efficient at winning Kaggle competitions. Many articles praise it and address its advantage over alternative algorithms so it is a must-have skill for practicing machine learning.

Although XGBoost is relatively fast it still could be challenging to run a script on a standard laptop: when fitting a machine learning model it usually comes with hyperparameter tuning and — although not necessarily — cross-validation. Tuning may increase the computational resource demand exponentially if all combinations of hyperparameters are taken into account. Consequently an exhaustive search for optimal parameters may not be a viable option.

This article is about finding a good balance between model performance and computational resource limitations by presenting alternative methods for hyperparameter tuning. I proudly own an Intel Core i5–8250U CPU which marks below the median of submissions according to CPUBenchmark. For anyone with such limitations my code might be interesting.

Technical Terms Overview

Although I take a practical point of view by sharing the code for the process I would like to add an overview of terms and parameter names used. Please skip this point if you are familiar with them and proceed to data set description and code results.

Autocorrelation

“In statistics the autocorrelation of a real or complex random process is the Pearson correlation between values of the process at different times as a function of the two times or of the time lag” [1] wiki autocorr

Decision tree learning

“It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item’s target value (represented in the leaves). Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels” [2]

Gradient boosting

“Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression classification and other tasks which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models typically decision trees. When a decision tree is the weak learner the resulting algorithm is called gradient boosted trees which usually outperforms random forest. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function” [3] Note: XGBoost is ditinguished from other gradient boosting techniques by its regularization mechanism to prevent overfitting.

Cross-validation

“Cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance” by “partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set) and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set)…multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions and the validation results are combined (e.g. averaged) over the rounds to give an estimate of the model’s predictive performance” [4]

Grid search

“Grid search is a process that searches exhaustively through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of the targeted algorithm…and evaluate(s) the cost function based on the generated hyperparameter sets” [5]

Randomized search

“Random search…selects a value for each hyperparameter independently using a probability distribution…and evaluate(s) the cost function based on the generated hyperparameter sets” [5]

Bayesian search

“…build a probability model of the objective function and use it to select the most promising hyperparameters to evaluate in the true objective function” [6]

Eta (learning rate [01] default=0.3)

“Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting.” [7]

“It is analogous to learning rate in GBM” [8]

Gamma ([0∞] default=0 ):

“Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.” [7]

“A node is split only when the resulting split gives a positive reduction in the loss function” [8]

Maximum depth ([0∞] default=6):

“Maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value will make the model more complex and more likely to overfit” [7]

Lambda (no bounds provided default=1):

“L2 regularization term on weights.” [7]

“…analogous to Ridge regression” [8]

Alpha (no bounds provided default=0):

“L1 regularization term on weights.” [7]

“…analogous to Lasso regression” [8]

Tree method ([ auto  exact  approx  hist  gpu_hist ] default= auto ):

exact — “Exact greedy algorithm. Enumerates all split candidates

Accuracy

“…a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations” [9]

Precision

“Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations” [9]

Recall

“Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class” [9]

F1 score

“F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account…Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall” [9]

Confusion matrix

“…a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known” [9]

ROC AUC

“An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate…AUC stands for ‘Area under the ROC Curve.’ That is AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (00) to (11)…AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. One way of interpreting AUC is as the probability that the model ranks a random positive example more highly than a random negative example” [10]

Problem Statement Elaborated

Machine learning models come with default parameters: if you do not assign a specific value or string to an optional parameter the algorithm does it automatically by a preset value or string. However optimal parameters may vary from one data set the to other so default parameters are usually not optimal. One needs to find the optimal parameters by grid search where the grid represents the experimental values of each parameter (n-dimensional space).

The exponential increase problem —as stated above — in computing power demand appears by applying brute force method and exhaustively search for each combination. The exhaustive search yields a global minimum considering the loss function and so it is appealing to go for each trial. Alternative faster methods exist — applied methods are listed above — at the cost of a probability to yield a set of parameter values corresponding to a local minimum.

Options for consideration:

step-by-step search a.k.a. Coordinate descent — optimizing one parameter at a time. Probably leads to local minimum. In case of several hyperparameters many local minimums may exist. It depends on the order of hyperparameters which minimum is achieved. There could be cases as well when a combined modification of two or more hyperparameters would yield a better score but modifying one of them would not [11] randomized search — randomly choosing hyperparameter values from the search space. Random point in the search space: probably not a minimum but chance for a global minimum Bayesian search — “an extremely powerful technique when the mathematical form of the function is unknown or expensive to compute. The main idea behind it is to compute a posterior distribution over the objective function based on the data (using the famous Bayes theorem) and then select good points to try with respect to this distribution” [12]

The goal of my investigation is to provide a method for comparing the above mentioned approaches by examining the model scores and elapsed time and select the most suitable method when resources are limited. It is important to note that each data set may need a separate investigation using a limited subsample then the most suitable approach would be applied to the whole data set when best results are concerned.

Data set

The data chosen for demonstration is a sub sample of the CERN Higgs Boson Challenge and has been published as ‘Higgs Boson and a Background Process’ on Kaggle [13].

The original publication has been made by the CERN ATLAS team and the famous Higgs boson has been confirmed by the analysis of this data.

Briefly the data contains 21 features (kinematic properties) measured by ATLAS 7 (high-level) features derived from low-level features and a binary feature indicating whether the process is a result of a Higgs process or background noise.

China published a trial regulation on the management of vehicle data on August 21 aiming to standardize vehicle data processing in a bid to protect the lawful rights and interest of individuals and organizations safeguard national security and public interest and promote rational development and utilization of data collected from automobiles.

The trial regulation on vehicle data security which is going to be put into force on October 1 this year represents the country’s efforts to address security concerns triggered by certain features of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) in recent years.

While ICVs have increasingly won favor with car users some safety issues related to such vehicles have attracted wide attention from their users and practitioners of the industry.

Some car owners are concerned that since they can open the door of their cars through facial recognition their facial information collected by the camera might be abused and some worry that when they talk about business plans over the phone in an ICV information collected by the camera inside the vehicle will be leaked.

According to a report on China’s Internet development released in July this year sales volume of ICVs in China rose 107 percent year on year to over 3.03 million last year when the market penetration rate of such cars stood at around 15 percent.

In the first quarter of 2021 the market penetration rate of L2 semi-autonomous ICVs reached 17.8 percent while that of L2 ICVs among new energy vehicles (NEVs) grew to 30.9 percent in the country suggested the report.

Sales of L2 and L3 ICVs (with capabilities to achieve partial automatic driving operations in specific environment) are expected to make up about 50 percent of the total new car sales in China by 2025 according to the report.

A survey revealed that an ICV collects at least 10TB of data a day with the data not only including information about the driver and passengers’ facial expressions movements sight and voices but the vehicle’s geographic position interior and exterior environment as well as its utilization of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) said Huang Peng vice chief engineer with China’s national industry information security and development research center at the Intelligent Connected Vehicle Industry Development and Safety Forum of 2021 China Auto Forum.

“At present vehicle data handling capacity is becoming stronger and the scale of vehicle data is huge. At the same time security issues and potential risks related to vehicle data seem more and more prominent” said an executive from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

According to the official relevant problems mainly include vehicle data processors’ collection of more important data than is actually needed illegal processing of personal information especially sensitive personal information without user’s consent and illegal export of important data without security assessment.

It’s imperative to strengthen vehicle data security management so as to prevent and resolve these security problems and potential risks the executive said.

China’s newly issued trial regulation on vehicle data security has explicitly defined and determined the types of personal information sensitive personal information and important data.

Meanwhile the document pointed out that vehicle data processors should give equal attention to data security and development adhere to principles including “in-vehicle processing” “no collection by default” “proper precision” as well as “anonymization” in the processing of vehicle data and reduce unordered collection illegal use and abuse of vehicle data.

“In-vehicle processing” requires data processors to process data inside the vehicle and not provide data outside the vehicle unless necessary; “no collection by default” means that the default setting on the vehicle should involve no collection of data unless the driver specifically sets otherwise; “proper precision” requires automobile manufacturers and service providers to decide the coverage and resolution of relevant devices in vehicles such as camera and radar according to the requirements of vehicle functions and services for the accuracy of data; and “anonymization” requires processors of vehicle data to anonymize and de-identify personal information to the greatest extent explained the CAC official.

The trial regulation stressed that vehicle data processors should abide by the provision that requires important data to be stored in China according to law when processing important data and enhance protection of the security of important data.

Vehicle data processors that need to provide important data for overseas parties out of business necessity should go through relevant security assessments and must not send important data overseas that exceeds the scope approved by security assessments according to the regulation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2ZvdXItZnJlZS1jYWxsZXItaWRlbnRpZmljYXRpb24tYXBwcy10aGF0LXdpbGwtYW5ub3kteW91ci10ZWxlbWFya2V0ZXJzLWFuZHJvaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5 Best Caller Identification Apps for Android,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2ZvdXItZnJlZS1jYWxsZXItaWRlbnRpZmljYXRpb24tYXBwcy10aGF0LXdpbGwtYW5ub3kteW91ci10ZWxlbWFya2V0ZXJzLWFuZHJvaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

The grand opening of the first model townhome at Somerville Station the transit-oriented development being built next to the NJ Transit train station was celebrated on Thursday afternoon more than a decade after the community was first conceived and decades since Somerville first started thinking of developing its landfill.

“This is a milestone event for our community” Mayor Dennis Sullivan said at the grand opening on Robeson Street. “It takes a village to build a village.”

The Somerville Station development a partnership between Pulte Homes and AvalonBay Communities both national companies features both for-sale townhomes and rental apartments.

It is the mayor said the largest development of for-sale homes built in Somerville since the early 1960s off Gaston Avenue where the streets are named after the classy car models of the time.

For subscribers:Somerville's largest-ever mixed-use development project expands. Here's what's coming

PulteGroup one of the nation's largest homebuilders is building a new community of 156 for-sale townhomes as part of the project.

AvalonBay Communities is building a 374-unit apartment community.

Somerville Station also will include street-level storefronts an NJ Transit parking deck a public plaza and a much-needed civic center. The civic center will give the borough a handicapped-accessible meeting place for the Borough Council and other municipal meetings.

Besides the housing the borough also has signed an agreement with CS Energy operating as Hathaway Solar to construct a solar facility on 25 acres of the landfill.

Since the 1980s Somerville had been frustrated with what to do with the landfill one of the largest pieces of undeveloped land in the heart of Somerset County.

Somerville had a depressed property base because it is the county seat. Property owned by the county and nonprofits such as Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset are exempt from property taxes which placed the property tax burden on the wallets of homeowners.

The development of the landfill borough officials believed would take away some of the burden from the middle-class homeowners.

But the daunting environmental and economic challenges of developing the site made developers doubt if they could realize a profit or even complete a project. Various proposals each heralded as a savior were presented including a shopping mall a cinema and even a velodrome.

But none of them materialized.

Until now.

The genesis of the present development came in 2004 when the borough received a grant from NJ Transit to explore the possibility of a transit village former Mayor Brian Gallagher said.

""We saw it as an opportunity"" Gallagher said.

Though the project was first proposed in 2006 the real estate market and economic crash of 2008 delayed implementation.

But Pulte retained faith in Somerville's potential Corey Wescoe a company executive said.

""It was right to wait"" he said adding that the project is a ""validation"" of Somerville's vision for the future.

Some contracts already have been signed to purchase the townhomes which start at $414900 for the 1002-square-foot Bowery model.

All that remains to be done is out of the borough's hands. The residential real estate boom in Somerset County and the other towns along NJ Transit's Raritan Valley Line is fueled by the prospect of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would provide direct service to midtown Manhattan without having to change trains in Newark.

Jeffrey Holcomb Staten Island Advance

STATEN ISLAND N.Y. — Jeffrey Holcomb a funeral director and manager of the Harmon Funeral Home has been named the recipient of the 2021 Eye-Bank Association of America’s Gift of Sight Award.

Each year the Gift of Sight Award is presented to a professional who works closely with the eye banking community whose efforts demonstrate outstanding support of eye banking. The award also recognizes his ongoing and longtime efforts promoting eye donation to his colleagues in the funeral services profession in the greater New York City metropolitan area.

HOLCOMB’S CONTRIBUTIONS AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCES

Holcomb has made essential contributions to both The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration and the eye donation community as a whole as a New York licensed funeral home director for more than 30 years.

Through his company Continuing Vision LLC he provides accredited educational opportunities for funeral professionals.

The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration is a private not-for-profit organization founded in 1944 whose mission is to restore sight by providing cornea tissue for sight-saving transplant surgery and ocular tissue for research into treatments and cures of other blinding eye diseases. Almost anyone from ages one through 75 can be a donor.

Annually 1100 people have their sight restored with donor tissue provided by The Eye Bank.

Passionate about the subject of eye donation since both of his children were born with congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy it was through Holcomb’s son Brian’s cornea transplant that he was introduced to The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration forming a relationship that has lasted for more than 25 years.

His daughter Erin’s transplant journey was more complicated requiring a procedure in which the cornea transplant included a keratoprosthesis device which prevented rejection of the tissue.

And it was because of his personal experiences that Holcomb and his family honored their donors by becoming volunteer advocates for The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration. And to this day Holcomb continues to be a pioneer in the advocation of eye donation participating in The Eye-Bank’s events videos and community outreach.

In addition the astute businessman has hosted a multitude of seminars through Continuing Vision LLC inviting Eye-Bank hospital and community liaisons to present educational sessions so that funeral directors can learn about the important role they play in the eye donation process.

EMOTIONAL WHEN ACCEPTING HIS AWARD

Upon accepting this year’s Gift of Sight award in the EBAA’s virtual session Holcomb was emotional as he shared with the audience of more than 400 eye banking professionals that he was honored by the recognition.

“I want to thank the Eye-Bank Association of America for this great award” he said with humility. “It’s a dream I thought would never come true. It’s an immense pleasure that I was able to win this and I promise that my continued efforts will be there every day as a funeral director.”

Patricia Dahl executive director of The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration noted: “We were honored to nominate Jeffrey for the award and are very pleased that he received national recognition for his longtime efforts in support of eye donation.”

A LITTLE ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION

The Eye-Bank Association of America (EBAA) is the nationally recognized accrediting and standard embodiment for all eye banks and represents a membership of approximately 60 non-profit eye banks nationally and internationally.

The decision came as a devastating blow after 18 months of financial precarity for sex workers. But just five days later following enormous media interest and user backlash OnlyFans announced that the ban would be suspended.

Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard. We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change. OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators. — OnlyFans (@OnlyFans) August 25 2021

This back-and-forth debacle illuminates the adult industry’s fraught relationship with the financial sector whose sweeping measures obstruct legal workers from accessing their services. With efforts to fight discrimination crippled by partial criminalisation sex workers are all too frequently at the mercy of external powerbrokers.

The pandemic saw OnlyFans’ numbers soar.

Before its current financial woes OnlyFans experienced a meteoric rise during the pandemic. With creators wanting to make money without the risk of meeting in person their numbers swelled by 40% during March 2020 alone. That same year users also grew more than tenfold to generate more than $2bn in sales for the site.

That said it was far from a massive money-spinner for everyone. While celebrities’ enormous earnings grabbed headlines creator incomes averaged around $180 a month. However especially in the context of the pandemic it allowed many to eke out a living.

“I started posting on OnlyFans in April last year because of lockdown” Alexa* a London-based sex worker tells Novara Media the day after the announcement.

“It was nowhere near what I earned before honestly it was maybe 10%. It wouldn’t have been enough to support myself without my savings. But it did at least mean I still had some money coming in.”

OnlyFans’ initial announcement angered sex workers like Alexa not only because it left her financial future uncertain but because it’s users like her who made the company a household name and generate their enormous revenue which is anticipated to double to $4bn this year with OnlyFans retaining 20%.

Blame the banks.

OnlyFans’ ban on adult content was the culmination of many months of it trying to distance itself from its sex worker user base while continuing to profit massively from their labour.

Attempts to highlight less explicit content such as offering cash prizes for emerging music artists went alongside shutting down the accounts and seizing the earnings of content creators suspected of providing services in person. After reports of investors being turned off by explicit content the ban sparked speculation that OnlyFans was redoubling efforts to attract them.

In explaining its decision to enforce the ban the company told the Independent that it was done in order to “to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers” – chiefly Visa and Mastercard with the additional options of Maestro and Discover. Doing this OnlyFans’ statement said would ensure the platform’s “long-term sustainability”.

The company’s veiled comments were superseded by a more forthright interview with the Financial Times four days after the announcement. “The change in policy we had no choice” said company founder and CEO Tim Stokely. “The short answer is banks.”

Stokely singled out three major institutions – the Bank of New York Mellon MetroBank and JP Morgan Chase – that refused to facilitate transactions due to what he dubbed “reputational risk”.

Payment processors have a growing monopoly.

OnlyFans’ ban on explicit content had been scheduled to start from 1 October just two weeks before new MasterCard terms that require verification and full reviews of every adult video before it can be published. The company along with Visa and Discover has publicly distanced itself from adult content in the last year cutting ties with PornHub following a New York Times article exposing its failure to review or delete clips featuring revenge porn and child abuse.

Sex workers who relied on PornHub to monetise their content argue that their livelihoods have been compromised without solving the problem of exploitative content. In a video posted by her Twitter account performer and campaigner Mary Moody argued: “It doesn’t help anyone it only creates victims…my income is just gone.”

The payment processors which have been effectively defunding PornHub have a growing monopoly that has been accelerated by the pandemic as many workers usually paid cash-in-hand are forced through their services. Even pre-2020 around 80% of the UK’s retail sales were done by card. And during lockdown ATM withdrawals dropped a further 60%. This decline of the use of cash gives payment processors new and unrivalled power to create an increasingly hostile financial landscape for sex workers. Other providers such as PayPal and Venmo regularly confiscate money and boot out users suspected of earning it in the adult industry.

That said banks haven’t been exempt from legislative pressure. The passing of the notorious FOSTA/SESTA anti-trafficking bills in the US senate in March 2018 has led to a crackdown on transactions and bank accounts linked to the adult industry. In response financial institutions have been scrambling to ensure that they cannot be found liable for facilitating exploitation – and consequently indiscriminately targeting anything connected to the adult industry. Legal and consensual workers are overwhelmingly bearing the brunt of this sweeping approach which is shutting them out of accessing vital financial services. While banks may have unprecedented power they are not exerting it free of political influence.

UK laws mean financial discrimination is rife.

FOSTA/SESTA’s influence doesn’t stop at the US border. In the UK financial institutions’ heavy-handed action against sex workers has been escalating aided by partial criminalisation laws that persist despite decades of decriminalisation campaigns. Criminalising certain types or aspects of sex work these laws are not only a headache to navigate – for workers and law enforcement alike – but provide the perfect environment for banks to discriminate with impunity.

“We’re essentially seen as too risky” says sex worker and activist Lydia Caradonna. “Banks can’t assess us individually so they shut us out entirely.”

Facing uncertainty over their rights and limited access to necessary support and resources sex workers also regularly choose not to challenge discrimination for fear of falling foul of the law themselves. When Rosie* had her Monzo business account suddenly closed in 2019 – one of many similar incidents – she decided not to do anything.

“I didn’t want to draw attention to myself because I’ve worked in a flat here in London with another girl” she tells me. “It’s technically illegal even if you’re just doing it to be safer. I didn’t want to make waves it might have made my situation a lot worse.”

While not a magic bullet against discrimination decriminalisation campaigners argue that it would allow workers like Rosie a better chance of fighting it.

“Partial criminalisation means that most of us are doing something that we could get into trouble for” says Caradonna. “It’s not the worker that’s wrong it’s the law. We need decrim to fight for our rights.”

Sex workers are fighting back.

But not everyone is staying silent. Sex worker Charlotte Edwards began campaigning against financial discrimination after her denied bounce back loan application uncovered her bank’s policy not to offer sex workers mortgages loans and business accounts.

“Santander said it was because of policies on so-called sensitive sectors like gambling or arms dealing” says Edwards. “But sex work shouldn’t be included with those things.”

Edwards approached the UVW Union whose sex workers’ sector began leading a unionising drive in the adult industry in 2019 and enjoyed their first victory at an employment tribunal in March 2020. As a case of financial rather than workplace-based discrimination it was the first of its kind; there was no legal precedent to draw upon.

“I hope mine will provide one” says Edwards who now has to wait for the outcome of a legal aid application to continue her fight. “And speaking out means more people like me will come forward.”

“We know Charlotte’s case isn’t unique and this could really pave the way for a lot of other collective action against banks” adds Caradonna.

The role of the banks in suspending OnlyFans’ ban – an involvement that was heavily hinted at by a company spokesperson – is not yet clear. But while the move has been tentatively welcomed creator confidence in OnlyFans along with the company’s long-term stability has been shaken.

“The sudden announcement and lack of care has convinced me – and many other sex workers – that OnlyFans can’t be trusted” says Glasgow-based worker Alice. “I’m definitely moving my explicit content elsewhere.”

The effort has led Robert Marcellus from his farm along the Appomattox River to Washington D.C. New York and London. He’s retained lawyers used encrypted communications and met with U.S. Department of Justice officials New York financial regulators and White House staff.

It’s been an uphill battle. Last year a federal judge in Manhattan tossed the self-taught currency trading expert’s case against the Standard Chartered Bank brought under the U.S. False Claims Act. Two months later an unlikely source boosted his efforts: a journalism project that shed light on how global banks profit from corruption made possible by Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards a former U.S. Treasury Department official who lives on the other side of Richmond in Quinton.

The FinCEN Files launched last September is built on information from more than 2100 confidential U.S. Treasury Department Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that Edwards leaked to a BuzzFeed reporter. Banks and other institutions are required to file the reports on clients with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network an intelligence arm that combats global money laundering.

The reports and other records “show that five global banks — JPMorgan HSBC Standard Chartered Bank Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon — kept profiting from powerful and dangerous players even after U.S. authorities fined these financial institutions for earlier failures to stem flows of dirty money” the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and BuzzFeed found.

The journalists detailed how U.S. agencies tasked with enforcing money laundering laws rarely do; cases that are brought fail to interrupt the unlawful flow of money a dynamic at the heart of Marcellus’ claims.

“In some cases the banks kept moving illicit funds even after U.S. officials warned them they’d face criminal prosecutions if they didn’t stop doing business with mobsters fraudsters or corrupt regimes” said the BuzzFeed report.

Marcellus had never heard of Edwards until last year. Now his legal team hopes to use the still-confidential SARs she leaked to advance a case that could net him millions of dollars.

Edwards did not respond to a request for comment for this story. She is slated to begin a six-month sentence at a federal prison in West Virginia on Sept. 3 for leaking the documents an act she and supporters say was whistleblowing.

Marcellus said his primary goal was stopping money from getting into the hands of terrorists not compensation; any kudos or reward for his work is far from assured.

If his case proves successful he could receive part of any settlement recovered by the government for exposing fraud under the False Claims Act which was enacted in 1863 to counter fraud by defense contractors during the Civil War. It allows private citizens to file suits on behalf of the government called “qui tam” suits against people defrauding the government.

There were $2.2 billion in settlements and judgments under the act — $1.6 billion of which arose from qui tam lawsuits in the year that ended last Sept. 30 according to the U.S. Justice Department. Some $309 million was paid to individuals who exposed fraud or false claims.

But the government exercises significant control over such cases by joining with the citizens; declining to join and allowing the citizens to go forward on their own but no longer anonymously; or as happened in this case declining to join and moving to dismiss the suit.

Marcellus’ first effort came in 2012 when he and Julian Knight a former Royal Air Force pilot and executive at SCB’s Dubai branch reported alleged SCB money laundering for Iranian clients to federal and New York state financial regulators after learning U.S. authorities were investigating the bank.

That year the New York Department of Financial Services the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Federal Reserve Bank reached settlements with SCB for hundreds of millions of dollars for violations of U.S. law in dealings with Iranian customers from 2001 through early 2007.

Marcellus and Knight who were friends and had done business together since 1999 believed the government was being hoodwinked by the bank and that SCB’s Iranian money-laundering operation far exceeded what regulators had been led to believe in reaching the 2012 settlements. On the suggestion of a regulator he and Knight filed suit against SCB under the name “Brutus Trading LLC” a company they created to protect their identities.

They turned over internal data to New York and federal investigators. Another SCB employee Anshuman Chandra surreptitiously turned over more trading data — some of it directly to the FBI at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai including spreadsheets with hidden columns.

They say those efforts triggered federal and state investigations in 2013 that led in April 2019 to a combined $1.1 billion government settlement with SCB for “apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs” primarily involving Iran.

The government argued otherwise accusing Marcellus and Knight of engaging in “repeated distortions” about what they shared in 2012. The men ultimately dropped their initial complaint in 2017 then resurrected it a year later.

They alleged in 2019 court filings that from early 2001 to at least 2014 SCB illegally moved hundreds of billions of dollars across thousands of transactions through the U.S. financial system for individuals businesses and financial institutions subject to U.S. economic sanctions because of their links to Iran.

“This case arises out of the financing of brutal terrorist atrocities across the globe through the elaborate inter-bank system in the United States by which banks clear and settle credits and debits in their Eurodollar accounts with other banks around the world on a daily basis. This U.S. dollar clearing and settlement system is central to the operation of the global economy among other things providing financial institutions and nations with essential access to global trade-finance credit denominated in U.S. dollars” the complaint alleges.

According to Marcellus and Knight “over half of the Iranian government’s revenues and the vast majority of Iran’s export revenues originate from the sale of oil and gas a market largely denominated in U.S. dollars known as ‘petrodollars’ and because Iran’s currency the Rial is one of the world’s least valued currencies the Iranian regime is dependent on access to the U.S. dollars it maintains in the Eurodollar market and the interest income on its petrodollar funds.

“Important for this case this financial dynamic also means that Iran depends on access to U.S. dollars to fuel its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and to buy the increasingly sophisticated weaponry relied upon by its terrorist proxies” says the suit.

Last year U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer threw out their claim after the government asserted that the 2019 settlement was not the result of information supplied by Marcellus and Knight.

Then last September the FinCEN Files was published based on confidential U.S. Treasury Department SARs leaked to a BuzzFeed reporter by Edwards in 2017 and 2018.

In court filings Marcellus Knight and their lawyers contend that the still-confidential reports support the allegations they made against SCB in 2012 and contradict what the government told the judge when seeking dismissal of their case.

Their lawyers are asking Engelmayer to take the case back alleging that the government committed fraud on the court when it said it had no evidence supporting the claims.

For Marcellus even if he and Knight fail to win anything he believes they stopped money from getting to terrorists.

“At the end of the day we did a good thing” he said.

******

Marcellus grew up in suburban Washington and moved to the Richmond area in 1994. He runs a small business Richmond Optimus LLC.

“I’m just a kid that had an interest in stocks and commodities in high school and stuck with it” he said adding that he passed a rigorous certification test the national commodities and brokers exam at age 21.

His business advises people on currencies commodities and stock and bond futures.

He has been active in state and local Republican politics. His current lawyer in the case Patrick McSweeney is a friend and former chair of the Republican Party of Virginia who has represented Marcellus before in an ultimately unsuccessful suit filed against the Virginia State Board of Elections in 2015.

Marcellus initially intended to remain anonymous. So did Knight and Chandra with whom Marcellus communicated through an intermediary for several months in 2013 obtaining data on SCB trades between 2007 and 2013. Marcellus said the government promised to protect Chandra and his family should he get exposed a risk Chandra undertook to deliver about 20000 SCB records to the U.S. Consulate in Dubai in 2013.

“I had already forwarded other SCB records to an individual in Dubai who had been asked by Robert Marcellus to serve as an intermediary for the purpose of providing those records to government investigators reviewing SCB transactions for possible sanctions violations” Chandra said in a declaration filed for the case.

The identities of Knight and Chandra an Indian national ultimately were revealed to the bank by authorities during the investigation after they had been assured anonymity Marcellus said. He said “I wonder what message we send as a nation to non-U.S. nationals who risk it all to help us fight terrorism and money laundering? I wonder why the government has to think they are the only ones who can uncover fraud?”

The 2012 suit was unsealed and voluntarily dismissed in 2017 — the government wanted to pursue its investigation and Marcellus and Knight wanted to remain anonymous. The dismissal was “without prejudice” permitting Brutus Trading to refile it later.

In December 2018 it was publicly revealed that the government was investigating SCB. The lawyer for Brutus Trading at the time David Koenigsberg reminded officials that it was his client in 2012 that “spurred the government” to investigate whether SCB had violated its agreement by failing to fully disclose its prohibited dealings with Iranians and Iranian government agencies after 2007.

Koenigsberg outlined the information provided by Brutus Trading from 2012 to 2017 and told officials the work “should not be overlooked in the event there is ‘a resolution of the Government’s pending investigation of SCB’s possible historical violations of U.S. sanctions and law after 2007.’ ”

In November 2018 Brutus refiled its claim under the False Claims Act. In April 2019 the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC announced a $639 million agreement with SCB to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of U.S. economic sanctions. It was part of a $1.1 billion combined resolution between the bank and federal state local and United Kingdom governments.

“From June 2009 until May 2014 SCB processed 9335 transactions totaling $437553380 that were processed to or through the U.S. All of these transactions involved persons or countries subject to sanctions programs administered by OFAC” the department said. “The majority of the conduct concerns Iran-related accounts maintained by SCB’s Dubai UAE branches.” SCB Dubai is where Knight worked until 2011.

The government asked Engelmayer to dismiss the amended complaint in August 2019 arguing that Brutus Trading had nothing to do with the 2019 settlement. Patrick M. Bryan the assistant general counsel for enforcement with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System told the judge that the 2019 settlements “were based on information obtained in connection with the separate independent investigation.”

The judge in July 2020 sided with the government. Brutus Trading now represented by McSweeney and his colleague Robert J. Cynkar appealed.

They contend Marcellus and Knight were denied due process when the judge dismissed the case after hearing only the government’s side. They contend that testimony from Daniel Alter the former general counsel for New York State Department of Financial Services refutes what the government told the judge.

***

Marcellus was contacted after appealing by BuzzFeed which — along with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ — was quietly scrutinizing the SARs that Edwards leaked. In January 2020 he met with a BuzzFeed reporter discussed the SARs and crosschecked evidence that appeared to overlap with his suit Marcellus said.

According to McSweeney BuzzFeed determined that at least 35 transactions by SCB with sanctioned Iranian parties were represented in documents provided to federal and New York investigation teams by the Brutus suit in 2012 and 2013.

As such Marcellus and his lawyers filed a request that Engelmayer take the case back from the appeals court arguing that the project discredited the government’s claims that information shared with U.S. authorities was “meritless.”

The U.S. attorney’s office disagrees and argues that even if the SARs are relevant obtaining them via a court order especially from a third party is not appropriate. The law prohibits the use of SARs in “a private legal proceeding.”

McSweeney wrote “To be sure SARs do not by themselves ‘prove’ illegal activity but the fact that SCB itself submitted them and that they appear to echo Relators’ contentions makes them powerful evidence to impeach the claims by Government witnesses that [Brutus’] position is meritless.”

He wants the judge to order the disclosure of SARs in possession of BuzzFeed; to order the depositions from a New York Financial Services official and two FBI agents; and to order that they be given access to the 20000 documents produced by Chandra among other things.

The government said an unlawful disclosure to the media should not circumvent the confidentiality of leaked SARs and pointed to First Amendment concerns associated with compelling BuzzFeed to hand over files.

Alexander Manful with the Treasury Department’s OFAC made it clear in a declaration last March that he is fed up with the case describing the efforts as “futile” and “without merit.”

“I and other OFAC personnel have spent hundreds of hours of agency time and countless agency resources responding to and refuting Relator’s misstatements over the past year” Manful said.

SCB did not respond to a request for comment on this story. However in a retaliation suit filed by Knight and Chandra against SCB — also since dismissed — the bank argued that not only was the retaliation suit baseless so too was the Brutus False Claims Act suit which the bank called meritless.

The bank noted that the Brutus suit had been dismissed. “The government investigated Plaintiffs’ purported FCA allegations and was unable to substantiate them. Moreover the government concluded that ‘even if credited factually’ those allegations would not establish the existence of an ‘obligation to pay or transmit money to the Government’ ” added the bank in court papers.

The request for Engelmayer to get the case back from the appeals court has been sitting before the judge since March 17.

It is not known when he will rule.

“At a minimum the government owes me a ‘thank you’ and an apology to Julian and Chandra” Marcellus said. An award would also be helpful he added. “Chandra and Julian need every penny to rebuild their lives” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb3RzbWFuLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdGVjaC93aGF0LWhhcHBlbnMtdG8tc2V4LXdvcmtlcnMtd2hlbi1zaXRlcy1saWtlLW9ubHlmYW5zLWJhbi1zZXh1YWwtY29udGVudC0zMzYzMTc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happens to sex workers in Scotland and beyond when online platforms like OnlyFans try to ban sexual content?,"Dr Anastacia Elle Ryan director of Scottish sex worker wellbeing project Umbrella Lane and member of Glasgow University's department of sociology

When news of the OnlyFans proposed ban on sexually explicit conduct broke on 19 August the sex workers and adult performers for whom the platform became a lifeline during the pandemic were the last to know.

As reports ripped across social media and made their way into headlines worldwide the company itself routinely denied the story when pressed for answers by frantic users. It was only hours later that they confirmed the planned policy change which would see sexually explicit conduct and content banned on OnlyFans from 1 October.

The blame for such sudden seismic changes to the platform’s content policies OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely said lay with banks and payment providers like Mastercard Visa and the Bank of New York Mellon.

Adult content creator Alice Mayflower has been using OnlyFans for three years but no longer feels trusting of the platform with her content

“This decision was made to safeguard their funds and subscriptions from increasingly unfair actions by banks and media companies — we obviously do not want to lose our most loyal creators” Stokely told the Financial Times.

OnlyFans’ proposed policy change was described by the company in a statement as necessary “in order ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform” and “comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers”.

The ban which would have prohibited sexual intercourse masturbation ‘extreme’ exhibition of genitalia or sexual bodily fluids in content uploaded to the platform came in the wake of Mastercard and Visa banning payments to PornHub last year.

Concerns over PornHub’s failure to adequately moderate content and protect users from revenge porn child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and videos depicting rape saw the finance giants stop supporting the platform. But PornHub’s moderation failures and similar concerns over underage users accessing OnlyFans has seen large corporations’ concerns over reputational risk take precedence over the platform’s content creators and their security.

When the pandemic struck in early 2020 sex work along with life as we knew it was moved considerably online. The result for OnlyFans was that by April 2021 the company had seen £1.7 billion in transactions grown its user base to over 150 million users and seen its revenue soar by 553% per cent according to the Financial Times.

Such a whopping increase of users with March 2020 seeing a 75 per cent month-on-month increase made it even more difficult for creators to break into the top percent of high earners on the platform. But for sex workers turning to the platform due to a lack of financial support from governments during the pandemic OnlyFans was still a much needed source of income.

Scottish adult content creator Alice Mayflower says she has gone into “crisis mode” since the OnlyFans explicit conduct ban and its breakneck reversal were announced. Having used OnlyFans for three years 25-year-old Alice says that while she was fortunate to have another job during the pandemic “the money I got from OnlyFans was vital to me surviving”.

“I went through basically all of my savings and everything from being stuck and locked down - and I actually caught Covid and was too unwell to work for about a month” Alice said.

“So that was basically a month with no income which was really stressful.

“But knowing that I had at least something coming in from OnlyFans meant that I managed to keep my head above water.”

In light of recent actions from OnlyFans however Alice has found herself scrambling to find alternative platforms to host her explicit content on - no longer feeling that OnlyFans cares about the welfare or livelihoods of sex workers.

“Over the last week I've spent more time than I’d care to admit trying to find information share information and move all of my content to other platforms but also doing research on those platforms as much as I can and as quickly as I can” Alice said.

And despite OnlyFans’ announcement that the policy change would be suspended this has not alleviate the “nightmare” in which Alice said she and many other sex workers using the platform now find themselves.

OnlyFans’ flip flopping over the policy change has led Alice to create seven new accounts on alternative websites not knowing if these too could be ripped away due to snap content policy decisions.

“As soon as the news around the porn ban came out everyone was like ‘Oh it's okay just move to a different platform’ but it was never going to be that simple” Alice explained.

“The thing about OnlyFans is that it had become mainstream - everyone knew what it was everyone felt comfortable using it. But moving somewhere else means going to sites subscribers haven't heard of or don’t trust.”

Another Scottish sex worker who wished to remain anonymous said they too have been trying to move away from OnlyFans but finding the task a daunting one.

“The reason why a lot of us will stay on OnlyFans is because it has become the site that is synonymous with porn and adult content - that’s the name that buyers trust and know” they said.

“I don't know what I'm gonna do except hope that my subscribers will move with me to other sites but unfortunately if OnlyFans is where the money stays then I will have to stay there – which I really desperately don't want to do.”

Dr Anastacia Elle Ryan founder of Scotland sex worker led wellbeing project and charity Umbrella Lane said that OnlyFans’ announcement that the planned ban on sexually explicit conduct is suspended “is just keeping people in limbo”.

A member of Glasgow University’s Sociology Department Dr Ryan believes that recent events at OnlyFans reflect a wider global context of increased hostility towards and dismissal of sex workers.

""Many people don't realise nor value the amount of work that goes into building up profile or customer base subscribers on a platform like OnlyFans and how much it takes to go and do that on another platform” she said.

""The decision was just a complete non recognition of the labour that goes into sex work the emotional labour particularly on OnlyFans where people may have subscribers that continue to talk to you and have conversations with – it's not a case of posting a few photos.

Dr Ryan continued: “I think that what this case with OnlyFans has done is show that while such companies can hide behind the online platform social media and the power of the connected global movements of sex workers is also very powerful as a backlash.

""So I hope this may be a lesson to other platforms who are kind of moving in the same direction but I hope it's also an opportunity to talk about the wider discrimination faced by sex workers from multiple institutions both online and in person.”

OnlyFans has been contacted for comment.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Then it went bankrupt and now the shares are worth zero though you can find contrarian views.

These stock sales always struck me as extraordinarily cynical: Bed Bath pretty much knew that it would be filing for bankruptcy with no recovery for shareholders but it went out and raised a few hundred million dollars from meme-stock retail investors to hand directly to creditors. I wrote:"

In a new series Auckland food writer Vanessa Baxter shows us how to get a quick healthy fast-food fix at home including some great ideas for homemade burgers and pizza.

Vanessa Baxter is a former Masterchef finalist who runs a food blog called The Fearless Kitchen

Although Baxter enjoys cooking her own style of ""fast and furious"" food she worries about how the prevalence of commercial fast food will affect future generations.

""The unintentional consequence of relying on being able to buy your food quickly or pre-prepared all the time is a total lack of understanding of how to actually prep a meal"" she tells Jim Mora.

""But it also means [people are] further distanced from where food comes from how its grown but even how to shop prep and prep a meal. And that doesn't have to be a laborious task.""

Mouth-watering ads for takeaway food can be very tempting but the reality is often disappointing Baxter says.

""[Fast food chains] are careful in how they're creating the food [that appears in ads]. It is what it says it is and it must be to meet advertising standards.

""But there are still tips and tricks and plays of light and ways of presenting the food which means what happens at a kitchen in a fast food outlet is very different to what is done by the food stylist and the photographer who are putting together an ad campaign.""

Fast food while it can be cheap misses the mark on nutritional value Baxter says.

High levels of fat sugar and salt are what make it seem addictive.

""Unfortunately it also encourages us to eat more. Whereas at home you can really take control of how much salt you're adding in [and ask yourself] does it need a teaspoon of sugar in the mix? No it does not.

""You can also add lots of dried herbs rather than adding excess seasoning in the form of salt. It's also changing your palate a bit away from the reliance of some of those additives that you become used to if you're consistently eating pre-prepared food.""

Fast-food meals at home - such as meatballs burgers and pizza - should still be considered a ""special treat"" even if they're homemade and healthier.

""These are kind of like your alternates to fast food they're your healthy at-home versions. But if we all had burgers every single day for dinner it's probably not ideal either.""

Make time for meatballs

There are plenty of ways to get your family excited about healthier meals Baxter says. Case in point - meatballs.

""We've been having a lot of meatballs in my house and it doesn't sound that exciting but there's a lot you can actually do.

""You can use different types of meat of course ... and you can change around all the different flavours and combinations you can have an Asian-style one or an Italian-style one. Then of course manipulate the sauces you're going to put with them.""

Sneaking in some grated veggies is often a good idea especially if your kids aren't getting their daily recommended intake.

""You can be very clear about the quality of your meat so you can choose a leaner meat. The flipside of that is how do I then make sure that I don't have a really dry inedible meatball?

""The way to combat that rather than adding fat is to maybe grate a juicy type of vegetable like a carrot or zucchini which adds in that fabulous moisture content but doesn't mean you're using a higher fat meat.""

Burgers but better for you

Start from scratch with the patty Baxter says. She recommends buying lean or hamburger mince or mincing up a chuck steak cut if you prefer.

""Just try not to overhandle your mince - that's the biggest flaw I guess in trying to make your own hamburger meat is people manipulate the meat too much and sort of push it together and down.

""Even if it's a bit wonky to look at you're going to have the juiciest burger that way [with the least amount of hand action].

""Then you can shallow-fry it or finish it off in the oven if it's thick ... and the simpler the better. Just a simple mince with salt and pepper is fine and maybe some thyme.

""Otherwise if you like to and you've got kids who are averse to vegetables of course you can grate some vegetables into that patty as well and create it with a bit more bulk.""

Try using a wholemeal bun for a healthier option to white bread Baxter says.

""You can grill off some vegetables and pile those in there as well or just keep it super simple with a slice of tomato and some Kiwi favourites - beetroot and some lovely grilled non-pre-sliced cheese.""

Pizza pronto

If you don't have time to make your own pizza dough flatbreads and wraps can work well Baxter says.

""You can actually use that base and put some ingredients on it pop it in the oven for five minutes let the cheese melt and the tomatoes caramelise a little bit and you've got a really quick and easy lunch that the kids can actually put together themselves and enjoy eating.""",,,,,,,,,

Demand for tests dipped earlier this year when cases fell with the introduction of vaccines but has once again spiked with the Delta variant.

One manufacturer in June ordered employees to destroy testing kits and laid off employees The New York Times reported.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Companies that manufacture COVID-19 testing kits are working to ramp up production as demand for tests increases as students across the US head back to schools.

Abbott Laboratories Becton Dickinson and Co. and Quidel Corp. had scaled back their operations to produce COVID-19 tests in recent months as demand for the kits fell according to a report from Reuters.

Abbott in June and July ordered employees at a facility in Maine to dismantle and throw away parts of testing kits they had created due to a decrease in the demand for tests across the US The New York Times reported August 20. The dip in demand came as vaccines rolled out and cases of the coronavirus dipped dramatically in the US.

Then the company laid off the workers hired to make the testing kits according to the report.

""The numbers are going down"" an Abbot site manager told the 2000 workers the company laid off at a manufacturing facility in Illinois according to the Times report. ""This is all about money.""

But demand for the rapid antigen tests has once again increased amid the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant which has fueled a new surge of cases across the US at the same time companies call workers back to offices and students and staff head back to schools and college campuses for the start of the new academic year.

""We're hiring people and turning on parts of our manufacturing network that were idled or slowed when guidance changed and demand plunged"" a spokesperson for Abbott told Reuters in a statement.

A spokesperson for Becton Dickinson told Reuters that supply was currently tight.

""With the rise of cases from the Delta variant... there is currently some tightness in supply as manufacturers ramp back up"" the spokesperson told the outlet.

CVS on Friday announced it would limit the number of rapid tests that individuals could purchase from its stores at one time. Customers were previously allowed to purchase an unlimited number of tests but are now limited to purchasing six rapid testing kits at a time as Insider previously reported.

As Insider noted at-home rapid tests have become a popular way to test for the disease among people looking for quick results.

""Abbott has continuously been manufacturing tests and we have been scaling up manufacturing as we saw demand increase when Delta became the dominant strain and new CDC guidance called for a re-prioritization of testing"" an Abbott spokesperson previously told Insider.

The demand for COVID-19 tests has increased from 250000 tests per day at the beginning of July to about 1.5 million tests a day in the middle of August an increase of nearly 600% according to federal data reported by Reuters.

As the outlet noted demand for tests is likely to further increase as more state governments and private employers issue vaccine mandates that require unvaccinated employees to undergo regular testing for the disease. President Joe Biden in July announced all federal employees must be vaccinated against the disease or face regular testing.

Companies like Walmart and major airlines like United and Frontier have announced various vaccine mandates. The mandates vary with some allowing employees to opt-out if they agree to regular testing.

Demand is also likely to increase as school systems and campuses implement surveillance testing programs to avoid outbreaks industry officials and state health officials told Reuters.

This was especially true for medical supplies. Just-in-time supply chains have been developed over the years to increase efficiency but had never been tested in a global crisis when demand for certain medical products is high and supply is weak. The government ended up paying huge sums for PPE which in some cases was not even suitable for use.

The shortage raises eyebrows because a plastic tube is after all a plastic tube

It seems the lesson has not entirely been learned. There is now a shortage of blood tubes – the small plastic tubes which are used for collecting samples of blood. NHS England has now demanded that all community and non-urgent blood tests be halted until 17 September – which may affect patients such as those receiving treatment for fertility problems allergies and pre-diabetes. Clinically urgent testing may continue.

The NHS sources many blood tubes from Becton Dickinson a multinational medical supplies company which has a sizeable operation in Britain employing 3500 people in the UK and Ireland. It does not however manufacture the tubes wholly within Britain – it sources parts of them from the US. A member of the BMA has attacked the NHS for being over-reliant on one supplier although the NHS has indicated that there is a global shortage of blood tubes in general.

The shortage raises eyebrows because a plastic tube is after all a plastic tube – which is among the simpler items used by the NHS. If we end up running out of plastic tubes what hope do we have of maintaining supplies of more sophisticated equipment and medicines during times of crisis? NHS procurement policies have been under the spotlight in recent years mainly in terms of financial waste. It has centralised some of its procurement in order to make greater use of bulk buying power but such an approach comes with problems if it means an over-reliance on a narrow range of suppliers. One of the questions the NHS will be left asking is whether it needs to diversify its supply chain or ensure that it has more local suppliers. It should answer those questions – even if it costs more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2luZXdzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvaGVhbHRoL2Jsb29kLXRlc3Qtc2hvcnRhZ2UtbmhzLWNoaWVmcy13b3JraW5nLWZsYXQtb3V0LXRvLXJlc29sdmUtc2hvcnRhZ2Utb2YtYmxvb2Qtc2FtcGxlLXR1YmVzLTExNzQwMjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health chiefs working 'flat out' to resolve shortage of blood containers for tests,"Health chiefs say they are working ‘flat out’ to resolve the nationwide shortage of blood collection tubes that has halted all but the most clinically urgent blood tests.

The British Medical Association warned at the weekend that the shortage of blood tubes across hospitals and GP surgeries is now severe and if the NHS does not reduce the amount being used in the coming days even the most clinically important blood tests may be at risk.

But a spokesperson at the Department of Health and Social Care which is in charge of the national supply chain sought to reassure the public that the everything was being done to alleviate the shortages.

“Patient safety is a top priority and we are working closely with NHS England the Devolved Administrations and NHS Supply Chain to minimise any impact on patient care” the spokesperson said.

“The health and care system continues to work flat out with the supplier and stakeholders to put mitigations in place and restore normal supply and there continues to be stock in place.”

The reassurances come a day after the BMA warned that a shortage of blood tubes has put doctors and patients in a “terrible unenviable position” with GPs facing “difficult choices” about who gets blood tests.

Earlier this month NHS England issued guidance amid a global shortage of blood tube products.

It came after medical technology company Becton Dickinson (BD) reported temporary supply chain issues for tubes used to collect samples in blood tests.

All clinically essential blood tests will go ahead but others have been scaled back.

The BMA urged doctors to follow guidance and carry out “only the most critical tests for the time being”.

Becton Dickinson the NHS’s main supplier of blood collection tubes has been blamed for the shortage with the manufacturer suggesting the post-Brexit HGV driver shortage could be to blame.

A company spokesperson said low stocks had been caused by “transportation challenges that have affected all industries including port and transport capacity air freight capacity and UK border challenges”.

“Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components” they added

The BMA said shortages across hospitals and GP surgeries were “severe” and if the NHS did not reduce usage in the coming days “even the most clinically important blood tests may be at risk”.

Earlier this month NHS England issued guidance amid a global shortage of blood tube products.

It came after medical technology company Becton Dickinson (BD) reported temporary supply chain issues for tubes used to collect samples in blood tests.

All clinically necessary blood tests will go ahead but others have been scaled back.

A spokesman for BD said the NHS had been clear that the supply disruption was not limited to BD and affected other companies producing blood tubes.

He said BD took its responsibility to provide consistent product supply “very seriously” and that it was taking steps to “maximize supply” and divert products from other regions to help the UK.

Dr David Wrigley BMA council deputy chair said: “This crisis has put doctors and their patients in a terrible unenviable position.

“No doctor knowingly undertakes unnecessary blood tests and to now have to ration all those we are doing as well as cancel hundreds more goes against everything we stand for as clinicians.

“However if we don’t try to follow the NHS guidance it’s clear we will get to the point where even the most clinically urgent of blood tests may not be able to be done as we simply won’t have the tubes for the blood to go into.

“We are at a very perilous point and it’s surprising that NHS England hasn’t declared a critical incident given the very strong possibility that NHS organisations may temporarily lose the ability to provide lifesaving diagnostic testing.”

He called on NHS England to provide information for patients about the situation.

On Thursday NHS bosses wrote to England’s GPs and hospital trusts warning that supply was “forecasted to become even more constrained over the coming weeks”.

“While it is anticipated that the position will improve from the middle of September overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period” they wrote adding that it was “important and urgent that demand is reduced as much as possible”.

Alternative products are being sought but it is expected to take time for these to be imported and delivered in volume.

Health bosses said all primary care and community testing must stop until September 17 except for “clinically urgent” testing.

Acute and mental health trusts must reduce their demand by a minimum of 25% for the period leading up to this date.

A global shortage of blood tube products was warned about

He added: “It is shocking that this situation has been allowed to develop – in particular the apparent over-reliance on one manufacturer and the woeful lack of any kind of reserve supply.

“The manufacturers should also have to explain how they allowed stocks to run so low that patients will now suffer as a result.

“If we don’t get on top of this shortage – and quickly – then we could very easily end up in a catastrophic position particularly in hospitals where patients come to serious harm.”

The NHS guidance recommends stopping vitamin D testing except in exceptional circumstances and deferring routine infertility testing unless the patient is over the age of 35.

It also says allergy testing is “not a priority at this time” unless there is clinical need and that routine wellness screening is “not a priority”.

The guidance also advises against stockpiling tubes.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Patient safety is a top priority and we are working closely with NHS England the devolved administrations and NHS Supply Chain to minimise any impact on patient care.

“The health and care system continues to work flat out with the supplier and stakeholders to put mitigations in place and restore normal supply and there continues to be stock in place.”

The BD spokesman said there had been “unprecedented” demand for its vacutainer blood collection tubes in recent months.

This was driven by the need for tubes for testing for Covid-19 patients as well as routine testing for procedures delayed due to the pandemic.

He added: “In addition to increased demand we are seeing continued transportation challenges that have affected all industries including port and transport capacity air freight capacity and UK border challenges.

“Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components.”

He said its blood tube plants around the world were running at “full capacity” to alleviate the backlog of orders."

Warren Buffett's talent for spotting undervalued businesses has made him one of the wealthiest men in history. However he has repeatedly underscored the outsized role that luck has played in his career and highlighted Afghanistan to hammer his point home.

Winning the lottery

The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO popularized the term ""ovarian lottery"" or the idea that the circumstances of a person's birth shape their opportunities in life.

""It's the most important event in which you'll ever participate"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 1997. ""It's going to determine way more than what school you go to how hard you work all kinds of things. You're going to get one ball drawn out of a barrel that probably contains 5.7 billion balls now and that's you.""

Buffett noted that he and his business partner Charlie Munger won the lottery by being born white smart able-bodied male and in America.

""When we were born the odds were over 30-to-1 against being born in the United States"" Buffett said at the meeting. ""Just winning that portion of the lottery enormous plus. We wouldn't be worth a damn in Afghanistan.""

""We'd be giving talks nobody'd be listening"" he continued. ""Terrible.""

The US has richly rewarded the two men's knack for valuing businesses but that wouldn't be the case in every country Buffett continued.

""Is that the greatest talent in the world? No"" he said. ""It just happens to be something that pays off like crazy in this system.""

Buffett repeated that point more than a decade later adding that many important jobs are far less lucrative.

""The market system rewards me outlandishly for what I do"" Buffett told Time magazine in 2012. ""But that doesn't mean I'm any more deserving of a good life than a teacher or a doctor or someone who fights in Afghanistan.""

Sharing the jackpot

Buffett has drawn comparisons between the US and Afghanistan to emphasize how inequality starts at birth. He's called for a system that incentivizes people to use their skills if they're valued by the market and society but also helps people who don't hit the jackpot in life.

That type of system ""makes sure that just because at that one moment in time they got the wrong ticket they don't live a life that's dramatically worse than the people that were luckier"" Buffett said at the 1997 meeting.

The Berkshire chief has also pointed to Afghanistan to make his case for higher taxes on the wealthy.

""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks"" he said in a New York Times column titled ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich"" in 2011.

Buffett's comments show he's aware of his numerous advantages and privileges which include living in a country that rewards his skills and protects his wealth. Afghanistan is his go-to example of a much tougher situation fueling his belief that the less fortunate should be lifted up and the most affluent should share more of their wealth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtZXhwbGFpbmVkLXNlY3JldHMtb2YtaGlzLXN1Y2Nlc3MtYnV0LW1vc3QtcGVvcGxlLXN0aWxsLWRvbnQtbGlzdGVuLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Explained the Secrets of His Success.

There the Bengals unveiled the new epic-looking intro tunnel for the players during introductions highlighted by tigers resting atop stone columns.

The team also unveiled the throne that will be used in the “Ruler of the Jungle” feature during game days.

These additions plus more — including the Ring of Honor — will be present when the team hosts the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1.

When you want cheap TVs there are so many options to choose from and not all of them good. If you've looked at our list of the best TVs under $500 or even just browsed the highlights of any recent weekend sale you've definitely seen Fire TVs and probably wondered if they're even worth buying when they sell for so little.

The good news is that Amazon smart TVs tend to be better than most TVs in the same price bracket and as long as you make sure you're getting a 4K model you can rest assured that both Insignia and Toshiba Fire TVs are a good value with or without those stunningly low prices.

But which is better the Insignia Fire TV or the Toshiba Fire TV? We've reviewed both which you can find in our Insignia 4K Ultra HD Fire TV Edition NS-55DF710NA21 review and Toshiba C350 Fire TV (2021 model) review.

Let's dig into the details of each and find out which is the better Fire TV bargain.

A note about names: The Insignia model from our Insignia 4K Ultra HD Fire TV Edition NS-55DF710NA21 review was recently renamed the Insignia F30 Series Fire TV Edition so we've updated the review to reflect that and will use the new name throughout this comparison.

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Price and size options

When it comes to affordable TVs price and size may be the biggest factors in anyone's buying decision. There's no point in looking at the more premium TVs when you have a budget of $500 but you also don't want to wind up looking like Michael Scott with his tiny little TV.

Thankfully both the Insignia and Toshiba Fire TV edition models offer a good mix of prices and sizes. These are some of the most affordable 4K TVs on the market and you won't have to settle for a small screen size to get those savings.

(Image credit: Insignia)

Let's start with the Insignia which is sold in sizes ranging from a compact 43 inches (about the smallest you'll ever want to go for a 4K screen) up to an impressive 70 inches. The 55-inch model sells for less than $500 and even the biggest 70-incher sells for $619.

(Image credit: Toshiba)

The Toshiba C350 is also quite affordable with similarly low prices that make it a mainstay of our best TVs under $500 page. Available in 43 50 and 55-inch sizes the most expensive model is just $469 through Best Buy despite its recommended retail price of $519.

43 inch (model 43C350KU) - $349.99

50 inch (model 50C350KU) - $439.99

55 inch (model 55C350KU) - $469.99

I say ""recommended retail price"" because I've rarely seen either brand of Fire TV sold for full price. They are always being discounted a little bit but they make a big splash whenever there's a big sale such as Black Friday or Amazon Prime Day with sale prices dropping to the lowest of the year so that retailers can grab headlines with 4K TVs selling for crazy low prices.

And that's where the Fire TVs really shine. As inexpensive TVs they're always a decent affordable option. But as loss-leaders subsidized by retail giants like Amazon and Best Buy (Fire TV is Amazon's smart TV platform and Insignia is Best Buy's store brand) they can be bought for a song anytime there's a sales event and that makes them some of the most popular TVs around.

But you'll notice one big difference between the Insignia and Toshiba models listed here: There are more size options for the Insignia than the Toshiba which tops out at 55 inches. The Insignia also tends to be a little cheaper at least when looking at normal non-event sales prices.

What is Amazon Fire TV?

So what exactly is Amazon Fire TV? It's Amazon's answer to streaming platforms like Roku built around Amazon's Alexa and Amazon-owned services like Prime Video IMDB TV Twitch while also supporting third-party apps like Netflix Hulu Disney+ and many many more.

It's the same software used on other Fire TV devices like those seen in our Amazon Fire TV Stick review or Amazon Fire TV Cube review  two of the best streaming devices you can get. Fire TV Edition smart TVs put this Amazon-powered software into a smart TV instead of a separate streaming device. The result is a pretty decent set of smart TV features packed into some of the most affordable 4K TVs on the market.

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Design

Whether it's the Insignia F30 model or the Toshiba C350 both are inexpensive TVs that use basic plastic construction. Affordable TVs aren't known for their sleek stylings or premium materials and most cheap TVs have the same generic looking black plastic construction.

However the Toshiba C350 adds a stylish touch to the otherwise basic design accenting the basic black chassis with a strip of silver plastic along the bottom of the panel and silver plastic feet. Boomerang-shaped feet also give the Toshiba a more stylish look that the Insignia but that may not matter to most shoppers.

Both models work with standard VESA mounting brackets – the Insignia works with a 200 x 200 millimeter mount and the Toshiba uses a 200 x 300 millimeter pattern – so either will work with the products on our best TV mounts list.

When it comes to port selection the Toshiba again has a slight edge offering 4 HDMI ports to the Insignia's 3 ports. Both TVs offer USB ports coaxial connections for antenna and cable and composite video inputs. Both include an HDMI ARC connection for connecting a soundbar but neither one has the newer HDMI 2.1 connection (or required feature support) you might want to get the most out of a new game console.

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Display

Both the Insignia and Toshiba Fire TV models work under the same basic philosophy: Good enough. It's not an uncommon approach to cheaper TVs but if you're expecting something impressive just because it bears the Amazon name you'll be a bit disappointed.

The Insignia suffers from limited color reproduction producing just 96.68% of the Rec 709 color spectrum and offering a Delta-E score of 2.7 indicating decent color accuracy. The Toshiba wasn't much better producing 95.0% of the color spectrum but surprising us with a 1.7 Delta-E rating meaning that it has noticeably better accuracy than the Insignia.

In terms of test results that's sort of a wash. Both are accurate enough that you won't be constantly irritated by bad color but the limited gamut on both will leave the resulting picture still feeling a bit lackluster.

The Insignia was plagued with motion blurring until we turned off all the video processing that comes enabled by default and even then it still had bad viewing angles – moving too far from the center of the screen introduced some unwanted color shifting. The Toshiba also had noticeable issues with limited viewing angles and inconsistent backlighting.

And without local dimming some content just looked flat on the basic TVs. The Toshiba C350 boasts support for Dolby Vision (the Insignia does not) but neither Fire TV really offers the sort of contrast or backlight control that are needed for effective HDR performance.

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Gaming

One area where we saw some unexpected performance differences between the two Fire TV brands was in gaming. With 60Hz panels and only nominal HDR support neither one is going to deliver superb picture quality but both are ideally priced as an inexpensive 4K gaming TV. (Check out the best 4K gaming TVs for more.)

The Insignia failed to impress us for gaming with a decidedly slow 36.4 milliseconds of lag time in our lab tests. The Toshiba C350 on the other hand impressed us with it's low lag time of just 10.7 milliseconds easily clearing the 20-millisecond cut off that we have for acceptable gaming performance.

If you want an inexpensive 4K TV for enjoying your game console the Toshiba C350 is actually a great choice and it's one of the few that won't cost more than a new PS5 or Xbox Series X .

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Audio

If there's one area that consistently disappoints on budget-friendly TVs it's audio. Getting great sound from the narrow confines of a TV chassis is a sophisticated and expensive process and TV manufacturers generally reserve better audio for more premium TVs. That certainly is the case with the two Fire TVs we're comparing here.

The Toshiba C350 has 7- and 8-watt speakers (7 watts on the 43-inch model and 8 watts on to 50 and 55-inch sets). The Insignia F30 models offer only slightly better with a similarly weak set of 10-watt speakers.

Instead of multichannel sound both Fire TVs offer basic two-channel stereo – you can get better audio with one of the best soundbars. And that's actually what we recommend. Both TVs offer good enough picture quality but the sound is lackluster enough that even an inexpensive soundbar will offer better sound.

Toshiba Fire TV vs Insignia Fire TV: Which one wins?

When you get right down to it the Toshiba C350 Fire TV may be the better of the two Amazon-powered smart TVs. It has a more stylish design better port selection and better performance for both shows and gaming.

But don't write off the Insignia Fire TVs either. With lower prices larger screen size options and fairly similar performance (outside of gaming) Best Buy's store brand is also a great Fire TV.

But the real conclusion here is that you should definitely consider a Fire TV – of either brand – whenever you want to find a decent 4K TV with solid smart features and an affordable price. These budget-friendly smart TVs may not lead the pack in performance or premium features but they deliver a solid modern TV experience for much less than most of the big names. And when a big sale strikes and you're unsure of whether to get a discounted Fire TV you know you'll be pretty satisfied with either model.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdmV1ci5jb20vc2hvcC9iZXN0LWNhdmlhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Caviars to Order Directly to Your House in 2022,"The first taste of caviar for Bonnie Morales chef and owner of Portland's renowned Kachka and its sibling restaurants was not from a mother-of-pearl spoon or presented tableside. It was served to her at home as a child spread on buttered white toast by her Belarusian immigrant parents. ""It's so nutrient dense much like chicken eggs but even more so and full of really healthy fats"" she explains. ""So as a result it's often considered to be a food for children."" And before you ask she’s not trying to convince anyone to go broke feeding tins of fish eggs to toddlers. It’s instead about showing how normalized the salty snack is among Russians. ""Anytime you want to show hospitality there is caviar on the table"" she says.

Americans tend to put caviar on a pedestal because of its cost and Morales notes that when she started serving it at Kachka people weren’t enjoying the wonderful texture and intense flavors as intended due to that reverence. And that's a shame laments Morales. ""You're kind of cheating yourself when you're worried about every little bead.""

Writer Seung Hee Lee like Morales prefers a casual approach to caviar. Lee trained in royal Korean court cuisine before moving to the United States where she translated her traditional cooking with local ingredients and tools in her book Everyday Korean. While she calls herself a caviar purist in some sense—she likes to drink champagne with hers and first tasted it in fine-dining settings—she fell in love with it when she realized ""if we just eat it at home it's cheaper.""

Restaurant servings don't add much more than presentation and it costs significantly more in that context. Instead have one tin (or a few) in your price range delivered at home and give yourself the space to really enjoy it. Lee rejects the idea that caviar should be eaten in certain ways or with specific foods and encourages anyone to just dig in and experiment. ""Whatever needs crushed sea salt"" she says ""you can put caviar on it."" But if you're looking to figure out exactly which kind you should put where we've put together a list of our six favorites.

Features to Keep in Mind

Types of Caviar

There's a reason caviar tends to be pricey: Sturgeon are huge animals with long lifespans and it can take years or even decades for them to mature to the point that they lay eggs. The processing phase is similarly drawn out; the roe must be harvested and washed sieved and then salted and packaged. And while caviar is traditionally made from the roe of Caspian sturgeon certain types of that fish—particularly the massive Beluga—are critically endangered. Overfishing has threatened the continued health of the species and so the term “caviar” is now more broadly applied to salted and preserved eggs from related fish farmed elsewhere around the world.

The finest-quality caviar is said to come from fish caught or raised in the coldest of waters from late fall to early spring but purveyor Alexandre Petrossian—who sources the roe for his family’s eponymous shop from China Bulgaria Israel Uruguay Madagascar and the United States—believes that there’s much to be gained from a global approach. “Every territory has brought something new to our understanding of caviar” he explains. “One day we might return to farming in the Caspian Sea but the circumstances would have to be much different than they are today.”

The “big three” sturgeon varieties are the traditional Caspian types—Sevruga Osetra and Beluga—which sustainable caviar producers strive to replicate.

Sevruga the smallest and most plentiful of the species weigh between 50 and 75 pounds are about three feet long and mature in seven years producing small gray subtly flavored creamy eggs.

Osetra the second largest sturgeon weigh 150 to 300 pounds grow four to six feet long mature in 12 to 15 years and produce medium-size gray-brown to nearly golden peppery eggs. One fish in 100 will deliver large dark gold eggs—the pricey imperial osetra.

Beluga the largest and rarest of the species can weigh up to 3000 pounds grow to 12 feet in length and live for up to 50 years. Beluga eggs are unavailable in the U.S. though some farms have created hybrid Beluga breeds in order to approximate the breed's coveted large gray eggs which have a very delicate skin and clear flavor. Since Beluga imports are banned and Sevruga are pretty hard to come by Osetra is the most commonly seen of these.

But there are many more types of caviar you're likely to see—and eat—more of in the U.S. these days.

Siberian these smallish approximately 150-pound sturgeon tend to mature early meaning they produce a lot of eggs and fish making them ideal for aquaculture. The small dark glossy eggs are among the most affordable types of caviar and the smaller softer beads carry strong flavors of the sea.

Kaluga the giant freshwater sturgeon is nearly extinct in the wild but the farmed version produces caviar with excellent texture. The firm mid-sized bead ranges in color but nearly always has the coveted ""pop"" along with complex briny and buttery flavors.

White California's native species is now farmed around the U.S. and represents much of the domestic caviar scene. The creamy eggs are small delicate and on the dark side and have a bold flavor that stays consistent throughout the bite.

Farmed vs. Wild Caviar

The reality is that you are unlikely to find wild caviar. Though there are people who still covet the traditional version the long lifespan of sturgeon and declining populations makes it an unsustainable or unaffordable option for anyone involved diner or producer. An interesting thing about this notes Morales is that it has led sturgeon farmers to breed for what they think customers want to see—features like bigger eggs lighter colors and taut beads—but that doesn't necessarily result in the best taste.

Pressed and Pasteurized Caviar

While the caviars here are all cured fresh other styles are available. Pressed caviar takes the broken and burst eggs and (naturally) presses it into a kind of jammy spread. Pasteurized caviar treats the eggs with a bit of heat making them shelf stable but they lose a little of the vaunted ""pop"" texture and fresh flavor.

Our Top Picks

Eye-catching complex and buttery this sustainably-farmed caviar from the Netherlands delivers on all the best parts of eating caviar. The strikingly large green-gold and light black beads pop satisfyingly in the mouth giving way to a silky well-structured texture that unleashes a rich brininess on the tongue. Packaged without preservatives or additives it maintains the desired complexity and evolution of flavors without hitting the upper echelon of caviar prices.

Best Value: Browne Trading Company Osietra Supreme

Paying more for caviar won't always deliver a better product and paying less doesn't automatically mean you'll like it less which means that you can find great caviar for under $100 per ounce. While there are caviar options for the strict budget like hackleback and cheaper Siberian sturgeon options this Osietra Supreme walks the line between high-end taste and reasonable price. Farmed in Poland the firm medium-sized beads carry a pleasant minerality and muted saltiness.

Best for First Timers: Pearl Street Caviar Ossetra Keluga Duo

Aside from producing these two excellent reasonably-priced caviars Pearl Street deserves special mention for taking sustainability seriously even through shipping. Tins arrive in soft packaging insulated with wool as a compostable alternative to styrofoam and chilled by biodegradable ice packs.

On top of that their prices are reasonable by the ounce—$77 for the Ossetra and $100 for the Keluga both of which held their own in tastings against similar styles. Pearl Street offers both in 12-gram serving sizes ($31 and $44 respectively) giving newbies a chance to try it before shelling out the big bucks. Even better their Pearl Duo buys both of those for just $72 plus fancy accessories: a tin opener mother-of-pearl spoon in a little pouch and a snack pack which includes their surprisingly good crème fraîche potato chips and chives. It has basically everything you need for a little private caviar tasting.

Best Classic: Browne Trading Company Beluga Hybrid

With Beluga imports banned many sturgeon farmers and caviar producers aim to get as close as they can to the coveted wild flavor of its eggs. This Beluga-Siberian hybrid farmed in Italy shows off the big pearls for which Beluga is known but with the dark inkiness of Siberian. Its beads taste of deep umami flavor that evolves into a caramel finish complemented by that signature texture and complexity.

Best American: Island Creek Oysters Osetra

Island Creek famous for its oysters also puts the same rigorous seafood sourcing standards into its caviar and particularly its North Carolina osetra. While imported caviars can use sodium tetraborate to help with preservation it’s not permitted in U.S. food production. Morales sees this as a plus as it tends to round out the edges and sweeten caviar leading to blandness. ""If it tastes like nothing and it smells like nothing"" she says ""It's probably because it's hiding something.""

Island Creek's osetra stands out for its small firm texture big brininess and roller coaster of flavors in every bite—just the thing that sodium tetraborate can hinder. It's a rollicking caviar with good pop that shows off sea saltiness without overwhelming its subtler almost fruity notes.

Best White Sturgeon: Tsar Nicoulai Select

Another standout American caviar from one of Morales' favorite producers Tsar Nicoulai has been sustainably farming white sturgeon not far from its natural habitat in California for almost four decades. The Select shows off medium beads with a gentle pop and miso-like complexity which comes through prominently thanks to low saltiness or ""malossol"" meaning little salt. This light hand preserves the eggs themselves and their natural flavor.

Ask the Experts

How should I store caviar?

As cold as possible in the refrigerator says Morales. She recommends avoiding the door which can be warmer. Lee suggests putting an ice pack in a Pyrex or similar container then putting the caviar on top to keep it very cold. Before you break into them most jars or tins will last a few months. But once they’re opened quality will start to decline so have plans to eat it pretty quickly.

What’s the best way to serve caviar?

Morales often sees people in scarcity mode eating just a few beads at a time but she recommends making sure to have enough for a full mouthful and to try eating it straight off the back of your hand. This helps warm the caviar to just the right temperature and allows you to really taste it on its own. At Kachka's happy hour she serves it spread on challah with butter which she prefers to the traditional crème fraîche topping since the acid of the latter cuts rather than enhances the richness.

Lee likes a traditional approach with blini and crème fraîche or on oysters but also puts it in chawanmushi on scallion pancakes or even in a tortilla smeared with cream cheese. ""The highbrow-lowbrow combo is where my heart is at"" she says.

Morales also adds that it's less about what you serve it with and more about how. People focus on crushed ice she says and it's one of her pet peeves. The cold dulls the taste so she recommends pulling it out a few minutes before eating and letting it come to room temperature. Check out SAVEUR's full guide to serving caviar here.

Which drinks should I serve with caviar?

As noted above Lee always drinks champagne with hers particularly leaning toward blends or an option with high acid which she likes to balance the saltiness. Her suggestions include the Pol Roger Sir Winston Churchill Krug and bottles from Frederic Savart. She also recommends super-cold premium Korean soju which is similar to one of Morales' choice drinks for caviar sake. But Morales's favorite is vodka. ""It's super neutral and cleansing so it helps you really taste the caviar.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsdS1yYXkuY29tL21vdmllcy9IYXJyeS1Qb3R0ZXItYW5kLXRoZS1Tb3JjZXJlcnMtU3RvbmUtNEstQmx1LXJheS8yOTM5MTUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 4K Blu-ray (Best Buy Exclusive SteelBook),"Best Buy Exclusive SteelBook / Magical Movie Mode / 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 4K Blu-ray Review

Celebrate the 20th anniversary with a stunning 4K steelbook.

Reviewed by Neil Lumbard August 28 2021

Arriving on 4K UHD in a new 20th anniversary collectors edition Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a must-see family classic with enchanting magic that cast a spell on moviegoers across the globe. Return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and set out on an adventure with the heroes at the heart of the story: Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). The magic begins!

With Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) spellbinding magic is around every corner. Based on the beloved novel by J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a classic fantasy and adventure: the origin of one of cinema's most beloved film franchises. Fun for the entire family.

The film astonishes with exceptional production design efforts by Stuart Craig (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) that sweep one in to the magic wizarding world. The sets decorated by Stephenie McMillan (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) are beautiful and detailed; providing great production aesthetics at every turn of the story. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone also features exceptional costumes by Judianna Makovsky (Avengers: Endgame The Hunger Games) which give each character a sense of ""wizardry"" style.

There is something wondrous about the enchanting cinematography by John Seale (Cold Mountain The English Patient) and the way the filmmaking pulls viewers into the world of magic with total ease. The filmmaking casts an enchanting spell. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is full of outstanding visuals and the storytelling is all the more immersive as a result.



A magical edition for Harry Potter fans.

One of the greatest elements of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the music by John Williams ( Star Wars Raiders of the Lost Ark). The score is one of Williams's best efforts and the music has a majestic quality that is undeniable. The epic themes soar and provide audiences with a thrilling and unforgettable journey.

The screenplay by Steve Kloves (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Wonder Boys) adapts the beloved novel by J.K. Rowling elegantly (and without leaving too-much on the cutting-room floor). Unlike some of the later entries in the franchise Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone adapts the book without sacrificing any key elements of the source-novel. Fans of the book series will appreciate how faithful the adaptation is.

Chris Columbus (Home Alone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) provided Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone with the magic necessary to become an endearing Hollywood classic. Roger Ebert compared this fantastic introduction to the franchise to "" The Wizard of Oz"" and there is no doubt this is a fair and appreciable comparison: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most enchanting films ever made. Twenty years later and it's still as magical as it was on opening day."

CPT derivatives have been repeatedly suggested as a good source of repurposed drugs for the treatment of a variety of infectious diseases caused by protozoan parasites [1 13 46]. With the alarming decrease in effectiveness of first-line drugs in areas where L. infantum is endemic repurposed drugs could represent a faster solution at lower cost [47]. However the predisposition of Leishmania to develop drug resistance should be addressed when repurposing a drug [1 25 27]. In this study we used a combination of stepwise drug resistance selection whole-genome sequencing and theoretical approaches to explore the propensity of and potential mechanisms deployed by three independent clones of L. infantum to resist the activity of the TOP1B inhibitor TPT. One of the major strengths of this approach is that both the parent cell line and three directly derived drug-resistant lines are studied together and thus any confounding factor derived from strain-related heterogeneity is excluded from the analysis [23 48].

Firstly we demonstrated that L. infantum is able to become resistant to high concentrations of TPT. While the mechanisms involved in TPT resistance have not been fully elucidated in tumor cells several studies have shown the implication of different drug transporters such as multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1/MRP1) or the ABCG2 transporter [49 50]. Likewise Leishmania parasites rely on the amplification of ABC transporter MRPA (ABCC) and inactivation of the aquaglyceroporin 1 (AQP1) gene to counter the action of antimonial drugs [21 23 51]. As gene expression in Leishmania is regulated predominantly by gene dosage [20 21] we proceeded to search for large-scale copy number variations (deletions and duplications) in chromosomes of the three selected clones for comparison with the unselected parental line. In the past different ABCG and ABCC efflux-pump gene clusters were identified in L. infantum as part of chromosomes 6 23 and 31 [52]. In addition overexpression (with no changes in gene dosage) of the ABCG6 transporter is known to be involved in CPT resistance in Leishmania parasites [53]. Of note none of these regions was found amplified in any of the three TPT-resistant clones in our whole-genome comparative analysis.

The absence of significant amplifications coupled with the very unusual fact that no prominent changes in ploidy were observed for any of the studied clones [54] led us to suspect the potential implication of SNPs and small nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels) in the TPT-resistant phenotypes. Several SNPs have been shown to contribute to drug resistance (e.g. miltefosine antimonial drugs etc.) in Leishmania parasites by altering the activity of specific transporters or modifying different detoxification pathways [22 23 29 55 56]. Here we focused on SNPs and indels present in the three TPT-resistant clones and at the same time occurring in the same ORF but at different positions. Among the eight genes fulfilling these criteria we identified the ORF coding for the large subunit of the DNA topoisomerase IB which is the main target of CPT derivatives once bound to the DNA during cell replication [10 11]. Clones TPT700.1 and TPT700.3 displayed homozygous mutations in the top1B gene while the SNP identified in TPT700.2 was heterozygous. Although previously observed in diploid Leishmania parasites homozygous mutations are rare because of their “nonreversible” nature. The homozygous mutations in clones TPT700.1 and TPT700.3 may have originated from loss of heterozygosity a well-described phenomenon in Leishmania [57 58]. Importantly these results reinforce previous works demonstrating the possibility that although rare Leishmania can generate SNPs associated with drug resistance without the need for alteration of its genomic architecture and gene expression [59].

Due to the impossibility of generating a null mutant our preferred method for studying the role of mutated variants of top1B consisted of episomal transfection of the mutated forms into a WT strain [23]. Since these transfected parasites still carry the top1BWT allele the mutated overexpressed forms of the protein are in competition with the WT large subunit in their binding to the small subunit (in order to make up the functional heterodimer). As such we were able to only partly recreate the highly resistant phenotype observed in the TPT700 mutants. However the relative strength of each mutation followed the same drug resistance trend in both the original mutants (TPT700.1 > TPT700.3 > TPT700.2) and the episomal transfectants (top1BF187Y > top1BW232R > top1BG191A).

To better understand the potential contribution of these three SNPs to TPT resistance in the mutants we performed several MD simulations. All three residues identified in the TPT700 mutants (F187 G191 and W232) were conserved between the human and parasitic enzyme and can be structurally aligned (Fig. 4). They were located in proximity of the TPT binding site in close proximity to residues found to be crucial in the human enzyme for the interaction and stabilization of TPT with residues R364 and N722 once intercalated between DNA bases [60] corresponding to leishmanial residues R190 and N221. Thus we can hypothesize that a change in one of the residues of this cluster may influence the arrangement of the TPT binding site. Although these residues are in proximity of the catalytic pentad [11 14 61] the mutations identified in this study are likely affecting the ability of binding of TPT to the DNA-TOP1B complex without altering the global catalytic function of the enzyme. Since TPT hinders DNA rotation within the covalent complex a reduced binding of this drug would result in a faster religation step. Indeed it has been very well established that a malfunction of cleavage/religation reactions will be reflected through altered protein drug sensitivity [11 60]. Of note two of the three SNPs identified in the TPT700 mutants (F187Y and G191A) were located within the conserved region corresponding to amino acids 361–365 in the hTOP1B enzyme. These results confirm the findings of Rubin et al. showing that a substitution of residue F361 can induce high levels of resistance against a CPT derivate (e.g. 9-nitro-20(S)camptothecin) in human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells [62]. Likewise Li et al. showed that certain substitutions in the 361–364 region affect DNA cleavage/ligation by the enzyme as well as contribute to resistance against CPT since they may be included in the CPT-binding domain [63]. These results suggest that these mutations are able to modify the architecture of the binding site decreasing the persistence of TPT in the binding pocket as well indicate that CPT and TPT may share binding sites in the LiTOP1B–DNA complex.

Furthermore in the covalent complexes K352 and R410 demonstrate a changed profile of interaction in all three TPT700 mutants. In particular the hydrogen bond between K352 and D353 is lost. This interaction is crucial for the correct position of K352 (known to be a key player in the religation reaction) and when incorrectly positioned affects the religation rate and thus TPT sensitivity [15 64]. Moreover D353 is itself involved in the network of residues and TPT interaction. As such the lack of the K352-D353 hydrogen bond and side chains orientation may be a main cause for rearrangement of the TPT binding site and lowered stabilization of the drug in the binding pocket further explaining the observed resistance.

Importantly the three TPT700 mutants became resistant to TPT without impairing their ability to proliferate in vitro. The process of becoming drug-resistant can lead to different evolutionary disadvantages (“fitness cost”) such as reduced survival [65]. However this concept remains controversial in Leishmania and is highly dependent on the parasite’s genetic and environmental context [48]. Likewise drug-resistant cancer cell lines exhibit different fitness–cost profiles including subpopulations with increased fitness when compared to their sensitive counterparts [66]. The absence of fitness cost in vitro in the TPT700 mutants could be due in part to the fact that these cells do not use ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps to resist treatment (e.g. MRPA in antimony resistance) for which they would have to divert energy away from proliferation towards running of the pumps. Moreover the absence of a cost in terms of growth would also explain why the TPT700 mutants did not return to sensitivity once the TPT was withdrawn. Mutants of this type have the potential to become a major risk for the spread of drug resistance into an environment devoid of antileishmanial drugs. However at this point whether this phenomenon would be stable in vivo or in the vector remains to be evaluated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Full Stack St. Paul was launched in 2017 to advance the work of the city’s Innovation Cabinet which developed a five-page action plan around “people places and promotion.” The goal at the time was to recruit techies entrepreneurs and other new talent prep real estate to better accommodate innovative new businesses and market the city as a potential startup hub.

“Right about the time that the steering committee turned its sights to ‘what’s next’ the COVID-19 pandemic started so the committee took a pause in 2020” said Shannon Watson vice president of public affairs for the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce a key partner. “But now they’re back.”

The Full Stack steering committee recently added new members including Srinivas Somayajula a vice president of Global Technology Partnerships with Ecolab who will co-chair the committee alongside Chamber President B. Kyle St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and St. Paul City Council Member Chris Tolbert.

There’s also a new and refreshed website fullstacksaintpaul.com and “a renewed focus on leveraging the power of tech and innovation to drive equitable resilient economic development in St. Paul” Watson said. “The good thing about COVID-19 is that it really amplified the importance of technology it forced a lot of innovative thinking and the tech and innovation scene in St. Paul is coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever.”

That innovation didn’t just spring from tech companies. Diane Rucker executive director of University Enterprise Labs (UELMN.org) a life-science and health care business incubator on Westgate Drive pointed to the example of how restaurants pivoted to curb-side delivery during the pandemic. “One restaurant included a toilet paper roll with every delivery or an add-on mask if you wanted one” she said. “Hyacinth St. Paul limited their menu. They chose a single-meal concept you could purchase and they limited the number of those. They not only created an artificial demand but it was ‘hurry up and get your order in while you can.’ ”

“If you looked at the groups that have thrived in the last year and a half they said we’re going to look at our traditional business plan and we’re going to go sideways” Rucker added. “Every business has had to revisit what they do who they do it for and how they do it. That’s created some really cool innovations we hadn’t expected.”

Additional new members of the Full Stack committee include Paul Campbell co-founder of Brown Venture Group; Ling Becker executive director of Ramsey County Workforce Solutions; Phil Haan a St. Paul-based business consultant and retired Delta Air Lines executive; Stephanie Hammes a senior vice president of innovation with U.S. Bank; Caroline Karanja chief executive officer of Hack the Gap and 26 Letters; Jeff Aguy founder of 2043 and NCXT and Angela Casselton executive director of the Creative Enterprise Zone.

NEW REAL ESTATE FOR INNOVATION

Back in 2017 the Full Stack committee set the ambitious goal of attracting 2000 tech-related jobs to the city by the year 2020. It also aimed to hit refresh on St. Paul’s real estate offerings by increasing co-working desks and other “innovation-related” commercial space by 200000 square feet. To connect entrepreneurs socially and professionally Full Stack envisioned hosting or promoting 50 innovation-focused events annually throughout the city. A fourth goal focused on highlighting the city’s innovators every year through 2020.

But the events of the past year all but emptied out downtown and put some of that energy on pause yet a three-page Innovation Cabinet report indicates that each of the four goals has been achieved.

Tolbert the St. Paul council member recalled a Full Stack meeting that was scheduled to be held shortly after business lockdowns were ordered statewide in early 2020. Rather than cancel the meeting participants pivoted.

“We did a bricks and mortar program helping people in the tech community connect to people in the restaurant community especially early on in the pandemic when their services went online” he said. “It was all on a volunteer-basis.”

Tolbert added “The need for tech investment and innovation investment in this community is even bigger now as we try to navigate the changing business landscape.”

“We’ve made some really good progress” said Michael Webster a second vice president of digital technology and customer experience with Securian Financial. He pointed to a partnership between Securian Allianz Insurance and Gener8tor to create the “OnRamp Insurance Accelerator” a leg-up for startups and innovators related to the insurance industry. “It’s anybody who thinks they have a great idea to help improve the customer experience and run our businesses.”

Last September Bio-Techne opened a $50 million 60000-square-foot facility on Empire Drive where lab-grown recombinant proteins or GMP proteins are produced for sale to manufacturers and life-science companies conducting clinical trials.

Last October the U.S. Department of Defense announced it would allocate $87.5 million to launch BioMADE a non-medical bio-industrial manufacturing institute housed at the University of Minnesota College of Biological Science’s Cargill Building in St. Paul. The initiative includes new lab space that is expected to break ground on the St. Paul campus this year.

Also in recent years the Osborn370 building on Wabasha Street the former Ecolab headquarters downtown has become something of a startup hub for new tech and media businesses. Best Buy opened a teen tech center inside the St. Paul offices of the social services agency CLUES on East Seventh Street and in downtown at Fourth and Cedar streets. The Coven — a co-working space that caters to women trans and non-binary clients — opened on Western Avenue.

Securian has dedicated space within a floor of its downtown headquarters as a “prototype of a workplace of the future” said Webster with collaboration rooms pods and reservation-only private areas.

Near the St. Paul border with Minneapolis University Enterprise Labs added 19000 square feet in 2019 bringing its total size to 144000 square feet. It’s home to some 45 startup ventures many of them lab-based business spin-offs that grew out of University of Minnesota faculty research. “It’s completely full” Rucker said. “If we had more space we’d have more startups that we could work with.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Blame Medicare.,"In the endless struggle to rein in high drug prices one glaring failure has been grabbing the headlines: the exorbitant cost of drugs that need to be administered by physicians.

Such drugs were once a rarity. But they are now more than one-fifth of all Medicare drug spending and growing rapidly thanks in part to the biotechnology revolution which has yielded an array of drugs that must be injected infused or inhaled.

One of them an Alzheimer’s drug called Aduhelm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June and is being priced by its maker Biogen at $56000 annually. That’s roughly equivalent to the cost of 45 hours of home health care for an Alzheimer’s patient each week for an entire year.

The F.D.A.’s approval of Aduhelm has come under close scrutiny and protest. The agency has already reversed itself narrowing the drug’s suggested use to those with early symptoms of dementia as opposed to everyone with Alzheimer’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L2Jpb2RlZ3JhZGFibGUtYmFncy1lbmQtbGFuZGZpbGwtZmFjaWxpdGllcy1sYWNrLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktcmVjeWNsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biodegradable bags end up in landfill as facilities lack technology to recycle them,"“The biodegradable standard is designed for 90 per cent reduction after a three-months period. Our process is around 40 days in the digester” Ms Lister said. “But they’re also devoid of oxygen and compostable packing will rely on sunlight and oxygen to get full degradation.”

BioGen would like to see a change in legislation to enable it to send compostable packaging on to industrial composting facilities where it would be able to breakdown fully.

“Compostable plastics weren’t designed with anaerobic digesters in mind” she added.

Some councils will also refuse to take any compostable packaging other than food waste liners because the end-destination is not well equipped to take it leaving it to go to landfill.

Despite issues over its suitability in UK waste streams compostable packaging is popular among companies keen to be seen to tackle the problem of single-use plastic with 84 per cent of consumers preferring it to traditional plastic according to a recent study by University College London.

Wrap the packaging charity advocates for compostable use only in specific cases such as fruit and veg stickers and ready meal packets when it is difficult to separate from food.

BioGen says it does find allowing compostable packing for caddy liners as well as items such as espresso pods encourages households to properly process their food waste rather than send it to landfill a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

But although it only accounts for a fraction of packaging currently experts within the waste industry fear it could become a significant contaminant as it becomes more popular.

‘Too much packaging could produce poor compost’

Paul Jackson director of the National Resource Consortium said even in composting facilities too much packaging could produce poor compost because of its low nutrient content.

“Effectively all we’ve done is create a new form of single-use waste because it doesn’t add anything to the compost product” he said. “At least plastic can be recycled into something new.”

Jacob Hayler the executive director of the Environmental Services Agency said compostable packaging caused confusion among households.

“So-called compostable packaging materials are not widely targeted collected or processed as part of normal council waste services in the UK because many of these types of packaging don’t perform as advertised when treated in real-world conditions at industrial composting facilities” he said.

“In most cases packaging and other objects are screened out before householders’ garden and food waste is sent for composting anyway and are then typically treated as general rubbish.”

He added: “To make matters worse compostable packaging confuses consumers who often mistake them for normal plastic and subsequently try to recycle them with other plastics – causing contamination issues that can undermine genuine recycling.

“Any introduction of compostable or biodegradable packaging to the market needs to be very carefully considered in the context of the UK’s waste management infrastructure which at present is largely not able to put these materials to good use.”",,,,,,,,,

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top securities regulator pledged on Monday to crack down on mismanaged private funds and weed out fake ones as the government becomes more assertive in dealing with an industry worth 60 trillion yuan ($9.28 trillion).

China has been seeking to channel more household savings into the capital markets to fund innovation and aid its economic recovery while reducing the economy's reliance on bank lending.

Fund managers should align their interests more closely with investors and refrain from hyping their products Yi Huiman chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.

""China is actively promoting high-quality growth of its capital markets and healthy development of the 60 trillion yuan fund industry is a crucial part of it"" Yi told a meeting held by the Asset Management Association of China.

Chinese mutual fund managers also face rising competition from global asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity International after regulators scrapped foreign ownership in the sector on April 1 2020.

By July-end the country's mutual fund industry stood at 23.5 trillion yuan 1.6 times the size at 2016-end Yi said.

The private securities fund sector doubled to 5.5 trillion yuan and its private equity and venture capital industry tripled to 12.6 trillion yuan during the period.

Despite a recent cleanup of China's private fund industry there're still many small and weak players hampering the high-quality growth of the sector Yi said adding that the regulators will publish new rules in due course.

Some private-fund managers even raise money publicly and misappropriate clients' funds he added.

Yi urged fund managers to prioritize clients' needs and interest as ""it happens from time to time that funds make money but investors don't"".

He asked money managers to address the issue of fund churning in which fund salespeople seeking higher commissions encourage investors to redeem existing funds and subscribe to just-launched ones resulting in massive fund flows.

SP asked for clarification after it became known that squatters lived in one of the apartments on the Sint Willibourdusstraat in the Amsterdam neighborhood De Pijp.

“Given the housing shortage in Amsterdam the council finds it socially unacceptable to leave houses vacant for an extended time” Alderman for Housing Rutger Groot Wassink wrote in response to the SP’s questions. “It is a duty to use the apartments for what they are meant for which is living.”

Round 1: Pearse Hat-Trick Helps Munster To Bag Big Belfast Win

With Vodafone’s sponsorship boost and TG4’s historic live TV coverage this was an ideal shop window for the provinces’ emerging talents and fringe internationals to shine – particularly in the absence of their Ireland stars.

Offaly native Claffey took her chance to cross in each half her 67th-minute close range effort putting Leinster ahead for the only time in a game that this young Connacht side had the winning of.

The hosts led for most of an absorbing first half flanker Meadbh Scally squeezing over in the seventh minute and influential centre Shannon Touhey combining with captain Mary Healy for try number two.

However despite a slow start new-look Leinster got back level at 12-all. Jennie Finlay scored in the corner taking advantage of Healy’s yellow card and a classy 40-metre run-in from player-of-the-match Claffey came just before half-time.

The Ireland-capped Claffey and Jenny Murphy who now operates in the back row played key roles as Leinster edged a scrappy second half.

Claffey’s leg-pumping run was the highlight before her decisive try as the reigning champions ensured a winning start for new head coach Phil de Barra.

It was new Connacht boss Ross Mannion who was much the happier early on. Claffey did really well to deny Nicole Carroll a try with a thunderous tackle before the home pack carried hard to break the deadlock.

Picking from a close-in seventh-minute ruck Scally powered through a small gap for Nicole Fowley to comfortably convert the home crowd responding to their team’s fast start.

Nonetheless Connacht scrum half and skipper Healy saw yellow towards the end of the opening quarter for coming in off her feet when the ball was not out of a Leinster ruck.

Mannion’s charges defended tigerishly holding up Ali Coleman in the 22nd minute after the visitors had won successive penalties in the 22.

Yet straight from the resulting drop-out Grace Miller’s clever pass put Murphy into space and she had Finlay on her outside to finish off an opportunist attack out wide.

Murphy’s missed conversion left it 7-5 and Connacht picked their moment to move the gap back out to seven points.

The returning Healy used Fiona Scally’s well-won 33rd-minute lineout ball to send Touhey sweeping inside Aine Donnelly’s attempted tackle for an unconverted score.

The strong Connacht centre increased her influence soon after with a big tackle on Meabh O’Brien to earn turnover ball. Again though Leinster were able to show their quality just at the right time.

Using a strong hand-off Claffey accelerated clean through from Connacht’s 10-metre line and rounded full-back Carroll for a cracking individual try converted by Murphy.

Defences were on top in a tight third quarter Fowley finding a very good touch with a well-placed kick before Caoimhe Molloy was quickly in at the breakdown to win a Leinster penalty.

Murphy inspired the visitors with some terrific counter-rucking while her opposite number Kate Feehan made the hard yards for Connacht once they got back inside the Leinster 22.

Poorer off for territory it took another slashing break by Claffey to reignite the Leinster attack past the hour mark.

Lively replacement Ella Roberts followed up and was stopped short but Claffey managed to bounce off a couple of defenders to claim a deserved second try.

The versatile Murphy could not add the extras from the left but the unconverted score proved to be a match winner.

Leinster came closest to scoring again late on eager winger Miller threatening from a Murphy kick but Connacht’s Orla Dixon was first to the ball.

Forced labor – almost always a component of slavery – could be a more integral part of our foods’ supply chain than many of us realize.

“Sustainability research on the food supply typically focuses on promoting human health and protecting the environment. But social sustainability provides a different perspective on our food sources including issues of labor rights and equity. Globally agriculture has one of the highest incidences of forced labor” said study lead author Nichole Tichenor Blackstone of Tufts University.

Sourcing data from both governments and non-profits Blackstone and her co-authors looked at where 93 different fruits and vegetables were sourced from and cross-referenced this data with what different countries’ labor laws looked like.

“What we’ve done for the first time is to look at all of the major fruits and vegetables consumed in the U.S. as well as all of the countries these foods come from including the U.S. and assess the possibility that somewhere in the production process forced labor could have been involved” explained Blackstone.

In the end 85 percent of food-country combinations had a high risk of incorporating forced labor somewhere in the supply chain. Seven percent scored as having a very high risk. To those of us accustomed to only considering our foods’ environmental impact this is quite a staggering percentage.

“There are major structural issues with how agricultural labor is set up that make workers vulnerable” said Blackstone. “To us this reflects systemic issues in food supply chains that have not been addressed. Our findings point to the need for policymakers farmers and food companies to engage with farm workers to address the systemic issues.”

According to the International Labor Organization forced labor refers to work that is performed involuntarily and under the menace of any penalty. “It refers to situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation or by more subtle means such as manipulated debt retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.”

“Forced labor in agriculture is a threat to the sustainability of food systems” wrote the study authors. “However the scarcity of data noted limits holistic analysis and action.”

“Future research should prioritize data and model development to enable analyses of forced labor and other labor-related social risks (e.g. wages child labor) across the life cycles of a wide range of foods. These efforts can help ensure that the rights and dignity of ‘the hands that feed us’ are centered in the transformation of food systems.”

The study is published in the journal Nature Food.

Best Flat Top Griddle Grill: Buyer’s Guide

Marketers can get you excited about owning a certain product but before you fork out your hard-earned cash here are several considerations you must make.

Cooking Surface

Consider how many mouths you need to feed when choosing a cooking surface. If you want to feed 100 famished souls at a go you need no less than 900 sq. inches of cooking surface.

But if it’s just a small party you will be safe with 500 sq. inches. A 300 sq. inch flat grill is perfect for a mid-sized family. Put in mind that larger is always better than smaller.

Portability

If you are the adventurous type a highly portable flat top grill will definitely come in handy. Consider grills with foldable legs and side handles for easy transporting.

A unit with caster wheels allows easy maneuverability so you can grill from the backyard at the pool or any other outdoor space.

Some flat top grills allow you to remove the legs and transform your griddle into a tabletop griddle. Others allow you to remove the griddle and carry it to camping or tailgating so that you can enjoy other types of foods not just grilled food.

Surface Material

It goes without saying that a non-stick cooking surface with excellent heat retention is the best pick. But a cast-iron flat top cooking surface or a cold-rolled stainless steel griddle top will still get the job done.

There are cheaper options such as aluminum or regular steel. But only buy these if they have a heat-resistant coating to guarantee excellent service for a decent period.

Here is the bottom line only choose a griddle top that is rust and corrosion-resistant. It will last longer and allow easy cleaning.

Grilling Accessories

Obviously you will love the convenience that accessories such as side tables and thermometers bring to the table.

We are talking about having the foldable side table as a prep area for your grilling ingredients and a thermometer helping you keep an eye on the internal heat levels as the food cooks.

Don’t forget the hanging racks for your cooking tools such as tongs spatulas and towels to clean any mess on side tables.

Also consider a griddle grill with a lid as it helps maintain constant temperatures within the grill especially when cooking outdoors in windy conditions.

Type of Fuel

What do you prefer natural gas or propane? Both of these burn at the same temperature but propane is more efficient than natural gas.

If your pockets allow pick up an electric flat top grill and enjoy better heat distribution and in some cases faster cooking time.

Is It Pre-Seasoned?

A seasoned grill gives better-tasting food and also keeps rust and damage at bay. If it comes pre-seasoned from the manufacturer the better. As you shop for a flat top grill find out if it is pre-seasoned so that you can plan on doing it yourself if it is not.

Seasoning the grill is simple; just apply some cooking oil on the cooking top and bake it in high temperatures for half an hour.

Griddle Top Grill: Conclusion

There you have it folks. Now you can cook those runny foods such as pancakes and eggs with ease. And no you do not have to replace your trusty grill; just get a portable griddle top that sits on the grill grates and cook your heart out.

Ultimately the choice of a good flat top grill and griddle depends on you. But give a chance to any of the options reviewed here; cooking on any one of them will be worth your time.

In the remaining four months of this year an aircraft could be approved that could one day pose a threat to Airbus and Boeing.

And that comes as no surprise to Tobias Grosche a professor at the University of Worms and an expert in flight planning and passenger demand forecasts.

“The fact that the first ‘COMAC’ aircraft is about to receive national approval is only the logical step in the efforts of the Chinese government also in the aviation sector towards the wester to unlock countries ” Grosche told the Business Insider in a special report.

COMAC is the abbreviation for an amalgamation of Chinese companies that is likely to be viewed critically in Hamburg Toulouse and Seattle.

It stands for Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and brings together design and research centers universities and aluminum and steel manufacturers.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install.

For comparison: the Airbus A320 flies for Lufthansa with space for up to 168 passengers the Boeing 737 has space for around 150 passengers i.e. similar sizes. The two types of aircraft are also similar in terms of range the report said.

Depending on the version the Airbus A320 can travel up to 5700 kilometers the Chinese counterpart C919 promises a range of up to 5555 kilometers.

This means that the Chinese aircraft could for example reach all national destinations from Shanghai in eastern China — and get even further.

The major elements of the C919 such as the nose fuselage outer wing vertical stabilizer horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC. Credit: COMAC.

Beijing has made no secret of its desire to break the western giants’ duopoly helping smooth the C919’s development with up to US$72 billion in state-related support according to estimates from US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

According to Simple Flying the Shanghai Aircraft Airworthiness Certification Center of CAAC (SAACC) signed and issued the first Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) for the C919 program.

This means that the plane has officially entered into “authority certification” flight testing.

However natural icing trials which were set to take place in March 2021 have had to be postponed until fall.

While the aircraft is expected to be approved and will start scheduled service with OTT Airlines a subsidiary of the largest airline in Asia China Eastern Airlines it is doubtful that this first-generation C919 will challenge the world’s aircraft manufacturers Business Insider reported.

Not yet anyway.

Says Grosche: “A second or third generation could be dangerous for Airbus and Boeing.

“Ultimately it’s an economic question. If a Chinese model is efficient and safe I see no reason why western airlines should not also operate these aircraft.”

After all Lufthansa for example not only has Airbus and Boeing aircraft in its fleet but also models from its subsidiary Cityline the former Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and the Brazilian Embraer.

Furthermore Grosche is certain that COMAC will one day be able to offer the C919 for sale at comparatively cheap prices.

Even Guillaume Faury Airbus chief executive has acknowledged COMAC’s rise telling an industry event “we will probably go from a duopoly to a triopoly at least on the single aisle by the end of the decade.”

Overall a total of 815 orders have been placed by 28 customers. China Eastern’s Big Three counterparts – China Southern and Air China will also deploy the C919 along with other powerhouses such as Joy Air and Hainan Airlines.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install. Credit: COMAC.

There has also been some international interest.

The head of the low-cost airline Ryanair Michael O’Leary announced ten years ago that he wanted to support alternatives to Boeing and Airbus and signed a non-binding letter of intent with COMAC the report said.

And while Boeing and Airbus have the advantage of having been on the road around the world for decades China which historically plays the long game is looking much further into the future.

The type CR929 is supposed to compete with long-haul airliners like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787.

And the type CR929-600 could have a range of up to 12000 kilometers and space for up to 280 passengers.

What are Boeing and and Airbus up against? The C919 will be state-of-the-art both inside and out along with some refreshing updates.

While the major elements of the airplane such as the nose fuselage outer wing vertical stabilizer horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC the company has enlisted Western expertise notably that of French high-tech industrial group and aero-engine manufacturer Safran which is producing the aircraft’s cabin and nacelles CNN Travel reported.

The C919’s LEAP-1C engines are being produced by CFM a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran. Subsidiary Safran Cabin says it will supply the lavatories galleys and cockpit doors for the C919.

The company told CNN that “the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft.”

That will be welcome news for passengers forced to do contortions in modern airplane toilet compartments.

More spacious lavatories would mean it would be possible to move around with less contact with surfaces and it could also make cleaning and maintenance a less onerous task for the crew that scramble on board between flights to disinfect the toilets — a boon in the Covid era.

The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized galley with ample space for the flight crew to work.

Safran says it “recognizes that many of its airline partners based in China will fly these aircraft on short routes within China which makes meal service a challenge.”

To address the compressed flight times on domestic routes Safran says its cabin designers have come up with an “ergonomic galley design with large work surfaces equipped with easy-to-maneuver “Hybrite S trolleys” which help the crew get meals snacks and drinks out to passengers quickly.

Spacious galleys are also likely to be a selling point worldwide as airlines work towards complying with new inflight catering guidelines set out by the Airline Catering Association.

As for environmental concerns Safran says it “has made advancements in its composite structures which enable interiors to be both lightweight and durable helping to reduce carbon footprint while withstanding the rigors of short-haul service.”

The aircraft’s engines are also claimed to be more efficient.

The CFM LEAP-1C engine which was selected by COMAC as the sole Western engine option for the C919 offers “a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines and up to a 50% margin on NOx emissions” says Safran.

The engines will also mitigate noise in and around the airports where the C919 operates.

The C919’s cockpit is being developed by the Chinese Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute (CARERI) and will feature integrated 15.4-inch avionic Display Head Assembly units coming from Barco Display Systems of Atlanta Ga.

The airline seems to be quite optimistic about this route — in June American increased frequencies in the market to daily year-round and now the airline has upgraded the plane on the route from a 777-200ER to a 777-300ER at least for the first several months of service.

American Airlines’ New York to Delhi service

As of October 31 2021 American Airlines will launch a new daily year-round route between New York (JFK) and Delhi (DEL). This 7318-mile flight will operate with the following schedule:

AA292 New York to Delhi departing 8:10PM arriving 7:30PM (+1 day)

AA293 Delhi to New York departing 11:55PM arriving 6:30AM (+1 day)

The flight is blocked at 13hr50min eastbound and 16hr5min westbound. With the latest equipment upgrade:

The flight will be operated by a Boeing 777-300ER between October 31 2021 and March 26 2022

The flight will be operated by a Boeing 777-200ER as of March 27 2022

Since late March coincides with the start of the summer schedule it’s possible that the airline just hasn’t updated the schedule yet and I wouldn’t be surprised to see the larger aircraft stick around depending on how things play out

American Airlines’ Boeing 777 premium economy

Implications of American flying the 777-300ER to India

It’s interesting to see American Airlines schedule the Boeing 777-300ER on the Delhi route as this is the carrier’s flagship aircraft and the only long haul aircraft to feature first class. For context here’s how the configurations of the planes compare:

The 777-300ER has 304 seats including eight first class seats 52 business class seats 28 premium economy seats and 216 economy seats

The 777-200ER has 273 seats including 37 business class seats 24 premium economy seats and 212 economy seats

American Airlines’ 777-300ER business class

As you can see the 777-300ER has 31 more seats overall and that’s almost entirely premium seats including an incremental eight first class seats 15 business class seats and four premium economy seats.

It remains to be seen whether premium demand to Delhi is actually that strong with forward bookings or if American simply doesn’t have anywhere better to fly these planes. American certainly has some excess 777-300ERs between Hong Kong being mostly closed and London not being anywhere close to recovered.

American has otherwise been flying 777-300ERs largely between Los Angeles and Miami so it seems like the opportunity cost of flying the plane to Delhi probably isn’t that high especially if cargo demand will be strong. While I understand that this is historically when seasonal demand is strongest for India at the moment the United States has a travel ban against India so I wonder whether the airline is banking on that being lifted or just being optimistic.

Unfortunately at the moment I’m not seeing much saver level award availability in first and business class on this route though I’m keeping an eye on it as I’m sure that will change eventually. Meanwhile I do see quite a bit of upgrade availability whether to first or business class.

American Airlines will offer first class to India

How India expansion fits into American’s route network

American’s New York to Delhi route is being added thanks to the American and JetBlue strategic alliance in the Northeast. With this we’re seeing American expand into new long haul markets while JetBlue provides much of the regional feed for these flights.

American and JetBlue have a new strategic alliance

This is the fifth new long haul route that American has announced out of New York in the past several months in addition to:

A seasonal New York to Athens flight

A year-round New York to Rio de Janeiro flight

A year-round New York to Santiago flight

A year-round New York to Tel Aviv flight

American Airlines’ new long haul routes out of New York

Bigger picture when it comes to American Airlines’ India service:

American plans to launch a Seattle to Bangalore flight as of early November 2021 as part of its partnership with Alaska Airlines though personally I wouldn’t take it as a sure bet that this launches with the current schedule

This flight from New York will be American’s first flight to Delhi since the airline cut its Chicago to Delhi route in 2012

Looking at the overall New York to India market:

Air India operates to both Delhi and Mumbai

United operates to both Delhi and Mumbai

Delta launched a New York to Mumbai route in 2019 though it has since been suspended and it’s anyone’s guess if/when it will be restored

United Airlines is strong between Newark and India

By the way it’s pretty funny to me that American claims to have “the fastest growing network from the United States to India.” This comes as American goes from zero to two routes. So yes I suppose the growth rate is so high here that it can’t even be calculated though the claim does seem quite disingenuous.

Bottom line

American Airlines will launch a new route between New York and Delhi made possible thanks to the new partnership between American and JetBlue. The airline had already increased frequencies in this market to daily and is now also upgrading the flight to a 777-300ER for the first several months of service.

We’re seeing American add significant long haul service out of the New York area which sure is cool to see. In particular I’m excited about American’s expansion to both India and Israel both of which were markets where the airline didn’t previously have a presence.

I’m still not sure whether American’s strategy of relying so heavily on Alaska and JetBlue for its international network is a smart one but I guess we’ll find out over time.

What do you make of American Airlines’ new route to Delhi?

To examine the significance of the RE-ACCESS Study (the first time coronary access has been systematically evaluated before and after TAVI) and future aortic valve selection Boston Scientific recently held an online webinar chaired by Rafael Cavalcante Vice President (Medical Affairs) at the company to include interventional cardiologist Professor Ole de Backer who has been involved in several transcatheter valve therapy research projects and Dr Marco Barbanti author of 200-plus publications in the field of transcatheter aortic and mitral valve interventions. Their discussion examined the implications of patients living longer post-TAVI; why it is necessary to look beyond the procedure and to consider future treatment options; and why the current implant procedure/technique needs to change to facilitate re-access to the coronary arteries.

If left untreated aortic stenosis takes a severe course but only in recent years have transcatheter heart valves (THV) offered a less invasive option to the surgical therapies developed in the 1960s. Comparing outcomes between surgery and TAVI Cavalcante said: ‘There has been an evolution of treatment in terms of physician experience and of technologies which have led to a significant reduction in rates of paravalvular regurgitation to the extent that it is very comparable to what is obtained with open heart surgery.’",,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk for International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding was increased 40% with edoxaban (9.7 vs 7.0 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 1.40) which failed to achieve noninferiority (P = .93). The difference was driven by more gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with edoxaban (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.28 - 3.22) including one fatal event.

Both the primary composite efficacy endpoint of net adverse clinical events (NACE) and major bleeding however were lower in the 46.4% of patients whose daily dose of edoxaban was reduced from 60 mg to 30 mg.

""Subanalyses to further explore this finding suggest that patients fulfilling dose adjustment criteria and patients without concomitant oral antiplatelet therapy may be reasonable appropriate candidates for edoxaban based on attenuating bleeding effects and we will be conducting further investigations on this topic"" senior author George Dangas MD PhD Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York City concluded.

The results were reported today in a Hot Line session at the virtual European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2021 and published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dangas pointed out that edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism and cut bleeding risks in a general population of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial which did not include patients undergoing TAVI. However results are less clear with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients undergoing TAVI where roughly a third of patients have AF or develop it after the procedure.

In the recent ATLANTIS trial apixaban (Eliquis Pfizer/Bristol-Myers Squibb) was not superior to standard care for a composite clinical outcome but did not increase bleeding whereas the GALILEO trial was stopped prematurely because of a higher rate of death thromboembolic events and serious bleeding with rivaroxaban (Xarelto Bayer/Janssen).

Study discussant and ATLANTIS investigator Jean-Philippe Collet MD PhD Sorbonne Université Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital Paris France said ENVISAGE-TAVI AF is the only positive NOAC trial demonstrating noninferiority against vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) but that the increased risk for bleeding limits patient eligibility.

""The transition of NOACs to practice is tricky because whether NOACs are all the same after TAVI seems unlikely. NOAC safety depends on concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy and dosing"" he concluded. ""Whether it is time to update the guidelines is unsure.""

During the panel discussion Collet said patient characteristics were very different in ATLANTIS and that they warned investigators not to continue triple therapy because of the fear of bleeding mainly based on the GALILEO results which ""probably explains why we have such a difference in terms of combination with antiplatelet therapy.""

Alec Vahanian MD University Paris-Descartes France one of the chairs of the newly updated European valvular heart disease guideline pointed out that in the wake of ATLANTIS ""people are doing what they feel is good for the time being and many are not bridging to another anticoagulant after TAVI that is to say restarting a NOAC. But as you know when you write a guideline you love evidence.""

He agreed with Dangas and the panel that ""many questions have to be answered before we move to a guideline recommendation… Maybe if you pool your data you'll be able to answer in a better way this difficult question. So let's see in a couple of years.""

An Elderly AF Population With an OAC Indication

ENVISAGE-TAVI AF enrolled 1426 patients with AF and an indication for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) after successful TAVI in the previous 5 days at 173 centers. Patients were randomly assigned to 60 mg/day of edoxaban or standard VKA management along with discretionary dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 3 months after TAVI or single antiplatelet therapy indefinitely. Outside the United States edoxaban dosing could be reduced if patients had renal failure or low body weight or were taking concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

The population was elderly (average age 82 years) nearly half were female more than 80% had congestive heart failure and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score was 4.9.

After a median follow-up of 548 days the rate of NACE — a composite of all-cause death myocardial infarction ischemic stroke systemic embolism valve thrombosis or major bleeding — was 17.3 per 100 person-years in the edoxaban group and 16.5 per 100 person-years with warfarin (HR 1.05; P = .01 for noninferiority).

Superiority testing of edoxaban for efficacy was not conducted because noninferiority and superiority were not met for major bleeding.

There were no differences between the edoxaban and VKA groups for all-cause death or ischemic stroke. No valve thrombosis was reported in either group.

Panelist Renato Lopes MD Duke University Medical Center Durham North Carolina said meta-analyses have shown a 58% increase in GI bleeding with NOACs over warfarin likely because NOACs are metabolized to the GI tract rather than the liver. ""So finding a 40% increase in GI bleeding was somewhat expected"" in the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF cohort.

Although there are known pharmacologic differences between the NOACs including mechanism of action and renal excretion in general as an anticoagulant these agents are more similar than different noted Lopes. That said it's very important for clinicians to find what he's been calling the ""antithrombotic sweet spot.""

""That means that for every patient including the procedure the patient underwent it's important to find the right dose the right combination of agents for the right duration that can give us the greatest reduction in ischemic events at a minimal cost of bleeding which we know is never going to be zero"" Lopes said. And ""this trial adds to the value of evidence with high quality of evidence to better inform what this sweet spot might be.""

Session chair Stephan Windecker MD Bern University Hospital Inselspital Bern Switzerland remarked that ""it seems just like in the PCI [percutaneous coronary intervention] field less is more and one important component seems to be antiplatelet therapy.""

The study sponsor Daiichi Sankyo contributed to the trial design conduct and oversight; data analysis; and manuscript writing. Dangas reported research contracts with Daiichi Sankyo and Bayer. Coauthor disclosures are listed in the paper.

We also learned about seven tryout players that would be participating in the minicamp hoping for a chance to make the 90-man roster heading into training camp.

As we noted earlier there were reports of nine undrafted free agents signing in Cleveland shortly after the NFL draft but only seven were announced Friday morning. WR Ahmarean Brown and OL Jalen Sundell are the two who were not announced as signing.

Brown had even spoken to The OBR about his excitement to play for the Browns:

“To learn from those [receivers] is special” Brown told TheOBR. “Amari Cooper is obviously one of the best route runners who’s been in the league for quite a while and has been Mr. Consistent. Jerry Jeudy we’ve seen even at Alabama the routes that he can run and the way he gets separation is amazing. Just to learn from those guys man I can’t wait.”

Early Friday afternoon Brown was also added as an undrafted signee by the team:

Baking it on a sheet pan eliminates the need to stand at the stove pan-frying slices in batches. And while the oven is on it’s easy to throw in a pan of bacon as well.

When you hear the name Jack Daniel whiskey probably comes to mind.

But what about the name Nathan “Uncle Nearest” Green?

In 2016 The New York Times published a story about the distiller’s “hidden ingredient” – “help from a slave.” In the article the brand officially acknowledged that an enslaved man Nearest Green taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey. Since then scholars researchers and journalists have descended upon Lynchburg Tennessee hoping to learn more about a man who until then had appeared as a mere appendage in the story of the country’s most popular whiskey brand.

As a scholar of tourism whose research involves highlighting marginalized populations and counternarratives I followed these developments with keen interest.

In the fall of 2020 my critical sustainable tourism students created a short documentary Uncovering Nearest. I wanted my students to learn more about Green since so many voices and faces of enslaved Africans and Black Americans have been silenced or erased from American history textbooks and heritage tourism sites.

Black culinary innovation

Popular media through shows like Netflix’s “High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America” have finally started to acknowledge the ways in which Black Americans have contributed to some of America’s most iconic dishes and spirits.

For example James Hemings Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved chef traveled with Jefferson in 1784 to France where he trained in French cooking at the highest culinary level. He ended up being instrumental in introducing legendary dishes like macaroni and cheese ice cream and French fries to the United States.

James Hemings eventually trained his younger brother Peter to take his place. In the fall of 1813 Peter Hemings learned brewing and it’s likely that he became the the first Black person in America to be professionally trained as a craft beer brewer.

Neither James nor Peter Hemings was a hobby chef or leisure brewer; this was their forced way of life. And the enslaved people who crafted new dishes didn’t set out to change American cuisine. They simply needed to make do with what little they had.

Enslaved cooks were responsible for introducing ingredients and the know-how of such complex and labor-intensive dishes as oyster stew gumbo jambalaya and fried fish. However their voices names and creations were routinely left out of cookbooks where their white owners received the credit and the acclaim.

Nearest’s legacy unveiled

Now one name – Nearest Green – has become synonymous with whiskey.

The New York Times article from 2016 inspired author and entrepreneur Fawn Weaver to set out on a quest to reveal Nearest Green’s full story – what ended up as a 12-month research project involving more than 20 historians archivists archaeologists conservators and genealogists.

Thanks to her work a fuller picture of Green’s legacy has emerged.

Around the mid-1800s Green’s enslavers were a firm known as Landis & Green who “leant out” Nearest Green for a fee to local preacher the Rev. Dan Call. This was typical in an era in which enslaved men were commonly involved in the making of spirits due to its reputation as dangerous dirty work.

Nearest was known as a skilled distiller who specialized in a process known as sugar maple charcoal filtering – also called the Lincoln County Process. This method – which some historians believe was inspired by the techniques of enslaved men and women who had used charcoal to filter their water and purify their foods in West Africa – gave Green’s whiskey a unique smoothness.

Years later Jack Daniel a 7-year-old white orphan was sent to the Call farm to be a chore boy. Eventually he became Green’s apprentice and was taught the Lincoln County Process which differentiates bourbon from Tennessee whiskey – making Nearest responsible for the Tennessee whiskey we know today. As Victoria Eady-Butler Green’s descendant and former employee of Jack Daniel’s Distillery noted that there would “never have been Jack Daniel’s made without a Green on the property.”

After emancipation Call sold his distillery to Jack Daniel. Daniel appointed Nearest Green by then a free man to be the Jack Daniel Distillery’s first master distiller and thus the first Black master distiller on record in the United States. Weaver discovered that sometime after 1881 Daniel moved his distillery to its current Cave Spring Hollow location where several of Green’s children and grandchildren went to work for him.

Statue of Jack Daniel in front of Cave

Nearest’s second-born and fourth-born sons George and Eli distilled whiskey on the Call Farm alongside Jack Daniel. Although no images of Nearest Green exist a photograph shows one of his sons George sitting next to Jack Daniel.

Altogether seven generations of Nearest Green’s family have worked for the Jack Daniel Distillery and continue to work there to this day.

A whiskey brand of their own

Jack Daniel and his descendants made a lot of money from their whiskey company over the years. In 1956 the family sold it to Brown-Forman for US$20 million dollars – about $190 million in today’s money.

While Nearest Green and his descendants do appear to have been paid fairly by the Daniel family they didn’t own any of the distillery – and consequently didn’t get any of those millions.

For decades Nearest Green’s name legacy and contribution to whiskey were largely unknown to anyone outside Lynchburg Tennessee – even though after the Civil War according to census data Nearest Green and his family owned sizable plots of land and were wealthier than many white families living in Lynchburg.

Weaver was able to meet Green’s descendants during her research and asked them how they would like to see him honored. They told her that “putting his name on a bottle letting people know what he did would be great.”

This gave Weaver the idea to start her own whiskey company that honored Green’s legacy. By 2019 she had raised $40 million from investors to create Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey. Later that year she opened the Nearest Green Distillery in Shelbyville. Weaver now serves as CEO of the company with Victoria Eady-Butler a descendant of Green’s employed as the distillery’s master blender.

Unearthing and celebrating stories like Green’s is part of a push by scholars and travel companies to expand marketing and storytelling in ways that include overlooked or silenced perspectives.

In 2020 Nomadness Travel Tribe partnered with Tourism RESET where I serve as a co-director and research fellow to publish a report that included both qualitative in-depth interviews and a quantitative survey of more than 5000 tourists to better understand the travel experiences of Black people and other people of color.

Meanwhile the Black Travel Alliance also in partnership with Tourism RESET recently launched a new timeline and website History Of Black Travel which seeks to educate the public on “how the African diaspora traveled to every part of the Earth.”

Ideally these efforts will create spaces for dialogue around difficult topics like race and enslavement while authentically honoring and amplifying the voices and legacies of Black Americans who helped to build the United States.

And hopefully more stories of people like Nearest Green – an accomplished Black man with a rich nuanced life – will emerge.

Within a few years we had the answer. Native American tribes audaciously expanded bingo parlors into some casino-like games and machines daring authorities to crack down and used the proceeds of their expanded — and perhaps illegal — activities to finance a political drive that locked in their monopoly.

Tribal leaders outhustled their rivals including Nevada casinos horse racing tracks and poker parlors and California is now dotted with dozens of their casinos some of them elaborate resorts that rake in many billions of dollars each year.

History may soon repeat itself. Sports betting is coming to California but once again the question is who will control and benefit from it. California’s casino-owning tribes are moving quickly to grab a monopoly and once again they face well-heeled rivals.

A 2018 Supreme Court decision opened the door to legal sports betting by voiding a federal law that prohibited it. Ever since state after state — 32 so far — has legalized it and even the titans of professional sports who once disdained betting on their games are cashing in.

As this year’s professional football season begins the National Football League is allowing gambling companies to advertise during its games telling the Wall Street Journal “it made sense for us to really introduce sports betting in a thoughtful way into our national footprint.”

The NFL also selected Caesars Entertainment DraftKings and FanDuel Group as partners who will pay many millions of dollars for the right to display NFL content on their betting sites.

So what about California?

Bills to legalize sports betting in the nation’s largest and richest market have kicked around the Legislature for several years but lawmakers have been unable to agree on a system that would please all of the contending gambling interests.

With deadlock in the Capitol casino-owning tribes decided to grab control via a ballot initiative that’s already qualified for the 2022 ballot.

If approved the measure would authorize betting on professional and collegiate sports at tribal-owned sites and four horse racing tracks — the latter an obvious gesture to a one-time rival to reduce potential opposition.

The measure also sanctions roulette and craps in tribal casinos and pointedly requires sports bets to be placed in person at the designated sites thereby closing off on-line wagering until and unless the tribes want it.

The state’s poker parlors are opposing the measure not only because it would create new competition for gamblers’ dollars but because it contains language that would subject them to increased state regulation.

It’s a David vs. Goliath situation because the tribes can throw almost unlimited funds into a campaign for the measure — in fact they already have 10 times as much in their campaign treasury.

However several cities that have poker parlors have filed a rival initiative that would also would authorize sports betting in Indian casinos and at racetracks but expand legalization to poker parlors professional sports teams themselves and — most importantly — on-line betting operations.

The latter provision virtually invites the big on-line wagering corporations to pour millions of dollars into qualifying and passing the new measure and perhaps into opposing the tribal initiative. Whichever measure garners the most votes would prevail if their provisions conflict.

The stakes in this political showdown are immeasurably large — many billions of dollars in revenue. Will the tribes once again outfox the opposition or be compelled to share the bounty with their rivals? Or will a legislative compromise cancel the expensive ballot measure duel?

The C&I crew offers condolences and warm wishes to the family friends and many fans of Ed Asner the award-winning actor who passed away Sunday at age 91 in Los Angeles.

Asner collected a total of five Emmy Awards for playing the gruff but principled news editor Lou Grant in two different series the 1970-77 sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show and the 1977-82 drama Lou Grant. He also earned Emmys for his outstanding performances in the groundbreaking miniseries Rich Man Poor Man (1976) and Roots (1977).

Like many actors of his generation Asner often appeared in episodes of classic TV westerns including Outlaws The Virginian Gunsmoke A Man Called Shenandoah Iron Horse and The Wild Wild West. On the big screen he memorably co-starred opposite John Wayne in Howard Hawks’ El Dorado as Bart Jason a rapacious land-grabber whose offer of employment is rejected by The Duke

Often praised as an indefatigable professional Asner continued to appear in film and television productions and work as a voice actor for animated projects until earlier this year. In 2009 he delighted audiences by voicing the lead role of Carl Frederickson an adventurous elderly widower in the Oscar-winning Up. More recently he guest starred in Modern Family Blue Bloods and three episodes of Cobra Kai.

Q'SHAUNDRA JAMES

13 Action News ran into James at Park West Gallery and she was able to give us some insight into her work.

The picture of the little girl holding a ""Sailor Moon"" wand is her second cousin Skyler.

""I love painting children"" she said.

Q’shaundra James/Park West Gallery Q’shaundra James

""The inspiration [for her work] is about a misconception of the limitations of what it is to be Black. My work focuses on W. E. B. Du Bois and his metaphor the 'veil'"" James explained.

""Each piece has a veil prominent in the back.""

Q’shaundra James/Park West Gallery Q’shaundra James

""W. E. B. Du Bois describes the veil as being a piece of cloth that distorts a Black person's image from the outside but also their image when looking into a mirror.""

Q’shaundra James/Park West Gallery Q’shaundra James

""So in my piece"" she continued ""I make sure to show double consciousness by removing the veil and having them have the ability to see past America's prescribed history or narrative when it comes to Black plight in America.""

James also has work hanging at Las Vegas City Hall downtown.

View the current offers here.

As discussed in previous articles I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member. Most of my flights this year have been on Delta or its SkyTeam partners and various promotions like the 2020 Medallion Qualifying Mile (MQM) rollover Status Accelerator and bonus MQM earning on Delta cobranded credit cards helped me earn Platinum by the beginning of July.

Now with just over four months left in 2021 I am planning to go for top-tier Diamond status. In theory I am close to the status now and can reach the MQM and MQD requirements so long as I plan my future travel accordingly. I think the extra effort is worth it for Choice Benefits and higher upgrade priority — something that may be useful after Delta's most recent round of status extensions.

Here I'll show you my current progress toward Delta Diamond and discuss how I plan to close the MQM and MQD gap. I'll also discuss why I think it's worth going out of my way to earn Diamond even when Platinum is a great airline elite status to hold.

Why I'm earning Delta Diamond status

I've long been a fan of Delta Air Lines — its NYC route network is great it has a solid on-time performance and its in-flight product is good. Moving up to Delta's top-tier status would give me more benefits on my frequent flights with Delta including the ability to select Choice Benefits.

Delta Diamond members get to select three Choice Benefits every year they requalify for benefits. When I qualify I plan to select these benefits:

Delta Sky Club Credit Card Guest Access: Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card.

Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card. 4 Global Upgrade Certificates: These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights.

These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights. 25000 SkyMiles: This is worth $275 per TPG's most recent valuation but I can likely get more value when redeeming for expensive last-minute flights.

Effective 2/1/25 Reserve Card Members will receive 10 Visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of Visits each year starting on 2/1/25 the total eligible purchases on the Card must equal $75000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24 and each calendar year thereafter.

Depending on how (and how often) I use these benefits they have the potential to be worth thousands of dollars. I plan to use the Global Upgrade Certificates on long-haul 2022 travel to Europe and Asia on routes with Delta One Suites business class. Further the Sky Club guest access will be great for when I travel with friends and family.

Additionally higher upgrade priority will come in handy next year. Delta extended elite status for all existing elites through 2022 and will roll over all 2021 MQM to 2022. This means there will be a ton of Delta elites and upgrades will be more competitive than in past years. Having top priority for upgrades will be extremely useful.

Closing the gap for Delta Diamond status

I'll leverage partner flights to quickly earn MQD. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As of writing this article I am sitting on a stash of 99576 Medallion Qualifying Miles and $4950 Medallion Qualifying Dollars. This puts me roughly 25500 MQM and $10000 MQD away from earning Delta Diamond. I have plans to meet this threshold without breaking the bank on two upcoming international trips and a handful of domestic trips.

Let's take a closer look at my plans.

Upcoming Delta domestic trips

As of writing this article I have a four trips planned with Delta. Here's a quick breakdown of each trip and how many MQM and MQD I'll earn for each trip. Note that I am factoring in the Status Accelerator promotion for each ticket.

LGA-ORD-LGA economy — 2200 MQM $232 MQD

JFK-SLC-JFK economy — 5968 MQM $420 MQD

LGA-MIA-LGA economy — 3274 MQM $206 MQD

LGA-ORD first class — 1283 MQM $367 MQD

This means that I will earn 12725 MQM and $1225 MQD from already booked travel. This brings me to 112301 MQM and $6175 MQD meaning I still need to account for 12699 MQM and $8825 MQD by the end of the year. There's a chance some of this will be taken care of with work travel and other domestic trips but I've made a plan to make up at least 90% of both requirements.

Leveraging partner trips for more MQD

So that I don't need to spend $5000+ on Delta first class tickets (with the 75% bonus) I've devised a plan to earn MQM and MQD quickly with partner flights. SkyTeam and non-alliance partner flights earn MQM and MQD based on a percentage of miles flown which means that you can stock up on MQD at a discount if you find inexpensive partner flights in premium cabins.

I started exploring different partner options and found a way to earn the bulk of the miles by booking a trip to Europe. It would be a non-traditional routing however as the flights take me through Los Angeles and Mexico. I'd start by booking this Delta round-trip ticket between New York-JFK and Los Angeles (LAX) it would earn 7426 MQM and $360 MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

From there I'd continue on to Madrid (MAD) via Mexico City (MEX) with Aeromexico for $1827.15 round-trip in business class. This fare earns 150% MQM and 40% MQD and the trip is 14390 miles round-trip. This earns 21585 MQM and $5756 MQD. Together with the LAX round-trip and my existing year-end balance I'll have a total of 133886 MQM and $12291 MQD.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

Then I would take my usual year-end trip from New York-JFK to Prague (PRG) on this Air France premium economy ticket. It costs $994 but earns 150% MQM and 30% MQD. The itinerary is 8332 miles round-trip so it earns $12498 MQM and $2500 MQD. This brings my MQD count to $14791.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

I can make up for the remaining $209 MQD by booking my flight home to Chicago for the holidays with Delta. I would earn $320 MQD by booking this round-trip ticket from New York to Chicago and would have myself well over the qualification threshold.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

This means I would spend a total of $3363 for roughly $8936 MQD which would give me Diamond status through 2022. I need to take the trips to Prague and Chicago anyway and the trip to Madrid would let me visit a new city and visit friends in Los Angeles along the way. Plus I can book some of it with flight credits and cover some expenses by redeeming Capital One points at a fixed value toward these flights.

Bottom line

Qualifying for Delta Diamond Medallion elite status isn't easy but you can get there quicker and less expensively when you leverage partner flights. Consider doing something similar to close the gap on your Delta elite status this year. Also remember that you can earn up to 75% bonus MQM and MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion and that award tickets earn MQM and MQD through 2022.

Frederick Jackson 19 is one of two people facing capital murder charges in connection with the shooting death of Everett Briscoe.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- One of two men accused of killing an off-duty New Orleans police detective will remain in jail after a judge denied bond on several felony charges.

Frederick Jackson 19 is accused of capital murder and attempted capital murder in connection with the shooting death of Everett Briscoe at a Galleria-area restaurant. Another man Dyrin ""DJ"" Riculfy was critically wounded and remains in a hospital.

Jackson and Anthony Jenkins 21 are both charged in connection with the case. Jackson's bond was set at $2 million on the attempted capital murder charge but the denial of bonds in relation to other charges including capital murder will keep him in custody.

""I'll be setting the bond for this case at $2 million"" the judge said during the hearing. ""I'm not approving a personal bond for the concerns and safety of the community for the safety of the complainant the surviving complainant their relatives and family members and any surviving witnesses.""

According to Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg Jackson was already out of jail in connection to an aggravated robbery from 2020 in which he allegedly followed someone home from the Galleria area. His bond was forfeited earlier this year. Earlier this month Jackson failed to appear for a court hearing which in its wake led to the discovery that his ankle monitor was cut off.

Last week Briscoe and Riculfy were shot at the Grotto restaurant Saturday as their group was robbed.

While police withheld specific details on how they determined Jenkins and Jackson to be suspects they stated research on the motive and the vehicle as well as a number of Crime Stoppers tips led investigators to them.

Jenkins was arrested at an apartment complex in southwest Houston where investigators seized a Nissan Altima that matched the description of the vehicle that had fled the shooting.

Jackson was arrested on Thursday taken into custody by a SWAT team.

During a news conference on Friday to announce the arrests Ogg hinted at seeking the death penalty in the case due to the capital murder charge.

""It should surprise no one at this point in Harris County Texas that both individuals were already out on bond"" Ogg said.

Police further stated the two men are also connected to other robberies in the area specifically targeting people for high-end jewelry. All indications from Briscoe's killing showed the shooting stemmed from a robbery gone bad police said.

Ogg speculated that the pair committed the robbery attempt in order to raise bail money for a friend.

An investigation continues despite the arrests with an additional person of interest being sought.

Earlier this week police announced the reward in catching the suspects in the case went up to $100000.

Police were not confirming a payout to the six-figure amount. Crime Stoppers have often stated tips can be submitted anonymously.

Da Gama established Portugal as a colonial power and changed the previous dependence Europe had on trade by overland routes. He was advised by Jewish scholars and financed by Jewish businessmen. He also followed maps and instruments made by Jewish manufacturers. Jewish physicians were on his ships.

While in India Vasco da Gama captured a Polish Jew forcibly baptized him and named him Gaspar da Gama. Gaspar became not only the pilot of Vasco’s fleet in Indian waters but also served the Portuguese king as a linguist on other naval expeditions. Gaspar accompanied explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral on the mission on which Brazil was “discovered” and accompanied Nicolau Coelho the first European to step ashore in Brazil.

For hundreds of years Portugal with the country’s shoreline facing the Atlantic Ocean has had a long tradition of seafaring fishermen and traders. All of which goes to prove that when one thinks of Portugal and Lisbon its capital one thinks of the sea and weather-beaten faces of fishermen hauling in the day’s catch. Indeed when you walk in Lisbon you’re sauntering about in two neighborhoods the one you’re in and the sea. Whoever has visited here knows that the fragrance of the city is salt and sea. I remember going down to docks on the water and partaking in seafood in fish restaurants.

While Lisbon may not have the panache of London Paris or Rome it is a good respite from the whirlwind movements of those three capitals. Lisbon calms the peripatetic traveler like me and yet there is a lot to do in this city including sampling Portugal’s wealth of port wines.

Thinking of this bustling port city I recall the famous author Erich Maria Remarque’s comment from his novel The Night in Lisbon in which he wrote “By day Lisbon has a naïve theatrical quality that enchants and captivates but by night it is a fairy-tale city descending over lighted terraces by the sea.”

Lisbon does not lack entertainment. There is flamenco dancing which started in neighboring Spain but is extremely popular in Portugal. On two different nights I took a train to nearby Cascais and Estoril and spend several evenings in clubs and cafes where I enjoyed the art form of flamenco and listened as well to fado songs that reflect feelings born from the sea and which often include the melancholia on the faces of the café goers.

In the Afalma section there are two historic landmarks: the St. George’s Castle and the 12th-century Se Cathedral. The castle which dates from the sixth century on was fortified by the Romans Visigoths and Moors and once served as the royal palace. Climb the towers for a breath-taking view. Se Cathedral is an important religious building in the early history of Lisbon. Containing massive solid towers the church resembles a fortress rather than a religious center.

Walking in the central square Rossio in the downtown district known for its towering statue of King Pedro IV who history buffs can note reigned briefly over Portugal and was the first ruler of the Empire of Brazil.

I DISCOVERED that Plaza Rossio or Placal Ido Rossio is actually the name of the Pedro IV Square. It has been one of the city’s main squares since the Middle Ages. Popular revolts and celebrations bullfights and executions have been held here. In Rossio Square stood the Palace of Estaos which housed the Spanish Inquisition. Between 2000 and 4000 New Christians known as Marranos (Anusim or Conversor) were butchered in the square. Rossio Square is a good spot to stand and reflect on the world of the Marranos a world in which no one could trust anyone. Today it is the place where Lisbon natives and tourists meet.

I marvel at the wavering mosaic pattern in various street sidewalk tiles. Even some of the cafes around the square date from the 18th century. Shopping galore!

I walk back to the historic heart of Lisbon the Alfama district and climb the hilly streets.

Later I saunter along the tree-lined Avenida da Liberdade reminding me of the Champs-Elysees for its many international luxury boutiques.

Lisbon has one of the fastest-growing Jewish communities in Europe mainly because Portugal approved a law in March 2015 that grants citizenship to descendants of Jews it persecuted 500 years ago during the Inquisition. The rights apply to those who can demonstrate “a traditional connection to Portuguese Sephardi Jews.” Obviously many Jews are applying for Portuguese citizenship to obtain an EU passport. The best estimates are that several thousand Jews reside in Portugal including about 1000Jews in Lisbon and an equal number in Oporto.

The historic Shaare Tikvah Synagogue is at Alexandre Herculano 59 Lisbon. Tel 351-213-931-130. www.cilisboa.org. This famous house of worship underwent a renovation in 2002 as a tribute to its 100th anniversary.

The synagogue is open Friday nights Saturday mornings and Jewish holidays according to Allan Fleischman the shamash (sexton) of this house of worship.

Chabad holds activities and classes in Cascais and Lisbon. Contact Chabad at 351-910-345-754. info@chabadportugal.com.

The Communidade Israelita de Lisboa is at Do Monte Olivete 16 r/c 1200-280 Lisbon.

A new Jewish museum was planned for the Alfama district but will finally be built in the neighborhood of Pedroucos as a “showcase of Portuguese Jewish life both of the nation and the Diaspora.” The building will be designed by the noted Polish-American architect Daniel Libeskind who also designed among other museums including the Jewish Museum Berlin.

During World War II Lisbon was a neutral country. By getting to Lisbon many Jews were saved from the Nazis. The capital was a great escape hatch to the United States and other safe destinations.

Because Portugal is located on the far western edge of the Iberian Peninsula and because Iberia itself was isolated for centuries people said Europe began and ended at the Pyrenees. No longer! A free democratic atmosphere envelopes Lisbon and the country and this brings tourists to Portugal today more than ever.

They can be used to book flights on Alaska's huge list of partner airlines both inside and outside Oneworld. Some of its current partners include American Airlines Aer Lingus and Singapore Airlines among many others.

In the past it even had partnerships with Air France Delta Air Lines and Emirates but Air France Delta and KLM were cut as Delta grew in Seattle (SEA) and Emirates was cut shortly after Alaska joined Oneword. Plus it has a great award chart with very reasonable prices. You can add stopovers to all international award tickets free of charge and most partners (excluding British Airways) don't have high fuel surcharges.

For a time this made Alaska Airlines the place to credit your flights. I loved being able to credit my Alaska American Delta and various other carriers to a single airline whose miles were so valuable. I was a United flyer at the time and having one place to credit all my non-United domestic flights was a real treat.

These days however Alaska Mileage Plan's glory days are behind us but a new catch-all program is appearing: Air Canada Aeroplan. This program was completely revamped last year and added a handful of new non-alliance airline partners over the past two years. Plus it has committed to keeping a standard award chart added stopovers and axed fuel surcharges.

Here are a few ways that I see Aeroplan slowly becoming the new Mileage Plan — and why it's all good news for the consumer. Plus I'll hone in on one way that the two programs massively differ.

A growing list of partners

The biggest similarity I see between Aeroplan and Mileage Plan is the abundance of non-alliance partnerships. Air Canada is a member of Star Alliance so it already has partnerships with major airlines like United Airlines and Lufthansa. But we've seen the airline add partnerships with non-alliance carriers too including:

Air Serbia

Cathay Pacific

Etihad

GOL

Gulf Air

Airlines like Air Serbia Etihad GOL and Gulf Air aren't members of any major alliance so there's a good chance I'll credit my flights on these airlines to Aeroplan. This provides a revenue stream for the airline and gets me engaged in Aeroplan even as an American traveler who rarely flies Air Canada.

As discussed in the intro this is once how I treated Mileage Plan. If I had a flight on Air France American Delta or Emirates I would always credit it to Mileage Plan. Nowadays I still do this for American and Oneworld airlines but some of its other partnerships were severed when Alaska joined Oneworld.

Predictable award charts with stopovers

Aeroplan and Mileage Plan both have great award charts with free stopovers. On the Aeroplan side all partner flights are priced in accordance with a zone and distance-based award chart. Simply match the regions you're flying to/from calculate the distance between your origin and destination and match it to its respective distance band on the published award chart (PDF link).

Mileage Plan also kept a standard award chart for partner redemptions albeit they're a little bit more confusing. Each partner has its own award chart that you can find on Alaska's website.

Regardless both programs give you a predictable way to redeem your hard-earned miles for partner flights. Both programs are going against the norm as Delta United and others have moved to dynamic award pricing.

Likewise both programs let you add stopovers to your award tickets. Aeroplan lets you mix partners and add a stopover wherever you'd like for 5000 points on a one-way ticket. On the other hand Alaska gives you a free stopover on all one-way tickets but only in the hub city of the airline you're flying. You cannot mix partners on Alaska awards but you can add a connecting leg on Alaska.

This actually makes Aeroplan better than Mileage Plan in some respects. Stopovers are extremely flexible and you can go so far as to transit another region en route to your final destination. This makes things like Vancouver (YVR) to Sydney (SYD) via Hong Kong (HKG) possible.

Aeroplan points are getting easier to earn

Air Canada is adding new earning partners like Chase Ultimate Rewards. (Photo by Andrew Kunesh / The Points Guy)

One thing that differentiates the two programs however is the ease of earning Aeroplan points. Mileage Plan miles have long been some of the hardest airline miles to earn. Beyond transferring from Marriott Bonvoy you cannot transfer credit card points to Mileage Plan miles.

To contrast Aeroplan has aggressively added credit card transfer partners. We've long been able to transfer American Express Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan. More recently Capital One Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards added Aeroplan as a transfer partner too.

This makes Aeroplan points easy to earn and will undoubtedly bring new customers. Some may say this gives Aeroplan a leg up on Mileage Plan but it's a double-edged sword. Aeroplan could devalue its program in response to growing mileage balances (and a growing balance sheet). That said I'm not convinced this will happen in the short term as Air Canada works to gain members.

What's next for Aeroplan?

Aeroplan has a lot of room to grow. (Photo by Joel Serre / Shutterstock.com)

Aeroplan is starting an international expansion with a special focus on the U.S. It recently announced that it teamed up with Chase to launch a cobranded credit card for American travelers. This card will likely have a sizable signup bonus and get many Americans to start earning Aeroplan points stateside. Similar to Mileage Plan this shows us that Air Canada is positioning Aeroplan as a program for all travelers not just travelers who fly with Air Canada.

I think we will see more changes like this in the future. We may see the airline partner with other domestic U.S. carriers that aren't members of a major alliance. Some contenders include JetBlue and Hawaiian Airlines — both airlines have limited Canadian service and would benefit from an Air Canada partnership.

I think we will also see Aeroplan add more retail partnerships too. The program currently has partnerships with Uber Eats and Starbucks wherein travelers can earn points while dining. We may see more of these partnerships be added in the future at major Canadian and American retailers where it can both generate revenue and expand its footprint.

Unfortunately one negative change is coming too. Soon Air Canada fliers will earn Aeroplan points based on the cost of their flight similar to what we see with American Delta and United. Alaska is keeping a distance-based earning for the time being but only time will tell how long this sticks.

Bottom line

In my eyes Aeroplan is slowly becoming the next Mileage Plan. Air Canada is constantly adding lucrative new partnerships and consumer-friendly changes that make Aeroplan points attractive for all travelers even if they don't travel to Canada. This is similar to Mileage Plan circa-2016 and in stark contrast to what we're seeing at most major North American airlines.

I hope to see Aeroplan continue to make positive changes over the coming years. While its future move to revenue-based points earning isn't great I am excited to see the airline add new partnerships expand on its existing partnerships and launch new credit cards. Only time will tell what's next.

“The Carnival Panorama just returned to Port of Long Beach there were multiple covid cases onboard with a lot of passengers being disembarked on some ports of call accompanied by medical personnel.”

Last week the Carnival cruise ship visited the Mexican ports of Cabo San Lucas Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta before returning yesterday (August 28th) from its first cruise since Carnival was forced to suspend cruise operations last year at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. The Carnival Panorama had its inaugural sailing on December 11 2019.

The cruise ship returned to the U.S with positive COVID-19 cases notwithstanding the fact that Carnival claimed that at least 95% of its passengers were vaccinated as it told the Mexican government last week. A local newspaper in Long Beach reported that the Carnival Panorama can accommodate approximately 4000 passengers but is operating at about 75% capacity (3000).

I have also heard from guests on different Carnival cruise ships who tested positive after returning home from cruises who tried to contact Carnival and had to leave a message with sales representatives that they tested positive for COVID-19. Another couple left a tweet to this effect on Twitter and commented that other guests tested positive as well.

I have heard from other @CarnivalCruise guests who tested positive after leaving the Carnival Mardi Gras #cruise ship / @CarnivalPLC will not acknowledge their + #COVID-19 status / #StickYourHeadInTheSand?? / @CDCgov please take note . . . https://t.co/A32qFbVR6o — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) August 29 2021

According to a local newspaper in Long Beach the Long Beach Post News the Carnival Panorama experienced what it vaguely called a “technical problem” reducing the speed of the cruise ship. The newspaper referred to a Carnival Facebook private page called the CARNIVAL PANORAMA CRUISE PAGE which shared a letter from Carnival explaining that the Panorama was “experiencing an issue that is affecting the ship’s maximum cruising speed.”

The newspaper mentioned that Carnival recently implemented HAVE FUN. BE SAFE. COVID-19 GUEST PROTOCOLS including “requiring proof of vaccination for the vast majority of guests and regular testing for others. Panorama’s entire 1400-member crew is fully vaccinated according to the company’s website. All passengers regardless of vaccination status must present a negative COVID-19 test result from within three days of embarkation. Unvaccinated guests must take another test prior to embarkation and a third test 24 hours into the voyage if the cruise is longer than four days.” AXIOS reported last week that Carnival announced new mask guidelines which say that all guests are required to wear masks indoors.

Carnival’s COVID protocols state that:

“Vaccinated guests are not required to maintain physical distance on board the ship.

It is recommended that unvaccinated guests maintain physical distancing as follows:

Outdoors – Remain at least 3 feet from others when not wearing a mask and not in your cruise companion group.”

This cruise line’s “HAVE FUN be safe” protocols in practice have been criticized as too heavy on “HAVE FUN” and too little on “be safe.” A video posted on Carnival Senior Cruise Director John Heald Facebook page shows the cruise director on the Carnival Panorama standing in front of hundreds of guests crowded together on the (exterior) Lido deck many without masks.

#Cruise fan explained that this is how they do it on @CarnivalCruise #cruise ""Fun Ships"" https://t.co/EZdvUXWKpo Comments split between (1) criticisms of disregard for masks & social distancing in crowd & (2) ""if you don't like it stay home"" @CarnivalPLC #COVID19 #DeltaVariant — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) August 29 2021

Comments left on the John Heald’s page are split between those who complained that the gathering was unsafe and negligent and those defending the reckless spectacle who essentially said “if you don’t like it stay home.” Included in the latter category were attacks on Dr. Fauci and the usual comments typical of COVID skeptics and deniers that masks allegedly don’t work:

“. . . if this 5 second moment is a turn off for u do everyone a favor and stay home.

. . . you do know they just proved yesterday that these masks do nothing.

. . . seriously stay home if you are worried. It’s your choice just as its theirs there is absolutely no proof that the masks work . . .

. . . This is never going away. They will only come up with different names for this. Stop your mask bs already. Stay the heck home if your worried. IT’S NEVER GOING AWAY!

. . . you know you have the choice to stay home and be all safe in your bubble.

. . . it just shows what a joke the mask mandate is. Nothing more than a misleading visual they have no legitimate function.

Let them stay home and we will just keep having a great time!!

Don’t like it stay home.

If you don’t like it… don’t sail.

So glad everyone is having fun we are back !! This is why we cruise!

This looks amazing!! Can’t wait until September 6 on Sunrise. So glad you all were having a great time! I see with these comments there’s a lot of jealous people trying to bring the hate to the party “

These comments expressing concern for the crowded space and absence of social distancing were usually met with vitriolic attacks.

“This looks scary and irresponsible.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. This one screams unsafe.

If cruising is stunted at all. It will be because Carnival already has a death on its hands and there may be more with this kind of thing going on. This is GROSS NEGLIGENCE.”

Carnival Cruise Line failed to reveal any information regarding the number of infected guests or crew members on this ship.

When the Carnival Panorama last sailed from Long Beach in March of 2020 it kept its passengers on board the ship when it returned to Long Beach after a week-long voyage to Puerto Vallarta Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas because a single guest was transported off the ship to be tested for coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made the decision to hold passengers on the ship pending the results of a single COVID-19 test. The test turned out to be negative. Passengers were quoted in the Long Beach Post News as saying that they were “glad the cruise line was being careful.”

Seventeen months later today it is clear that Carnival is refusing to disclose the total number of crew and guests infected with COVID-19 on any particular cruise and is sloughing off direct responses to such inquiries from the media. It is also apparent that guests are disembarking from Carnival ships and quickly testing positive without follow up by this cruise line.

Carnival recently demonstrated a lack of transparency in responding to media inquiries into the extent and number of COVID-19 outbreaks on several Carnival ships. Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak on the Carnival Vista for example at least one guest died of COVID-19 one was seriously sickened and went ashore in Belize an unknown number of others were infected and at least forty-two crew members tested positive for COVID-19 over a two week period. But Carnival initially falsely characterize that it was managing only a “small number” of positive cases on the ship. Several national newspapers such as Axios eventually characterized the true number of COVID-19 cases on the Carnival Vista as “the biggest outbreak of coronavirus cases since cruises resumed in the U.S. and Caribbean last June.”

After leaving one Carnival Vista passenger with COVID-19 alone in a sub-standard hospital in Belize and sailing on to the next port (Cozumel) Carnival belatedly claimed that “it was highly unlikely Ms. Tackett contracted the coronavirus aboard the ship . . . ” notwithstanding the fact that her symptoms began 4 days into the cruise which was consistent with the incubation period explained by the CDC which can begin as early as 2 days.

A common thought expressed by many Carnival fans is that “covid is everywhere” and the public needs to “just learn to live with it.” Given COVID-19 breakthrough infections the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant and the carefree-have-fun-nonchalant attitude of many Carnival fans there will continue to be COVID-19 outbreaks on Carnival ships in the future.

According to the COVID-19 color code database the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that all thirteen Carnival cruise ships operating in U.S. waters authorized to sail with passengers had COVID-19 infections in the last seven days.

With COVID-19 now appearing on virtually every Carnival ship leaving from the U.S. don’t expect any accurate COVID-19 infection details any time soon from the likes of Carnival.

As a result the cruise line has adjusted the ship’s call at Cabo San Lucas today.

Carnival Cruise Ship Technical Issue

The third Vista-class cruise ship is suffering from an issue related to its maximum cruising speed. Carnival Cruise Line sent out a letter to guests on August 25 letting them know about the problem and that their time at Cabo San Lucas on August 26 would be altered and with a delayed arrival back at the Port of Long Beach in California on August 28.

The cruise line said in the letter “We are experiencing an issue that is impacting the ship’s maximum cruising speed. As a result our return to Long Beach will be later than scheduled and we now expect to arrive at approximately 10:30 AM on Saturday.”

Today the call at Cabo San Lucas has been altered to make sure the ship does arrive back home at the new arrival time. Originally the Carnival Panorama had an arrival time of 7:00 AM and a departure time of 3:00 PM. Instead the ship already arrived earlier at 6:00 AM and will depart an hour earlier at 2:00 PM.

Carnival has informed guests that their shore excursions booked through the cruise line will adjust accordingly and if any tour is impacted they will be contacted individually. Those who purchased Carnival’s Fly2Fun air would have their flights adjusted automatically if scheduled before 2:00 PM.

The cruise line will reimburse up to $200 per person for guests who have to change their flights scheduled before 2:00 PM.

Carnival Panorama is currently sailing a seven-day Mexican Rivira cruise that departed Long Beach on August 21. The ship already completed scheduled calls at Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan as normal before the technical issue came to light.

The ship first started sailing in December 2019 and is the second newest ship in the fleet at 133500 gross tons and a guest capacity of 4008 at doubler occupancy.

Cruise Hive last reported a similar issue with the Carnival Dream which was also in August but back in 2019.

Sheriff Michelle Cook said at least 1000 people showed up at the carnival in the mall’s parking lot. Fights began breaking out among different groups of people.

According to Cook innocent people may have been sprayed with pepper spray.

Clay County deputies arrived at the carnival to shut it down. In the shutdown process more fights broke out. Cook confirmed at least two separate gunshots were fired between groups of people.

Officers from the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office and Orange Park Police Department as well as Florida Highway Patrol troopers helped the Clay County deputies with the shutdown process. Clay County Fire Rescue and the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department also helped.

According to Cook a few Clay County deputies suffered very minor injuries. No injuries to anyone attending the event have been reported.

Clay County deputies arrested multiple people involved in the fights.

“We will not tolerate this sort of behavior in Clay County” Cook said in a Facebook post. "" The carnival was intended to be a family-friendly event.”

Hopefully for the people and property impacted the damage will be minimal.

To the degree necessary local state and federal emergency management agencies relief organizations churches major corporations and ordinary people will band together to help those affected by the storm.

However when major hurricanes have hit the United States in the past (as recently as last week unfortunately) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the point agency for the federal government.

Hurricane impact on the trucking industry

Anyone that has been around the trucking industry for some time knows that hurricane relief is a major driver of freight demand. Trucking companies have learned that they can do well helping out but also make a lot of money in the process.

FEMA and shippers that provide the types of goods that are used in relief will have a massive volume of loads and will be willing to pay top dollar to get their freight to areas that have been impacted by storms.

Earlier today I tweeted out a few comments about how carriers were going to flock to this freight and warned other shippers that they could see carrier capacity dry up. A CEO of a large carrier texted me in response challenging my assumptions. He explained that over the past year fleets have aggressively pursued double-digit contract rate increases in return for consistency and dependability in capacity planning. Shippers have been willing to accept these rate increases as long as the carriers provided the capacity promised when they promised it.

In his view FEMA would be the one struggling this time around to find capacity.





He asked not to be directly identified but wrote:

“The big difference between this and previous cycles is that many carriers have gone through two to three rate increases with each individual shipper in a 12-month timeframe. In aggregate some have seen 20%+/ rate increases. With those increases came more defined expectations around volumes and order acceptance.

It’s worth it from a monetary perspective but makes it very difficult to drop and chase relief freight. In past cycles these big events have occurred in the early part of an upcycle or even in a weak market when customer rates were not sufficient. This is a much different scenario. FEMA will seriously struggle to find capacity.”

He went on to write those small carriers that play in the spot market would be the big winners here able to get really high spot rates and shippers that have not locked in stronger commitments among carriers would also experience disruptions.

In the end higher spot rates are good for all fleets even those not playing in the market directly. Shippers seeing high spot rates or running out of capacity will be more willing to accept that double-digit rate increase fearing that their freight may be left on the docks for weeks at a time.

Ciao ciao Alitalia.

Italy’s storied flag carrier has announced it will no longer issue tickets triggering a countdown of just a few weeks until its familiar red and green livery vanishes from our skies for good.

The nationally owned airline is to be replaced in October by ITA a smaller company with a different logo but the service which once carried Italian pride style and cuisine – not to mention the Pope – to all corners of the planet will be long gone.

While the demise of Alitalia might bring a sense of loss for many Italians it’s unlikely to come as a surprise. The airline has spent the past few decades teetering on the brink of collapse as authorities scrambled to strike lifeline alliances with investors and other global carriers.

“Each time it succeeded in being rescued albeit with the only result of further prolonging its agony” says Giovanni Orsina director of the School of Government at Rome-based LUISS University.

Founded 74 years ago Alitalia was once known by Italians as “freccia alata” – aka the “winged arrow” in honor of speed – will retire for good. Its aircraft’s tails bore the popular logo of a capital ‘A’ shaped like the wing of an aircraft and colored like the Italian flag.

Aside from its cuisine and car brands it was perhaps one of Italy’s most recognized symbols overseas.

When Italian families returned home from a faraway trip and set foot inside an Alitalia aircraft with the stewardess finally greeting them with a warm “buongiorno” and serving steaming spaghetti with tomato sauce and cotoletta alla Milanese for lunch it was like stepping back home. To kill time passengers could read Italian national newspapers.

Papal blessing

Alitalia took pride in Italian style and food. Flight attendants in the 1950s were dressed in elegant uniforms designed by couture house Sorelle Fontana. In later years an impressive roster including Delia Biagiotti Alberto Fabiani Renato Balestra and even Giorgio Armani created stylish outfits and comfortable seats.

The hot Italian cuisine served on board at times made the company a favorite among international travelers. The duty free sold luxury Italian perfumes watches scarves and ties. Back in more unenlightened times husbands returning from a long-haul flight would bring their wives the latest boutique item.

The airline had the blessing of religious authorities too. From 1964 it regularly served as the Pope’s official airline with the size of the plane varying based on the distance being flown. The aircraft carrying the Pope is usually referred to as “Shepherd One” – the papal equivalent of Air Force One – and is given the flight number AZ4000.

It wasn’t all glamor and prestige for Alitalia. Over the past 30 years Italy’s government has pumped billions of euros into the airline in an attempt to save it from extinction and keep its employees in jobs.

But says Orsina the airline simply couldn’t cope with global competition and adapt to the changes in the aviation sector.

“The fall of Alitalia is the ultimate symbol of Italy’s historical inbred difficulty in dealing with globalization and rising competition” he tells CNN. “The travel industry has undergone a revolution while Alitalia was stuck in a stalemate stifled by corporations lobbies trade unions and political pressures to keep it afloat despite its woes and the reality of an evolving sector.”

Alitalia showed little resilience says Orsina. It just couldn’t keep up with the arrival of efficient low-cost carriers operating with smaller crews and offering more competitive fares newer aircraft and a wider list of global destinations.

Even though Italy has always been a popular tourist destination Alitalia’s profits kept falling due to rising competition debts piled up and bankruptcy followed. The company passed several times into extraordinary administration. Numerous rescue missions were mounted without long term success.

‘Reaching the bottom’

The aftermath of the September 11 2001 attacks on the United States which heavily impacted the aviation industry dealt a heavy blow to Alitalia but the lethal strike has likely been the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Authorities kept resuscitating it believing that Alitalia just couldn’t fail but there are limits and we’ve reached the bottom” says Orsina. “It’s like curing a terminal patient. You can try to make him feel less pain for a while but not forever. That is therapeutic obstinacy.”

Alitalia’s golden age started in the 1950s when post-World War II reconstruction triggered an economic boom in Italy and families could finally afford to fly to distant locations.

“Italy was a vanquished country recovering from the wounds of the Second World War and Alitalia came to represent collective hope and national identity” says aerospace industry expert Gregory Alegi.”It conveyed a sense of belonging.”

As the jet age arrived the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome helped spread the fame of Alitalia worldwide – the company even created a poster showing a javelin thrower with an airplane flying over his head.

“Having a state carrier was a must for Italy an icon of national pride and patriotism” says Orsina. “Italy couldn’t afford not to have one it was like having the police and carabinieri corps. Alitalia was an indispensable accessory of the state because it was like having a piece of flying Italy around the world” says Orsina.

Alitalia’s troubles started in the 1990s when European deregulation made air traffic more competitive and Italian railways were strengthened according to aerospace expert Alegi.

Delays and cancellations

The situation worsened when authorities tried to privatize Alitalia triggering an infinite quest for carrier partners and businessmen willing to support the state in tackling the challenges of a free market. All partnerships failed while trade unions fought against layoff plans.

And while Alitalia was loved as a symbol it was often loathed by its passengers.

The endless crisis eventually led to a decline in service quality says Orsina with personnel strikes delayed or canceled flights and fewer long-haul trips. Italians started to become frustrated.

According to recent surveys the majority of them believe the state should have long stopped funding the company with taxpayers’ money.

That hasn’t clouded nostalgia felt by retired pilots captains and air attendants for the good old days when salaries were high and the job came with benefits and prestige.

Rosetta Scrugli a former Alitalia passenger who regularly flew to Asia for work complains that union protests have made her lose important meetings overseas.

“The flight was either late or often even canceled” she says. “I spent hours waiting at the terminal and my luggage was lost several times. It’s nice to fly a national carrier if things run smoothly otherwise it can be hell. Patriotism has nothing to do with it efficiency is key”.

Scrugli also complained that Alitalia used to fly to Asia via Milan with no direct flights from Rome.

While little is yet known about the airline’s anointed successor according to Alegi there are hopes ITA will succeed where Alitalia has failed.

But since it will be state-owned at least in the short-term no one is expecting it to soar just yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyLXRyYW5zcG9ydC90aGFpbGFuZC1lYXNlcy1kb21lc3RpYy1mbGlnaHQtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWZyb20tYmFuZ2tvay8xNDUyNTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thailand eases domestic flight restrictions from Bangkok | News | Flight Global,"Thailand’s civil aviation authorities has eased restrictions for travel to and from high-risk regions in the country which includes capital Bangkok.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) will allow airlines to operate domestic passenger flights out of “dark red” areas — the local classification for risk levels — from 1 September with several restrictions in place.

Passengers flying out of Bangkok must either be fully-vaccinated and have tested negative for the coronavirus prior to departure. Inbound domestic passengers will not subject to the same regulations states the authority.

The CAAT has also stipulated that airlines can only operate flights at 75% capacity. “Airlines must also consider the arrangement of seats taking into account safe distancing measures” it adds.

Consequently Thai carriers have announced a resumption of a limited number of flights to the capital city.

Bangkok Airways states that it will resume flights to three domestic points — Chiang Mai Phuket and Samui — from 1 September while flights to Lampang will commence on 9 September and Sukhothai a week later.

Low-cost carrier Thai AirAsia which suspended all flying throughout August announced a resumption of flights to 11 domestic points from 3 September.

From Bangkok Don Mueang airport the carrier will operate flights to cities such as Chiang Mai Hat Yai Udon Thani as well as Phuket.

Other carriers such as Thai Lion Air Thai Smile Air and Nok Air have similarly announced a resumption of Bangkok flights from 1 September.

After one of Maine’s worst browntail moth seasons there are signs already that 2022 could continue a years-long outbreak of the invasive insect that’s responsible for painful skin rashes and occasional dangerous breathing problems.

But winter and spring weather could determine the scale of next summer’s infestation. And ongoing research offers some hope for tamping down future outbreaks.

The influx of moths throughout the state this summer means there likely was successful mating leading to a large number of eggs that become caterpillars experts told The Maine Monitor.

A cool and wet spring however would help reduce the outbreak because a fungus that attacks browntail moth caterpillars thrives in those conditions. When the spring is hot and dry like it has been in recent years the fungus isn’t as effective in controlling the caterpillars.

For what it’s worth The Farmer’s Almanac this month predicted that the coming winter will “flip flop” between mild and cold and stormy.

Maine is in a browntail moth outbreak that began in 2015 and has ramped up in recent years. The insect was found in every county but York this year although it’s likely it was there in small numbers said Tom Schmeelk an entomologist with the Maine Forest Service. Webs were found in Aroostook County this year for the first time in decades after the insect likely hitchhiked there on cars.

The pest gained national attention this summer for irritating Mainers and visitors enjoying the outdoors. Tiny hairs from the caterpillar can cause a skin rash similar to poison ivy and remain toxic for up to three years. Severe reactions can include trouble breathing. The brown caterpillars are about 1.5 inches long with white stripes on their sides and two orange spots on their hind end.

The browntail moth was accidentally brought from Europe to Massachusetts more than a century ago. By the early 1900s it had spread across New England.

To find out the full range and impact of the moth this summer the Forest Service will conduct an aerial survey in early fall to note how many acres of trees have been impacted. The caterpillars consume part of the leaves turning them brown which is visible from a plane.

Last year browntail moths impacted about 150000 acres. The largest outbreaks in the early 2000s were typically less than 20000 acres Schmeelk said.

During the winter the Forest Service will count caterpillar webs throughout the state. The two surveys together will give an idea of the infestation that could happen next summer.

Infestation could expand

While it’s early to predict Schmeelk said “the areas that are bad this year will probably be the same areas that are bad next year. There just might be some range expansion and some new towns that are included in the browntail survey.”

But the fungus that attacks the caterpillars also is widespread in small isolated populations such as Blue Hill and Jefferson.

“That’s good news because that tells us that it is widespread and if we do happen to have that cool wet weather we will likely see a large decrease in the population” Schmeelk said.

While it’s possible one really rainy spring season could squash the outbreak browntail moths are so rampant that it likely will take a couple of seasons he said.

And with shorter milder winters due to climate change there’s a smaller window of cold conditions that naturally regulate the insect said Jim Dill pest management specialist for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension.

“Climate change in the winters can be a dramatic force in the population dynamics” Dill said.

Mainers who find webs on their property this winter can hire an arborist to remove them or find more information from the Forest Service about how to safely remove the webs themselves.

Some cities such as Bangor and Waterville announced plans this summer to control the pest on a larger scale including moth inventories and web clipping programs. Dill said this might be a good approach because it’s difficult to address the problem one property at a time.

Ongoing research may provide another solution for controlling the bug.

UMaine researchers provide hope

Angela Mech assistant professor of forest entomology and her colleagues at the University of Maine this summer conducted a pilot study to test pheromone traps for male browntail moths as a way to calculate population density. They will compare the number of trapped moths to the number of winter webs later found in the same area. After about four or five years of data they will have a statistical model that can predict where the moths will be most prevalent Mech said.

From there Mech and her colleagues can create a “plume” of high concentrations of the female pheromone to confuse the males making it difficult for them to find a mate.

The browntail population fluctuates in cycles so a monitoring system will help researchers and officials predict when the populations are growing again to prevent future infestations from getting this bad Mech said.

Browntail isn’t the only invasive insect threat in Maine. There’s been an increase of emerald ash borer and hemlock woolly adelgid Mech said. And southern pine beetle a native species typically found south of New Jersey is creeping north with warming winters. Schmeelk said he’s concerned about the spotted lantern fly which feeds on almost anything and is devastating to agriculture drifting north into Maine as the climate warms.

But the browntail moth is unusual because it’s a “trifecta pest” Mech said. The insect damages trees which can affect an entire ecosystem; it harms orchards and plantations affecting the economy; and it causes irritating rashes affecting human health.

“We are always going to have pests that could affect our ecology and our economy” Mech said. “Browntail moth is unique in that it’s all three that are being affected which makes it quite the little beast.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFkYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9hbi1hcm15LW9mLW1vdGhzLWhhdmUtbGFuZGVkL2FydGljbGVfMDRjYWZhMDMtM2U1Yy01YTU3LWEyMGYtMzQwM2YyMjJiNTMyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An army of moths have landed | Local News | theadanews.com,"A fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) crawls along on concrete.

When Canadian conservation enthusiasts head out to find monarch eggs it's always with a magnifying glass and a notebook. They are volunteers taking part in a summer census of the iconic endangered butterflies.

July and August are the best months when the monarch is visible in Canada at all stages of its development: eggs caterpillar chrysalis and adult butterfly.

It is also the reproduction period for the generation which will take off in a few weeks for a 4000 kilometer (2500 mile) journey to Mexico.

But it's complicated research. ""The monarch lays one egg per leaf. There are insects which can lay a dozen eggs all together while the monarch lays one. So we are looking for something very small"" explains Jacques Kirouac who is among the hundreds of people who take part in the citizen science program Mission Monarch.

The eggs of these creatures known for their striking orange and black colors are off-white or yellow and about the size of a pinhead with ridges that run from the tip to the base.

The species's dire situation led to the creation five years ago of this program set up by the Montreal Insectarium to document monarch breeding grounds. The data is used by researchers in particular to determine zones in need of protection. There are similar programs in the United States.

Monarchs of the eastern side of the North American continent are in a difficult situation: their population has decreased by more than 80 percent in two decades.

Monarchs of the eastern side of the continent are in a difficult situation: their population has decreased by more than 80 percent in two decades. Western monarchs—which hibernate in California—are even worse off: fewer than 2000 were reported in the last census by Western Monarch Count down 99.9 percent since the 1980s.

More generally the disappearance of insects—less spectacular and less striking for the public than that of large mammals—is just as worrying say the scientists.

They are essential to ecosystems and economies because they pollinate plants recycle nutrients and serve as staple food for other animals.

'Not enough data'

""It's a beautiful butterfly. It would be a real loss to lose it"" says Renald Saint-Onge also a volunteer for Mission Monarch.

This 73-year-old former carpenter and ornithologist feels driven to ""save this butterfly."" So he decided to let grow at his home as many milkweed plants as possible. Often considered a weed this perennial plant is the only one on which the monarch butterfly lays. But we find it less and less.

Monarch butterflies are essential to ecosystems and economies because they pollinate plants recycle nutrients and serve as staple food for other animals.

""The natural fields where we had milkweed and nectar-bearing plants are increasingly rare"" says Alessandro Dieni coordinator of the Mission Monarch program. And the plants are ""of lower quality because we have fields with monocultures everywhere"" and an intensive use of pesticides in the country that killed them off.

Logging has also devastated forests in Mexico where the monarchs spend the winter.

Faced with the catastrophic decline of this insect the Canadian government has decided to get involved in helping the monarch by seeking to protect its breeding grounds. ""However there was not enough data in Canada to know where to go to protect the monarch"" says Dieni.

The decline of insects which represent two-thirds of all terrestrial species dates back to the beginning of the 20th century and accelerated in the years 1950-60 to reach alarming proportions over the last 20 years.

""Thanks to the censuses we can now do more precise research"" explains Marian MacNair of McGill University.

""This allows us to better determine the routes taken the conditions that the monarch particularly like"" adds the biologist who expresses amazement over this small emblematic butterfly's ability to fly thousands of kilometers.

The monarch butterfly makes a good study for scientists because often ""we have great difficulty in observing the evolution"" of populations of insects. But the monarch's territory is rather small and therefore it is easy to do calculations and observations and document ""the extent of the disaster"" explains MacNair.

Post Road site for $38 million,"White Plains Hospital has bought the approximately 4-acre parcel at 77 W. Post Road where a $160 million mixed-use development had been planned.

Real estate services firm CBRE announced Wednesday morning that the hospital a member of the Montefiore Health System bought the property from Grid Properties and Gotham Organization Inc. The purchase price was $38 million according to CBRE.

The site had been cleared in anticipation of a mixed-use development project getting underway after having been approved about five years ago.

“The offering represented a highly unique opportunity to buy a 4-plus acre site representing nearly an entire city block in the heart of downtown White Plains with exceptional proximity to Scarsdale” said Jeff Dunne vice chairman of CBRE.

The site formerly was home to the Sholz Auto Group dealerships which handled General Motors vehicles including Buick and Oldsmobile. Real estate developer Grid Properties operating as Post Maple 77 LLC which has an office in New York City had acquired the property and proposed an upscale shopping mall that also would include a fitness center.

The development site is bounded by Maple Avenue West Post Road South Lexington Avenue and Rathbun Avenue. Part of the thinking at the time was that the location on the western side of White Plains near the Scarsdale border would prove to be attractive to upscale shoppers as was The Westchester mall”™s location on the east side of town.

The city of White Plains however wanted to see a residential component added to the project. At the city”™s behest Grid reworked the project”™s design and added a dozen townhome units.

Grid”™s project would have totaled about 230000 square feet. There would have been a 720-space self-park garage with an additional 82 spaces for valet parking and 91 satellite and joint-use spaces.

Grid”™s site plan for the project received approval from the White Plains Common Council on Nov. 7 2016 and the approval subsequently was extended. On Feb. 1 of this year the Common Council again extended approvals of Grid”™s project.

DKV una aseguradora alemana de renombre internacional llevaba muchos años sin estar a gusto en Dénia casi en estado de depresión permanente. Nunca entendió el por qué de la conflictividad que siempre cercó al Hospital y a los centros de salud de la Marina Alta ni las constantes críticas de pacientes trabajadores o ayuntamientos a su gestión ni las continúas bregas con la Generalitat (al fin y al cabo la administración que la había contratado) desde que en 2015 ascendió al poder el Botànic. Así que DKV pese a ser el buque insignia de Marina Salud al controlar el 65% de las acciones de esta concesionaria hace mucho tiempo que dijo que quería irse. Prácticamente desde 2016 un año después de que Ximo Puig se convirtiera en líder de todos los valencianos.

Fue entonces cuando Puig y sus conselleras de Sanidad vieron allí en esa constante depresión de DKV la oportunidad para cumplir la promesa electoral de su partido el PSPV y de sus socios de gobierno Compromís y Podemos la reversión del Hospital de Dénia que figuraba en los acuerdos del Botànic: comprarle las acciones a DKV ya que DKV se quería marchar para que la sanidad de esta comarca pasara al fin a ser pública. El president lo anunció muy pronto hace cinco años en una histórica visita a la comarca en Pedreguer. La reversión entonces pareció posible. Aún más: comenzaba su cuenta atrás.

Y lo cierto es que la Generalitat y DKV se sentaron a hablar. Fueron conversiones difíciles. A veces el acuerdo parecía inminente y en otras ocasiones ambas partes se levantaron de la mesa indignadas para pasarse luego meses sin llamarse. Al final los enfados comenzaron a ganarle la partida a la esperanza transcurrieron ya no los meses sino los años y el Consell jamás se hizo con las acciones de la aseguradora germana.

Para las siguientes elecciones las de 2019 parecía que ya no había ninguna posibilidad de que la sanidad de la Marina Alta fuera alguna vez pública. Pero entonces los socialistas cometieron el error más grueso de todos los que han cometido en esta historia: volvieron a prometer en aquella campaña electoral que al contrario que la reversión sería un hecho justo después de votar en las urnas. Que acabarían convenciendo a DKV.

No fue así. Muy poco tiempo después ya en la legislatura del Botànic II se supo que los puentes con el en otro tiempo amigo alemán estaban definitivamente rotos. Por fin la pandemia y las millonarias cantidades de dinero público invertidas para hacer frente a sus efectos fueron la excusa perfecta para admitir con un simulacro de dignidad que ya no había dinero para comprar las acciones de DKV y que por lo tanto no habría reversión al menos antes de que acabe el contrato de la concesión de Marina Salud en Dénia allá por enero de 2024. ""Ahora con el coronavirus no es el momento"" dijo Puig.

El gran problema del PSPV ha sido haber prometido algo que no podía cumplir haberlo hecho dos veces y haber recibido votos por eso. También Compromís y Podemos han tenido sus propios problemas: pese a pronunciarse aún a favor de la reversión inmediata y estar muy molestos con los socialistas por cómo han conducido este asunto pertenecen a un Govern que ha incumplido acuerdos rubricados por escrito.

2. El gigante americano y el botín alemán

Ahora bien para poder vislumbrar el cuadro al completo aún falta un actor que después de estas 580 palabras aún no ha aparecido en esta crónica pese a ser su auténtico protagonista: Ribera Salud hasta la fecha socio minoritario de Marina Salud con el 35% de las acciones.

Ribera Salud es diferente a DKV: perteneciente a una multinacional norteamericana que es un auténtico gigante en el negocio de la sanidad privada Centene Corporation aspira a seguir en todas las concesiones sanitarias que pueda. Cuantas más mejor. Aquí y en cualquier parte del globo terráqueo.

Es verdad que a Ribera Salud ya la han echado de Alzira y están a punto de echarla de Torrevieja porque lo que sí ha cumplido el Botànic es su promesa de no renovar las concesiones sanitarias cuyo contrato expiraba. Pero a cambio se ha expandido por otros lares: solo en España se ha quedado con hospitales de Murcia Galicia o Cataluña.

En la Comunitat Valenciana Ribera Salud quiere aguantar allá donde aún pueda. Por eso ambicionó siempre quedarse con el 100% de las acciones de la sanidad de la Marina Alta. Eso no es nuevo. Lo ha codiciado desde 2016 cuando a DKV le entró la depresión. Ya entonces Ribera Salud (o sus abogados que también son muy importantes en esta crónica) advirtió de que al ser socio minoritario tenía derecho a esas participaciones al botín del amigo alemán a través del ""derecho de tanteo"". La Generalitat entonces cuando tan interesada estaba por ese botín le dijo a los abogados que no que Ribera Salud no tenía ese derecho. Pero aquello solo fue el primer asalto para torpedear este proceso de reversión. Han venido más.

Ahora que en cambio la Generalitat ya no tiene ese interés Ribera Salud y sus letrados han puesto en marcha el segundo abordaje: y han firmado un acuerdo privado con DKV por la que se queda esas acciones no se sabe por cuánto dinero y pasan así a controlar el cien por cien de las participaciones del Hospital de Dénia. Lo ha anunciado a bombo y platillo. Hasta Marina Salud le ha comunicado a sus trabajadores que el acuerdo era oficial y que sólo falta el visto bueno de la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) considerado como un mero trámite.

Tal y como pueden apreciar en el siguiente anuncio firmado por una de las altas directivas de Ribera Salud lo dan por hecho a pesar de que ni siquiera le han comunicado su decisión a la Conselleria de Sanidad.

Casi mil palabras después llegamos así al nudo gordiano del asunto: Ribera Salud y sus abogados creen tener razones de peso para quedarse con las mismas acciones que en su día constituyeron el mascarón de proa de la Generalitat del Botànic para lograr la reversión del Hospital de Dénia. Tal circunstancia certifica el fracaso de ese intento por lograr que la sanidad pública de la Marina Alta volviera a ser de verdad pública. Arruina todas esas esperanzas. Constituye todo un símbolo de que no habrá reversión al menos hasta 2024.

3. Una consellera a la defensiva

Todo eso hace que la Conselleria de Sanidad que tantas cosas prometió para esta comarca durante los buenos tiempos se encuentre ahora en una precaria estrategia defensiva: cuando ya habían pasado 48 largas horas de que se hiciera público el acuerdo DKV-Ribera Salud y tras guardar un sorprendente silencio la consellera de Sanidad la socialista Ana Barceló solo a preguntas de los periodistas advirtió de que se opondrá a ese movimiento accionarial. Lo contrario claro habría sido un auténtico seísmo. Y ni Compromís ni Podemos lo habrían aceptado.

Barceló esgrime dos argumentos para decir que ese abordaje de Ribera Salud no es posible y que son los mismos que los sindicatos mucho más rápidos y mucho más valientes llevan diciendo desde el minuto uno: que por ley una misma mercantil no puede concentrar más del 40% de las acciones de varias concesiones en territorio autonómico (y Ribera Salud además de Dénia ya tiene el 100% del Hospital del Vinalopó); y que también por ley cualquier cambio que implique un trasvase de participaciones debería haber sido autorizado previamente por la conselleria.

Ahora bien la gran prueba de que Barceló está a la defensiva es que se va a limitar a comunicarle esos dos argumentos a la CNMV para que lo sepa. ¿Qué hará la conselleria si al final el informe de Competencia sí autoriza la venta? Que la conselleria tendrá que ir a los tribunales. E irá por detrás en este asunto. Pero el caso es que Barceló tenía motivos para haber sido mucho más contundente: y que según el pliego de condiciones de Marina Salud la compra de las acciones de DKV por parte de Ribera Salud bastaría para expedientar a la concesionaria y estudiar incluso la rescisión de su contrato máxime cuando ambas mercantiles están violando una ley.

4. Ningún otro hospital dónde ir

Que Sanidad haya de autorizar operaciones de este calibre no es un simple un trámite: es porque la de la Marina Alta sigue siendo una sanidad pública aunque su gestión se encuentre privatizada; porque la ciudadanía de esta comarca no tiene ningún otro hospital adonde ir; y porque este tipo de acuerdos que se urden en cualquier despacho tienen efectos muy gruesos sobre la atención que se va a prestar a los pacientes y sobre las condiciones de los trabajadores.

Sin embargo los abogados de Ribera Salud (y en este caso también los de DKV) consideran que esto no es así. Que lo que hacen con sus acciones no le importa a nadie más porque para eso son suyas; que todo esta atañe únicamente al ámbito de sus negocios privados. Por eso ambas empresas firmaron ese acuerdo -y lo hicieron público- sin consultar a nadie y menos a la administración que representa a la ciudadanía de la Marina Alta que es la que paga con sus impuestos todo el sistema sanitario.

Esta es la gran perversión del modelo que en su día dejó implantado la Generalitat del PP: que algo que atañe a la vida de todas las ciudadanas y ciudadanos acaba dependiendo de los criterios de una gran multinacional como Centene Corporation sin que nadie más tenga voz y voto. Ese es precisamente el argumento jurídico de los abogados de Ribera Salud: arguyen que en un país de libre mercado como es este las acciones de las empresas competen a las empresas y a nadie más. Otra cosa es que también en los países de libre mercado las leyes han de cumplirse.

5. Las consecuencias del abordaje

Ribera Salud bloquea así cualquier intento de reversión del Hospital de Dénia antes de 2024 porque puede esgrimir ese acuerdo para acudir a los tribunales y aunque acabe perdiendo la causa (que está por ver) habrá paralizado el destino de esas acciones que podrían haber sido públicas durante meses e incluso años. Máxime vista ahora mismo la tibieza de la conselleria.

Pero es que además en un futuro un poco más lejano antes de que acabe la concesión de Marina Salud en el primer semestre de 2023 habrá unas elecciones autonómicas. Y ahí pueden pasar dos cosas.

Primera: que las elecciones las vuelve a ganar la izquierda. Ribera Salud volverá a defender sus derechos en Dénia con uñas y dientes. Y que hablen los jueces.

Segunda: que las elecciones las gana el PP el gran padre de la criatura de la sanidad privatizada. Esa es la gran esperanza de Ribera Salud. Porque entonces sabe que el PP sí le renovará la concesión y que podrá disfrutar de unos cuantos años más de una buena vida en Dénia.

Porque si PSPV Compromís o Podemos tienen sus propios problemas el PP también arrastra los suyos y son gruesos: considerar que se puede hacer negocio de todo hasta de algo tan vinculado a la vida y la muerte como es la sanidad. Y hacerlo siempre de la mano de empresas o multinacionales bien concretas que pueden contarse con los dedos de una mano.

During the height of the pandemic we linked clients with key players in government to address challenges including Google and Tableau whose experts developed a case tracking system and dashboard and IBM which developed the Excelsior Pass tool enabling New Yorkers to share their vaccine status. We also assisted with private sector efforts to supply (personal protective equipment) and other equipment and to ensure care providers had reliable language translation services. We looked inward to identify additional ways to promote social justice and support opportunities for traditionally underrepresented groups and will continue to be proactive in this space.” What would you like to see change in New York state politics and government? “Our hope for the remainder of 2021 is that events in Albany will lead to workplaces in which employees particularly women feel safe and have a reliable responsive process to follow if they do not.” Big prediction for the rest of 2021? “For the rest of 2021 our prediction is that government will get back to work an executive budget will be crafted and good work will be done for the people of New York.”

We brought ROAR and agencies together to launch the city’s first mobile COVID-19 vaccination bus visiting the neighborhoods where many restaurant staff live thus breaking down barriers between restaurant work schedules and vaccination sites.” What would you like to see change in New York state politics and government? “One dynamic that we’re already seeing change is representation of women at the highest ranks with Kathy Hochul assuming the role of governor.

Our big prediction is that New York will continue to wow the world with our remarkable resilience: We’ll harness creativity to build back businesses our work ethic to create jobs through infrastructure projects and our compassion for one another by complying with evolving safety standards as we all envision a healthier 2022.”

With the NFL season fast approaching some Spectrum cable customers are facing the loss of NFL Network and NFL RedZone.

Not because of a carriage dispute or a package change but because according to Spectrum they shouldn’t have been receiving those networks all along.

Tim Burke (AKA invaluable video resource @bubbaprog) posted the letter he received from Spectrum on Twitter in which Spectrum claims that a “routine review” found that Burke had been receiving NFL Network for years thanks to some sort of clerical or technical error.

After nine years Spectrum has concluded that I shouldn’t have been receiving NFL Network this whole time? pic.twitter.com/lGAfvf23BW — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) August 28 2021

Ah the ol’ nine-year incorrect authorization!

A quick Twitter search turned up a few more people who received similar notices and they were also not thrilled about it as you’d expect:

https://twitter.com/NoMalarkeyFL/status/1431012511411752962

https://twitter.com/packdan88/status/1430626543953485828

Presumably there are more people in a similar boat here too including some folks who maybe don’t open mail from their cable company who will be very surprised in a couple of weeks when they try to watch NFL coverage.

Spectrum via their customer service Twitter is responding by pointing customers to the premium sports tier mentioned in the letter:

Both channels are available in our Spectrum Sports Package. https://t.co/NdNbfZRhGm ^PS — Ask Spectrum (@Ask_Spectrum) August 25 2021

It’s let’s just say interesting that a “routine review” would take place just before football season and that it would turn up unauthorized channels for customers who have had them for years. (How routine can that review be?)

In any case for at least some of the affected customers any potential changes have yet to go into effect:

i have NFL Network on right now watching the Packers-Bills preseason game so they haven't even ""turned it off"" if I weren't supposed to be receiving it anyway — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) August 28 2021

So hey maybe the letter itself was incorrectly authorized!",,,,,,,,,

Production cutbacks ahead of Hurricane Ida exceed those during 2005’s devastating Katrina

Ida barreled into Cuba on Friday after intensifying into a hurricane with 85 mile per hour (130 kph) winds according to the National Hurricane Center. It could become “an extremely dangerous major hurricane” and threaten the U.S. Gulf Coast “catastrophic wind damage” the NHC said.

Top Gulf of Mexico oil producer Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it suspended production at seven offshore platforms and two processing plants onshore. BP Plc stopped work at four platforms. Both said they were evacuating offshore workers.

Chevron Corp. said it was shutting in production at its six Gulf of Mexico platforms and evacuating all workers. BHP and Equinor pulled workers from offshore facilities spokespeople said.

Oil companies had shut 59% of Gulf oil production and 49% of natural gas output according to the U.S. offshore regulator. A total of 90 offshore facilities were evacuated and 11 drilling vessels moved out of harm’s way.

“This could be comparable to hurricanes Laura and Harvey as far as intensity goes” said Joe Bastardi chief forecaster with Weatherbell Analytics referring to two hurricanes with winds of at least 130 mph (209 kph). “In the worst-case scenario it could go as high as a category 5” he said.

During Katrina a hurricane that wreaked havoc in Louisiana supplies were cut by up to 1.53 million barrels per day. Production outages lasted for weeks due to damaged platforms and refineries. Last year’s Delta shut-in up to 1.69 million barrels per day.

Gasoline manufacturer PBF Energy pared production at its Chalmette refinery said people familiar with the matter and Phillips 66 said it was releasing non-essential workers and halting output at its Alliance Louisiana plant. Shell also is stopping fuel production at its Norco refinery and chemical manufacturing at its Geismar Louisiana plant it said.

Oil prices rose nearly 2% on Friday and posted their biggest weekly gain in over a year. Some U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline prices gained for a fourth day with one type of gasoline feedstock up by 600% since Tuesday.

Over 45% of U.S. refining capacity lies along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana’s governor called on residents to prepare for a major storm President Joe Biden issued a federal emergency declaration and New Orleans and coastal officials asked residents to move to higher ground. Five storms made landfall in Louisiana last year causing billions of dollars in damage.

Soup kitchens. It’s happened before. What’s next — fast-food shortages?

Afraid so.

We’ve entered a twilight zone where even burger bun rationing is becoming conceivable.

And incidentally Wendy’s is changing their fries. It’s only the second time they’ve tinkered with the world-famous recipe in over 40 years. Meatless burgers we get — but switching fries?

See more: 2021 Burger-nomics: Beef Shares The Plate With Fast-Growing Plant-Based Options

Exactly what in the heck is going on?

It’s all about demand and supply in atypical order. Driving the point home PYMNTS and the rest of the world shuddered in August when McDonald’s temporarily dropped milkshakes from its U.K. menus citing supply chain disruptions (and possibly Brexit). Brits seemed unamused.

Read more: McDonald’s UK Out Of Milkshakes As Nationwide Shortages Frustrate Consumers

A golden arches spokesman said on Aug. 24 that “bottled drinks and milkshakes are temporarily unavailable in restaurants across England Scotland and Wales.”

When in Scotland scotch is always an option. But even the smokiest Glenlivet is no match for a creamy Mickey D’s milkshake. It’s all part of a multifaceted problem as the pandemic gums up the gears of global production and logistics causing stockpiles to dwindle — and meanwhile quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and fast-food chains are having a devil of a time attracting workers.

It’s a perfect storm for quick convenient comestibles — and it doesn’t stop there.

Wait until we start flapping on about chicken wings. Go ahead and laugh — it’s a real issue.

The Wing Ding and French Fry Fiddling

Chicken wings took flight in recent decades as a “center of the plate” entrée so much so that retail enterprises have been built around the delectable drumette. But now wings are being clipped.

We knew things were getting weird back in Q2 when chicken wing king WingStop pivoted to a different chicken part altogether launching its virtual ThighStop concept with delivery by DoorDash. The chain is making no bones about it saying in a statement that they are “addressing consumers’ fear of a chicken wing shortage head-on.” We draw the line at beaks.

It was Wendy’s that joked back in the 1980s that “parts is parts” in a famous TV campaign addressing the composition of chicken sandwiches. So are thighs but never mind that.

We want to know more about this Wendy’s French fry fiddling around.

CNN reported that the chain “is giving its top-selling menu item a makeover for the COVID era: a fry that retains more heat and keeps its crispiness longer compared to its predecessor. The upgraded fry which will be available nationwide by mid-September was created as more people shift their ordering preferences to drive-thrus and delivery because of the pandemic.”

Wendy’s President Kurt Kane told CNN Business that customers will “notice a difference as soon as they taste it. The proof will be in the tasting.” There’s a new “batter system” involved too.

Could be great. Guess we’ll find out in September. Until then get your old-school fry on — fast.

With Human Servers Scarce Chains Do the Robot

As thighs push out wings and millions of milkshakes go missing the USDA says there are no actual shortages just supply chain disruptions. That being the case don’t read anything into their recently announced Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to “convene stakeholders to diagnose problems and surface solutions — large and small public or private — that could help alleviate bottlenecks and supply constraints related to the economy’s reopening.”

Maybe start with wings.

But suppose the skies are filled with chicken wings tomorrow the fry fix is a total success and shakes shimmy back as if they never left. There’s still concern as to who will cook and serve it all.

CNBC reported in August that “in recent months Chipotle Mexican Grill has raised hourly wages and introduced referral bonuses while McDonald’s is chipping in millions of dollars to help its franchisees pay workers more and even piloting an emergency child care program.”

Staffing is so tough that mighty Chick-fil-A closed some dining rooms for want of servers.

That situation is taking a turn for the weird too as a paucity of restaurant workers is activating the robots. Clayton Wood CEO at robot-as-a-service (RaaS) company Picnic said that the digital shift — not COVID or pay or hours or the lack of milkshakes and chicken wings — is to blame.

“Digital orders means that you can get many many more orders instantaneously than you could ever get with a walk-in a call-in or a sit-down customer base” Wood said. “It’s an operational challenge … but it’s an opportunity for those who can get the right technology.”

Freaked out by all of this? Don’t be. Come hell or higher prices — another snag in the story — we expect QSR and fast-food to forge ahead. For now care to try our new fried chicken beaks?",,,,,,,,,

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15cGFuaGFuZGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYmF5LWNvdW50eS9wYW5hbWEtY2l0eS9mYWxsaW5nLWRlYnJpcy1uZWFybHktaGl0cy1wYW5hbWEtY2l0eS1jaHVyY2gv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlwYW5oYW5kbGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9iYXktY291bnR5L3BhbmFtYS1jaXR5L2ZhbGxpbmctZGVicmlzLW5lYXJseS1oaXRzLXBhbmFtYS1jaXR5LWNodXJjaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Falling debris nearly hits Panama City church,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/panama-city/falling-debris-nearly-hits-panama-city-church/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15cGFuaGFuZGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYmF5LWNvdW50eS9wYW5hbWEtY2l0eS9mYWxsaW5nLWRlYnJpcy1uZWFybHktaGl0cy1wYW5hbWEtY2l0eS1jaHVyY2gv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlwYW5oYW5kbGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9iYXktY291bnR5L3BhbmFtYS1jaXR5L2ZhbGxpbmctZGVicmlzLW5lYXJseS1oaXRzLXBhbmFtYS1jaXR5LWNodXJjaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtZmVhdHVyZXMvbm90LWFub3RoZXItY2h1cmNoLW1vdmllLXR5bGVyLXBlcnJ5LTEyMzU4OTQwMjQv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1mZWF0dXJlcy9ub3QtYW5vdGhlci1jaHVyY2gtbW92aWUtdHlsZXItcGVycnktMTIzNTg5NDAyNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Daniels on What Tyler Perry Might Think of ‘Not Another Church Movie:’ “I Hope He Gets the Joke”,"When Kevin Daniels got a call from his agent’s mom that she’d pitched him for the lead role in a film she was producing it didn’t take much for him to say “yes.”

“We had a zoom meeting and we kind of laughed and told some jokes and they were like ‘Hey you want to come down to Savannah?’ and I was like ‘I like Savannah. That sounds nice’” Daniels tells The Hollywood Reporter.

The film was Not Another Church Movie a spoof comedy of Tyler Perry’s Madea series written directed and produced by Johnny Mack (Real Husbands of Hollywood) which is set to hit theaters on May 10. In it Daniels stars as the hardworking Taylor Pherry a man given a mission directly from God (Jamie Foxx) to write a story about his dysfunctional family to save billionaire talk show host Hoprah Windfall’s plummeting TV ratings. However the devil (Mickey Rourke) has plans to sabotage the efforts of Pherry which play out like scenes from Perry’s popular comedies like Diary of a Mad Black Woman Daddy’s Little Girls Meet the Browns Madea Goes to Jail and I Can Do Bad All by Myself. Instead of Madea saving the day as she does in the original film series though Not Another Church Movie gives audiences MaDude also played by Daniels.

“It was really fun” the actor says of spoofing Perry in multiple roles for the film. “I wanted to pay tribute to what he was doing make a good joke about it but I didn’t want to imitate per se what he was doing.”

Daniels who jokingly calls himself a “30-year overnight success story” currently has a recurring role on Paramount+’s Frasierreboot and ABC‘s Will Trent while also starring in the play Monsters of the American Cinema a coming-of-age story about family and loss in the face of racism and homophobia in Los Angeles. The variety of characters he morphs into on-screen and on stage speaks to his philosophy as an actor.

“I just like to tell stories” Daniels says. “Whatever kind of comes up I feel it’d be great to do.”

Below Daniels chats with THR about the experience shooting Not Another Church Movie over 10 days in Georgia and what he hopes Perry will think about the film.

What did Johnny Mack explain to you about the premise of this film?

He used to write for Jamie Foxx and they’d been buddies for a long time and he’d written this script based on an experience he’d had and he gave it to Jamie. He was trying to get to Queen Latifah because he wanted her to play God and apparently Jamie read it and was like “You know Queen she’s busy. She doesn’t want to do this. I’ll play God. I got you” and that’s how it started. We grew up watching those spoof movies like Not Another Teen Movie and I think the Wayne Brothers did the last one so he wanted to add something else. Tyler has this huge wealth of movies and this empire so I think he thought “Oh that’d be great to pay homage to him and crack a couple of light jokes.” And I think that’s what it ended up being.

Did you watch every Madea movie to prep?

All of them. And I don’t know if you know what watching all those movies back-to-back might do to you —by the way I enjoy the characters it’s great — but after a while you’re like “Oh I’ve seen this OK that’s the same character.” But it was really fun. I wanted to pay tribute to what he was doing make a good joke about it but I didn’t want to imitate per se what he was doing. But I wanted people to know who it was.

You then had to play multiple roles in this spoof version. What was that like?

Because Tyler plays himself Madea Joe and a couple of other characters in his films when they brought it to me I thought “Oh it could be a bit much” But they said “We’ve got this actor we really love named Wayne Stamps and we think he’d be great against you” and he played Moe. So I played myself and MaDude and just played off Wayne and Wayne is so funny. I was like “Oh I gotta be on my toes.” Whenever I did the scenes with Taylor as MaDude I’d have my stand-in come in and he’d read lines with me. We’d crack jokes and then I’d switch and take the wig off and run to change. I’d never done anything like that before and I started thinking about Eddie Murphy in Nutty Professor and Coming to America and how cool it would be to get a chance to do all of these different characters.

Kevin Daniels Aaron Fallon

There are lot of surprise cameos in this film. Who did you have the most fun with on set?

Everything that Tisha Campbell did she just came with it. She was hilarious. Martin was my shit and we’re a small budget movie and we’re down in Savannah and they’ve got like one good trailer. So when they said “Tisha Campbell is here today” I said “Y’all better put Tisha Campbell in my trailer. I’ll take this little room in the church.”

Kyla [Pratt] and I got on like we had known each other forever. We just cracked jokes about everybody—and the lack of resources for the budget. And then I remember that scene with her because in the original script MaDude wasn’t in that storyline as much. And I was like “Look you’ve got Kyla Pratt in this movie and I’ll be damned if I’m not going to be in a scene with Kyla Pratt.” So I got them to dress me up and that entire scene about the letter and all of that was improv. I was proud of that.

Do you think the spoof comedy genre can have a resurgence in this comedic climate?

Absolutely. There’s an appetite for it. Those movies are really funny especially if you know the source material. It makes you want to go back and watch the other movies.

Have you heard of any response from Tyler Perry? How do you think he might react?

I have not heard anything outright. I hope that he gets the joke because really we can only make these movies because he has an empire because he’s done so much and such a prolific amount in Black cinema. My dream is that we could do a MaDude and Madea movie together or at least an appearance.

You’ve had a very diverse career between Broadway and dramas and police procedurals on TV. Is comedy where you’re most comfortable?

I’ve been really fortunate and blessed with my career. I tell people that I’m like a 30-year overnight success story. I’ve been here for a minute but it’s okay. Bit by bit. I did a lot of drama in New York. I went to Juilliard and one of my first roles was a Law & Order episode. And then I moved to L.A. and I met this casting director Jeff Greenberg who asked me had I thought about comedy and he put me in my first sitcom. I was like a doorman or something on Baby Bob and I did a few of those and then I ended up getting my first series regular for this comedy the Farrelly brothers were directing called I’m with Stupid. It was a pilot for NBC I was the lead and I was like “Oh it’s gonna be great.” Then there was a writers strike it didn’t get it picked up and I worked at the Cheesecake Factory. But I’ve had a lot of fun with comedy now because I realized you have to have great drama for comedy. Life is funny in itself and you better laugh about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbWlkaHVkc29ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9jaHVyY2gtc2FuY3R1YXJ5LWNlaWxpbmctY29sbGFwc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church sanctuary ceiling collapses,"PORT JERVIS – Merciful Love and Redemption (MLR) Holy Church and Cultural Center formerly known as Port Jervis’ Deerpark Reformed Church has been deemed as an unsafe structure with occupancy prohibited following the collapse of part of the ceiling in the sanctuary. The prohibition order was issued on May 7 by Port Jervis Code Enforcement Officer David Rivera.

Mayor Dominic Cicalese was saddened by the situation.

“We hope we find some sort of remedy to the situation. It is a sad situation. Deerpark Reformed Church is conveniently located on our East Main Street and has been a part of our community forever” he said.

Designated as the city’s oldest church the 30 East Main Street structure was built in 1868 for a congregation whose roots extend to 1737 early Dutch settlers.

The structure had been undergoing what current owners said were minor repairs and remodeling in anticipation of a planned public opening hoped for this summer.

A partner in MLR said he and others were in the building this week and last as work was being done on an empty lot next door – the former Sullivan Avenue School property currently owned by the City of Port Jervis. This partner said he was told by a DPW employee that bases were being installed for the Rotary Club to place flags in.

As backhoes and construction hammers were drilling in the blacktop he said he and others in the church felt vibrations st

rong tremors and loud sounds he described as earthquake-like.

He said he placed a call to the DPW and was told that this work had been approved to assist with an also-approved Rotary Club project. That project which is currently underway is the Rotary Club’s annual Flags for Heroes project which raises scholarship funds for graduating local seniors through community tributes to heroes.

On Tuesday of this week it was discovered upon entering the historic place of worship that a section of the ceiling had collapsed onto the pews and a portion of the sanctuary.

While the partner feels the structure roof and beams remain sound engineers have been called for an assessment to take place next week. He said repairs will require a tremendous amount of money to be invested but current owners remain committed to making sure the structure is rebuilt and preserved.

The plan is to continue for worship purposes as well as to serve as a community cultural center. The structure contains a theatre stage banquet hall and two acres of land and the owners say much public interest has been expressed for these uses. They continue to see a tremendous public benefit and potential for this historic building.

No one was able to be reached for comment from the DPW or building department. Rotary Club President Howard Kuperman said the Rotary Club is a community service organization and simply placed flag poles into receptacles as part of their annual fundraising scholarship effort."
CI,Cigna,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZXdtaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUuY29tL2ZyZXNoLWxvb2stY2lnbmEtZWxsaW90dC13YXZlLXN1cGVyLWN5Y2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Fresh Look At Cigna 's Elliott Wave Super Cycle,"In a case study article on Cigna published in October 2016 we examined how a fundamentally sound and undervalued stock can still drop nearly 90%. The reason for that crash didn’t lie in some company specific issue. Rather it happened to occur during the biggest financial crisis in 80 years.

Nevertheless we made the point that there was a complete impulse pattern on Cigna ‘s weekly logarithmic chart. According to the Elliott Wave theory a correction follows every impulse. This is how one could’ve anticipated the huge plunge in this otherwise strong and undervalued business.

Above is the chart we based our claim on. The impulse pattern labeled I-II-III-IV-V was so clear that any newbie could recognize it. At the 2007 top Cigna was trading at a three-year trailing P/E ratio of just 14. The company was financially sound profitable and growing. By any fundamental measure the stock was a strong buy below $60 a share.

Cigna Sent an Elliott Wave Warning in 2007

The only reason not to invest in Cigna in 2007 was the bearish Elliott Wave setup its weekly chart revealed. Corrections usually erase the entire fifth wave. The anticipated retracement in CI’s case was likely to drag the price down to the support of wave IV near $11. “At that price the stock would be ridiculously cheap trading at just 3 times earnings” the bulls would say. Yet this is exactly what happened.

Wave (II) caused a selloff to just $8 a share or just over 2 times the company’s 2007 earnings. Cigna was indeed ridiculously undervalued in late-2008. That undervaluation paired with the Elliott Wave rule that once a correction is over the prior trend resumes made CI a wonder to behold over the next 13 years.

In May 2021 the stock climbed to an all-time high of almost $273 a share. In the meantime the company earned $23 a share in 2020 and is expected to earn over $20 a share in 2021. At $273 Cigna was just as undervalued as it was in 2007 with a 2021 P/E of 13.6.

History Rhyming Itself Again?

Yet the stock is down 22.7% in the past three months anyway. At its current price of less than $211 Cigna looks like a real bargain. Apart from the never-ending health regulation chatter the company has never been in a better competitive position. Unfortunately for its shareholders its weekly chart is once again sending a bearish message.

The updated weekly chart above reveals Cigna ‘s phenomenal surge from the depths of the 2008 crisis. It also shows that an even bigger five-wave impulse has been formed. The 2008 bottom is still marked as the end of wave (II). The following surge to $227.13 in January 2018 must then be wave (III). Wave (IV) culminating in the coronavirus panic in 2020 dragged Cigna to sub-$120. The rally to $273 by May 2021 is logically labeled as wave (V).

13 years have passed Cigna is a bigger and stronger company now. And while the Elliott Wave impulse on its chart is also bigger it is still the same pattern. The consequences for investors should be similar as well. A decline to the support of wave (IV) can be expected. From the current price of $211 this translates into a 43% decline to roughly $120.

It looks like the weakness from $273 might be just the start. And if you think that at $120 Cigna would be ridiculously cheap at just 6 times earnings we agree. That doesn’t make it less likely to happen though.

Similar Elliott Wave setups occur in the Forex crypto and commodity markets as well. Our Elliott Wave Video Course can teach you how to uncover them yourself!﻿",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cause was a stalled storm that dumped nearly a foot-and-a-half of rain in 24 hours. It serves as a grim reminder for those living in the middle of the country that in many places it's not tornados or earthquakes that pose the greatest threat. It's flooding.

And much of the country could see more of it as soon as next week.

Tropical Storm Ida is set to make landfall on the Gulf Coast and move up the Mississippi River Valley on Monday and Tuesday. The National Weather Service said there's a chance for more heavy rains as remnants of the storm crawl north.

With this in mind The Enquirer talked to a few of the people who work to protect Hamilton County and Cincinnati from flooding.

'Flooding is our No. 1 hazard'

Nick Crossley is the Director of Hamilton County's Emergency Management Agency.

""Flooding is our No. 1 hazard"" Crossley said. ""We think about it all the time and we're always trying to get grant money and other things to try to fix it.""

He pointed to the 2016 floods in the areas of Norwood St. Bernard and Oakley when a storm resulted in nearly 1000 sewer back-ups hundreds of flooded basements and huge financial costs to repair the damage.

The flood in Tennessee this month and the Cincinnati neighborhood floods in 2016 share one thing in common.

In both cases the storm just stopped moving. In Tennessee that meant over 17 inches of rain in a day. In Norwood there were places that received 4 inches of rain in a single hour.

Luckily there was no loss of life in the 2016 Cincinnati neighborhood storm. While last weekend's storm in Tennessee created a flash flood in a creek that swept through Waverly the biggest issue in the Norwood area was flooded basements.

Crossley said in Tennessee the infrastructure was different because the town was much smaller and the environment much more rural. More homes were just swept away.

""What we saw here was 90-plus percent of the flooding filled up basements. You saw a little bit of road damage some yard damage and basements"" Crossley said.

Crossley said for people in the Cincinnati region signing up at AlertHC.org and getting proper insurance are probably the most practical things to do.

""You need to know what your risks are be able to receive warnings if they are issued for your area then you need to mitigate"" he said. ""(That's) either waterproofing your home or getting the right insurance.""

'It is high-intensity rains that are the most challenging for us'

There are two types of flooding that plague Cincinnati. The first type is the flooding that happened in 2016: rain comes down so quickly that it simply has no place to go. The second type is simply a rising river.

Eric Saylor is Cincinnati's principal engineer with the city's Stormwater Management Utility. It's his job to manage both types of flooding. He said the city has spent millions protecting itself from the Ohio River.

The Mill Creek Barrier Dam alone protects roughly $3 billion in public and private assets he said by keeping the Ohio River from backing up into the creek.

But unlike the river where predictions and models give authorities plenty of warning high volume rain and stalled storms pose a completely different set of challenges.

Saylor said 85% of Cincinnati has so-called ""combined sewers"" that handle stormwater and wastewater. That means that flooding can cause sewage to back up into people's homes.

Tackling this problem requires at least two agencies: SMU and the Metropolitan Sewer District.

""It's a challenging balancing act between our two utilities"" Saylor said. In fact both agencies and several other key players in the region are meeting to discuss this very issue in September.

While SMU and MSD are trying to address and fix old infrastructure there's also proactive work happening in all new developments to ensure that more problems are not created Saylor said. This includes more basins and green space to contain water and release it more slowly into the stormwater system.

While parts of the city still have issues Saylor is hopeful.

""We'll never be able to protect against everything but we've made remarkable improvements in the past 20 years"" he said.

But the weather may not keep cooperating.

""It is high-intensity rains that are the most challenging for us"" Saylor said.

More rain than before

National Weather Service data for Cincinnati shows the city is simply getting more rain than it used to.

Look at the past 40 years the agency reports the city is getting nearly 3 inches more rain each year now. April June and September account for most of the increase in rain.

Two of the 10 most rainy days on record for the Cincinnati area have occurred since 2018. The record is still held by March 9 1964 with 5.21 inches but a close second is August 16 2018 with 5.02 inches.

While the National Weather Service can predict river levels days and sometime even weeks out predicting flash flooding and issuing warnings is more complicated.

""That's on the very edges of our science"" Seth Binau science and operations officer told the Columbus Dispatch. ""It's not until it really starts to happen that we realize that this is going to produce a foot of rainfall in 24 hours.""

Binau said they work to track creek levels in real-time using a network of sensors the flooding equivalent to radar during a bad thunderstorm.

Flash flood warnings are issued right along with tornado warnings but Binau said the public's reaction to these warnings is different. Experts say flood warnings aren't as intimidating and people often believe they can outrun or even swim out of rising water.

What next week could look like

Flash flooding is hard to predict but so are the interactions of major weather systems.

The Mississippi River Valley could see extensive rain and even flooding next week due to Tropic Storm Ida but the National Weather Service states that a Canadian weather trough could limit how far north the storm can get.

""If the favorable jet dynamics combine with the remnants of Ida the heavy rain scenario is much more likely. However if the trough is faster and Ida is slow to move northward significant amounts of dry air would envelop the region keeping the heavy rain threat to the south.""

""For now the forecast does not lean toward either of the two scenarios"" the weather service said Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhdGhvbGljdGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9tZWV0LXRoZS1rbmlnaHRzLWFuZC1kYW1lcy1vZi10aGUtaG9seS1zZXB1bGNocmUvNzcwMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the Knights and Dames of the Holy Sepulchre,"by John Stegeman

If you have ever seen men and women dressed in white and black cloaks with a red Jerusalem cross at Mass you’ve encountered the knights and dames of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (EOHSJ).

EOHSJ is an ancient lay institution under the protection of the Holy See. Just how far back it goes is unclear. Some note a historical mention in 1336 while others trace the origin of the order all the way back to 1099 during the Crusades. Once responsible for the defense of the Holy Land the order was reconstituted under Pope Pius IX who tasked it with providing material and spiritual support to the Latin Patriarchate (similar to a diocese) of Jerusalem.

The order has around 30000 members in nearly 40 countries. The amount of aid rendered to the Latin Patriarchate each year by the order is nearly $12 million. While the lieutenancies (regional groupings) and sections (local chapters) do gather a few times a year the order is not a social club. Local events by the Cincinnati/Dayton section include an annual dinner for the archbishop a retreat and the celebration of one of the four feast days of the order. In addition to vesting for major events like ordinations if desired the knights and dames attend funerals of fellow members in regalia.

“We don’t come together as often [as some other organizations]” said Dan Andriacco who along with wife Ann serves as co-president for the Cincinnati/Dayton section. “When we do come together it is in solidarity with the Holy Land and to support each other support our archbishop and grow in holiness.”

According to a lieutenancy website members are distinguished by their practice of Christian faith living by high standards of moral conduct their involvement in the Church at the parish and diocesan levels their willingness to engage in the apostolate of the order their ecumenical spirit and their active interest in the needs and problems of the Holy Land.”

Membership is often by invitation. It includes a period of formation and each member must be approved by the Grand Magisterium in Rome. There are recurring financial obligations which include the cost of attending the annual meeting and investiture and an annual charitable contribution. Members are also expected to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and pray for those who live there.

“There is a financial commitment and every person who is interested has to assess his or her financial situation” Andriacco said. “Most Catholics make charitable contributions every year in addition to their own parish. For me it was an issue of prioritizing and saying this is where I want my contributions to go.”

“All that money goes [to the Latin Patriarchate]” he added. “All the money goes directly to help the cause of Christians in the Holy Land. We have heard again and again from the Latin patriarch and from our contacts in the schools that our support has been absolutely essential.”

This September between 350 and 400 knights and dames from the Northcentral Lieutenancy will gather in Cincinnati for the annual meeting and investiture. The Cincinnati/Dayton and Covington/Lexington sections are co-hosting. The meeting will take place at the Netherland Hotel in Cincinnati a promotions ceremony will be at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in Covington KY. and the investiture will take place at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Peter in Chains in Downtown Cincinnati.

During all the gathering members will keep the people of the Holy Land in their prayers.

“The biggest thing that Christians in the Holy Land will say is ‘Don’t forget us’” Andriacco said. “They’re always in our prayers and in our hearts as well as being a cause we contribute to financially.”

Ulasan atau review serta kritik menjadi bahasa yang selalu mengikuti suatu karya termasuk film. Perkembangan teknologi saat ini memperluas ruang penonton mengungkapkan ulasan serta kritikan terhadap film yang mereka saksikan.

Ada yang blak-blakan langsung menyatakan menyukai atau kurang menyukai suatu film lewat cuitan. Ada pula yang mengeksplorasikannya melalui utas di Twitter keterangan gambar di Instagram atau status di Facebook.

Ulasan-ulasan singkat dan sederhana acap kali ditemukan dalam bentuk podcast atau video penjelasan di YouTube. Tak lupa juga ulasan-ulasan di media cetak atau online seperti yang sudah ada lebih dari satu dekade lalu.

Sehingga sama seperti film ulasan dan kritik tersebut terus mengalami perkembangan dan perubahan dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Penerimaan terhadap review atau kritik film pun beragam ada yang kalem-kalem saja namun ada pula yang menggelinding menjadi kontroversi.

Asher Weiss dalam tesis berjudul The Evolution of Film Criticism from Professional Intellectual Analysis to a Democratic Phenomenon pada 2018 mengatakan evolusi kritik film membuat garis-garis di antara pengetahuan dan opini acak massa menjadi kabur.

""Sebagian besar kedalaman intelektual dan kebijaksanaan kritik para ahli film telah hilang di era digital karena teknologi terus bergerak tanpa henti untuk mengumpulkan konten dan opini massa"" tulis Asher Weiss.

Tak hanya itu ia juga mengemukakan terjadi pergeseran dari kritik yang kompleks ke arah ulasan singkat bahkan hanya melihat jumlah jempol (like/ dislike) untuk menilai sebuah film.

Sehingga bagaimana sebenarnya konsep dasar kritik film?

Cendekiawan seni sekaligus Ketua Akademi Jakarta Seno Gumira Ajidarma menilai beberapa hal menjadi dasar dalam mengkritik sebuah film terutama dari segi jurnalistik. Menurutnya kritik yang menjadi penilaian bagus atau jelek suatu film seharusnya sudah tidak berlaku lagi.

""Saya kira yang penting bukan menilai karena menilai dalam kritik apapun sudah tidak musim. Harus diutamakan memberikan keterangan informasi di balik film itu"" kata Seno Gumira kepada CNNIndonesia.com beberapa waktu lalu.

Ia pun menganalogikan penulis kritik sebagai pelayan di restoran. Menurutnya apabila penulis kritik seperti pelayan restoran yang kreatif maka mereka bisa menjelaskan detail film yang ditonton beserta contoh atau data pendukungnya.

""Jadi lebih informatif. Pendekatan yang benar adalah seorang kritikus itu bisa mengurai bukan menilai. Dia tidak melihat esensi tapi konstruksi"" katanya.

Ia menekankan penonton adalah produsen makna atau yang memberi arti dari sebuah film. Karena film pada dasarnya dibuat untuk disaksikan penonton.

""Norak atau enggak norak penonton yang menentukan. Banyak orang menilai satu film bagus kemudian yang bilang enggak bagus berarti seleranya rendah? Itu salah"" Seno menegaskan.

""Begini [kritik yang baik] yang memberi kemungkinan pembaca kritik itu berpikir. Dia mengajak berpikir tidak menggiring mengarahkan apalagi pamer. Menggabungkan itu memang susah dari pengalaman kritis bahasa jurnalistik. Makanya kritik itu is an art.""

- Sisa-sisa kerangka sepasang kekasih yang terkubur bersama lebih dari 1.500 tahun yang lalu di Cina utara ditemukan dalam pelukan abadi di peti mati. Peneliti menyebutkan kemungkinan sang wanita rela dikuburkan hidup-hidup bersama suaminya yang lebih dulu meninggal.""Ini adalah [pasangan] pertama yang ditemukan dalam pelukan cinta seperti itu di mana saja kapan saja di China"" pemimpin peneliti studi Qian Wang seorang profesor di Departemen Ilmu Biomedis di Texas A&M College of Dentistry mengatakan kepada Live Science di email.Para arkeolog menemukan makam itu pada Juni 2020 selama penggalian kuburan yang telah dibuka selama pekerjaan konstruksi di provinsi Shanxi. Pemakaman itu berisi sekitar 600 penguburan dari Xianbei sebuah kelompok nomaden kuno di Cina utara yang berasimilasi dengan budaya Cina Han.Dari hasil peninggalan barang-barang keramik yang ada di area makam itu diketahui kalau pemakaman ini berasal dari Dinasti Wei Utara (386-534 M).Karena pemakaman pasangan itu unik para arkeolog memutuskan untuk tidak menggali sisa-sisa kerangka sepenuhnya. Sebagai gantinya tim membiarkan mereka terjalin sehingga keduanya bisa dipajang di pameran museum.""Para arkeolog menemukan dua pasangan lain terkubur bersama di kuburan yang sama; tetapi pasangan ini tidak berpelukan dengan erat dan para wanita tidak mengenakan cincin kata Wang.Penggalian makam ini mengungkapkan banyak hal tentang sepasang kekasih tersebut. Pria itu tingginya sekitar 1615 cm dan mengalami beberapa luka termasuk patah lengan bagian jari yang hilang di tangan kanannya dan taji tulang di kaki kanannya. Dia kemungkinan meninggal di usia antara 29 dan 35 kata para peneliti.Sedangkan wanitanya cukup sehat ketika dia meninggal. Tingginya sekitar 1571 cm dan hanya memiliki beberapa masalah gigi termasuk gigi berlubang. Dia kemungkinan meninggal antara usia 35 dan 40.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY2FudGlrLnRlbXBvLmNvL3JlYWQvMTQ5OTg0MS9qYXR1aC1jaW50YS1iaWtpbi1vcmFuZy10ZXJsaWhhdC1sZWJpaC1tdWRhLWluaS01LWFsYXNhbm55YdIBX2h0dHBzOi8vY2FudGlrLnRlbXBvLmNvL2FtcC8xNDk5ODQxL2phdHVoLWNpbnRhLWJpa2luLW9yYW5nLXRlcmxpaGF0LWxlYmloLW11ZGEtaW5pLTUtYWxhc2Fubnlh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jatuh Cinta Bikin Orang Terlihat Lebih Muda Ini 5 Alasannya,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvZGVzdGluYXRpb24vcHJpbGEtYXJvZmFuaS90ZW1wYXQtd2lzYXRhLWluZG9uZXNpYS1iaWtpbi1wdXR1cy1jaW50YdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvZGVzdGluYXRpb24vYW1wL3ByaWxhLWFyb2ZhbmkvdGVtcGF0LXdpc2F0YS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtYmlraW4tcHV0dXMtY2ludGE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Tempat Wisata Indonesia yang Bikin Putus Cinta Mitos atau Fakta?,"Follow IDN Times untuk mendapatkan informasi terkini.

Wanita 27 tahun mendaftarkan gugatan pada tanggal 14 April 2021 dengan nomor perkara 1625/Pdt.G/2021/PA.JS.

Dalam status perkara yang terdapat pada Sistem Informasi Pengadilan Perkara (SIPP) Pengadilan Agama Jakarta Selatan diketahui presenter olah raga itu yang menggugat sang suami Ilham Akbar Prawira.

Dita Fakhrana naik pelaminan dengan Ilham Prawira Akbar pada Maret 2020. Siapa sangka keduanya bertemu di media sosial Instagram. Berawal dari kenalan secara virtual keduanya merasa cocok dan akhirnya memutuskan untuk menjalin hubungan lebih serius. Keduanya mempublikasikan hubungannya sejak November 2019.

Setahun menikah hubungan pasangan ini terlihat adem ayem dan jauh dari isu miring keduanya pun kerap mengunggah momen kebersamaan di Instagram. Namun baik Dita Fakhrana dan Ilham Akbar kini kompak menghapus foto bersama di Instagram masing-masing.

Karena itulah isu miring soal rumah tangga mereka santer dibicarakan warganet. Berdasarkan keterangan Humas PA Jakarta Selatan Dita Fakhrana dan Ilham Prawira masih suami istri hingga saat ini karena saat sidang pertama keduanya tidak hadir dan ternyata tergugat tidak ditemukan atau tidak bertempat tinggal dicantumkan maka gugatan perceraian dibatalkan."

Prithviraj ""Roger"" Bhikha a former senior director of global supplier management was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false and fraudulent tax return.

Bhikha 52 of San Francisco pleaded guilty in November and was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco by Charles R. Breyer senior U.S. district judge

In his plea agreement Bhikha admitted to receiving kickbacks from a vendor creating his own vendor for projects he was working on -- in violation of company policy -- and concealing it from his employer. He also admitted to omitting more than $9 million from foreign accounts resulting in an underpayment of more than $2.5 million in federal income taxes.

The sentencing requires Bhikha to pay $1.15 million in restitution to Cisco more than $2.5 million to the IRS as well as to forfeit two pieces of San Francisco real estate.

Bhikha remains out on bail and is scheduled to surrender into custody Oct. 28.

The analyst firm’s inaugural ZTNA New Wave assessed 15 vendors with at least $5 million annual ZTNA revenues and designated the above-mentioned five as “Leaders.” The next group “Strong Performers” includes Citrix Akamai Netskope and Google. And finally Forrester labeled Proofpoint Cisco Cloudflare Wandera Tencent Security and Juniper Networks “Contenders.” Cisco and Proofpoint while ranked didn’t participate.

Unlike its regular Forrester Wave report the New Wave evaluates emerging technologies. The analysts spent two hours with each vendor and ranked them against 10 criteria. They positioned the 15 on the wave chart based on ZTNA product and strategy. Forrester also reviewed the companies’ market presence.

Zscaler ZTNA

Zscaler has the largest ZTNA market presence according to Forrester and it is also the only vendor that doesn’t have any “needs improvement” areas on its scorecard. However it does say Zscaler must add support for server-initiated applications like VoIP.

“Zscaler has the greatest ZTNA mindshare among Forrester clients” the report says. “The vendor is enrolling organizations with tens of thousands and in some cases hundreds of thousands of users.”

ZTNA which reduces organizations’ attack surfaces by setting secure boundaries around applications and workloads became an increasingly attractive alternative to VPNs during the pandemic and resulting remote workforce. And as such it plays a major role in edge-cloud delivered security and networking capabilities or secure access service edge (SASE) — Forrester calls this “zero-trust edge.”

While Forrester’s latest report focuses on ZTNA Zscaler also ranks at the top of SASE leaderboards. The cybersecurity vendor has pulled several recent high-profile SASE and ZTNA partnerships with the likes of IBM and CrowdStrike and Verizon offers a managed SASE service that uses Zscaler’s ZTNA and secure web gateway.

Palo Alto Networks ZTNA

Palo Alto Networks’ ZTNA product Prisma Access received high marks for its strong combination of deployment options IDP integration and non-web apps. It can be self-hosted deployed as software-as-a-service or used in hybrid environments.

“The vendor’s support for authenticating and authorizing third parties is superior to other ZTNA solutions” Forrester wrote.

However Palo Alto Networks needs to improve its endpoint offering the scorecard says. “Customers say the mobile experience Prisma Access still needs improvement and they report some technical challenges with the endpoint software for desktops and laptops.”

In a blog post about the Forrester New Wave Palo Alto Networks SVP and GM Anand Oswal says ZTNA plays a crucial role in its — and any — SASE platform. “ZTNA offers organizations scalable remote access consistent identity-based access control and continuous trust assessment wherever data or users are” he wrote.

And on the vendor’s most recent earnings call earlier this month CEO Nikesh Arora said Palo Alto Networks nearly doubled its SASE customer count during the quarter to roughly 2500. Of those 25% were new customers.

AppGate ZTNA

AppGate a small Scandanavian network security startup is one of the few vendors evaluated in the ZTNA New Wave that doesn’t offer a full SASE stack. Forrester says while it offers “exceptional” integrations with services like IT service management and configuration management database it lags behind its competitors in inline security inspection.

“ZTNA solutions are usually inline in order to provide authentication and contextual authorization” the report says. “AppGate’s inline security inspection could be improved by adding more behavioral analytics and machine learning.”

VMware ZTNA

VMware on the other hand has superior inline security inspection via technologies including watermarking risk scoring and behavioral analytics Forrester says. Its ZTNA which is part of VMware’s larger SASE platform integrates well with its own endpoint and device security products as well as major third-party vendors the report adds.

However VMware needs to improve its legacy application support according to the New Wave. Companies with numerous non-web applications aren’t a good fit for VMware’s ZTNA until it improves its remote desktop capabilities.

Perimeter 81 ZTNA

The final ZTNA “Leader” Perimeter 81 is the youngest of the bunch. The 3-year-old startup which has raised $65 million to date for its ZTNA and SASE software focuses on cloud-delivered and managed SaaS deployments. Forester calls out Perimeter 81’s ability to handle non-web applications like VoIP as its major differentiator but says it still needs to add integration with Microsoft endpoint security and apply more inline security and analytics.

Perimeter 81’s ZTNA is a good fit for smaller enterprises that want to rapidly deploy ZTNA as a service the report says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL3JveGFubmUtbG9wZXotb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MjI0NTU5MjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roxanne Lopez Obituary (1959 - 2021) - Meridian ID - Idaho Statesman,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/idahostatesman/name/roxanne-lopez-obituary?id=22455929 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9pZGFob3N0YXRlc21hbi9uYW1lL3JveGFubmUtbG9wZXotb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MjI0NTU5MjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vam9icy93YXItZm9yLXRlY2gtdGFsZW50LWlzLXBsYXlpbmctb3V0LW9uLW5vbi1paXQtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctY29sbGVnZS1jYW1wdXNlcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTcwNzA2Ny5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2pvYnMvd2FyLWZvci10ZWNoLXRhbGVudC1pcy1wbGF5aW5nLW91dC1vbi1ub24taWl0LWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLWNvbGxlZ2UtY2FtcHVzZXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NzA3MDY3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,War for tech talent is playing out on non-IIT engineering college campuses,The war for tech talent is now playing out on non-IIT engineering college campuses  as recruiters including Microsoft Oracle Qualcomm Intel Sprinklr Google and Cisco swoop in to hire the brightest students.Institutes such as Delhi Technological University BITS Pilani  RV College of Engineering and UPES which started final placements early in end-July or August said this year is shaping up to be one of the best ever.At VIT the highest package has gone up 70% over last year to Rs 75 lakh; at NIT Calicut the top offer so far has been Rs 67.6 lakh from startup Traceable AI a 56% jump from the Class of 2021. At DTU the average salary for the 500-odd students placed till now is Rs 22 lakh nearly 16% higher compared with this time last year.“The fight for talent this year is much more intense” said Rajesh Rohilla dean training and placement DTU. Nearly half the students already placed at DTU have bagged packages of Rs 20 lakh-plus.Covid has also turned out to be a boon in disguise as students have got to work on longer-duration internship projects online parallelly with their studies. This has led to a higher pre-placement offer conversion rate as companies have observed their work over a longer time said Rohilla.“It could be one of the best years in terms of placement so far” said V Samuel Rajkumar director at VIT’s Career Development Centre. More than 2000 of the institute’s 7500 registered students have been placed already; over 100 have received offers upwards of Rs 25 lakh.Intel and Nokia have hired more than 100 students each; Societe Generale has hired 75 and Microsoft 21 students. Video-calling platform Dyte’s offer of Rs 75 lakh is the highest so far.Many companies this year have increased their compensation packages said Sajith V head of Centre for Training and Placement at NIT Calicut.Four B-Tech students have bagged the top package of Rs 67.6 lakh. Goldman Sachs Oracle Cisco Qualcomm Texas Instruments Udaan and Bajaj Auto are among the companies that have made offers to 231 students so far.Around 180 students have been placed within a week at Bengaluru’s RV College of Engineering with an average package of Rs 20.5 lakh. The highest offer so far has been Rs 47.5 lakh from SaaS startup Clumio.“There’s been a 20-30% hike in the CTCs of several companies” said D Ranganath dean placement and training at RVCE.Harshvendra Soin global chief people officer Tech Mahindra said: “With accelerated digitalisation across organisations and sectors the demand for niche skills in emerging technologies has also accelerated. Our plan is to increase the fresher intake by 3x in this fiscal year through our flagship global campus hiring programmes. For this we are engaged with leading educational campuses across the country.”IT/ITes startups and tech firms are the most aggressive in terms of hiring but core sector companies which were impacted because of the pandemic last year are also expected to stage a comeback said T.

By this time Binay thinks she is halfway through the digital roadmap. The fiber optic infrastructure for connectivity has been put in place since 2017 allowing the city to provide free internet to students.

“Instead of giving internet allowance—which you cannot monitor because you can’t monitor if they are doing Facebook or games—we allot a time for free and block the sites that they can’t access so you are still able to control and make sure that students are really using the internet for school” she said.

After putting the broadband backbone in place Makati also upgraded its mobile command center purchased body cameras and upgraded other basic facilities.

Another big task however was to build up the database needed to make various tech solutions work. As such the Makatizen ID card was launched allowing the city to generate pertinent data without having to rely on the Philippine Statistics Office.

But the best thing is that the digitalization journey has been achieved at little or no cost to the city. The big ticket projects have been executed through public-private partnerships (PPPs) while some solutions had come for free in exchange for Makati becoming the local prototype of technologies that other local government units (LGUs) or organizations can eventually procure.

“We really don’t mind if we are test cases and we are used by companies as benchmarks for other local government units to emulate or to share that knowledge that we do acquire from partnerships with the private sector whether it be a PPP whether it be a straight-out procurement or whether it be a donation. We always want to experiment and be a test case for other LGUs to see if this solution works for them or not” Binay said in a recent roundtable discussion.

Because of digital technology Binay said Makati had been able to provide efficient service to constituents without compromising their health especially when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in 2020.

“Everything is within their fingertips and it’s within the comfort of their homes” Binay said. “The payments of taxes we had to rush it to be able to accommodate our taxpayers this year” Binay said adding that the city would not be able to encourage its constituents to pay taxes if they would have to fall in line to do it during this pandemic.

Partnership with Cisco

Even prior to the pandemic the Makati LGU has been working with tech giant Cisco on more digitalization initiatives.

Using Cisco’s Webex Suite—a unified purpose-built suite for hybrid work that combines tools across meetings calling messaging events and polling—many of the LGU’s crucial meetings had found a suitable platform.

“During the lockdown we also used Webex to be able to provide our marriage counseling which is a requirement for you to get your marriage license. So we essentially use Webex to do the webinars and to do all the compliance (requirements) as these were still necessary even during the lockdown” she said.

Recently Makati also tapped Cisco’s Meraki COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Solution a suite of smart technology including temperature and humidity sensors door open/close sensors sensor cameras wireless access points and other networking devices.

“That will help us monitor control and regulate our vaccines because of the sheer number as well as [track] the deployment and ensure that temperature control is maintained” she said.

Binay sees this solution making inventory management easier eliminating risks of vaccine theft as human intervention will be minimized in tracking vaccine distribution.

The solution is seen to address three critical challenges. One is the physical security of vaccine storage where logs are created to know who had access to the vaccines as well as ensuring the physical integrity of the vaccines through temperature and humidity monitoring. Another is to boost capability to set up mobile and remote vaccine distribution sites through mobile-enabled ready-to-go solution for curbside drive-through or in-field vaccine deliveries. Lastly the solution is seen to improve management of traffic flow and safety to enable real-time face-mask detection provide 24/7 indoor/outdoor video surveillance assist with risk mitigation and deliver immediate alerting.

Another Cisco solution harnessed by Makati is Konektado a communication solution created specifically for disaster readiness and mitigation. Konektado includes routers switches IP phones and a generator that can turn any location into a disaster response command center. It can connect laptops mobile phones and other Wi-Fi-ready devices to the internet. In the absence of a disaster Konektado can easily be used to extend connectivity for digital learning or any other service the city aims to provide.

“This will help us with our digital learning since I don’t think we will be having any face-to-face classes anytime soon” Binay said.

But even when face-to-face classes resume Binay said Makati could still use Konektado to reach out to out-of-school youth or kids who have difficulty going to school.

Ugnayan 2030

The partnership with Makati is part of Cisco’s digital acceleration program UGNAYAN 2030 a collaboration framework with government leaders industry and academia aimed at building greater digital resilience by unlocking the value of digitization in the Philippines.

Cisco aims to bridge three factors that impede implementation: uneven access to ICT resources weak cross-organizational structure and ICT adoption and limited expertise and manpower.

Through UGNAYAN 2030 Cisco intends to invest its technologies infrastructure tools knowledge and expertise to empower crucial stakeholders to enact their digital transformation plans.

There are three key pillars and flagship projects that Cisco intends to focus on as part of UGNAYAN 2030: connectivity in building a high-speed and reliable information highway; collaboration in building an integrated and inclusive ecosystem; and cybersecurity.

“There has never been more urgency for institutions to deliver digital-first services. As we know there are still many pieces that are still missing before we can really consider ourselves our country our cities to be digitally transformed” said Karrie Ilagan managing director of Cisco Philippines.

“We also know that this pandemic has become a big challenge and will not be the last one that will [turn] our world upside down. And we see every day what happens when we are not ready. So it’s very very important that digital resilience is in place” she added.

While institutions from the public and private sectors have written up several plans and created roadmaps for the country’s digital journey Ilagan said there’s an urgent need to flesh out these plans now amid a prolonged pandemic.

“Organizations know what to do but the real challenge is being able to do it. At Cisco we are committed to work with all stakeholders to play a role in building digital resilience across the country” she said.

In the case of Makati Binay said a lot would still have to be done and fixed at the LGU. More and more services in city hall will be digitized she said. Since technology keeps on changing she added that the city would always have to keep its systems up to speed and responsive to the needs of the constituents."

The listing of LIC is set to be India's biggest ever IPO with the government aiming to raise Rs 800 billion-900 billion ($11 bln-12.2 bln) from its stake sale.

In all the government plans to raise Rs 1.75 trillion from a privatisation programme in the current fiscal year ending in March one of the sources said.

It has selected 10 investment banks including Goldman Sachs Citigroup and SBI Capital Market to handle the LIC initial public offering the two government sources said.

The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.

""The potential size of the IPO is expected to be far larger than any precedent in Indian markets"" one of the sources said adding the LIC IPO has been put on a fast track as it could help partly meet budgetary spending plans.

The government plans to spend Rs 34.83 trillion including capital spending of Rs 5.54 trillion in the current financial year.

A ministerial panel called the Alternative Mechanism on strategic Divestment is expected to decide soon on the size of the stake to be sold. It could be around 10% sold in two tranches the two government sources said.

Bank privatisation

The government had previously announced plans to sell at least two state-run banks in the current fiscal year as part of its privatisation plans and to consolidate state banks but has not named the banks.

Plans to privatise the proposed two banks were going slowly due to various procedural issues as well as internal assessments indicating limited appetite among investors to buy at the desired value said one of the sources a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter.

Another banking industry source who participated in discussions said despite a bullish market there were few takers for weak banks saddled with bad loans.

""There have been discussions on the sale of banks but thinking now has shifted to first look at monetising other assets and then come to banks after that"" the source said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXRzL2dvdnQtc2VsZWN0cy0xMC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWJhbmtzLXRvLW1hbmFnZS1saWNzLW1lZ2EtaXBvL2FydGljbGUzNjE0MjA2MS5lY2XSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0cy9nb3Z0LXNlbGVjdHMtMTAtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1iYW5rcy10by1tYW5hZ2UtbGljcy1tZWdhLWlwby9hcnRpY2xlMzYxNDIwNjEuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Govt selects 10 investment banks to manage LIC’s mega IPO,"India has selected 10 investment banks including Goldman Sachs Citigroup and SBI Capital Market to handle the initial public offering of Life Insurance Corp of India two government sources said in what is set to be the country's biggest ever IPO.

In his 10th MLB season it's as true as it is surprising.,PHILADELPHIA — Washington is past the point in its relationship with Bryce Harper that there is much left to unearth. He grew up as a player in the District became a star in the District and left even though he wanted to stay — for reasons that were rehashed and retold long ago. When he arrives for a series that begins Monday night against the Nationals his reality is this: “I’m a Phillie when I walk out onto the field and a Phillie when I walk off it as well and I absolutely love it here.” He will be booed when he comes to the plate even if booing him is tired and unnecessary.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waGlsbGllcy9waGlsbGllcy1iYXNlYmFsbC1kZWZlYXQtYXJpem9uYS1kaWFtb25kYmFja3MtcmFuZ2VyLXN1YXJlei1mcmVkZHktZ2FsdmlzLTIwMjEwODI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Phillies got a strong start from Ranger Suárez then survived a Diamondbacks rally.,"Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Freddy Galvis knocks in two runs in the fifth inning as the Phillies play the Arizona Diamondbacks at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia Pa. on August 29 2021. .

The Phillies rolled nothing but sevens during their four-game series with the Arizona Diamondbacks and came out of it winning their last three contests.

After scoring seven runs in each of the first three games the Phillies matched that figure once again on Sunday and defeated the Diamondbacks 7-4 to take the final three games of the series at Citizens Bank Park and give them some momentum as they embark on a nine-game road trip beginning Monday in Washington. They remained 4 1/2 games behind the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves who beat San Francisco 9-0.

Since July 1 the Phillies are 21-3 when they score five or more runs including 14 wins in their last 15. The only loss in that stretch came Thursday night when they scored five runs in the ninth but fell short in Arizona’s 8-7 victory.

In their nine games before Thursday the Phils had averaged 3.2 runs per game.

“I think our pitching’s been pretty good I do” manager Joe Girardi said. “But I think the key there is five runs … because we’ve lost some 3-to-2′s and 2-to-1′s and that sort of thing so I think consistent offense is a big thing for us.”

Of course that task is made harder with the loss of first baseman Rhys Hoskins who will have season-ending surgery to repair a tear in his lower abdomen.

One of the major contributions came from Freddy Galvis who had been 1-for-11 at the plate in his second stint as a Phillie but drove in three runs Sunday. The big blow came in the fifth when he served a soft line drive to center that fell in and scored Bryce Harper and Andrew McCutchen to make the score 5-1.

“It was really good” Galvis said. “I tried to stay short to the ball. I’m glad it happened.

“The team did a really good job. The offense was pretty good today and we had some pretty good pitching and defense too. I think we played really good as a team.”

Galvis also played a role in the Phillies’ two-run first inning off Arizona starter Madison Bumgarner. After McCutchen singled home Jean Segura with the initial run Galvis lifted a sacrifice fly to center that scored J.T. Realmuto.

When the Diamondbacks cut the lead to 5-4 in the eighth the Phillies answered with back-to-back RBI triples from Rafael Marchán and Travis Jankowski to get to that magical seven-run mark.

“You’ve got to get other people to step up” Girardi said. “Freddy had a good day. Marchán had a good day. You just need those types of things to happen. Jean had a good day and so did Harp but you need those things to happen where other guys help.”

The Ranger

After setting career highs for innings (6 2/3) strikeouts (seven) and pitches (99) while allowing just one run last Tuesday against Tampa Bay left-hander Ranger Suárez again was effective allowing five hits and one run in 5 1/3 innings of work with five strikeouts and 95 pitches.

One of his better pitches was a slider he’d been working on.

“I’ve been throwing that pitch in the bullpen and today I felt like I had more command of it more control of it so I used it more” Suárez said through an interpreter.

He gave up a run on three hits in the second but limited the Diamondbacks to one baserunner in the next three innings none of whom advanced past first. He was lifted after walking Christian Walker in the sixth but J.D. Hammer got the last two outs.

Suárez who entered the game with a 1.46 earned run average third-lowest of any major league pitcher with at least 60 innings of work ended it with a 1.48 ERA.

Who’s on first?

Realmuto started at first base for the first time this season his 10th game of the year at that position but he left the game following the fifth inning with left ankle soreness. Brad Miller replaced him at first.

The initial indication was that Realmuto who went 1-for-2 with a walk and a run scored had fouled a ball off his foot while batting in the fifth. But Girardi said he thought it was Realmuto’s final swing “where his ankle kind of rolled.”

“He’s day to day” the manager said. “I’ll see [Monday] how he feels but right now we’re considering him day to day and that’s what he’s calling it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhhdGJhbGxzb3V0dGFoZXJlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L3BoaWxsaWVzLWhpc3RvcnktMjAwOC1zdGFyLWN1cnJlbnQtbWxiLXBsYXllci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phillies: Comparing each 2008 star to a current MLB player,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waGlsbGllcy9waGlsbGllcy1kaWFtb25kYmFja3Mtd2luLWplYW4tc2VndXJhLWJyeWNlLWhhcnBlci0yMDIxMDgyOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jean Segura lifts Phillies in extra innings other observations from 7-6 win over Diamondbacks,"Phils Jean Segura runs to first base after driving in the winning run in the 11th inning of the Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Philadelphia Phillies MLB game at Citizens Bank Park in Phila.

Jean Segura fouled off the seventh pitch he saw in Friday’s 11th inning when the fans along the first-base line at Citizens Bank Park started chanting his name. It was a long night as the Phillies blew a lead in the ninth fell behind in the 10th and tied it in the bottom of the inning. But the finish finally felt near.

“I didn’t hear anything” Segura said.

He delivered anyway dropping a single into right field to cap a 7-6 win over the Diamondbacks. Ian Kennedy was responsible for the franchise-record 26th blown save in the ninth Enyel De Los Santos dug a two-run hole in the 10th and Brad Miller dug the Phils out with a two-run homer before Segura finished it an inning later.

It was a needed victory as it came just 24 hours after perhaps their most dire day of the season. The Phillies still trail Atlanta by 51/2 games in the National League East but the mood in the clubhouse is much different than it was on Thursday.

“It was a really really good game for us. Bouncing back come from behind” Segura said. “We needed that type of game to get going because the way we’ve played lately has not been great.”

On Thursday the Phillies lost Rhys Hoskins to season-ending surgery scratched Zach Eflin because of a knee injury that could cost him the rest of the season and lost yet another game to the National League’s worst team to drop below .500. Their playoff odds (10.3% on Friday morning per FanGraphs) dropped to their lowest point in seven weeks.

From the outside it felt like the walls were closing in. But with five weeks remaining the Phillies have little choice but to cling to their chances and hope hitters like Segura Bryce Harper and J.T. Realmuto can carry them.

“It’s the personality inside you it’s the fight in you right?” Girardi said before the game. “You always have fight in you. I believe I do. I believe our guys do. You have to have that fight in you. To me this is what life is about right? Get knocked down you have to get back up and I’ve seen our guys do it a number of times and I believe they’re capable.”

Heavy hitters

If the Phillies are to make an unlikely run to the postseason they’ll have to do it by riding the bats of Harper and Realmuto. They drove in the team’s first four runs on Friday which was enough to get the Phils within two outs of a win. Harper hit a two-run shot in the third for his 25th homer of the season and Realmuto ripped a two-run single in the seventh after Arizona intentionally walked Harper to load the bases. Without Hoskins Harper and Realmuto’s production is crucial over the final weeks.

Harper went 2-for-3 with two walks and raised his OPS to 1.001 which trails only San Diego’s Fernando Tatis Jr. for the major league lead. The two are the front-runners for the National League MVP Award but the winner might be the player who can push his team to the postseason. The Padres are still in the mix for the wild card after falling out of position last week for the second wild-card spot.

“Harper is swinging the bat really really good” Segura said. “He’s disciplined at the plate and he’s squaring balls up. He’s been huge for us all year long. To be able to see his name in the lineup every day is something you really respect because there’s not many people who are able to play every day especially at this level. It’s unbelievable that this guy is able to do it each and every day.”

Bradley slowed by shoulder

Girardi used Enyel De Los Santos for the 10th and 11th innings even though Archie Bradley was in the bullpen and had not pitched since Tuesday.

“Not available” Girardi said. “His shoulder. Just not available. I think he’ll be available [Saturday].”

Is Realmuto hurt?

Joe Girardi said before the game that the Phillies will replace Hoskins at first base with Realmuto and Segura may have dropped some insight into why the Phillies are moving Realmuto away from behind the plate.

Realmuto Segura said is dealing with discomfort in his right shoulder. Girardi said Realmuto will play first on Saturday while Rafael Marchan catches.

“I know J.T. is dealing with shoulder problems” Segura said. “I just think the way he throws the baseball is not the same J.T. that we all know.”

Miller’s blast

Miller didn’t make any excuses on Thursday night about his struggles lately at the plate. He let his bat do the talking on Friday by ripping a two-run homer with one out in the ninth to tie the game. Miller dropped his bat almost as soon as he made contact and looked into the Phillies’ dugout. It was easy to see what that meant for Miller who will see an expanded role down the stretch since Hoskins is out.

“That’s the great thing about our game you always get a chance the next day it seems like” Girardi said. “Every once in a while you get a day off but he had a chance and he came up big.”

Historic blown save

Ian Kennedy has been with the Phillies for less than a month but his blown save in the ninth inning helped make history. It was the team’s franchise-record 26th blown save which eclipsed the 25 saves they blew in 2004. Kennedy entered the ninth with a two-run lead before allowing a lead-off single to Pavin Smith and a two-run homer to Norristown’s Christian Walker.

Nola’s night

Aaron Nola seemed to run out of gas in the sixth inning and he was replaced after allowing an RBI triple on his 93rd pitch. Nola earned the first out of the sixth by popping up Bryan Holaday but the catcher -- who spent a spring with the Phillies in 2017 -- worked a nine-pitch at-bat that may have fatigued Nola. Josh Rojas followed with a triple to right and that was it for Nola.

“I felt fine” Nola said. “As a team they fouled off a lot of pitches. I felt fine.

“I felt good tonight. My stuff felt good. Fastball command changeup felt good. Curveball felt good. I didn’t have any walks and felt like I was getting ahead of the guys for the most part.”

He struck out seven batters walked none generated 16 swings-and-misses and looked crisp early before running up his pitch count. Nola retired 11 batters in a row from the second to fifth innings. He allowed just three hits.

“Walk-offs are fun” Nola said. “Every game matters and hopefully we can start a streak tonight.”"

We will review the project in a month's time and based on our learnings from its operation we will plan out the replication of the system for other parts of the city"" Jain said in the statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2d1cmdhb24vd2h5LXdhc3RlLXRvLWVuZXJneS1wbGFudHMtYXJlbnQtdGhlLWlkZWFsLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1tYW5hZ2luZy1vdXItdHJhc2gvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU3MjYyNzQuY21z0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvZ3VyZ2Fvbi93aHktd2FzdGUtdG8tZW5lcmd5LXBsYW50cy1hcmVudC10aGUtaWRlYWwtc29sdXRpb24tZm9yLW1hbmFnaW5nLW91ci10cmFzaC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODU3MjYyNzQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why waste-to-energy plants aren’t the ideal solution for managing our trash,Gurgaon: The government’s plan to set up a waste-to-energy (WTE) incinerator plant at the city’s Bandhwari landfill has brought into debate the effectiveness of such plants in managing solid waste. Setting up incinerator plants is “illogical” in the Indian scenario according to several experts. Most cities including Gurgaon are facing a huge challenge in handling waste as they are following a “flawed” system of waste disposal and management they said.According to experts waste management in Indian cities is solely based on collection and transportation methods which leaves out the opportunity for segregation and recycling.While producing energy from waste is a crucial element of solid waste management as it reduces waste volume and also helps in converting it into renewable energy WTE plants should ideally come into the management model after segregation collection and recycling experts pointed out.Dr Shyamala K Mani senior advisor at the Centre For Environmental Health Public Health Foundation of India said 6.2 crore metric tonnes (MT) of solid waste are generated in urban areas in India annually which will occupy 340000 cubic metres of volume or 1240 hectares of area in landfills per year. “This is not feasible as there is no spare land for dumping garbage and the existing ones are in a critical state” Mani who was formerly a professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs said.Out of the 6.2 crore tonnes of waste only 4.3 crore MT (70%) is collected 1.2 crore MT is treated and 3.1 crore MT is dumped in landfills experts said. The remaining waste is dumped haphazardly. Asked why waste is not segregated Mani said “Since most concessionaire contracts state that the civic body has to pay Rs 1700 to 1800 per tonne to the concessionaire for collection transportation and dumping of solid waste at the dumpsites this leads to the practice of mixing waste and dumping it.”Why WTE plants don’t do well in IndiaWTE plants in India handle a vast quantity of mixed waste. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 however only segregated non-recyclable waste having a calorific value of 1500 kcal/kg or more should be utilised for generating energy or refuse-derived fuel.“But as much as 50% of the waste that most WTE plants receive in our cities is low-calorific waste so it ends up in dumpsites instead of being used to produce energy” said Ruchika Sethi founder of Citizens for Clean Air a Gurgaon-based citizens’ group.“India’s experience with WTE plants has been unsatisfactory. The country’s first WTE plant was set up in 1987 in Timarpur Delhi. It was shut down in 21 days due to poor quality of incoming waste” said Ranjit Devraj a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on waste management set up in 2018. Since then 14 more WTE plants of a total capacity of 130 MW have been set up in the country. Out of these half have already been closed and the remaining are under scrutiny for environmental violations he added.Incineration should be the last consideration for any city said Swati Singh Sambyal an independent expert. “WTE plants are like boilers they take tonnes of resources which could otherwise be recycled or recovered” she said.Experts also pointed out incinerator plants are already being phased out in Western countries. “The US has not set up a single incinerator-based WTE plant since 1997” said Sibhu Nair India coordinator for the Global Alliance for Incineration Alternatives.How garbage can bebetter handledComposting biogas installation and bio-methanation and recycling of dry and electronic waste can help reduce waste sent to landfills by 80% to 90% experts said. Only around 10% of waste which can’t be composted or recycled should be sent to a waste processing site they said. “Whether waste will be incinerated recycled or composted depends on its quality. Bio-methanation technologies for segregated wet waste from large kitchens restaurants slaughterhouses and market waste have proved to be more viable in India” said Mani.“Rather than having a WTE plant in every city we could have one in a cluster of a few cities or a larger area which is still a more sustainable approach” Sambyal said.Government officials however defended the plan to set up a WTE plant in Bandhwari. “WTE plants and landfills are not completely unscientific methods. It depends on what kind of waste is dumped in landfills and what is incinerated in the plant. Many countries are using landfills and WTE plants effectively. We need to follow their pattern” said S Narayanan member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board.Despite repeated calls by TOI there was no response from Mukesh Kumar Ahuja commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9tYW5nYWxhLW9pbGZpZWxkLWVudGVycy0xM3RoLXllYXItb2YtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTcxMzgwNC5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL21hbmdhbGEtb2lsZmllbGQtZW50ZXJzLTEzdGgteWVhci1vZi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTcxMzgwNC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mangala oilfield enters 13th year of production,"

Scottish firm Cairn Energy-discovered Mangala oilfield in Rajasthan has completed 12 straight years of production producing more than 473 million stock barrels of oil. Mangala oilfield was discovered by Cairn in 2004. The field was put to production on August 29 2009. In December 2011 Cairn sold the India business to billionaire Anil Agarwal's Vedanta group.""Discovered in 2004 the field was the largest global discovery of the year and India's largest onshore discovery in 25 years. Since first oil on August 29 2009 Mangala field has produced more than 473 mmstb as of July 2021"" Vedanta said in a statement. Cairn Oil and Gas  which is a division of BSE-listed Vedanta Ltd  contributes about 25 per cent of India's domestic crude oil production - majority coming from the company's Rajasthan block that is spread across 3111 square kilometers.""Production from Mangala and its sister fields Bhagyam and Aishwariya has contributed USD 19 billion to the national and state exchequer as on FY'21"" the statement said. ""The cumulative production from the block has crossed 600 million barrels of oil equivalent.""The statement quoted Harish Choudhary Revenue Minister in the Government of Rajasthan as saying that there has been visible socio-economic transformation in the landscape of western Rajasthan since the discovery.""The region now produces over 150000 barrels of crude oil every day with the district of Barmer registering a 650 per cent increase in per capita income"" he was quoted as saying.Prachur Sah Deputy CEO Cairn Oil & Gas said the firm has followed a path of continuous innovation research and adoption of new technology to maintain production levels.""Moving ahead Cairn Oil & Gas is committed to contributing 50 per cent of India's domestic crude oil production. For this Rajasthan block and Mangala particularly will continue to play a driving role"" he said.Technology and innovation are hallmarks of the Rajasthan block. The field is home to the world's largest alkaline surfactant polymer (ASP) flood project and the Mangala pipeline - the world's longest continuously heated and insulated pipeline that runs from the fields of Rajasthan to refineries in Gujarat - covering 705 kilometers.Additionally it is home to a full-fledged enhanced oil recovery (EOR) polymer project that is also the largest of its kind in the world.""Cairn Oil & Gas has placed firm faith in India's hydrocarbon potential and has emerged as the highest bidder - winning a total of 51 blocks across successive OALP rounds.

Indraprastha Gas (IGL) has raised the prices of compressed natural gas CNG ) by 90 paise per kg and those of piped natural gas ( PNG ) used for cooking by ₹1.25 per standard cubic metre as per a company executive.In Delhi  CNG will now cost ₹45.20 per kg and PNG ₹30.91 per standard cubic metre. Prices have increased by a similar quantum in Noida Gurgaon and several other cities where IGL operates.IGL has blamed the limited availability of cheaper domestic gas for the price increase. “IGL has revised the retail prices of CNG & PNG to partially offset the increase in the input cost of natural gas being sourced as a result of increased dependence on eight times costlier R-LNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) as compared to domestic gas” the company said on Twitter. “While sales volumes have increased substantially the domestic gas allocation has remained constant due to lower average volumes of previous months.”IGL had hiked CNG and PNG rates by a similar amount in July. Petrol diesel and liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) prices have also sharply risen in a year to record levels.",,,

D’Aguiar Brothers Ltd. Wieting and Richter’s (W&R’s) Cold Storage and Ice Depot and the Rahaman Soda Factory deployed a wide range of traditional and innovative tactics. This installment introduces some of the advertising from the mid-1940s to the late-1970s when a severe foreign exchange crisis crippled the Guyanese economy.

Most of the advertising used by Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola in British Guiana between the end of World War II and the 1960s was initially developed for the U.S. market. As the examples from the British Guianese newspapers of that era show Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola’s newspaper advertisements were dominated by images of Caucasian women and men in comfortable post-World War II U.S. middle-class contexts. This represented the privileging of Caucasian norms of attractiveness modernity progress leisure and sophistication. When African American faces started to represent the Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola brands in the United States because of the civil rights struggle and efforts to increase market share those changes were also evident in the advertising and marketing materials sent to the colony.

In addition to using newspaper advertisements both brands included point-of-sale posters in their merchandising. Signs and posters were displayed inside and outside cake shops groceries and rum shops which had replaced the “bub” shops as the primary deliverers of sweet drinks for on-site or take-home consumption. During the early 1960s a popular Coca-Cola poster in retail establishments in Georgetown portrayed African Americans in a positive light. A family unit comprising a seemingly contented mom dad and son was shown relaxing in a comfortable setting enjoying sumptuous sandwiches and showing their “good taste” by drinking Coca-Cola. Hitherto the dominant images of African Americans in U.S. consumer advertising were demeaning and dehumanizing caricatures and stereotypes such as sambos golliwogs mammies Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.

The African American struggle for civil rights in the United States was coterminous with Guyana’s anti-colonial struggle. What happened to Black people in the United States was of interest to Black people in British Guiana. In the early 1950s two important sources of information about the experiences including the achievements and suffering of Black folks in the United States were Ebony and Jet magazines. As was the case in the United States readership was high in BG and copies were kept and shared.

Starting in the 1950s Pepsi-Cola which was founded in North Carolina began to target the African American market by placing advertisements in Ebony and Jet. As was the case with the Coca-Cola poster the Pepsi-Cola advertisements in Ebony and Jet featured family units with a seemingly contented mom dad and their daughters relaxing in comfortable settings and being “sociable” with a Pepsi. The impact of these Pepsi advertisements on Guyanese consumer preferences for Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not yet known. Was PepsiCo aware of the potential to influence the tastes of Black people in the Americas when it started advertising in Ebony and Jet? One of the pioneering African American models in U.S. print advertising during this early period was North Carolina-born Sarah Lou Harris. She made the cover of Jet and Ebony magazines on many occasions. She was probably the first African American woman to be featured in a national advertising campaign in the United States. We will meet Sara Lou Harris again.

Unlike the situation with Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola there do not seem to be any Red Spot advertisements produced by North American corporate headquarters. The Red Spot newspaper advertisements were produced by Guyanese advertising agencies including Guyenterprise which was founded by Vic Insanally and Clairmonte Taitt in 1966. Vic Insanally recently reflected on his company’s Red Spot account and the history of advertising in Guyana. He indicated that during the 1950s and 1960s advertising was dominated by two agencies: Bookers’ Carib Advertising and Ace Advertising operated by Vivian Lee. He stated “The foreign firms Lonsdale Hands and Advertising & Publicity (Niall Willis) came with Independence.”

In addition the state-operated Design & Graphics agency managed the extensive advertising and promotion requirements of the new nation state. The workers in these advertising agencies including the copywriters graphic artists photographers and campaign designers were among the most creative individuals in the country. They helped the recently independent nation to nurture a post-colonial identity. From this sector came many of our contemporary beliefs attitudes and behaviors related to being Guyanese.

Working on the Red Spot account was exciting for Guyenterprise. It provided an opportunity to be novel distinctive and cost-effective. The agency’s designs were distinctive. Its body of work is a good representation of post-colonial Guyanese graphic arts advertising and marketing practices. A review of a collection of Red Spot newspaper advertisements created by Guyenterprise reveal the privileging of Guyanese monuments and urban fashion.

Underlying the advertisements was the decolonizing narrative of the early post-independence years. Some advertisements such as the striking “The Champagne Beverage CREAM SODA” were also used as cinema slides a popular advertising platform when cinemas were central to leisure and entertainment. As Vic Insanally noted “Cinema slides were very popular with great audience reach and cheap.” Red Spot’s newspaper and cinema advertisements were complemented by the iconic enamel signs placed at cake shops groceries and other retail outlets.

Radio

By the end of World War II radio had become an important mass communication medium in British Guiana. The establishment of Radio Demerara by the private British corporation Overseas Rediffusion Ltd. in 1950 brought a mode of operation that accommodated several influential environmental forces: the governor and the colonial administration as well as the delivery of key audience segments to the commercial sector.

One of the characteristics of radio in pre- and post-World War II British Guiana has been the “brokerage system.” Individuals or companies purchase radio time to promote their own goods services or in some cases ideology. So it was not strange to have spot advertising by companies (e.g. Wieting and Richter D’Aguiar Imperial House) and programs (e.g. the Crown Rum Swizzle Dance Programme the DeCastro Wine Programme and Ovaltine Amateur Hour) that promoted specific products.

In 1952 DIH launched the “Cash In on Your Ideas Now!” radio promotion. This two-week promotion (Monday September 15 to Tuesday September 30) “offered BIG CASH PRIZES for the best IDEAS submitted which may be used as radio programmes.” The competition rules were provided during a five-minute block (5:25 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) Monday through Saturday on Radio Demerara. The first prize was BG$50 and the second prize was BG$25. There were six consolation prizes of one case of Pepsi-Cola each. The records pertaining to that radio promotion its winners and subsequent D’Aguiar Bros. Ltd. competitions and promotions were destroyed by fire. The reassembling of these details can be done through a careful study of the newspapers of the era. However given the incomplete runs and lack of digitization of available collections such a task is beyond the scope of this project a preliminary exploration of the social history of sweet drinks.

By the early late 1950s the Cola brands in British Guiana began to introduce new approaches such as image advertising which associates a product with the attractive attributes of an unrelated person object or concept. For example the Coca-Cola bottle is evocative of the female body shape. So it was not a stretch for the cola brands to associate their products with women. In 1958 both brands sponsored entrants in the Miss British Guiana Beauty Contest. In the next installment we will explore this and other marketing and promotion tactics in the “war” for the Guyanese sweet-drink market.

Here’s what we know,"A photograph has gone viral on the internet where it is being claimed that a feminist girl from Delhi has filed a complaint against Coca Cola alleging that its bottles are shaped like a penis. The girl in the photograph has been identified as Priyanka Paul.

The photograph has gone viral on the internet having been shared widely by pages on Facebook and Instagram and accounts on Twitter. However we can confirm that the claim is fake and has been confirmed to be fake by the girl seen in the photo on Instagram.

Priyanka Paul who goes by the username ‘artwhoring‘ on Instagram has shared multiple screenshots of the viral posts calling them out for peddling fake news. She has updated her bio on the platform to clarify that she has not in fact sued Coca Cola.

In one her stories on Instagram she has said “The fact that so many people thought this was funny enough to post on their pages is what’s taking the cake for me like it’s really not that funny even for satire.”

In another story Priyanka Paul said “Everyday I come on this site to be just blown away by the sheer dingbat-ness of the average Indian audience use my face for better things than the most unfunny kind of incel humour I’ve ever seen and people are really asking me if this is real.”

Priyanka Paul has also said that those spreading the photograph should at least tell people it is not real.

She also said that the lack of orginality in the Indian ‘meme community’ is saddening. Paul also wondered whether the meme pages have a WhatsApp group because many of them were sharing the photograph.

The ‘feminist girl from Delhi’ also wondered whether it was some “savarna feminist sh*t”.

The ‘feminist girl from Delhi’ meme was shared by pages with enormous reaches. She shared a post saying “1 million” we are not sure whether she was referring to ‘likes’ on the post or the followers the page had.

Paul also made a post saying that the claims made in the photograph was not real. She also told people to stop asking if it was real.

Thus it appears clear that the viral post although it has been shared widely is not real as the person in the photograph itself has confirmed that it is not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZGFyZS10by1jcnVpc2UtYWJvdmUtNTUtbXBoLWluLXRoaXMtcmVzdG9yZWQtY29jYS1jb2xhLTE5NDYtZm9yZC1mLTEtZmxhdGhlYWQtMTY3OTAzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dare to Cruise Above 55 MPH in This Restored “Coca-Cola” 1946 Ford F-1 Flathead,"Officially the F-Series kicked off its legendary adventure starting with the 1948 model year. But the original generation is also known as the Bonus-Built series. Meanwhile previous trucks were largely unchanged since the start of WWII for America that dreadful 1941.

So do we hold it against the good folks over at PC Classic Cars in Sherman Texas for potentially confusing the F-1 name with a truck that was created before the age of the F-Series? Purists might but we are going to be as reconciliatory as possible considering the very nice Coca-Cola-like paintjob. True we might have a soft spot for crimson and creamy white combinations...Now that everyone has finished ogling at the pristine exterior details let’s get down to the classic pickup truck business. This 1946 Ford was probably restored sometimes during previous ownership – there isn’t much background to go along with as far as its historic whereabouts are concerned. We did catch the dealer’s reference that “extensive records and photos from restoration” are also available.And this time around we paid more attention than ever to what the consigner has to say considering the laugh we had after reading the proud statement that we are dealing with a “truck (that) will cruise at 55 mph.” That’s just 89 kph for the Old Continent fans . But then again even after a full restoration it’s still a very old truck – and well within pension rights at 75 years of age.As far as the highlights are concerned aside from the Pepsi-rivaling exterior paintjob the pickup truck also has matching paint for the interior a black bench seat a headliner as well as correctly working factory gauges! There’s a wooden bed floor in the back as well as 16-inch steelies with factory caps to add to the vintage atmosphere.And the engine under the hood is also looking to make an impression. We are dealing with a 239ci Flathead V8 mill with an electric fan and a GM 1 wire alternator that’s connected to a three-speed manual transmission. The manual brakes are also new fortunately for when one feels that cruising at 55 mph is not enough. Especially after paying $28500 for this truck that “only” has 1928 miles (3103 km) – but of course the actual mileage cannot be verified.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vb2lsY2l0eS5uZXdzL2NvbW11bml0eS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L25pZ2h0Y3Jhd2xlci1icmluZ3MtdWx0cmFydW5uZXJzLW5lYXItYW5kLWZhci10by1jYXNwZXItbW91bnRhaW4tdHJhaWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nightcrawler brings ultrarunners near and far to Casper Mountain trails,"CASPER Wyo. — Nearly 50 people signed up for the fifth annual Nightcrawler Endurance Challenge on Casper Mountain this weekend the race’s organizer said.

Casper ultra-runner and trainer Justin Kinner said hosting the event is “absolutely a way to give back to something that I love.” Kinner says running is a way to “find the best version of himself” and the Nightcrawler is a way “help people find that spark for themselves.” Nightcrawler Endurance Challenge (Gregory Hirst)

Kinner said last year’s event netted about $75. His family and friends help run it and also crew for him on his own ultrarunning endeavors.

Aid stations are loaded with fuel like grapes M&Ms peanut butter and jelly sandwiches coffee Coca-Cola and hot-off-the-griddle quesadillas: “Some healthy stuff and some [that’s] just fuel” Kinner said. Nightcrawler Endurance Challenge (Gregory Hirst)

In addition to giving Casper its own ultra-distance race Kinner said the Nightcrawler is designed to be accessible to people just venturing out into longer distances. Some ultramarathons inevitably extend into overnight hours and the Nightcrawler is a way to get used to navigating the rocks roots and disorientation of night running while never being too far from an aid station. Nightcrawler Endurance Challenge (Gregory Hirst)

Encounters with voles owls roosters chickens and sage grouse during the night are not uncommon. Colby Frontiero Kinner’s brother-in-law ran this year and said he came upon a deer standing tall on a log: “I about jumped out of my skin” he said.

The event brought in repeat customers and also some new participants including one from Pennsylvania who boarded a plane at 3:30 a.m. Friday to make the 6:30 a.m. start.

“Some people are more competitive than others and some are just out here for the experience” Kinner said.

Mingling and camaraderie amongst the athletes is part of the appeal Kinner said.

“Another comment I get is how cool it is to have the change in direction each lap. A lot of times you go to an ultra and you see the leaders at the start but you never see them again.”

Kinner himself is preparing to do his fourth 100-mile race of the summer in two weeks at the Wasatch Front 100 Mile endurance Run in Utah a feat currently being chronicled by fellow ultra runner Jeremy Miller in a documentary.

Date 29.08.2021 Read time 3 Min Ahead of Formula One's return to the Belgian Grand Prix Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is shining a spotlight on one of the many fans attending the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps this weekend.

Cindy's passion for Formula One has led to her following the championship around the world including travelling to Belgium this weekend. This is Cindy's story in her own words.

I became a fan of Formula One when I was around 10 years old. My Godfather was a huge fan of Michael Schumacher and one day he came over and watched the race at our house. I watched it with him and ever since then I have considered myself a huge fan.

I've been fortunate enough to attend multiple races. I've been to Spa before as well as the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim and even winter testing in Barcelona. Once again I'm heading to Belgium this weekend for the race.

The Belgian Grand Prix is a very special race. Spa-Francorchamps is an iconic track and you can feel the history seeping through as you walk around. Raidillon in particular is incredibly magical to me. I may be biased but my favourite Belgian Grands Prix were when Sebastian won the race [in 2011 2013 and 2018].

I've been to Spa a few times and the magic never wears off. It's by far my favourite track which is probably why I keep coming back. To me Spa-Francorchamps is iconic historic beautiful and powerful.

I've always sat in the grandstands facing the pitlane because I love to see the action in garage. The grandstand facing La Source and Raidillon are also very good spots to watch the race from.

Sebastian is definitely my favourite driver. He has been since 2007. My favourite moment in Formula One would probably have to be Sebastian's title win in 2012. The Brazilian race that year was so crazy. All I can remember is being so nervous all race long.

My favourite thing about Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is that the team interacts a lot with the fans no matter what's happening on track. I hope that eventually the team will be strong enough to challenge at the front of the field.

My favourite piece of Formula One memorabilia is the bodywork I bought from F1 Authentics. It's from the AMR21 and it's so precious to me.

New:Firefighters battling blaze at Oakland Hills Country Club

""The golf operations crew wasn't even in yet"" said JerryDomeneck Brentwood's general manager on Sunday. ""One of the maintenance crew heard some pops and saw smoke in the distance towards the clubhouse area. He called the superintendent who called 911.""

Barbie Graham Livezey who lives near the golf club was letting her puppy out when the fire broke out.

""I saw the smoke and I thought they were gun shots that I heard"" said Livezey. ""It was unsettling.""

Within 25 minutes the 4320-square-foot cart center which held 80 golf carts and the club's beverage cart alongside other equipment and machinery was engulfed in flames said Domeneck.

Ten of the carts had been rentals Brentwood acquired in June when it became apparent that there was much more demand for golf this year which the 70 golf carts they owned could not sustain.

""It's because of the pandemic. A year and a half ago one of the first things to reopen were outdoor activities. And golf was at the top of the list"" said Domeneck who estimated that around 4000 rounds of golf are played every month in the summer.

He added that the recent privatization —where people need a membership to play— of a nearby golf club left many players ""displaced"" but was a ""benefit"" for Brentwood which is open to the anyone who wants to play and pay the fee.

The White Lake Fire Department was on the scene about 10 minutes after the crewmember noticed the fire according to Domeneck who said that they ""did what they could"" but some complications made containing the fire more difficult.

""They were very cognizant of any runoff with the battery acid"" said Domeneck. ""They didn't want to use too much water because they did not want to contaminate any of the groundwater or have water go in the storm sewers.""

The superintendent was then able to get some sand using a backhoe and create a berm area around the burning building to stop any runoff from the fire. Once the flames were under control added Domeneck the firefighters used foam to coat the site.

The cause and source of the fire remain unknown and an investigation into its origin is underway. The club is currently trying to inventory all the contents of the building and plan to meet with their insurance company on Monday.

The club hopes to limit the interruption to their activities as much as possible and want to resume in some capacity this week. Domeneck said he was relieved because the fire could have done much more damage than it did.

""No one was hurt that's the biggest thing. Everyone's okay"" he said. ""It was stuff that was damaged it was equipment and that can be replaced. So we're gonna pick up and move along as quickly as we can.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNib3N0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMTMtYmVlcnMtYXQtYW4tZW1wdHktdGFibGUtbG9jYWwtYnJld2VyaWVzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWhvbm9yLXUtcy10cm9vcHMta2lsbGVkLWluLWthYnVsLzI0Nzg5MjEv0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8xMy1iZWVycy1hdC1hbi1lbXB0eS10YWJsZS1sb2NhbC1icmV3ZXJpZXMtcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtaG9ub3ItdS1zLXRyb29wcy1raWxsZWQtaW4ta2FidWwvMjQ3ODkyMS8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,13 Beers on an Empty Table: US Troops Killed in Kabul Honored at Local Restaurants,"The 13 U.S. service members -- including Sgt.

In tribute to their sacrifice and service beers were reserved for them this weekend at breweries and restaurants across New England including at Wachusett Brewing Company in Massachusetts.

At the Westminster brewery there were 13 beers lined up at the bar on Saturday -- one for each service member who died.

""Reserved for our fallen 13 soldiers"" the sign said. ""Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.""

On Sunday the display was still out on the bar. The brewery says they wanted people to be cognizant of the sacrifice that these service members made.

""We never want to see soldiers lost so we're just trying to bring awareness to make sure people take time to respect the sacrifices they make to us"" said Jamie Roy Wachusett's director of food and beverage.

Roy says the display will be out on the bar for about a week and that the brewery is going to discuss a potential fundraiser in the near future.

Elsewhere in New England a similar scene played out at Smuttynose Brewing Company in Hampton New Hampshire; the Galley Hatch Restaurant also in Hampton New Hampshire; Rick's Food & Spirits in Kingston New Hampshire; and Fairgrounds Pizza & Pub in Cornish Maine.

Smuttynose lined up 13 beers at an outside table saying they were reserved for those who did not make it home.

""These beers are for you as a small token of our appreciation for your sacrifice"" the brewery said.

According to Smuttynose a portion of all profits from this weekend will be donated directly to the families of the 13 service members lost.

Nearby in Hampton the Galley Hatch said its tribute was for the fallen adding ""May we all be grateful for our freedoms and the sacrifices made by all of our troops.""

The restaurant also thanked Tom Wines for the tribute which showed American flags placed in some of the beers with red white and blue ribbons placed on the table.

At Fairgrounds each beer was placed next to another glass that had a candle inside. They were at a table with a ""Reserved"" sign.

""Honoring our 13 heroes that made the ultimate sacrifice"" the restaurant said. ""God bless.""

""13 beers for Kabul"" said Rick's Food & Spirits where beers were placed around a fire pit.

The restaurant thanked Deputy Greely who they said purchased the beers as a tribute to the service members who died in the Kabul attack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzdG9ubWFydGluZjEuY29tL2VuLUdCL25ld3Mvb24tdHJhY2svc2ViYXN0aWFuLXF1YWxpZmllcy1maWZ0aC1pbi13ZXQtYmVsZ2lhbi1ncmFuZC1wcml4LXF1YWxpZnlpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sebastian qualifies fifth in wet Belgian Grand Prix qualifying,"All news On Track Sebastian qualifies fifth in wet Belgian Grand Prix qualifying Share





Date 28.08.2021 Read time 8 Min Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team's Sebastian Vettel will start the Belgian Grand Prix from fifth after a dramatic and wet qualifying session at Spa-Francorchamps.

Lance and Sebastian first used FP3 to complete over 30 laps on the Intermediate tyre as they got up to speed with the first truly wet conditions of the weekend which proved to be an ideal warm-up for the challenge of qualifying.

Sebastian

Significant rain in the build-up to qualifying presented Formula One teams with the difficult choice between Wet or Intermediate tyres.

The team opted for Wet tyres as did all but two cars in the field only for conditions to progressively improve and require a switch to Intermediates.

Regardless Sebastian was able to put in an impressive 2.09.148 lap time to go sixth halfway through the session making him one of the fastest Wet tyre runners on track.

A switch to Intermediates brought stronger lap times and Sebastian saved the best for last lapping in 2.00.175 to secure seventh and a place in Q2.

Q2 began with the threat of mid-session rain making it essential for Sebastian to set a banker lap time in case of worsening conditions.

Running on a set of new Intermediates Sebastian set the second-fastest time after the opening runs courtesy of a 1.57.866 effort.

The threat of rain dissipated towards the end of Q2 meaning that a drying racing line was now starting to appear creating a last-minute dash for Q3.

With under five minutes on the clock Sebastian and the team fitted a new set of Intermediate tyres to maximise the conditions yielding a 1.56.814 lap time and sixth in the session.

Q3 was quickly red-flagged following a significant crash for Lando Norris at Eau Rouge. Thankfully the McLaren driver was able to climb out of the car but it led to a significant delay.

When the session resumed all drivers had two chances to set a competitive effort on Intermediate tyres.

Sebastian was one of the first to cross the line and moved third with a 2.03.231 lap time just as the circuit began to dry significantly.

The four-time World Champion kept his nerve in an ultra-close battle for a top-five start and secured fifth after lapping in 2.00.935 in the final seconds of qualifying.

FP3 1.59.436 8th Q1 2.00.175 7th Q2 1.56.814 6th Q3 2.00.935 5th

""The most important thing today is that Lando [Norris] is OK after his crash. I stopped to make sure he was because I saw a lot of debris and it is never a nice place to go off.

""From our side we can be happy with fifth on the grid tomorrow. I was getting increasingly into the groove with the car and I was happy with my laps – until the final one.

""I had already put in a good lap time and I wanted to extract more so I was pushing a little harder but I went off at Turn Eight and lost some time. I think if we had avoided that I could have battled with the guys at the front of the field.

""The forecast suggests that tomorrow will be similar weather which suits us so we can fight for a strong result and get some good points for the team.""

Lance

Lance like Sebastian demonstrated a consistent top 10 pace throughout wet conditions in FP3 and Q1.

He began qualifying on the Wet tyres and proved to be the fastest driver on the compound ahead of the field's switch to Intermediates.

After lapping in 2.08.566 securing a provisional sixth Lance pitted to take on Intermediates for the remainder of the session.

With most of the field having just minutes to set their best lap on the compound it was a nervy end to the session but Lance secured progression to Q2 by lapping in 2.01.597 for 13th.

Lance started Q2 promisingly by ending his first stint on the Intermediate tyre in seventh as lap times tumbled below the two-minute mark.

His lap time of 1.58.231 put him in the hunt for a Q3 place but the arrival of an increasingly dry racing line meant it all came down to the final minutes.

The team switched Lance to a set of new Intermediate tyres to bolster his chances of setting a quicker lap and securing a top 10 placing but the session came to an end before he could begin a flying lap.

That meant Lance tumbled to 15th as his rivals completed their flying laps and he will start the Belgian Grand Prix at the back following his five-place grid penalty carried over from Hungary.

FP3 1.59.205 6th Q1 2.01.597 13th Q2 1.58.231 15th

""It is a difficult qualifying result to take. The car had felt good in the tricky conditions throughout the day and the end of Q2 was crucial because conditions were improving all the time.

""We switched to a new set of intermediate tyres to try and capitalise on the situation but we just ran out of time to begin a flying lap which meant a lot of drivers around me were able to easily improve their times. We will look into how that happened and learn from it.

""It means we will start at the back of the field tomorrow [owing to the grid penalty from Hungary] but I still believe we can get a result tomorrow because this is a circuit on which you can overtake especially if the weather continues to be changeable.""

The Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund led by Rubestene Fisher Potter Millus Turman and assisted by many partners and volunteers compiled and delivered gift bags with needed supplies to local schools.

School opened with a surprise gift bag for all teachers and staff at Roseboro Elementary School. The gift bags were donated by the Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund (GFTSF) made possible through special donations of masks and personal protection supplies.

This non-profit through a partnership with Kramden Institute has provided hundreds of computers to students in Sampson County who did not have computers in the home.

“Teachers are tasked with helping students recuperate from a tremendous loss of cognitive skills due to lack of access to technology and in-school instruction” GFTSF President Rubestene Fisher Potter. “The students have fallen behind through no fault of their own and we must join forces to help them be successful.”

“I feel a moral and spiritual obligation to give support to teachers and students in Sampson County who have been impacted by the COVID pandemic” added Millus Turman CEO of the GFTSF.

Since 2010 the Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund has awarded scholarships to deserving students and provided resources to students in Sampson County. Since 2016 the GFTSF has held legacy Dinners to honor octoganarians whose legacies reflect their humble beginnings and who graduated from Roseboro Colored High/Charles E. Perry School a Rosenwald school located in Roseboro North Carolina.

Things have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However the GFTSF has awarded scholarships to deserving senior students in 2021. The GFTSF Legacy Dinner was not held in 2020 nor 2021. The classes of 1958 and 1959 Roseboro Colored High/Charles E. Perry School are tentatively scheduled to be honored in July 2022 at the annual legacy dinner.

Keeping the students safe and providing them with resources to help them recuperate from the academic losses and mental challenges they have witnessed during the pandemic are top priority GFTSF representatives said. The need for resources in the schools is dire.

During the 2020-2021 school year the Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund partnered with Colgate-Palmolive and the Triangle Park Chapter of The Links Incorporated to bring the virtual Bright Smiles Bright Future program to all Clinton City elementary schools (Kerr Sunset and Butler Avenue) and Union Intermediate School for a total of 1472 children. Three summer school programs (Roseboro Elementary Salemburg Elementary and Roseboro-Salemburg Middle) were held which involved a total of 650 children. A total of 2122 children received a toothbrush toothpaste and dental hygiene training to enhance their knowledge of brushing and flossing to have bright smiles and bright futures.

The goal is 100% participation for all elementary students in Clinton City Schools and Sampson County Schools during the 2021-2022 school year.

During the 2020-2021 school year the Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund made several deliveries of supplies including Lysol spray Clorox wipes and masks to help protect the children from this horrific virus. The same is set to happen for the 2021-2022 school year.

In an effort to help mask the unmasked children — Sampson County Schools Board of Education voted to require masks in schools — the Gwyn Fisher Turman Scholarship Fund will provide extra masks for students who want masks but do not have one. They are accepting donations to be used to buy children’s masks and other school supplies to help them reach academic success while staying safe.

Even though a city ordinance requires that dogs be leashed in city parks unless in designated dog play areas the group gathers every morning to socialize and exercise their dogs.

A month earlier Paul Ward and his wife Laura Lamps were walking their corgi June. As they headed into Burns Park three larger dogs–a bernedoodle named Bernie a border collie named Bader and an English shepherd named Betsy–ran over to June. Lamps crouched down and shielded June with her body.

Ward says he screamed “No!” while the other dogs circled. Within a few minutes the owners arrived and started to leash their dogs but “the more it went on the more Bernie thought it was a game” he says.

“Neither of us are afraid of dogs” Lamps says. “It’s just when they’re running at you full speed it’s very scary.” Once the dogs were leashed Bader’s owner apologized and the couple continued their walk.

The next day Ward posted on ‘Nextdoor.com: “Unleashed Dogs Attacked Us in Burns Park.” As the dogs headed toward June he wrote “ignorant humans were chasing and calling their dogs with limited success.” Though “no creature was hurt just scared” he wrote in such situations it’s unclear whether dogs want to “attack and kill or just play and explore.” He asked: “Do people walking their leashed dogs need to carry defensive weapons?”

In an interview Ward says he wrote the post to warn others who might wander into the park in the early morning. And he says “I was mad at these people for flouting local law.”

June an eight-year-old rescue they got in February is their seventh corgi. Clearly they’re devoted to the breed. Photographs of two previous corgis hang on one wall and “Blue Dog”–a portrait of three corgis by George Rodrigue–sits above their fireplace.

Lamps says she loves her neighborhood and loves dogs. But she and Ward have been previously hurt by other dogs and “we don’t want anybody to get hurt … There aren’t many dogs who are so well-trained off leash that they are 100 percent predictable.”

Ward’s post ended up garnering nearly 300 comments–many of them vitriolic. “If you thought local folks’ views on the election Covid Fauci Trump or China were extremely polarizing you haven’t been fully exposed to what people think about unleashed dogs” says Joshua Pincus a Burns Park resident who has taken his dogs August and Valiant to the off-leash gathering.

Linda Young a clinical psychologist and owner of Bernie sees both sides. “We care passionately about our dogs” she says. “Yet people feel they have a right to walk in a park and not be frightened.”

The issue has intensified during Covid as isolation and stay-home orders prompted many to adopt dogs–some for the first time. One or two puppies adopted during the pandemic have joined the Burns Park morning group says Ellen Rabinowitz who helped organize the gathering after getting her red fox Labrador Rio four years ago.

Ed Wier the fourth dog owner at the park that morning says he used treats to entice his black Labrador Liesl to stay with him. He believes that Ward’s reaction was out of proportion to the threat and that he may have agitated the dogs and made it harder for the owners to control them. “He was just making a scene yelling ‘This is why dogs need to be on a leash’ and it escalated the situation” Wier says.

Young who readily admits that Bernie was “one of the dogs who went up to say hello” to June has been taking him to the gathering since he was a puppy. “Socializing your dog early on with other dogs is extremely important for their physical health and their mental and emotional health” she says.

“I get it that people want to be able to walk in a park and not have an unleashed dog come towards them” Young says. Yet she also believes that if all dogs had opportunities to play off-leash with other dogs “we’d have much healthier dogs.”

Walt Swanson says he takes his nine-month-old English shepherd Betsy to the gathering because walking her on a leash isn’t enough exercise. Carrie Cosola a veterinarian in Ann Arbor agrees that unless a dog is geriatric walking isn’t adequate. And off-leash dogs she says are better socialized and less likely to feel ‘threatened–and so less likely to be dangerous or bite.

Michele Heisler who takes her sheltie Freya and Welsh corgi Artemis to the early morning gatherings has become close to people she otherwise wouldn’t have known. “Dogs have a way of bringing people together” she says. She says the dogs usually engage in friendly play. “We’re very cognizant of sharing the space.”

Dave DeVarti Rabinowitz’s husband says that incidents like the one in May are rare and the off-leash gathering is normally a safe situation where “dogs learn to socially interact in a way that isn’t aggressive.”

Ward counters that if the dogs were well-behaved “they wouldn’t have run after our dog.”

Heisler sympathizes with Ward’s concern. “It’s absolutely unacceptable for an unleashed dog no matter how friendly the owner thinks it is to ever approach anybody without being invited. One time is too many” a sentiment echoed by the others attending the morning gathering. She says since the Nextdoor posting owners have practiced more self-policing.

“We have been rather vigilant about watching out for people and leashed dogs” Young says. “We are constantly scanning the park leashing our dogs when we see runners or people walking on the perimeter with leashed dogs.”

—

But Burns Park isn’t the only place where off-leash dogs have caused conflicts. Elena Wakeman says her two dogs a pug and a golden retriever were attacked by two pit bulls last fall. Wakeman whose home backs up to the Pioneer Woods Nature Area sees neighbors walking their dogs there off-leash every day. That’s dangerous she says and it keeps people who follow the law from using the public space.

When Old West Side resident Virginia Simon was a student in the 1970s two unleashed dogs attacked and almost killed her leashed poodle. So Ward’s Nextdoor post caught her attention. Simon who currently owns a cockapoo named Andy called the Burns Park owners “entitled” and “selfish” in an online comment. In an interview she adds “they’re putting themselves and what they perceive as their dog’s needs for freedom and running and playing ahead of people who have their dog on a leash and perhaps may be frightened of unknown dogs running up and approaching them.” If people want their dogs to run freely Simon says they can take them to a dog park.

Off-leash advocates respond that the city doesn’t have enough dog parks and the ones it does have aren’t safe.

Only three of Ann Arbor’s more than 150 parks and nature areas have dedicated areas for dogs: Broadway Park Olson Park and Swift Run (managed jointly with the county). Owners are required to get an off-leash permit and provide health and safety documentation including current rabies vaccination certification.

But Barb McMullen says though the rules are posted “there’s no requirement to actually follow them and no enforcement.” McMullen who lives in the Maple and Miller area no longer takes her twelve-year-old black Lab Calamity Jane to the city dog parks. She says the owners who use them don’t seem to understand the rules or what’s expected of good dog play.

Veterinarian Cosola calls the city dog parks “overcrowded dens of contagion.” After joining a neighbor at Swift Run and seeing pet owners ignoring blatantly aggressive behavior and one dog splattering diarrhea she says “I swore them off entirely and caution my clients to stay away as well.”

Jacqueline Kuehn lives on Braeburn near Swift Run and says she initially loved to take her pit bull mix Casey to the dog park there. She stopped after Casey was attacked twice in one year by two different dogs. The first time she had to take the owner to small claims court–and won–after the owner refused to pay her vet expenses.

Colin Smith the city’s parks and recreation services manager says that the dog parks have never been staffed–the city hasn’t employed park rangers since 2007. He says that while there are periodic complaints “it’s not a systematic theme” and that he hears plenty of positive feedback. “Dog parks are imperfect but also provide a great opportunity” for both people and dogs to socialize he says.

Maureen Michael whose house backs up to Bird Hills Nature Area used to like walking there in the early morning. After being knocked down by an off-leash dog she left notes on car windshields asking their owners to take their dogs to dog parks instead. She no longer walks in Bird Hills on a regular basis.

Mayor Christopher Taylor says that he’s working with the Humane Society and city councilmember Jen Eyer on expanding the dangerous-dog ordinance which currently applies only to dogs that are aggressive against people to dogs assaulting dogs as well. He expects it will come before council this summer.

But Ward and Wakeman say that police seem uninterested in enforcing the current laws. Attempts to notify the police of the leash violation in her park “went nowhere” Wakeman says. Having a dog off-leash is subject to a fine of between $25 to $500 for a first offense but AAPD lieutenant Mike Scherba says the department’s first response is to educate dog owners about the law not fine them.

Scherba says that while the department receives “a fair amount” of complaints about unleashed dogs they don’t often hear about attacks on other dogs or people. With the department understaffed enforcing the off-leash law “is not something that we would consider to be a priority” he says.

The recent controversy has some members of the Burns Park gathering pushing for changes. In an email to Mayor Taylor and Julie Grand council’s representative on the Parks Advisory Commission Rabinowitz suggested creating fenced areas within neighborhoood parks that could work as dog runs or designating “off-leash” hours when there is little activity in the parks like 6 a.m. to 8 a.m.

“The vitriolic dialogue on Nextdoor after the incident with the leashed dog is really what is motivating me to bring this forward” Rabinowitz emails. “I’m trying to offer a solution instead of just listening to the divisive discourse.”

In New York some parks allow dogs to be off leash from the time the park opens until 9 a.m. and from 9 p.m. until the park closes. Charisse Hill a spokesperson for the New York City Parks says that “off-leash hours are positively received and adhered to in parks across the city” while dog owners are “respectful of the rules and good stewards of the parks.” Berkeley California has two parks designated for off-leash activity at all times.

Conroy Baltzell who used to take his dog Amadeus to the off-leash gathering moved from Burns Park to Berkeley in November 2020. He says Amadeus sustained serious injuries when he was at the Broadway dog park in 2018–and the aggressive dog bit him too when he tried to pull it off. Baltzell says that because Ann Arbor has so few off-leash options “you have all types of dogs that are forced into the areas that they’re really not best suited for.”

Ward opposes having off-leash hours at the parks since he and Lamps want to be able to take their dog anytime without fear of being attacked. Ever since the incident they’ve had to start their walks at 6:30 a.m. to avoid encountering the off-leash group. He finds the idea of fencing less objectionable.

Group member Pincus believes erecting fencing shouldn’t be complicated especially in larger parks and suggests that the costs could be shared between the city and dog owners.

Another Burns Park neighbor Kate Bauer thinks that would create a safer situation and “would resolve these ongoing tensions.” The owner of Ruby a goldendoodle puppy that she got in October ‘Bauer says she felt “unbelievable” peer pressure to take her to the off-leash gathering and did so once but decided not to let her loose: “The bottom line is that it’s illegal.”

—

Grand says similar proposals have surfaced before but compromise is often elusive since there are groups that are “just diametrically opposed.”

Some people who don’t have dogs are afraid of them so “the idea of the city endorsing dogs being able to run loose in a public park is terrifying to them” Grand says. Dog owners whose leashed dogs have been attacked by off-leash dogs don’t want that either. And proposals to fence off areas in parks have been met with resistance as well. “It’s really hard to find a middle ground” she says.

Smith the parks manager echoes her sentiments: “People are so split down the middle on this.”

Any new policy Smith notes would need to undergo an extensive review and public input process before being adopted. If and when that happens he predicts it will “be a contentious proposal.”",,,,,,

No. 22 Victor Reyes outfield — S-R 6-5 200. Age in season: 27 His head must’ve been swimming. With two days left in camp he was set to be the starting center fielder on Opening Day. Now he may find himself either platooning in center with Akil Baddoo or serving as the club’s fourth outfielder. Still there is value in his ability to play all three outfield positions well run the bases and switch-hit. Don’t forget he slashed .325/.349/.516 with six doubles three triples and four homers an .864 OPS after July 19 last season. 2021: .258 BA 88 wRC-plus .03 WAR 2022 salary: $1.4 million Carlos Osorio Associated Press

Where were you when the lights (almost) went out?

New Yorkers took to Twitter on Sunday night to report a brief power dip experienced in neighborhoods across the city.

Early on Monday morning a Con Edison spokesperson blamed the blip on “a fault to an underground transmission feeder in Long Island City” which “caused a momentary voltage disturbance [that] lasted a fraction of a second for all customers.”

The company is now investigating what caused the trip.

The flash happened just before 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 29. It sparked lots of curiosity from New Yorkers concerned about the power dip — and “extremely limited service” on several subway lines for the remainder of the evening.

In a cryptic response to a tweet from a concerned customer on Sunday night a Con Edison spokesperson acknowledged the “power issue” was “temporary and has since been resolved.” The company did not immediately state what caused the sudden drop.

After investigation the power issue was temporary and has since been resolved. If you continue to have any issues with your service please reach out to us for further assistance. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. ~PF — Con Edison (@ConEdison) August 30 2021

Some had speculated the power dip may have been sparked by a reported transformer fire on 12th Street in Astoria Queens which occurred at around the same time. The incident located not too far from the Ravenswood power station.

It seemed to send a plume of white smoke into the sky but Bill Neidhardt a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio relayed information from NYC Emergency Management that the plume was in fact steam from a nearby power station.

Explosion in LIC at ConEd. Saw a mushroom cloud of flames. #NYC pic.twitter.com/RO7R9GPF3Q — Joe Espo (@JWEsposito) August 30 2021

According to @nycemergencymgt there was no transformer explosion or fire. This is not smoke it is steam from a private power plant. No outages at this time. https://t.co/d2hEF6jVsm — Bill ""worst comms guy in history"" Neidhardt (@BNeidhardt) August 30 2021

The Fire Department reported that it responded to the manhole fire at about 8:26 p.m. on Aug. 29 but that it got the situation under control at about 8:53 p.m. There were no serious injuries reported.

It’s not clear at this point whether the manhole fire was connected to the citywide power blip in any way.

If things weren’t weird enough MTA New York City Transit reported that the numbered subway lines and the L train were suffering from severe service delays connected to the “power surge.” Travelers were urged to use buses and the lettered lines as alternate routes.

Service on the impacted lines was fully restored just before 2 a.m. Monday morning the MTA reported.

Back in December 2018 Queens residents experienced a similar flicker in lights when a blast occurred at its Astoria facility. While the lights remained on the evening sky glowed in an eerie shade of blue stemming from the inferno.

amNewYork Metro reached out to Con Edison for further information on Sunday’s incident and is awaiting a response.

As for outages Con Edison reported Sunday night just a handful of sporadic power failures affecting 28 customers out of more than 3.5 million across the five boroughs.

The city hasn’t suffered a major blackout since August 2003 when it was impacted by a massive power failure experienced across the northeast United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s not always easy to know when the right time is — I have to keep my eagerness in check. Often for a long time. Whether it’s the state of their business or a major transition or as market factors shift around it — I try to look for a sweet spot where the guest has learned enough about who they are and what business they’re in but also started to develop their own vision for what the future might hold. It’s a moment where I see them sort of settle in to a groove. And the challenge is to get them to reflect on what that settling in moment is all about.

Today’s guest Manny Valdes of Cruz Blanca in Chicago is someone I’ve consulted with over the past couple years off and on and he’s sought some perspective on all that. He’s a master at soaking up different perspectives and gradually patiently synthesizing his own.

Indeed much of the work we’ve done has often felt like a slow-drip conversation between friends over a late dinner. And I’ve walked away with more intriguing questions than I had answers.

Manny falls outside the lines of how I’d describe most brewery and brewpub owners. While he’s a good operator and focused on the details he clearly spends most of his time observing imagining and listening to the stories people tell about his brand. He factors it all in.

And while he’s spent a lot of time the past couple years trying to articulate who Cruz Blanca is - lately he’s seemed less…concerned. Or less…exacting about that. He’s been more playful and reclined in a way. And that for me was an indication that something was shifting and maybe positively so. And I wanted to talk to him about it.

Cruz Blanca has a particular history in Chicago - which we’ll get into. It was founded alongside Rick Bayless a renowned Chicago chef who is largely credited with making Mexican food in the Midwest an accessible cuisine (that’s a very complicated thing to say and those are my words not Rick’s or Manny’s). And over the years Rick brought that culinary mindset to craft beer as well back when he created Marisol with Goose Island a sort of citrusy spiced wheat ale that’s a bit of a legend in Chicago.

Then he partnered with Constellation Brands to produce Tocayo - a beer that was supposed to fit into that Blue Moon area of the market - and was intertwined in some complicated ways with the Cruz Blanca brewpub in the beginning - but mostly just because of the timing. Tocayo and Cruz Blanca shared a sort of launch story - even if they were separate ventures.

So it’s important to clarify - I’m not sitting down with Rick Bayless the chef and restauranteur today. I’m sitting down with Manny Valdez Rick’s longtime partner in Frontera Foods and the person who imagined and launched and is now independently building Cruz Blanca. A brewery with a story all its own - and mostly still ahead of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But back in January one YouTuber was able to be one of the first people to get his truck delivered and it wasn’t soon after that some crazy antics began.

Michael Hyssong also known as StreetSpeed717 jumped his brand-new 2021 Ram 1500 TRX over a small creek and damage ensued. The Ram 1500 TRX proved that it could still run and drive as normal after the massive landing despite damage to the front bumper front shock reservoir mounts a broken rear window damaged tailgate and broken front fenders.

Soon after he lit the truck on fire installed massive 44-inch tires on it with some help from some wheel spacers crushed some cars and then sold the truck for $20000 to his “friends” who were supposed to fix it. But then those friends turned around and sold it on Copart for a $42000 profit. Since then he has bought another TRX matching his original one.

After the initial video went viral the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission brought 18 criminal charges against him for his jump video after an anonymous tipster sent a complaint to the state Game Commission’s Operation Game Thief tip line.

The charges included 2 counts of disturbance of waterways and watersheds 6 counts of pollution of waters 6 counts of littering near waters and 4 counts of running a vehicle in a stream despite the stunt being done on private property.

Since then the original video was taken down. Now according to the York Daily Record Hyssong was recently ordered to pay $53000 in restitution.

“I had no idea it was illegal to drive through a creek” Hyssong said to the York Daily Record. “I’m an outdoors guy. I hike and I’ve never even littered in my life. I’m not the type to destroy natural resources. I won’t be driving in a creek anytime soon.”

As per Pennsylvania state law all “legally navigable” streams and rivers are considered public property by the law. The creek known as “Doe Run Creek” according to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission is considered a navigable waterway.

John would become president of the Chaska Brick and Tile Co. in Minneapolis while Charlie started a foundry and a sash and door factory in St. Paul.

But the Corning brothers won their greatest fame rowing and racing ultralight boats on the Mississippi River around St. Paul's Raspberry Island.

The Minnesota Boat Club they helped organize in 1870 is still afloat celebrating a COVID-delayed 150th anniversary as the state's oldest athletic organization on Sept. 11 with a day of races and events (minnesotaboatclub.org/celebrate-150-years).

Two years before the club's founding John Wheeler Leavitt Corning showed up in St. Paul packing some fragile cargo. His prized rowing shell made of shellacked paper was too breakable to ship by train. So it came to St. Paul from New York ""by way of New Orleans by ocean and river vessels it being a popular belief in those days among rowing men that paper boats would not stand the long trip by rail"" according to a 1903 edition of the Razoo a quarterly boating publication.

John Corning attracted curious onlookers to the Mississippi River banks when he first jumped in and started to row. They ""never could see how he 'kept the derned thing right side up' "" the Razoo recalled.

Two years older than his brother Charlie Corning came to St. Paul in 1869 and became an acclaimed boat racer. The Corning brothers were two of the Minnesota Boat Club's founding 10 members in 1870 with John serving as the club's first secretary-treasurer and Charlie as its second president.

Minnesota Boat Club circa 1884: The Raspberry Island club was the place to be for rowers and elite society guests as the sport became a national craze along with boxing and horse racing by 1870. The Corning brothers of Brooklyn established the club as rowing quickly became a spectator sport and a gambling fixture along the Mississippi River in St. Paul.

By 1885 when 100 of St. Paul's elite men and women posed for a photo at the club's first boathouse on Raspberry Island the Minnesota Boat Club included the cream of the young city's crop. Posing with the Cornings in the photo were budding architect Cass Gilbert who would design the State Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court building; Lucius P. Ordway who would rescue and then lead 3M Co.; and William Merriam who would become Minnesota's 11th governor in 1889.

""While the club became a grand social organization it didn't start out that way"" said Sarah Risser a Minneapolis rowing buff who has written extensively about local boating history.

The Corning brothers ""were young kids in their 20s seeking to gain a foothold in post-Civil War St. Paul"" Risser said. ""They cobbled together this boat club and it was a gritty start.""

A floating boat house at the foot of the Robert Street Bridge served as the Boat Club's first headquarters — ""A crude affair"" the Razoo said in 1903 ""which used to leak and threaten to sink every once in so often and caused the 'boys' many a backache at the pumps to keep their house above the waves of 'Old Mississipp.' ""

Construction of a more substantial boathouse on Raspberry Island was completed in 1874. The current Spanish Revival boathouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places dates to 1910 according to club president Charlene McEvoy.

""Rowing became a national craze by 1870 right up there with horse racing and boxing as one of the country's most popular sports"" Risser said.

Spectators often gambled on the races lining the river bluffs and the Wabasha Street Bridge to cheer as racers — in single double and four-man boats — rowed upstream for a mile turned 180 degrees around a stake and sped back downstream to the boathouse.

""Charles Corning was the real star"" often competing nationally according to Risser. His crew once out-rowed a fabled London team in Philadelphia in 1876 according to Risser.

A photo of Charles Corning in the Minnesota Historical Society archives calls him the ""Father of the Minnesota Boat Club and Pioneer of Amateur Rowing in the Northwest."" John gets most of the credit as the first rower in the Twin Cities but many of those stories came from his son Leavitt who published the Razoo.

With popular regattas on July 4th and competitions against rowers from Minneapolis Winnipeg Chicago and Milwaukee at Devil's Lake Wis. and other venues the Minnesota Boat Club's prominence grew.

But as other sports such as tennis and golf grew more popular in the late 1800s the Boat Club fleet fell into disrepair. Financial problems forced it to cut ties with its nationally respected coach an ex-professional racer named John A. Kennedy.

In the 1990s the club's boathouse was nearly condemned and razed its windows busted and bird droppings littering the ballroom floor where city luminaries once danced. A $1 million renovation led by the city and private partners in 2004 sparked a grand reopening.

John Corning died 100 years ago at 76 outlasting Charlie by 33 years. They're buried at St. Paul's Oakland Cemetery. McEvoy said the club still owns a trophy named after the Corning brothers.

The United States Department of Agriculture has issued a recall on Italian meat due to a salmonella contamination.

Officials say 862000 pounds of Italian Antipasto by Fratelli Beretta have been recalled.

That includes its 24-ounce trays of uncured meats sold at Costco.

The meat has been connected to a salmonella outbreak in 17 states.

The CDC says there have been 36 illnesses and 12 hospitalizations between May and late July.

If you bought the meat you can return it to your local Costco or call the company's hotline.

That’s the latest news in the long-running Napa Pipe story. Keith Rogal of Napa Redevelopment Partners recently said the Costco is on track for a grand opening that year.

A precise target date is unclear. Costco when queried replied that it shares details on new locations only two to three months in advance.

Meanwhile there are signs of life at the Napa Pipe site that is still mostly dirt except for the giant dry dock cranes and other remnants from the industrial days. Yellow earthmoving equipment can be seen at work there.

“Napa Redevelopment Partners started onsite demolition and grading operations in spring 2021 — there has been heavy equipment working intensely on the site since then” Rogal said in an email.

The engineer's improvement plans for roadway infrastructure are complete and being processed through the city of Napa. Once the permits are secured those site improvements will begin he said.

Napa Pipe is a 154-acre former industrial site along the Napa River just south of Kennedy Park and north of the Butler Bridge. It is to be redeveloped with 945 homes parks trails a retirement center hotel and stores.

In 2012 Rogal announced that Napa Pipe plans included a Costco. The move helped sell the controversial project to the public with city of Napa voters in 2014 agreeing that Napa Pipe could be annexed to the city.

Ever since then the question among Costco fans has been when is Costco coming? Past and now discarded timetables had it opened and serving customers by now.

Even the Napa County grand jury weighed in. “Will Napa ever see a Costco?” it asked in a 2019 report.

“What I’m resigned to as a senior citizen is that I will never see a Costco in Napa. I’m disappointed” resident Mark Bernardi recently wrote to the Napa Valley Register. That was before Rogal announced the 2023 target date.

Mayor Scott Sedgley hears the Costco queries.

“Often. Very often” he said. “People I think are excited about the prospect of having a closer Costco. I explain the complexities of the development of the property.""

The big piece is installing infrastructure such as streets sewers water electricity and sidewalks. His understanding is once Costco has a building site ready and can hook up to utilities it is ready to start building Sedgley said.

He hears less questions from citizens about the housing that is also to be built at Napa Pipe. Sedgley sees Costco as being the big selling point for the redevelopment project.

“We could have put a nuclear power plant out there as long as we put a Costco between the silos” he joked.

There have been teasers for Costco fans along the way. A February 2020 application to the city calls for a Costco slightly larger than most with such usual features as gas pumps a food court optical hearing aids and a pharmacy.

Preparations are also being made to build Napa Pipe housing. Rogal said Napa Redevelopment Partners is negotiating with residential builders for the first phase of market-rate housing which will coincide with the initial affordable housing project.

The Napa Pipe property has a long history of industry. Basalt built World War II ships there in the 1940s. Kaiser Steel fabricated BART tunnel liners there in the 1960s.

Napa Pipe manufactured large diameter steel pipe there from 1987 to 2004. After that business closed Napa Redevelopment Partners bought the site in 2005 leading to public workshops on potential redevelopment in 2006.

The project has gone through various iterations including shrinking the number of proposed housing units from 3200 to 945. The county and city engaged in long negotiations over the city annexing the property. Toxic materials from the industrial days needed cleaning up.

These days heavy equipment is moving dirt on the property. That appears to be good news for Costco fans.

Angelica Marie Mendez (Riverside County Sheriff's Dept.)

PALM DESERT CA — A woman who accused a family of neglecting and sexually assaulting their daughter in a viral video taken at a Costco in Palm Desert was arrested for allegedly providing false information to deputies sheriff's officials said Sunday.

In the video filmed on Aug. 20 Angelica Marie Mendez can be overheard saying that a Black girl accompanied by her white family members was being denied food and that the family was ""probably using her as a slave."" Mendez also mentioned that she reported the family to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in the video which was shared on social media and garnered millions of views across the internet.

Sheriff's officials said the serious allegations ""set in motion hundreds of staff-hours by several law enforcement agencies in two separate states."" At the request of Riverside County sheriff's officials police in Gilbert Arizona said they contacted the family seen in the video.

In a tweet Gilbert police said they determined the girl was ""safe and in good health"" and ""it was found that the child had refused to eat the day of the video recording due to an upset stomach."" Gilbert police also said that the Arizona Department of Child Safety conducted its own separate investigation into the incident and that ""no evidence of any crime has been established.""

Despite the false nature of the accusations in the viral video it triggered a fire storm of angry reactions online. Back in Riverside County sheriff's officials said a flood of calls about the video came into their dispatch center as well as the offices of city and county officials.

""The countless calls to our Dispatch Center took up valuable call time for other citizens who were in need of emergency services"" sheriff's officials said. Mendez 23 of Desert Hot Springs was arrested on Saturday and booked into the John Benoit Detention Center on suspicion of reporting a false crime and providing false information to a peace officer both misdemeanor crimes. ""It appears the reporting person had seemingly made up the allegations and had no supporting evidence to substantiate her claims. Her claims both to law enforcement and publicly had numerous inconsistencies"" sheriff's officials said. Mendez was released the same day of her arrest after posting $25 bail according to inmate records. —City News Service",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL2Nvc3Rjby1mb29kLXJlY2FsbC1mcmF0ZWxsaS1iZXJldHRhLW1lYXRzLWF1Z3VzdC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Just Issued This Serious Food Recall — Eat This Not That,"On Friday Costco issued a recall notice for a reported 862000 pounds of a specialty grocery item that the manufacturer says Costco members and shoppers at other supermarkets nationwide may have purchased anytime in the past six months. One official recall advisory site suggests the product is responsible for 36 illnesses in 17 states. We've got the Costco recall details you need to know.

An August 27 memo to Costco members was dispatched to advise customers that a New Jersey-based Italian food brand Fratelli Beretta was voluntarily recalling packages of their Fratelli Beretta Uncured Antipasto in collaboration with the U.S Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS).

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

The USDA-FSIS reports that this recall includes double 12-ounce packages (24-ounce trays) of Fratelli Beretta uncured prosciutto soppressata Milano salami and coppa. They state the products were produced between February 28 2021 and August 15 2021 and show best-by dates of August 27 2021 through February 11 2022.

USDA-FSIS says they have been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and individual state health agencies after a traceback investigation led authorities to believe that the three dozen Salmonella cases were caused by the Fratelli Beretta Uncured Antipasto meats.

Fratelli Beretta's memo to Costco members stated: ""If you have any of this product remaining do not consume the product. Please return it to your local Costco for a refund."" They add that customers may call Fratelli Beretta USA at 1-866-918-8738.

It's important to note that the USDA-FSIS states: ""These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide."" However with USA Today reporting such a large recalled quantity it appears the Fratelli Beretta uncured meats may have been sold at other supermarket chains—not just Costco.

It is a relic from a bygone era. When the proud owner is at home his flag waves defiantly in the wind but it bears the colours of a kingdom that no longer exists: the black-and-white of Prussia.

Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia is the current head of the House of Hohenzollern. It is strange to look at the smiling businessman in the tailored suits and think of him as a Kaiser. But the 45-year-old father of four would be exactly that had the German monarchy not fallen.

His dynasty can trace its roots back to the 11th century. They became the first last and only royal family to rule over a unified German nation state but were forced to relinquish their power after the last German Kaiser Wilhelm II was held responsible for the calamity of the first world war. Germans have since found it difficult to find a place for the Hohenzollerns in the national narrative.

The Hohenzollerns have been called a ‘family clan which has haunted central Europe for over 1000 years’

While Georg Friedrich has always maintained that he has no ambition to carve out a political role for himself he has been keen to restore his family’s estate much of which was confiscated in the wake of the second world war. According to the prince this affects around 10000 pieces of art as well as usage rights for palaces. In total the disputed property amounts to hundreds of millions of euros.

Since reunification in 1990 the German state has generally been sympathetic towards those whose property was nationalised or seized after the second world war. While this happened in West Germany too in the East land redistribution became an official policy. The former ‘elites’ were seen as fair game as they were unanimously regarded as Nazi sympathisers. Property above 100 hectares was confiscated and redistributed which affected the Hohenzollerns particularly badly as their power base lay in the north east of Germany.

Most popular Brendan O’Neill What is the anti-Israel Eurovision protest really about?

After the fall of the Berlin Wall Georg Friedrich’s grandfather Louis Ferdinand began proceedings to claim the Hohenzollern estate back — but he quickly ran into problems. The first was public outrage. Many German commentators saw the prince’s efforts as sheer greed especially as many of the objects were on public display and most of the palaces used as museums.

A separate (if related) issue is a legal hurdle designed to prevent families from claiming compensation for property that was confiscated because their ancestors had been been ‘substantially involved in furthering the Nazi system’. The key figure here is Georg Friedrich’s great grandfather son of the Kaiser: Crown Prince Wilhelm. He publicly declared his support for the Nazis and Adolf Hitler in the early 1930s. But whether this amounted to ‘substantial’ support — whether this had a direct effect on the takeover — remains the question to be decided.

Crown Prince Wilhelm was a complex character. He could be charming and funny loved parties and was a successful competitive showjumper. A particular passion of his was football long before it became a popular spectator sport. He sponsored his own cup in 1908 the first of its kind and still ongoing as the Länderpokal today. But he took his role as heir to the throne seriously. Wilhelm was a loyal son to his father Kaiser Wilhelm II and commanded troops at the Battle of Verdun both in the full expectation that he would be Kaiser one day. But he was also the darkest character in the Hohenzollern family — a Nazi sympathiser who pledged his support to Adolf Hitler vociferously both before and after the latter became chancellor of Germany in 1933.

The nature of Wilhelm’s exact role in Hitler’s rise to power is more than family history to his great-grandson Georg Friedrich. It has a bearing on the dynasty’s presence and future morally and financially. He has therefore commissioned the renowned historian Lothar Machtan professor of modern history at the University of Bremen to look into the matter — aided by a five-figure sum and full access to the family archives. Machtan’s findings have now been published in a comprehensive biography The Crown Prince and the Nazis: The Hohenzollern’s Blind Spot.

In an interview with the Welt newspaper last week both men historian and prince showed themselves to be pleased with the results of the research. Machtan has concluded that there is no denying that ‘there was a phase during which one can speak of a collaboration with the rising Nazis’. But he is also certain that ‘the Hohenzollerns were not involved in the transition of power in the winter of 1932/1933 neither directly nor indirectly’. He characterised Wilhelm as a misguided and ‘erratic’ man who was dispensable in the eyes of the Nazis. The ‘terrible proclamations of loyalty’ he offered Hitler were neither demanded nor particularly useful to the future dictator Machtan argues.

What the German courts will make of this new analysis remains to be seen. The Prince of Prussia is also still engaged in direct negotiations with cultural organisations in the hope that he might reach compromise solutions outside the courtroom.

But the wounds in German collective memory are still deep as evidenced by the heated tone of the public debate. The Hohenzollerns have been called a ‘family clan which has haunted central Europe for over 1000 years with its wars nepotism and catastrophes’ by one commentator; others have called the claims ‘an insult to the republic’ ‘greedy’ and even an ‘erosion of democracy itself’. Georg Friedrich is clearly trying to rationalise the debate by employing the services of a respected expert in the field but he is fighting an uphill battle.

It is unlikely that press appearances no matter how sleek and professionally conducted will allay the collective historical anxiety that still holds sway in many areas of German public life. Even the professional research of a well-respected historian is unlikely to make a difference. Whether Crown Prince Wilhelm helped the Nazis to power or not may be the legal question. But the moral question for many Germans is still whether the Hohenzollerns deserve the return of their riches.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a specially called meeting on Friday the Covington Board of Commissioners voted to hire the company for $2.94 million to take a redesign created by Hub+Weber Architects and make it a reality.

The building at 1730 Russell – the former home of Cincinnati Tag & Supply – has 68000 square feet and sits on 3.68 acres tucked up against the CSX railroad tracks.

The City bought the property last year as part of a major “musical chairs” economic development deal that will free up the current Public Works complex at the southwestern end of Boron Drive for the new regional headquarters of Rumpke Waste & Recycling. Rumpke bought the property for $8 million from the City and will also build a new state-of-the-art transfer facility.

Covington-based Radius will begin the work on Public Works’ home immediately and – subject to weather and supply-chain challenges – finish in February 2022 said Ken Smith Covington’s interim city manager.

“It can’t happen soon enough” said Chris Warneford Covington’s Public Works Director. “We’re going to have a bigger building be able to house all of our operations under one roof have a better ventilation system be away from the transfer station and be more centrally located as related to the urban core of the city. We’re excited.”

The renovated building will be subdivided to hold offices; the mechanics’ bays for the department’s Fleet Management Division; a sign-making operation; and storage for equipment tools supplies and vehicles.

Among the work required will be the installation of more floor drains a more sophisticated ventilation system expanded electric capacity and doors of various sizes.

Separately Public Works employees are grading the site and building a slab that will serve as a foundation for the dome-shaped building that will house road salt for winter treatment. The salt dome will be built via a separate contract.

The Public Works Department maintains the City’s streets and sidewalks medians parks facilities and fleet and urban tree canopy.

Operations include filling potholes; paving road surfaces; repairing sidewalks curbs and catch basins; sweeping streets; plowing snow; collecting leaves; cutting grass and weeds; pruning removing and planting trees; fixing playground equipment; and repairing and maintaining police cruisers fire trucks and dump trucks.

It has 60-70 employees depending upon the season.

Smith said the Commission called the special meeting to approve the contract because of the time constraint and because there is no Commission meeting on Tuesday.

“Both Public Works and Rumpke want to be in their new homes and we want to make that happen as soon as we can” he said. “It’s a win for everybody.”

Hean Rangsey

DBD Engineering Plc sold all 6461538 shares on offer ahead of its initial public offering (IPO) listing which the company expects by next month as it gets set to emerge as the first firm to go public on the Cambodia Securities Exchange’s (CSX) Growth Board.

The shares were sold at 2380 riel ($0.58) per unit to raise more than $3.84 million during the July 26-August 18 offer period which closed with oversubscription or more orders than shares available – a sign of investor confidence in the future of the company.

Around 3.4 million shares were sold to strategic investors and the remainder went to individual investors according to SBI Royal Securities Plc (SBIR) the underwriter or manager of the IPO.

The Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) on August 25 approved the results of the subscription offer and the refund list SBIR said adding that investors who would not be getting the shares they paid for would be refunded a process it said began on August 27.

SBIR managing director Seng Chan Thoeun told The Post on August 29 that there was no book-building process for the IPO and that the price was set based on the equity valuation report by SBIR DBD and main investors.

“As a normal marketing process and before we open the subscription we need to find strategic investors. However based on the current demand status I believe only retail investors could take the whole IPO without needing prior support from strategic investors” he said.

However demand from retail investors is “so strong now” he pointed out. “That is the reason I said just only retail investors are enough to support the whole IPO.”

Chan Thoeun said the listing date ultimately depends on the CSX but added that he expects it to be this week or early next week.

Speaking at a virtual IPO roadshow on July 19 DBD managing director Neang Vithy noted that the company was established in 1995 to provide quality water electricity and air conditioning services to hospitals and houses which have garnered continuous support from customers.

DBD received final approval for the IPO from the SERC on June 24 he said adding that the company had won the first iteration of the “Excellence Programme” organised by the regulator in 2018.

“I strongly hope that DBD will receive the support of investors which will allow DBD to take a successful step on the Cambodia Securities Exchange and expand its business potential” he said.

On July 22 the CSX granted approval in principle of real estate developer JS Land Plc’s equity securities listing eligibility review application for trading on the Growth Board. JS Land is poised to become the second company to list on the bourse’s secondary board after DBD.

The Growth Board was launched in late 2015 as a secondary platform to lift some of the barriers for listing and cater more to companies with less access to capital or financial resources. But it had failed to attract a single issuer over the years even as the Main Board witnessed increasing growth.

According to SERC regulations companies are required to have a minimum of $500000 in operating capital to list compared to $7.5 million on the main board.

Companies that list on the platform are also required to release one year of audited financial results compared to the two years required for bigger companies.

Additionally the results must show a positive net profit or positive operating cash flow with gross profit margin of at least 10 per cent.",,,,,,,,,

(AP) -- Cummins Falls State Park in Middle Tennessee has been named state park of the year.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures the department said in a news release Thursday.

The 306-acre (123-hectare) park used social media to inform people of river conditions scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs held day camps for children and school programs and hosted a weekly home-school group officials said.

Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants planted native species built two greenhouses and grown and processed sorghum officials said.

Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee.

The campaign named The Cool Down was launched on Monday by Pocock who after retiring from rugby union in 2020 has focused his energies on conservation and climate activism.

Pocock is joined by more than 300 current and former athletes who have penned an open letter to the nation’s leaders encouraging bold action be taken as extreme weather events become more frequent and “our Australian way of life including sport at every level” is jeopardised.

The group which includes Pat Cummins Cate and Bronte Campbell Lance Franklin Rohan Browning Darcy Vescio Mick Fanning Craig Foster Ian Chappell Liz Ellis and Mark Webber hopes to encourage Australians to make their voices heard. It has backed scientific calls for the country to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by 2030 and reach net zero emissions before 2050.

The campaign highlights the connection between extreme weather events and sport – including how heat has impacted the Australian Open tennis tournament in recent times and how bushfire smoke has affected professional sport – and Pocock called for bold action to be taken.

“The people and places we love as well as the sports we love so much are threatened by climate change” Pocock said. “We have the resources in our own backyard to be a world leader in this field and as a sporting nation we’re used to performing on the world stage. It’s time we harness that to focus on strong climate action.”

The latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published earlier this month found human activities were unequivocally heating the planet and causing changes not seen for centuries and in some cases thousands of years.

The world’s leading authority on climate science found greenhouse gas emissions were already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe helping cause increased heatwaves heavier rainfall events and more intense droughts and tropical cyclones the report found. In Australia it found average temperatures above land had already increased by about 1.4C since 1910.

The open letter which people are invited to sign says “sport’s future is more uncertain than ever but its power has never been more important”.

“Australians have always punched above our weight on the world stage and it’s time to do it on climate.”

Professor Mark Howden the director of the ANU Institute for Climate Energy & Disaster Solutions said any delay in addressing Australia’s poor record on emission-reduction would have severe consequences.

“If we don’t take rapid and strong global action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions the world could well have passed 1.5C by the time of the Brisbane Olympics in 2032 failing to meet the lower of the two Paris Agreement temperature goals” said Howden who is also a vice-chair of the IPCC.

“This could come at a time when everyone’s eyes will be on Australia focusing attention on our contributions to reduce emissions.”

No major sporting organisation in Australia includes climate change in their annual reporting and former Diamonds netball coach Ellis said the campaign was “our stake in the ground to spread this important message”.

“As sportspeople we recognise the role we play in our sports-loving country and supporting the generations of athletes to come after us. We have the opportunity to take action within our field and use our platform to accelerate the change we need to see” Ellis said.

Other sportspeople to lend their names to the campaign include current Wallabies captain Michael Hooper AFL footballer Nat Fyfe and AFLW star Daisy Pearce the NRL’s Nathan Cleary golfer Karrie Webb cricketer Rachael Haynes and Matildas duo Tameka Yallop and Alanna Kennedy.

The Australian government is facing increasing pressure to increase the 2030 emissions target it set six years ago – a 26-28% cut below 2005 – and join the more than 100 countries that have set a mid-century net zero emissions goal.

Earlier this month Dr Jonathan Pershing the deputy to US presidential climate envoy John Kerry told the Guardian that Australia’s targets were “not sufficient” and the country should be considering a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The former UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Australia was “out of step” with the rest of the world and and the former European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström warned it was becoming “more and more isolated” at a time when the world was increasingly being hit by floods fires and droughts."

Guest columnist

Taking on the mantle of supposedly reducing drug prices and eliminating alleged fraudulent activity within the pharmaceutical marketplace some of Ohio’s largest newspapers and government officials are targeting pharmacy benefit managers.

More:'I just see fraud all over this': Insiders detail how clawbacks drive up drug prices hurt pharmacies

PBMs are utilized by insurers self-insured employer health benefit plans union health plans Medicare Part D plans state government plans Medicaid managed care plans and other entities to manage pharmaceutical benefits for their employees or members.

PBMs administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans.

Attacking PBMs over high drug costs is unfounded when they have helped to save money and often must respond to government actions that have distorted the marketplace.

The December 2020 Supreme Court decision in Rutledge v. PCMA which found that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act a federal law that regulates private-sector employee-based health plans did not preempt an Arkansas law establishing a statutory minimum payment to network pharmacies (a price control) will invite further government meddling.

Several states have passed or are considering bills that would regulate PBMs.

Provisions include requiring PBMs to reimburse any pharmacy regardless of whether it is in their network; restricting mail-order delivery which delivers pharmaceuticals at lower costs; allowing any pharmacy to be a “specialty pharmacy” which dispense complex medications for chronic diseases requiring special handling that many pharmacies are unqualified to undertake; and limiting PBMs’ ability to conduct audits of pharmacies within their network to ensure proper dispensing and preventing fraud.

Other initiatives include transparency requirements that would reveal proprietary information within private contracts.

More:Seniors' health care suffers due to skyrocketing fees for prescription drugs pharmacists say

Patients should know what their drugs will cost but revealing proprietary pricing information among different providers helps competitors game the system. If states implement “reforms” and micromanage PBMs drug prices will increase.

Processing huge volumes of prescription drug programs is complicated and overwhelming so health insurers in the 1960s hired PBMs to fill that role.

In the 1980s when insurance and pharmaceutical markets grew exponentially due to medical advances PBMs expanded their roles to negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies.

In 2005 before Medicare Part D was implemented the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost taxpayers $174 billion by 2015 but it cost only $75 billion thanks to private-sector negotiations by PBMs.

More:Doctors: Decisions by PBMs make vital drugs unaffordable for many patients

Some say the PBM industry is anticompetitive because CVS-Caremark Express Scripts and OptumRX control about 70 to 75% of the market. However the National Association of Insurance Commissioners says there are 66 PBM companies nationwide so competition exists including among the big three.

This does not mean market reforms are unneeded in health care.

Reforming Medicare Part D is a good place to start. Congressional meddling through the Affordable Care Act and the 2018 Bipartisan Balanced Budget Act placed a price control on drugs now 70% within the coverage gap in Part D which distorts market dynamics and drives up costs.

That problem can be resolved with the American Action Forum plan which places a cap on beneficiary out-of-pocket costs eliminates the coverage gap entirely and puts greater financial risk on insurers and PBMs that would encourage more vigorous negotiations on pharmaceutical prices and use of generics making Part D behave more like true insurance.

Greater use of Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts would also put consumers in charge of the health plans they want and need helping to drive real free-market reforms and lower health care costs.

Taxpayers consumers and patients should beware of claims from government officials and the media that they know what is best for them.

Lowering drug costs should be achieved through marketplace reforms not heavy-handed laws and burdensome regulations.

The couple had been tested at the West Philadelphia site each month for most of the pandemic as a precaution. After being vaccinated in the spring they’d stopped.

But now they were back spurred by a roommate’s COVID-19 exposure and concerns about breakthrough cases that can be caused by the highly transmissible delta variant.

At Sayre the number of people seeking tests each day has increased from 20 or fewer a couple of months ago to 100 on some days this month. Many come because they’ve been exposed and a large portion are vaccinated said Jill Gansert a doctor at Sayre. Some like Collins were regulars pre-vaccine.

“People who I think felt safe for some time now are back to using testing as their safeguard” Gansert said. “Obviously I tell people ‘Welcome back’ but nobody’s happy we’re back in this situation.”

After a lull in early summer the demand for testing is again increasing across the region — driven by the delta-fueled rise in cases among unvaccinated people the possibility of infection in the vaccinated and employers requiring regular testing.

And with vaccinated people back among those seeking testing for exposure or mild symptoms — and cold viruses circulating as people return to the world after isolation — the calculus for capacity needs is changing.

At-home rapid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. Many more patients are getting swabbed at sites run by health systems they report. Pennsylvanians are searching for “rapid covid test” more frequently than they have since the holidays according to Google trends data.

“A lot of things are happening right now” said Gopal Sankaran a public health professor at West Chester University. “Students are going to school. Young adults are going to college. Parents are going back to work.”

And more people are being exposed. In Pennsylvania the number of new cases reported each day is approaching levels not seen since the spring with a similar but slightly slower rise in New Jersey. Hospitalizations are also increasing primarily among the unvaccinated though they remain far lower than in earlier surges.

About 8000 more people are seeking tests each week in Philadelphia compared to last month according to the city. Demand has also jumped for at least a dozen public and hospital-run testing sites across the region spokespeople said.

The number of people getting PCR tests at local CVS stores each day is the highest it’s been since December a spokesperson said while at-home tests are its top-selling item in the region.

So far there’s no concern about a shortage of tests said providers experts and local health departments even as they predicted the higher pace would continue into the fall. But whether you can get one immediately for free and in your neighborhood can be chancier.

Katy Otto of Pennsport ran into dead ends trying to book appointments this week: She found some testing sites closed some booked and some with no one answering phones she said. On the CVS website drugstore after drugstore showed no availability.

Eventually she and her husband scored appointments in New Jersey. Two days later they got negative results but the wait meant her husband a letter carrier was missing work so they still visited drugstores looking for at-home tests.

“I just can’t understand how we’re this deep into the pandemic and we haven’t mastered testing yet” said Otto 43 who thinks the vaccinated couple got runny noses and coughs from their 9-month-old daughter. “We’re here trying to do the right thing.”

Finding tests

The U.S. testing system never graduated from a patchwork approach that often requires people to hunt for appointments online or call an array of drugstores hospitals and urgent care clinics.

Sites have varying hours. Some require symptoms exposure or a doctor’s referral. Others charge a fee. Some have closed since the spring: Chester County Main Line Health and Virtua for instance scaled down or shuttered sites with the two health systems closing big clinics in favor of testing by their urgent-care centers or doctors.

In Philadelphia some places may not be able to accommodate walk-ins said a spokesperson but the city’s testing partners indicated it was “not a systemic problem” even with rising demand.

Experts also said there’s not enough messaging about when and where to get tested which can confuse those seeking tests and cause a rush on the most recognized providers like CVS.

“Any of the ones that we usually go to we couldn’t get an appointment” said Sasha Spassoff 48 of the Roxborough-area CVS stores he tried last week.

In the Bryn Mawr Hospital and Lankenau Medical Center emergency rooms people have increasingly shown up in recent weeks frantically looking for testing said Jonathan Stallkamp interim chief medical officer for Main Line Health. He urged the public instead to contact their doctors and go to designated testing sites.

Others though reported easy experiences. Collins said it was “very straightforward very easy” at Sayre. When Karen Cravens of Voorhees got a cold after traveling her husband quickly found an at-home kit at a drugstore and she tested negative that day. For Ellen Sager of Vineland making an appointment getting tested and going home took an hour from start to finish.

Providers in and around Philadelphia as well as the state and city health departments emphasized that tests are available for anyone who needs one. And several providers said they are prepared to boost capacity.

More people in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are getting vaccinated too with August beating July for the number of first shots given. The more people get vaccinated said Esther Chernak director of Drexel University’s Center for Public Health Readiness and Communication the less critical testing will be.

At least 935 testing sites are operating in Pennsylvania and more than 950 in New Jersey according to the state health departments. Both have seen demand increase over the last two months with the daily number of PCR tests having risen 40% since July in New Jersey.

The departments said state and commercial laboratories were now well-equipped to handle surges.

‘Trying to feel out’ the future

The evolving nature of the pandemic and return of some restrictions have left vaccinated people uneasy.

“I think for the general population it’s difficult to keep track of the changing messages” said Abby Rudolph associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University. “What breakthrough infections are and how likely we’d expect them to be is a point that seems to be particularly confusing to people.”

» READ MORE: How many people in Pa. got vaccinated and still got COVID-19? The state isn’t counting.

Breakthrough infection remains unlikely experts said and data indicate a vaccinated person who is infected may not be contagious for as long as an infected unvaccinated person. Vaccinated people who are exposed to COVID-19 should be tested three to five days after exposure said Chester County Health Director Jeanne Franklin.

And everyone including vaccinated people should stay home and get tested if they have symptoms such as a runny nose congestion cough or fever Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia epidemiologist Julia Sammons said.

For Sager 57 of Vineland her test in early August was her first since getting vaccinated.

“I will get tested without hesitation if I get a cold or any other symptom” Sager said “because I fear for the health of my grandkids and all kids/people who cannot get the vaccine.”

Collins and their girlfriend are “trying to feel out” whether to change their behavior now that the delta variant means breakthrough cases are more likely.

“We may go back to getting tested regularly” said Collins 34. “We thought we knew what we were doing … and now it feels a little up in the air again.”

When to get tested for the coronavirus

When to get tested:

You have symptoms including fever or chills cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing fatigue muscle or body aches headache new loss of taste or smell sore throat congestion or runny nose nausea or vomiting diarrhea. You’ve been exposed to someone who’s infected if you’ve been within six feet of the infected person for 15 minutes or longer. If you’re fully vaccinated get tested three to five days after exposure and wear a mask in public. If you’re not fully vaccinated quarantine and get tested immediately. If you get a negative result get tested again five to seven days after exposure. In Pennsylvania the health department says you can stop quarantining after seven days if you have a negative test on or after day five. You are not fully vaccinated and must travel: Get tested one to three days before your trip. Get tested three to five days after travel and stay home for seven days after travel even if you test negative.

What else to know:

Your school employer doctor or health department may refer you for testing. Some people decide to test before or after travel or before or after close contact with immunocompromised unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable people. The New Jersey Department of Health recommends testing for anyone who is not fully vaccinated after being at a large gathering where social distancing was hard to maintain or in a crowded indoor setting. Seek emergency medical care if someone has trouble breathing; chest pain or pressure; confusion; inability to stay awake; pale gray or blue skin lips or nail beds; or other severe symptoms.

The state Supreme Court will announce this week approval of a new rule eliminating what are called “peremptory challenges.” This is the ability of attorneys in civil and criminal trials to disqualify potential jurors without citing any reason at all.

Instead as of Jan. 1 lawyers will need some specific reason to strike someone from the jury pool like an admitted bias or their personal knowledge of the parties or the dispute.

The move comes over the objections from several prosecutors who contend as does Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel it “will ultimately lead to trials that are less fair for all sides.”

Instead the Supreme Court justices accepted the recommendation of two judges from the state Court of Appeals Peter Swann and Paul McMurdie who argued that the move will go a long way to eliminating persistent problems with juries that often do not reflect the racial and ethnic backgrounds of their communities.

“The primary tool by which this discrimination is practiced is the peremptory strike” they wrote in their petition.

No one has disputed that lawyers have used peremptory challenges to fashion a jury they think will be more favorable to their arguments.

But the appellate judges noted this is not anything guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. In fact they said most states did not allow for it until after the Civil War.

“A cynical observer might note that the power came into being in the years after black Americans obtained the right to serve on juries” they wrote.

The problem was addressed — or at least supposed to be addressed — by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 in the case of Batson v. Kentucky.

In that case a Black man was on trial charged with burglary and receipt of stolen goods.

The prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to eliminate all four Black prospective jurors. Batson was then convicted.

In a 7-2 ruling the nation’s high court said the prosecutor’s actions unconstitutionally denied Batson his right to a fair trial and his right to equal treatment under the law.

Since then any time there has been a peremptory challenge to a minority juror the attorney needs to articulate a non-racial reason for his or her decision. But Swann and McMurdie said the data they have seen convinces them that it still means fewer minorities on juries even with lawyers citing what they claim is a legitimate reason.

“There can be no doubt that race continues to play a major role in the exercise of peremptories decades after Batson was decided” they wrote.

There is evidence of that in Arizona.

In criminal cases here the proportion of white jurors seated varied only 3% from their representation in the population a study compiled by the Administrative Office of the Courts shows. By contrast Black jurors were underrepresented by 16%.

And it was worse for Hispanics who were underrepresented on juries 21% of the time with a 51% gap for Native Americans.

The disparities were even more pronounced in civil cases.

But much of the opposition comes from prosecutors.

The peremptory challenge gives prosecutors a chance to strike jurors who they believe based on their answers to questions asked during the screen process hold some bias Adel said.

“Expecting a prospective juror to candidly admit that they cannot be fair is not realistic” wrote Kenneth Vick her chief deputy on her behalf.

“Most people do not think of themselves as unfair or biased” he continued. “Others even if they recognize a bias in themselves likely do not want to express their true opinions on sensitive topics like race their views on the law or their beliefs in the equity or inequity of the legal system in front of a group of strangers.”

That view was echoed by Elizabeth Burton Ortiz executive director of the Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys’ Advisory Council.

“What reasonable minded person would want to publicly admit on the record in front of a group of stranger that they did not even judge themselves to be fair?” she wrote.

And Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Klingerman writing for Mark Brnovich his boss argued that peremptory challenges help ensure that those who are unfit do not serve on juries and eliminates the need for a lawyer to find some “challenge for cause.”

Instead Brnovich wants more study of the matter.

But Mikel Steinfeld a Maricopa County public defender said the move is long overdue.

“There is near-uniform agreement that peremptory strikes have long been a tool for discrimination” he wrote. He cited a 2005 survey which found that every lawyer interviewed considered race and gender when picking a jury.

Among judges the sentiment is more divided.

Nine out of the 10 Yavapai County Superior Court judges submitted comments in support of the change concluding that the peremptory process is misued.

But a majority of judges in Mohave County are opposed. Kip Anderson administrator of the court said peremptory challenges are a tool not just for prosecutors but also defendants whose attorneys may sense bias but not be able to articulate it in challenging someone for cause.

“Characteristics such as facial expressions body language tone of voice dress and grooming are not verbally expressed by prospective jurors and are rarely reflected in the record” Anderson wrote. “However they often indicate that these jurors would not favor the defendant.”

And even the Arizona Black Bar while taking no formal position is concerned that complete abolition of peremptory challenges “could have unintended and undesirable consequences.”

Not all the opposition to the change is coming from prosecutors. Attorneys defending doctors and hospitals in medical malpractice cases involving millions of dollars also want to keep their ability to strike jurors without having to articulate a reason.

“These cases can be highly emotional” they wrote. “It is especially important to have the peremptory challenge safety valve for ensuring that the jurors who are seated in these cases are not unfairly biased for or against one side or the other.”

But McMurdie and Swann say there’s another — and potentially more practical — reason aside from racial and ethnic balance to eliminate peremptory challenges.

In capital cases each side now is allowed 10 peremptory challenges. The figure is six per side in other superior court criminal cases and two in lower court.

For civil trials each side gets four such challenges.

Allowing these strikes means that more people have to be called for jury duty than actually will be needed. That they said means that “a substantial percentage of jurors who make the effort to appear for jury service are merely fodder for arbitrary hunch-based strikes.”

The new rule still allows attorneys to challenge a prospective juror “for cause.” But it will require the lawyer to prove “by a preponderance of the evidence that the juror cannot render a fair and impartial verdict.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3NoZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjgvd3lhbmRvdHRlLXBvbGljZS1jaGllZi1uYWJzLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1zaG9wbGlmdGVyLXRyeWluZy10by1mbGVlLW9uLWJ1cy_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuZXdzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L3d5YW5kb3R0ZS1wb2xpY2UtY2hpZWYtbmFicy1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtc2hvcGxpZnRlci10cnlpbmctdG8tZmxlZS1vbi1idXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wyandotte police chief nabs suspected shoplifter trying to flee on bus,"For the most part a police chief’s days of busting criminals on the street are behind him by the time he leads a police department.

While his job description changes quite a bit from his days patrolling the streets a chief never knows when he could be called to action.

That was the case recently with Wyandotte Police Chief Brian Zalewski who was driving into work when he heard a larceny call given out over the police radio.

At about 7:30 a.m. Aug. 13 officers were dispatched to CVS/pharmacy 2025 Fort St. on a retail fraud that had just occurred.

A thief had stolen several bottles of liquor. He was described as wearing a camouflage shirt and carrying a red bag.

Zalewski was aware that people who commit crimes often use public transportation as a quick escape so he checked the surrounding bus stops.

On Fort Street near Cedar Zalewski observed a 53-year-old Lincoln Park man standing near a bus stop. He was in the process of removing his camouflage shirt and stuffing it in a tan bag.

Zalewski approached the man and observed a red bag protruding out of the tan bag.

Police said that initially the career criminal denied any wrongdoing but when the chief confronted the man with the facts he confessed to the crime. Zalewski recovered the stolen merchandise and arrested the man.

The Wyandotte Police Department which posted about the incident on its Facebook page said the stolen items included three bottles of Jack Daniel’s whiskey a half-gallon of Jim Beam whiskey and a “tallboy” of Bud Light.

“The arrestee’s criminal history was really impressive” police stated in the post. “He has literally been getting arrested several times a year mostly for stealing for over 30 years!”

Deputy Police Chief Archie Hamilton said the alleged thief had a good plan: change shirts conceal his red bag inside a different style bag and then get out of the area by hopping on a bus.

“But his planning could not outplay the 30 years of law enforcement experience the chief possesses” Hamilton said. “In the end the career law man outwitted the career criminal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFuYWx5c2lzL2FyaWQtNDAzMjI3MzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baby Christopher: An avoidable medical tragedy,"Rebecca Price and Pat Kiely have been through an experience that few will ever have to endure.

In March 2019 they were told that the unborn child Rebecca was carrying had a fatal foetal abnormality and would not survive the pregnancy or would die within a day of delivery.

The advice was that it would be best to proceed with a termination.

Two weeks after the procedure a final result came through from the tests that had shown up the abnormality. Instead of confirming the result which they had been told was definitive this showed that a catastrophic error had been made. Their unborn baby a boy was healthy.

Life-altering event

In the two years since the life-altering event the couple hasn’t got closure. The pregnancy had been much longed for the loss leaving a sense of bereavement and shock.

Their trauma has they believe been compounded by how the whole matter was dealt with by the maternity hospital in question and a State that appears unable to take control of the situation.

“We are different people than we were before this” Pat says.

“Part of that is down to the tragedy but the other thing is closure.

There is still the ongoing risk as far as we are concerned. The risk to other couples has not been addressed

On December 20 2018 President Michael D Higgins signed into law the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.

The legislation was in response to the passing of the referendum the previous May to repeal the eighth amendment which had banned abortion. The referendum was passed by a two-to-one majority.

Fatal foetal abnormalities

One of the key areas of the referendum campaign was that of fatal foetal abnormalities.

A series of personal stories before and during the campaign had highlighted the emotional trauma of parents who had to go to the UK or Europe for a termination when told their expected child would not survive for long outside the womb.

Section 11 of the new act stated: “A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section where 2 medical practitioners having examined the pregnant woman are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is present a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth.”

Four days after the president signed the act into law Rebecca Price and Pat Kiely received the news for which they had been longing. Rebecca was pregnant. It was to be a Christmas like no other full of the expectation of what the coming year would bring.

Rebecca Price and Patrick Kiely on Christmas Eve 2018 the day they found out they were expecting a baby.

Pat is from Oysterhaven in Co. Cork. He is a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who is well known for his work with children who have scoliosis the painful spinal condition. Rebecca is from Wales and works in the medical devices sector.

The couple met in Dublin and live on the northside of the city.

The new health act came into force on January 1 2019. Over the following days Rebecca got in touch with her local maternity hospital the Rotunda but was told that she would have to wait until March 20 for her first pregnancy scan.

“I would have been 17 or so weeks then which is late for a first scan” Rebecca says. “So we went private to the Merrion Fetal Health Clinic for a scan.”

The clinic is owned by five consultants attached to the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) in Holles St.

On February 21 Rebecca and Pat attended the scan. The news was good all was perfect. As Rebecca was getting dressed the nurse asked would she be interested in doing the test to check whether there was any sign of Down Syndrome or two other possible serious conditions.

Harmony test

This is the non-invasive prenatal test known as the Harmony test. It is designed to detect the risk of trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome) or trisomy 13. The test is taken by many pregnant women particularly those of an older age.

According to Rebecca the nurse said that if she took the Harmony test that day she would get it at a reduced rate.

“We went across the road and had a coffee and thought about it” Rebecca says.

I was 35 an older mother and there would be no harm in getting any information we could. If there was something then we could be in a position to prepare for it

“So we rang back and said yes we’d do it.”

That afternoon she took the test. Had the test not been offered or had the couple opted not to take it their lives would have taken a very different course.

Seven days later Rebecca got a call from consultant obstetrician Fionnuala McAuliffe at the NMH. The bad news was the test had detected trisomy 18 Edwards Syndrome. The prognosis was that if the child survived birth he wouldn’t live for long.

However the test while marketed at providing 99% accuracy is only designed to identify a “high risk” of the presence of the trisomys. A follow-up invasive test is required for confirmation.

The devastated couple were asked to come in the following Monday for a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test which would provide a definitive diagnosis.

The CVS is one of two tests designed for this purpose. The other is amniocentesis which is considered to be more accurate.

Amniocentesis directly reflects the foetal DNA structure CVS is for the placenta and is generally used in the earlier stages of pregnancy under 15 weeks. The foetal and placenta DNAs are usually similar but not necessarily so.

When the couple arrived at the NMH on the Monday Rebecca first underwent another ultrasound scan. Again this showed everything normal.

“I asked didn’t that raise a question about the Harmony test but I was told no because the Harmony was a DNA test and it had to be the more accurate one” Rebecca says.

She then had the CVS test. She was around 15 weeks pregnant at the time.

Four days later on Friday March 8 the couple got a phone call from a nurse in the hospital. The initial CVS result confirmed that there was a fatal foetal abnormality in the form of trisomy 18. They were asked to come in the following Monday for a consultation on how to proceed.

“When we went in we talked it through with Prof. McAuliffe” Rebecca says.

“I had been in touch with Soft the charity for parents of children with Edwards syndrome and I had got a fair bit of information on it.

We wanted to see if there was any way that there could be a chance that he might survive and live for a while at least

“But in the end we were told that the results were definitive that this was full-blown trisomy 18 and the final result would only show if there was something else wrong as well.

""I asked were we being told there was no hope and she said yes.""

Termination

Arrangements were made for the termination. Rebecca was not examined by a second physician as required by Section 11 of the act under which the procedure was to take place.

Later the hospital would say that another doctor examined Rebecca’s file and notes to fulfill the requirements of the law but the legislation explicitly refers to the second physician “having examined the pregnant woman”.

The termination took place on March 14. The couple named the baby Christopher. Rebecca retained the umbilical chord for sentimental reasons. They had Christopher cremated and brought the ashes to west Kerry where the couple have a holiday home. The ashes were scattered in the shadow of Mount Brandon.

On March 26 the obstetrician in the NMH received a phone call from the laboratory in University Hospital Glasgow where the CVS test was being processed.

Final result

The final result was completely unexpected. There was no sign of trisomy 18. The termination of Rebecca’s pregnancy had been based on erroneous and incomplete results.

Some days later the couple were asked to come into the hospital one more time.

On April 4 they met Prof McAuliffe again and a midwife. They were told that the final results were not as expected but had shown there were some normal cells.

“We were told that theoretically there was a tiny chance that these cells may represent he was a normal child” Pat remembers.

I asked had this kind of thing been seen before and was told it had

""We were left confused. I felt dumb because I couldn’t figure it out. We were both at a loss and then the meeting segued into whether we should be tested for trisomy 18.”

Rebecca was given an envelope with her file in it and the full results of the tests. They were both asked to give blood samples to check whether either was a carrier of trisomy 18.

Unsatisfactory

The meeting was unsatisfactory from their point of view as if everybody had been talking around something.

Afterwards Pat had to rush off to a surgery in Crumlin Children’s Hospital. Rebecca walked towards the city centre and stopped in a coffee shop. She opened the envelope which held her file.

The first line of the final report from the lab in Scotland read: “Chromosome analysis of cells cultured from chonionic villus biopsy indicates an apparently normal male chromosome complement with no evidence of mosaicism involving chromosome 18 in any of the thirty cells examined.”

She didn’t have to go any further. She knew the enormity of what the report stated. Their unborn baby had been perfectly healthy. There was no reason to believe that he had as the couple had been assured a fatal abnormality.

Rebecca Price.

In Crumlin Pat was unsettled as a result of the meeting that morning. He got through his work and when he had a minute to spare he phoned Rebecca to see how she was.

“She was very distressed and said get home as soon as you can. I legged it home and I found her upstairs in the dark and she was crying and she handed me the report and it confirmed that Christopher was probably not fatally affected by anything.”

Medical negligence

A recurring theme of medical negligence cases down through recent decades has been the conduct and legal approach of the State or hospital towards the victim in the aftermath of an incident.

In the three weeks between the termination on March 14 2019 and the final consultation with the obstetrician on April 4 a bereavement nurse had been in contact with Rebecca. (The couple are highly complementary of the nursing staff they encountered in the NMH).

After April 4 there was no further contact. Neither was there any follow-on call from any of the senior staff at the hospital. On April 12 Pat rang the master of NMH Shane Higgins and expressed the devastation he and Rebecca were experiencing.

“I met him in his office and gave him our experience word for word and how we had to make the discovery ourselves of what happened” Pat says.

I told him my belief that this must have happened to other people and we wanted it investigated and a way to ensure that it would never happen again

An incident form is required to be submitted within 72 hours when something of this magnitude occurs. The form wasn’t completed until April 18. It records the date of the incident as March 27 the date that the final result was received rather than March 14 the date of the termination.

Sympathy

There was further communication with the hospital. The obstetrician replied expressing sympathy and offering to meet again. Despite that the couple felt they were getting the runaround and asked solicitor Caoimhe Haughey to communicate on their behalf.

ON May 13 Ms Haughey wrote to the hospital pointing out a number of issues that had arisen in her clients’ case including the failure to certify the termination.

According to Section 20 of the 2018 Act all terminations carried out must be notified to the health minister within 28 days of the procedure.

On the same day that Ms Haughey’s letter was delivered the hospital notified the minister of the termination that had taken place 60 days previously.

With the assistance of a geneticist the couple organised for DNA to be extracted from the umbilical chord to be sent to Centogene a laboratory based in Germany that specialises in genetic analysis.

The resultant report stated: “We did not detect any clinically relevant copy number variation (CNV). We detected a normal male chromosomal constitution.”

This was further confirmation that trisomy 18 had not been present.

Medical file

Rebecca sought her medical file from the NMH through a data request. When she received the file the pathology report was missing. She wrote and got more documents and still the file wasn’t complete.

She wrote again and again. In total the couple had to make seven separate requests for the file because it kept coming back incomplete.

An image of Baby Christopher from Rebecca Price's first scan

The experience prompted them to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commissioner which the Irish Examiner understands engaged with the hospital on their behalf.

The hospital didn’t communicate with Rebecca’s GP as might be expected under the circumstances. The impression the couple got was that the hospital just wanted them to go away and let bygones be bygones.

Investigation

Later in May the hospital announced that the London-based Royal College of Obstetricians was going to conduct an investigation. This did not proceed ostensibly because the college said it didn’t have the expertise required. A major issue throughout was that neither the HSE nor the minister could order an independent inquiry as the NMH is a voluntary or non-profit privately owned hospital.

The State funds and indemnifies the hospital but does not have the power to order an inquiry. As such the hospital would be funding the inquiry calling into question its independence.

Over the last two years the couple have had meetings with two ministers for health HSE chief medical officer Tony Holohan and numerous officials. They have written to the Attorney General and Dublin City coroner about what they believe to be a breach of the law.

Legal action

In 2020 having failed to get any kind of a response they considered appropriate they launched a legal action against the hospital and the private health clinic where Rebecca had the initial scan.

Last December there was an attempt at mediation between the parties. A report on the matter compiled by Peter McKenna HSE clinical director for the national women and infants programme.

“The aim was that the family could obtain an acknowledgment of the significance of the event that occurred an apology for that event and an explanation as to how the hospital had ensured a similar event could not happen again” the report states.

The process broke down despite a series of meetings over three months into March this year. Mr McKenna points out that in recent years there have been two cases at the NMH in which the department felt that an independent inquiry would be appropriate.

“The first case was a maternal death and this current case involving a termination is the second. In both cases the personnel suggested by the Institution [the NMH] to do the review were appropriate and their integrity beyond reproach.

“What can be said is that the independence of the review could be called into question if it was organised by the Institution in which the adverse event took place. That the funder of the service (Department/Minister) cannot mandate an independent review seems inappropriate indefensible and ultimately unsustainable.”

Grief

It has now been over two years since the couple experienced trauma and tragedy on a scale few will ever encounter. In that time the nature of the fallout has ensured that they are still having difficulty getting through the first stage of grief.

“The risk to other couples has not been addressed” Pat says. “They brought this legislation in very quickly and chose 1 January [2019] to start it for political reasons. Then six weeks later all of this happened. Within another six weeks we had flagged it and we haven’t even had a response from the current minister about our concerns.”

Their ordeal has been life-changing but they are both individually equipped to research and process all that is involved in their case. They are acutely aware that others may not be so fortunate.

What about the couples who don’t have access to the kind of people I was able to call up

“What about those who are not in a position to take on board all the different aspects in terms of the science or medicine? We were fortunate in that regard but has it happened to others who haven’t been able to deal with the enormity of it or pursue it to the extent that we have?

“Nobody should be put through this” Pat says.

Rebecca says she is acutely aware of the wider issues around abortion that arose in their ordeal.

“It was never our intention to polarise people” she says. “The issue here is pro-choice should be exactly that informed choice made on correct information. If the legislation and the guidelines were followed we would not be in this situation.

“If Christopher’s life and legacy is that other failures and future children can be better protected that would be something real.”"

Anderson County Mayor Terry Frank recently contacted state forestry officials to meet regarding new firefighting equipment now stationed in the county.

Frank and Anderson County Emergency Management Services' Karen Ooten and Brice Kidwell and Emergency Medical Services Director Nathan Sweet recently got a firsthand look at the new 104-horsepower John Deere 650k dozer and International transport a news release from Frank's office stated.

Warm and dry weather patterns can contribute to greater risks for wildfires in Anderson County and throughout the country. Now if wildfires spark in the area the forestry work center in Anderson County has some new equipment to make the job a little easier and safer.

“I am so very thankful to Gov. Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly for funding a new state-of-the-art dozer and transport that will be stationed in the forestry work center here in Anderson County” Frank said in the news release.

During the recent on-site visit at the city of Clinton’s Fire Station 1 located at 100 Longmire Road State Forester David Arnold briefed the local officials about the new equipment and Division of Forestry training and firefighting response.

“The Tennessee Division of Forestry is proud to be the leader in wildland fire management in the state” Arnold said in the news release. “We strive to respond swiftly and diligently to protect life and property from wildfire work with communities to prepare in advance of catastrophe and use fire as a tool to achieve management objectives. The new state-of-the-art firefighting equipment now in Anderson County will help us meet those goals.""

Frank thanked the Division of Forestry team and noted how important proper equipment and machinery is to protecting life.

“As impressed and amazed as I am by the quality and capability of the machinery I am even more impressed by the courage of the firefighters who operate it in the service of protecting our community and protecting life” she said in the release.

The new dozer and transport will replace aging equipment that has been used for at least 16 years. In 2005 the Tennessee General Assembly established a reserve fund to replace the Division of Forestry’s aging fleet. Beginning in 2020 through 2024 the Division expects to replace 112 bulldozers throughout the state.

The new John Deere 650k is considered the most state-of-the-art Type 3 firefighting dozer in the United States with a tracking system high-efficiency HEPA filters and superior operator safety. The International HV Series Transport includes an extended cab new style suspension and is Tier 4 compliant for air pollution laws.

Wildfires are suppressed by disrupting the combustion process. These dozers allow Division of Forestry firefighters to safely remove the fuel by creating a fireline around the blaze where vegetation is removed down to mineral soil.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyb25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L2NvbGxlY3Rpb24tYnJpbmdzLXRvZ2V0aGVyLWZvcm1lci1zZW5hdG9ycy1mYW1pbHkv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVwb3J0ZXJvbmxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvY29sbGVjdGlvbi1icmluZ3MtdG9nZXRoZXItZm9ybWVyLXNlbmF0b3JzLWZhbWlseS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collection brings together former senator’s family,"BLOOMINGTON Ill. – John W. Maitland Jr. realized he was a John Deere tractor collector when he bought three antique tractors at an auction almost 40 years ago.

“There were rows and rows of antique tractors at that sale. How we decided what to buy I don’t know” said his son Johnny Maitland.

Before becoming a collector he was part of a family farm with a loyalty to John Deere tractors.

Today he has a museum on that Bloomington Illinois farm with 18 tractors and all kinds of memorabilia including shelves of toys clocks signs and even pedal toys the great-grandkids can power along on the cement floor.

On July 30 he celebrated his 85th birthday there. Even the cupcakes had chocolate tractors and he wore a plaid yellow and green shirt.

Those first three tractors John Maitland bought were a John Deere A B and D. One of his tractors is a 1941 Oliver like the first tractor he ever drove.

“Another very special tractor is a 1929 John Deere GP that he bought from Keith Lemons who was like a brother to John” said his wife of almost 65 years Joanne Maitland.

John started farming in 1959 in Bloomington the third generation of Maitland Farms that was founded in 1898. He started with a tractor and a planter that cost a total of $1000.

“$1000 was a lot at the time” Joanne said. In the 1950s at age 16 in her first job as a bank secretary and teller she made $66.30 every two weeks.

Also in the early days of farming John Maitland had a 4010 John Deere tractor. He bought another in the 1970s. Neither of his 4010s are in the museum – both are still being used as utility tractors on the farm today Johnny said.

While farming John also got interested in farm issues and was president of the McLean County Farm Bureau. That led him to being elected a state senator in 1979. He was re-elected throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Over the years he received many awards and recognition for his efforts especially from the agricultural community.

Even when he was in the senate John Maitland kept close to his roots.

“When Papa came home between meetings wearing a suit he would get in the combine for a while then go back to the next meeting” said Terri Maitland his daughter-in-law.

His plan was to retire from politics keep working in the community and tinker with antique tractors in his shop. Unfortunately he suffered a stroke in 2000 and officially retired in 2001 before he completed his final term. He had served 22 years as a senator.

The dream of tinkering in his shop was also altered by the limitations in his movement after the stroke. But it didn’t stop his fondness for John Deere tractors nor deter his determination to add to his growing collection.

Instead he created a museum and curates its contents to share with others.

An old barn which previously held many of these tractors was torn down to make room for the new museum at the home farm. The cement patio holds the retired senator’s handprint and date – 2014 – when the family established the museum. It isn’t a public museum but the Maitlands hold so many family and community events here hundreds of people have had a chance to get a close look at the tractors over the years.

The main room is home to the tractors mostly John Deere with a spattering of red representing tractors from Joanne’s side of the family and a beloved 8N Ford which John’s family had on the Danvers farm where he grew up.

“People come here and are really floored and amazed. It’s surprising how interested some people are that you think wouldn’t be interested. They ask good questions” Johnny said of the museum.

The family traveled as far as Ohio Michigan and Wisconsin to collect the tractors for the museum.

Most of these antique tractors are museum quality but at least one needs considerable work.

“I have one that’s so bad it’s in crates” Johnny said.

His neighbor Brad Barclay had started taking it apart to restore it but didn’t put it back together. Johnny said it’s a project they may complete together someday.

In addition to the main tractor showroom of the museum the senator’s lounge holds shelves of John’s toys and other memorabilia. Joanne jokes she was glad to get it out of the house into the museum. Even the lamps and other accessories reflect the theme. Neon and metal signs help tell the story of this collection.

The museum has become the social hub for the family hosting wedding and baby showers antique study groups receptions birthdays graduations and reunions.

The retired senator may not be able to make rousing political speeches these days but the museum speaks volumes for his love of agriculture history and family.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbmtlbnlhLmNvbS85NzE3L2RlZXJlLWhpdGFjaGktZXhjYXZhdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deere Hitachi to End 30-Year JV for Excavators,"A Hitachi excavator. PHOTO | FILE

John Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery are ending their 33-year joint venture to manufacture excavators for the North and South American market in a move that seeks to unlock new business opportunities for both companies.

The JV was set up in 1988 to co-produce excavators in North Carolina before it expanded to include the production of forestry swing machines and a joint marketing across America.

The dissolution which goes into effect on February 28 2022 will see Deere acquiring the joint venture plants in Kernersville N.C. Indaiatuba Brazil and Langley British Columbia.

Intellectual property

The company will also acquire the intellectual property license to continue manufacturing Deere-branded excavators indefinitely. Both acquisitions will cost $275 million.

Deere will produce self-branded excavators at the plants but will cease manufacture of Hitachi excavators. On the other hand Hitachi will produce all of its excavators wheel loaders and mining equipment in Japan and then export them to the Americas.

John Stone president of construction & forestry division and power systems said: “John Deere will build on our legacy of quality and productivity and accelerate development of industry-leading technology and machinery”.

Supply agreement

Deere will enter into a “long-term supply agreement with Hitachi to source and produce the current products at existing locations” the company’s said in a statement.

On its part Hitachi – one of the world’s top-selling excavator manufacturers – will introduce new products in America which will feature “cutting-edge technologies that increase efficiency and safety while lowering total cost of ownership.”

Advanced hydraulic and safety systems “internet of things” services and telematics are some of the key technologies that Hitachi plans to introduce into the Americas.

Hitachi Construction Machinery America CEO Alan Quinn said his company will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japan-based Hitachi Construction Machinery.

It will retain its regional headquarters in Newnan Georgia where it plans add 75 to 80 employees for positions ranging from sales marketing distribution and dealer service.

“I think we’re in a perfect place to really be one of those disruptors in innovation and really capture some of the new ways of doing business” Quinn said.

He said the market had become very competitive which makes it “a little bit more cost effective and actually more customer friendly for us to bring it directly from Japan”.

“Base USA”

Deere and Hitachi started a supply relationship in the 1960s – which resulted in the formation of Deere-Hitachi Construction Corp. in Kernersville in 1988.

A decade later the partners started a “Base USA” strategy in which similar models were produced for both brands at the U.S. factory.

The new Hitachi-branded machines will arrive in the Americas in Spring 2022.

“It feels for us like the skies have opened up” Quinn added. “And we can do everything in our power to build the Hitachi brand in North America.”

COLUMBUS Ind. — Columbus police and Bartholomew County Sheriff's deputies teamed up to end a potentially dangerous chase through city streets early Saturday.

The pursuit involved a stolen bulldozer and large armored vehicle and ended with nobody hurt and a suspect in jail.

Around 4 a.m. Columbus Police called for the help of sheriff's deputies in pursuit of a suspected stolen bulldozer that was headed southbound on Central Avenue. from 17th Street in Columbus.

Officers were able to block intersections and keep light overnight traffic away from the John Deere dozer while they worked on a plan to stop the nearly ten-ton piece of heavy machinery.

Using a public address system to ask the suspect identified as Adam Jackson to stop didn't work despite ""numerous commands"" according to a sheriff's department statement about the incident.

Numerous police cars with emergency lights activated didn't deter Jackson either. The bulldozer was hardly speeding with speeds ranging from 3 to 6 mph but police were concerned that the dozer could do heavy damage in a residential area and cause personal injury or even death to anyone and anything in its way. No standard police vehicles would be capable of stopping it either.

Eventually the law enforcement officers brought out the sheriff's large armored vehicle (MRAP) because it had the size and weight to match the dangerous capability of the dozer.

Deputies pulled up next to the dozer in the MRAP as it was still moving and gave Jackson more loud commands to stop the machine. Jackson eventually complied and stopped and was immediately taken into custody.

“The MRAP was provided to Bartholomew County at no cost from the federal government"" said Chief Deputy Chris Lane in a media release explaining how it could be deployed to protect lives and property in the most dangerous situations. ""We had this situation last night"" Lane said. ""We don’t like to use this type of tactical vehicle but we are glad we had it last night.""

Jackson told officers that he was “joyriding.”

Jackson was transported to the Bartholomew County Jail where he was remanded on the following preliminary charges: resisting law enforcement vehicle theft and criminal recklessness.

Columbus Police said a pursuit involving a bulldozer was a first for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9qb2huLWRlZXJlLWV2ZW50dWFsbHktbW92ZXMtYWJyb2FkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Machinery Focus: The foreign adventures of John Deere,"John Deere is undeniably a mighty corporation that now straddles the globe with sales worth nearly $36 billion in 2020.

Its origins can be traced way back to 1830 when the original John Deere opened a blacksmith shop in Grand Detour Illinois.

A few years later he took a broken blade from a sawmill and fashioned it into a plough mouldboard and so the company we know today was born.

Waterloo Boy

Up until 1918 the company was purely a manufacturer of implements and its entry into tractor production came with the purchase of the Waterloo Boy Gasoline Engine Company in that year although it had already experimented with its own design beforehand. The Waterloo Boy was fitted with a twin horizontal engine a format still in use right up until the late 1950s

From that date it gradually established itself as a popular tractor manufacturer that turned out ever more powerful models which in the main were built around the tried and trusted two-cylinder horizontal engine arrangement it inherited from Waterloo Boy.

This twin-cylinder format lasted up until 1960 as the company had settled down to a regular rhythm of corporate life with various deals being done the usual board disputes over management structure and so on.

Radicalism was not encouraged and the Johnny Poppers as these tractors affectionately became known continued to sell in large numbers. The Model A from the late 30s was styled by renowned art deco designer Henry Dreyfuss

This serenity was not to last however. In 1955 a young executive by the name of William Hewitt had been appointed chairman and he was all out to bring change to the company and invigorate it with a new vision.

Scotland calling

One debate that had been going on within the company was expansion abroad.

At the start of the 1950s a project to build a plant in Scotland for the manufacture of combines and mowers had reached an advanced state before circumstances closed it down.

The company had reached an agreement with the UK government in which the British would build the factory with public money and then lease it back to John Deere for the production of combine harvesters and mowers.

Unfortunately the plan fell through mainly due to a Conservative government displacing the Labour administration in 1951.

Although the project was never officially cancelled John Deere was told that the funds for construction would not be released.

Internally the idea had also met resistance from the export department which had lobbied instead for a factory in France producing a much wider range of machines including a tractor of 25-30hp.

Proposed merger with Massey Harris Ferguson

The attention of the board was then drawn away by other ventures especially the idea of fertiliser production and so the idea of foreign expansion took a back seat until Hewitt took over.

One of the first items that landed on the desk of the new chairman was an approach by James Duncan the president of the newly formed Massey Harris Ferguson company to consider a merger between the two companies. The Massey Harris Pony was one of the company’s success stories

This was a rather startling development and the reason for Duncan proposing such a an idea is not immediately clear although there may be some clue in the situation of his company at the time.

Massey Harris Ferguson (MHF) was beset with internal strife and difficulties as competing managers argued over falling sales in America while the board ran shy of the basic restructuring of the company that was needed.

Added to this mix was the upset caused in the Ferguson camp by Harry Ferguson deciding to sell up without telling anyone beforehand a shock that many had yet to come to terms with.

It is likely that Duncan saw a merger with what was still an indigenous and rather conservative home market-orientated company as a way of increasing the sale of his products in the United States.

John Deere itself took the idea seriously and invested time and effort in meetings with its rival in a bid to thrash out a plan that was acceptable to both parties.

Caterpillar decimates dealer network

Although at first sight the plan seemed to commend itself the deeper both sides delved into the details the less attractive the scheme became.

One attraction for John Deere was the extent of the MHF agency network in the west an area which had seen a large reduction in the number of Deere outlets due to a pre-war agreement with Caterpillar to share dealerships.

This is a story in itself but the upshot was that many smaller Californian JD dealers had been forced to switch to other brands while Caterpillar dealers focused on the post-war building boom rather than worry about selling a few tractors to farmers. John Deere tractors were sold alongside Caterpillar models such as the Twenty Two

Despite this being one great mutual advantage to both JD and MHF who still had an extensive representation in that state the difficulties of meshing the two companies with overlapping product lines and distinct parts supply requirements proved too much to contemplate.

With the mention of the Caterpillar affair it ought to be noted that as part of that link some John Deere tractors were sold abroad but only through Caterpillar dealers rather than the company’s own efforts.

The need for a new plan

And so the management of John Deere once again found itself without any firm plans for exporting the company’s products in any great quantity.

Yet Hewitt had not forgotten this intention and it wasn’t long before another opportunity presented itself.

In late 1953 the company had been quietly approached by a west German banker who held 30% of the Lanz stock.

Lanz had been one of the two dominant German tractor manufacturers up until the war Deutz being the other but the company was suffering from a multitude of problems.

Tucked away in an Austrian barn the Lanz Alldog was originally powered by a Triumph motorcycle engine converted to a diesel

The famous Bulldog tractor was ageing and the single cylinder format had reached its design limitations.

Sales had suffered due to the division of Germany into east and west while the factory at Mannheim had been rebuilt with little thought to future production techniques.

The price for 51% of the German company had been set at $2.5 million. An investigation by Deere’s own accountants suggested that a further $13 million would need to be invested to bring it up to scratch.

John Deere now faced a dilemma. There were two basic ways forward either build a fresh factory as had been proposed for Scotland or buy an established manufacturer and use it as a base to expand upon.

In the end they avoided making that decision and the proposal was voted down in December of the same year as was another to expand into South America.

John Deere succeeds at second attempt

Despite this setback the germ of the idea had been planted and it surfaced again in 1956 when a second much more potent group of executives including William Hewitt visited Germany to take another look.

In the intervening years Lanz had spent a good deal of money on new machine tools although the tractors remained the same.

This certainly increased the value of the company and despite many imponderables a deal was struck for a majority shareholding for $5.3 million. The John Deere 830 was a later iteration of the first Dubuque models

Having purchased the company the first task was to drop the Bulldog product line completely and set the factory up to manufacture the American-designed Dubuque line of diesel models.

And so John Deere established itself as an international manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment.

It was not an easy transition; there existed a huge culture clash between the American idea of enterprise and the the European idea of cooperation and even tractor use.

Yet the company stayed the course and Mannheim went on to become the hub of operations and manufacture for Europe and beyond."
DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1hbmQtZGVsdGEtYXJlLXVzaW5nLWRhdGEtdG8tbWFrZS10cnVseS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWRlY2lzaW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines and Delta are using data to make truly controversial decisions,"Data-driven decision-making? Screenshot by ZDNet

Data analysis is the joy of our time.

Well our working time.

It seems that businesses are spending as much money on bulking up their data capabilities as they are on well anything else.

I worry that this constant number-munching turns us all into permanently neurotic beings. Still sometimes the numbers seem to help senior executives make decisions that they know won't be universally popular.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has often been regarded as the quintessential data-driven human. So when he announced that his airline's employees would all have to be vaccinated by Oct. 25 -- or they'd be fired -- it was instructive how he presented his case.

Speaking to MSNBC he began: "" We knew there'd be some negative reaction and there has been. But my email inbox particularly from employees has been running about 10 to 1 of people just thanking us for doing it.""

There's that instant quantification. Ninety% seem to be in favor. He'd only just got started.

""I didn't appreciate how many people there are in our workforce -- and in the country -- who really know... they're looking at the data"" he said. ""They see all the same facts that all of us see. They know it's the right thing to do.""

Only then did he suggest that the airline ""would have done it anyway.""

Yet he leaned on the data first in order to make his case before adding: ""For us it's a safety issue.""

Baited into declaring whether his decision was a way to increase passenger numbers Kirby again went back to data: ""Over 99% of the people who are in hospital or that are dying from COVID-19 are unvaccinated.""

This helped him extrapolate to the idea that ""[you're] about 300 times as likely to die of COVID-19 if you're unvaccinated. Once you have that statistic in your mind at least to me it's impossible not to require vaccinations.""

Then you might think that all other airlines would look at that data and reach the same conclusion. Yet American Airlines Southwest and Delta didn't.

The innately cynical might drift to wondering whether the fact that two of these airlines are based in Texas and the other in Georgia may have had something to do with that.

Then again Delta did reach for a perhaps even more controversial measure with respect to COVID-19 -- and again leaned on data.

Last week the airline announced that it'll increase the health insurance premiums for their unvaccinated employees by $200 a month.

CNBC reported the words of Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a memo sent to employees. Instead of declaring this measure as the right thing to do from a home humanistic moral standpoint Bastian offered cold data: ""The average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost Delta $50 000 per person.""

He followed with: ""This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision not to vaccinate is creating for our company. In recent weeks since the rise of the B.1.617.2 variant all Delta employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated.""

Some may wonder whether these CEOs merely searched for the appropriate data to serve their already-made decisions. One can imagine recalcitrants snorting that it's their body their choice and tangentially their expression of not caring what may happen to their fellow humans.

In Delta's case there are surely troubling implications. Would the same sorts of penalties ever be levied on those with say a genetic history of cancer or diabetes? What if it could be proved that some ailment resulted from someone's personal choices -- smoking or drinking for example?

Some will see these decisions as purely political. Because in some twisted infernal manner saving lives seems to have become a symbol of which political faction you embrace.

We live in an extraordinary time one where our business life is more and more infused with data. Yet too many will deny the veracity of data in the rest of our lives because it doesn't suit their political worldview.

I'll confess that United's decision encouraged me to prefer United should the occasion arise.

But it's the airline's expression of its attitude rather than its data presentation that persuades me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1wcm9wZWwtcHJvZ3JhbS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta's Propel Program For Future Pilots Grows With Two More Universities,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1wcm9wZWwtcHJvZ3JhbS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy1wZXJzb25hbGx5LXB1cmNoYXNlLXNwZWNpYWwtaXRlbXMtZm9yLWFmZ2hhbi1jaGlsZHJlbi1vbi1ldmFjdWF0aW9uLXBsYW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Flight Attendants Personally Purchase Special Items for Afghan Children on Evacuation Plane,"One Delta Airlines crew recently stepped up in a special way to help a group of children fleeing Afghanistan.

Flight attendants on an emergency flight out of Germany personally purchased various items ""on their own initiative"" the night before the trip pilot Alexander Kahn said Friday in an interview with John Berman on CNN's New Day.

""Spending their own money they purchased diapers and wipes and candy and balloons and coloring books and other things they knew the evacuees were going to need"" he told Berman.

Kahn said the pilots offered to reimburse them for their generous gesture but the flight attendants ""refused to take any"" compensation from their crewmates.

""We knew these evacuees were coming with no opportunity to prepare and to take things that you and I would prepare for an international flight"" he told Berman.

The veteran pilot lauded the flight attendants' ""incredibly professional"" attitude and ""exemplary service"" during the flight.

More than 100000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan after the Taliban took over the country according to The Associated Press. The United States' efforts to complete evacuations before their Aug. 31 deadline have been marred by violence at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

The night before the flight Kahn said the Delta crew got familiar with each other after positioning themselves at the United States' Ramstein Air Base. It was then that the pilot knew ""how special this operation was going to be.""

Kahn is the son of a Holocaust survivor who immigrated to the United States after being liberated from the Buchenwald concentration camp. He said his father entered the country much like many of the evacuees currently coming to the U.S. — with just ""the clothes on his back no family [and] no English skills.""

""[My father] came to the United States not much different than the people that are coming to the United States now"" from Afghanistan Kahn explained adding that it helped him see the deeper meaning of the mission.

""I was able to put myself in their position and realize that they're starting a new life"" he added. ""This is going to be a frightening experience for them. But it has the potential to be an excellent experience for them.""

Kahn is proud of his team's efforts in transporting the evacuees to the U.S. from Germany. ""The American people have always come together and helped when it was time to help and the military community overseas has always come together when it was time to help"" he said.

""This is what military families are all about"" he added ""and this is what the American people are all about.""

View the current offers here.

As discussed in previous articles I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member. Most of my flights this year have been on Delta or its SkyTeam partners and various promotions like the 2020 Medallion Qualifying Mile (MQM) rollover Status Accelerator and bonus MQM earning on Delta cobranded credit cards helped me earn Platinum by the beginning of July.

Now with just over four months left in 2021 I am planning to go for top-tier Diamond status. In theory I am close to the status now and can reach the MQM and MQD requirements so long as I plan my future travel accordingly. I think the extra effort is worth it for Choice Benefits and higher upgrade priority — something that may be useful after Delta's most recent round of status extensions.

Here I'll show you my current progress toward Delta Diamond and discuss how I plan to close the MQM and MQD gap. I'll also discuss why I think it's worth going out of my way to earn Diamond even when Platinum is a great airline elite status to hold.

Why I'm earning Delta Diamond status

I've long been a fan of Delta Air Lines — its NYC route network is great it has a solid on-time performance and its in-flight product is good. Moving up to Delta's top-tier status would give me more benefits on my frequent flights with Delta including the ability to select Choice Benefits.

Delta Diamond members get to select three Choice Benefits every year they requalify for benefits. When I qualify I plan to select these benefits:

Delta Sky Club Credit Card Guest Access: Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card.

Lets those who have Delta Sky Club access from a credit card bring up to two guests into the lounge with them. I will combine this with my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card. 4 Global Upgrade Certificates: These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights.

These can be used to upgrade to Delta One on any Delta route. These can also be used to upgrade select partner flights. 25000 SkyMiles: This is worth $275 per TPG's most recent valuation but I can likely get more value when redeeming for expensive last-minute flights.

Effective 2/1/25 Reserve Card Members will receive 10 Visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of Visits each year starting on 2/1/25 the total eligible purchases on the Card must equal $75000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24 and each calendar year thereafter.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Depending on how (and how often) I use these benefits they have the potential to be worth thousands of dollars. I plan to use the Global Upgrade Certificates on long-haul 2022 travel to Europe and Asia on routes with Delta One Suites business class. Further the Sky Club guest access will be great for when I travel with friends and family.

Additionally higher upgrade priority will come in handy next year. Delta extended elite status for all existing elites through 2022 and will roll over all 2021 MQM to 2022. This means there will be a ton of Delta elites and upgrades will be more competitive than in past years. Having top priority for upgrades will be extremely useful.

Closing the gap for Delta Diamond status

I'll leverage partner flights to quickly earn MQD. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

As of writing this article I am sitting on a stash of 99576 Medallion Qualifying Miles and $4950 Medallion Qualifying Dollars. This puts me roughly 25500 MQM and $10000 MQD away from earning Delta Diamond. I have plans to meet this threshold without breaking the bank on two upcoming international trips and a handful of domestic trips.

Let's take a closer look at my plans.

Upcoming Delta domestic trips

As of writing this article I have a four trips planned with Delta. Here's a quick breakdown of each trip and how many MQM and MQD I'll earn for each trip. Note that I am factoring in the Status Accelerator promotion for each ticket.

LGA-ORD-LGA economy — 2200 MQM $232 MQD

JFK-SLC-JFK economy — 5968 MQM $420 MQD

LGA-MIA-LGA economy — 3274 MQM $206 MQD

LGA-ORD first class — 1283 MQM $367 MQD

This means that I will earn 12725 MQM and $1225 MQD from already booked travel. This brings me to 112301 MQM and $6175 MQD meaning I still need to account for 12699 MQM and $8825 MQD by the end of the year. There's a chance some of this will be taken care of with work travel and other domestic trips but I've made a plan to make up at least 90% of both requirements.

Leveraging partner trips for more MQD

So that I don't need to spend $5000+ on Delta first class tickets (with the 75% bonus) I've devised a plan to earn MQM and MQD quickly with partner flights. SkyTeam and non-alliance partner flights earn MQM and MQD based on a percentage of miles flown which means that you can stock up on MQD at a discount if you find inexpensive partner flights in premium cabins.

I started exploring different partner options and found a way to earn the bulk of the miles by booking a trip to Europe. It would be a non-traditional routing however as the flights take me through Los Angeles and Mexico. I'd start by booking this Delta round-trip ticket between New York-JFK and Los Angeles (LAX) it would earn 7426 MQM and $360 MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

From there I'd continue on to Madrid (MAD) via Mexico City (MEX) with Aeromexico for $1827.15 round-trip in business class. This fare earns 150% MQM and 40% MQD and the trip is 14390 miles round-trip. This earns 21585 MQM and $5756 MQD. Together with the LAX round-trip and my existing year-end balance I'll have a total of 133886 MQM and $12291 MQD.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

Then I would take my usual year-end trip from New York-JFK to Prague (PRG) on this Air France premium economy ticket. It costs $994 but earns 150% MQM and 30% MQD. The itinerary is 8332 miles round-trip so it earns $12498 MQM and $2500 MQD. This brings my MQD count to $14791.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

I can make up for the remaining $209 MQD by booking my flight home to Chicago for the holidays with Delta. I would earn $320 MQD by booking this round-trip ticket from New York to Chicago and would have myself well over the qualification threshold.

(Screenshot courtesy of google.com/flights)

This means I would spend a total of $3363 for roughly $8936 MQD which would give me Diamond status through 2022. I need to take the trips to Prague and Chicago anyway and the trip to Madrid would let me visit a new city and visit friends in Los Angeles along the way. Plus I can book some of it with flight credits and cover some expenses by redeeming Capital One points at a fixed value toward these flights.

Bottom line

Qualifying for Delta Diamond Medallion elite status isn't easy but you can get there quicker and less expensively when you leverage partner flights. Consider doing something similar to close the gap on your Delta elite status this year. Also remember that you can earn up to 75% bonus MQM and MQD with the Status Accelerator promotion and that award tickets earn MQM and MQD through 2022.

Alexander Kahn spoke to CNN on Friday about the “special” experience in which he and a crew he had never met before ferried the refugees fleeing the Taliban from a US Air Base in Germany.

“I was able to put myself in their position and realize they’re starting a new life” Kahn said. “It’s a frightening experience for them but it has the potential to be an excellent experience for them.”

The flight was especially emotional for Kahn when he considered how his dad also made a new life in America after he was liberated from the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany by US troops during World War II.

“[He came to America] not much differently than the people that are coming to the United States now” Kahn told CNN about his dad. “He was coming with the clothes on his back no family no English schools and had to start life over again.

“And luckily he was able to start over again in the land of opportunity.”

And with no near neighbours you'll be able to make as much noise as you like.

But while this eco haven may be rustic it's certainly not rough and ready.

The house itself is of timber construction which was reputedly made in a London workshop then sold by Harrods.

And while the surroundings are wild and expansive the interior is cosy and charming.

Outside there's the opportunity to flex your green fingers in the productive vegetable patch.

The current owners have even erected a rabbit-proof fence around the entire plot so there's no need to worry about Peter Rabbit stealing your cabbages. That just leaves the slugs then.

As you might expect this unique property really is off the beaten track: the only access is via an unmade road so a 4x4 might be handy.

Unless of course you're willing to go the extra eco-mile by cycling.

Scientists last month set foot on a tiny island off the coast of Greenland which they say is the world's northernmost point of land and was revealed by shifting pack ice.

The discovery comes as a battle is looming among Arctic nations the United States Russia Canada Denmark and Norway for control of the North Pole some 700 km (435 miles) to the north and of the surrounding seabed fishing rights and shipping routes exposed by melting ice due to climate change.

""It was not our intention to discover a new island"" polar explorer and head of the Arctic Station research facility in Greenland Morten Rasch told Reuters. ""We just went there to collect samples.""

The scientists initially thought they had arrived at Oodaaq an island discovered by a Danish survey team in 1978. Only later when checking the exact location they realized they had visited another island 780 metres northwest.

""Everybody was happy that we found what we thought was Oodaaq island"" said Swiss entrepreneur Christiane Leister creator of the Leister Foundation that financed the expedition.

""It's a bit like explorers in the past who thought they'd landed in a certain place but actually found a totally different place.""

The small island measuring roughly 30 metres across and a peak of about three metres consists of seabed mud as well as moraine - soil and rock left behind by moving glaciers. The team said they would recommend it is named ""Qeqertaq Avannarleq"" which means ""the northernmost island"" in Greenlandic.

Several US expeditions in the area have in recent decades searched for the world's northernmost island. In 2007 Arctic veteran Dennis Schmitt discovered a similar island close by.

Though it was exposed by shifting pack ice the scientists said the island's appearance now was not a direct consequence of global warming which has been shrinking Greenland's ice sheet.

Rene Forsberg professor and head of geodynamics at Denmark's National Space Institute said the area north of Greenland has some of the thicket polar sea ice though he added it was now 2-3 metres thick in summer compared with 4 metres when he first visited as part of the expedition that discovered Oodaaq in 1978.

Any hope of extending territorial claims in the Arctic depends on whether it is in fact an island or a bank that may disappear again. An island need to remain above sea level at high tide.

""It meets the criteria of an island"" said Forsberg. ""This is currently the world's northernmost land.""

But Forsberg an advisor to the Danish government said it was unlikely to change Denmark's territorial claim north of Greenland.

""These small island come and go"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(WIS) - A new type of dollar store is calling Columbia home in an area where there was previously very little convenient access to fresh produce. The Dollar Sto’ held its Grand Re-opening event Saturday to celebrate being approved for SNAP benefits – something that was previously lacking in the area.

“There’s no grocery stores within a five-mile radius” said one local resident.

Brian Thomas is a Columbia native from the Booker Washington Heights neighborhood who’s seen grocery stores close through the years.

“On Beltline for example there was a Bi-Lo there way back in the day there was Piggly Wiggly. The Save-A-Lot that was by Drew Wellness Center that’s gone” said Thomas. “The Bi-Lo that was over there by North Main that’s gone.”

The neighborhood is considered a food desert an area where there are no convenient grocery options.

“A lot of times people don’t want to come into the community because they have this stigma” said Shiryl Davis owner of Rawkin’ Kitchen.

“So now they can come just a little bit closer” said Thomas. “I know there’s not a whole lot of local stores in the area no more so to prevent a customer from having to go far down to Gervais Street or having to go on Two Notch Road they can come right here and get all those things.”

The Dollar Sto’ provides fresh fruits and vegetables household supplies canned foods beverages and snacks.

“This community has no means of getting some cabbage or collard greens or some strawberries – what have you – anything that’s fresh” said Thomas.

The idea came about when a tutoring business in the building next to Thomas was having trouble finding somewhere to send kids to buy after-school snacks. Before students had to walk far across a busy street. Thomas then started planning his store in the very building that his dad built back in 1989.

“It’s just something perfect for the community” said Mariah Jeffcoat Co-Owner of The Lemonade Twins. “It’s a safer environment for the kids.”

In an underserved area access to food is harder for those that don’t drive.

“A lot of people in this area they don’t have transportation and the bus lines is limited so they needed something closer in the heart of the city” said Jeffcoat.

Thomas is making sure community is at the heart of his store too.

“I have a notebook over there that from day one that for example one customer needed some butterfingers and I didn’t have them until recently so I went back in my notebook and remembered ‘Oh I need to get those Butterfingers’” said Thomas.

His stock is constantly changing to fill the needs of his customers. During the event Saturday Thomas hosted locally owned vendors to support and highlight entrepreneurship.

“It’s giving our other cultures a chance to see that everybody can make a change and be whatever they want to be no matter how long it takes” said Cierra Jenkins owner of Dae’s Delicious Dogs.

Thomas says he will continue to host vendors each week to spotlight local businesses and provide another convenient and affordable food option for the Columbia neighborhood.

The Dollar Sto’ is located at 3017 Farrow Road in Columbia.

(Walsh) Cain of Providence Passes at 91,"Helen M. (Walsh) Cain of Providence Passes at 91

Helen M. Cain of Capitol Ridge Providence passed away on Wednesday August 25 at Hope Health Hospice Center in Providence. She was the ""precious"" wife (as he called her) of the late James H. Cain (Ret. PPD).

Born in Providence she was a daughter of the late John F. and Margaret (Dooley) Walsh.

Helen was a ""people person""...she loved meeting with friends and family conversing about past memories as well as current events. She was always interested in what others were going through always there to give comfort and a listening ear. In fact because of her warmth towards others she was on the welcome committee at Capitol Ridge greeting new residents and giving them ""the scoop"" of the goings-on there. She took part in all the activities offered at Capitol Ridge with humor and enthusiasm! She had a heart for those with memory issues and volunteered in the memory unit there as well.

Helen loved to shop! Her favorite store? The Dollar Tree. She always bought plenty of ""goodies"" to put in her candy dish for her many visitors and the staff at Capitol Ridge. Not one could leave her apartment without a snack or beverage from her endless supply she always kept well-stocked. She was jokingly referred to as the ""Duracell Battery"" as she could outlast anyone who was with her on her shopping excursions!

Helen loved children! No matter where she was she would stop to say ""hi"" and ask them their name etc. Children brought a beautiful smile to her face so her visits with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren were very special to her. She'd send them off with goodies maybe a buck or two back-to-school clothes etc...

Helen is survived by her sisters Madeline and Bernadette as well as her brother Gerald. She was also sister to the late John James and Joseph Walsh and her sister Virginia. She also leaves four sons: James Cain and his wife Mary of New Canaan Ct. (the late) John Cain of Providence William Cain of N.Providence Robert Cain and his wife Belinda of Providence two daughters: Deb Provencher and her husband Leo of Pawtucket Margaret “Peggy” Proulx and her husband Michael of Johnston as well as her many grandchildren great-grandchildren nieces and nephews.

Visiting hours will be held on Wednesday September 1 at 8:30 am from the Russell J. Boyle & Son Funeral Home 331 Smith Street Providence.

Mass of Christian Burial at 11:00 am in St. Patrick Church 244 Smith Street Providence.

Burial will follow in Saint Ann Cemetery Cranston.

In lieu of flowers donations to Hope Health Hospice Center in Helen's memory 1085 North Main Street Providence R.I. 02905 would be so appreciated.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The North Carolina-based Bojangles chain of restaurants announced Friday it will close all of its company-owned establishments on two upcoming days portraying it as a chance to provide its thousands of employees a “well-deserved break” amid very challenging times.

But Bojangles’ employees will not get paid for those days off.

In a statement the chicken and biscuit chain described its 8000 crew members and managers as its “most vital asset.” It encouraged them to use the upcoming closures on Aug. 30 and Sept. 13 for an opportunity to “rest and recharge.”

The restaurant company’s written statement made no mention of whether its workers would be compensated during these closures framing it as a “benefit” to its valued employees that would support their health and well-being.

The Associated Press asked company spokesperson Stacey McCray to clarify whether staffers would be paid. In an email McCray responded: “The two days will be unpaid.”

Responding to subsequent questions she said many staff have been working overtime lately and the company thinks they would benefit from having a couple of days off. She said Bojangles would offer employees opportunities to work additional hours if they chose.

Bojangles said the upcoming closures were “in response to industry wide labor shortages and other stresses put on its employees who’ve worked hard through the pandemic.”

It was not immediately clear what Bojangles employees thought of the unpaid days off. Employees reached by phone at various restaurants referred calls to the corporate office.

Bojangles was founded in Charlotte in 1977 and has restaurants in more than a dozen states including in North Carolina South Carolina Georgia Tennessee and Virginia.

Kiewit Offshore Services Ltd. the largest U.S. offshore fabricator will develop the substation for the state’s first offshore wind farm at the firm's 555-acre oil and gas fabrication facility in Ingleside Texas with work set to start in November it said.

Developers also said Sept. 2 that federal environmental permit review has begun of the adjacent Sunrise project a proposed 924-MW wind farm marking ""another sign of the tremendous momentum"" for U.S. offshore wind. The review by the US Interior Dept. also launches a public comment on the project through Oct. 4

“The production of clean energy is at a pivotal stage in the U.S.” said Paul Geldmeier Kiewit Energy executive vice president and president of Kiewit Offshore Services who is leading its offshore wind work. Substations are critical components of utility-scale offshore wind farms collecting power produced by turbines and connecting it to the onshore grid. The structure for South Fork will consist of a topside resting on a monopile foundation.

More than 350 workers will support the Kiewit project at the site as well as in Houston and Kansas and “hundreds of union workers in the Northeast” said Kiewit. Joe Nolan Eversource Energy CEO and president said the project “signals the growth of the next great maritime industry throughout the country.”

The firms declined to disclose the value of the Kiewit contract.

Ørsted and Eversource said they are set to start construction of South Fork located 35 miles east of Montauk N.Y. in 2022 with a federal permit expected early in the year. The U.S. Dept. of Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the project’s final environmental impact statement on Aug. 16. State regulators approved the project's transmission cable to East Hampton N.Y. earlier this year.

Kiewit plans to complete substation construction by spring 2023. It will travel via the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean for installation in summer.

The contractor opened the Ingleside yard near Corpus Christi in 2001 to tap into anticipated increased energy drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in deepwater worldwide with a $100-million capital investment according to its website. The firm says the yard “specializes in the fabrication and integration of large complex offshore projects” and has “the largest onshore lifting device in the Western Hemisphere with a rated capacity of 11000 tons.”

Kiewit is currently working on construction of the 60000-ton Argos semi-submersible offshore oil platform for energy giant BP which will be installed in the Gulf about 190 miles south of New Orleans in 4500 ft of water. Related to offshore wind Kiewit's team “specializes in applying the lessons from the international offshore market to reduce risk and bring American innovation to American power” the website says.

Pushing Forward

The firms announced the offshore wind award during a major sector conference the International Offshore Wind Partnering Forum held Aug. 24-26 in Richmond Va. At the event Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced that the state which aims to be the Mid-Atlantic offshore wind project hub had reached a deal with Dominion Energy to lease a 72-acre area at the Port of Virginia's Portsmouth Marine Terminal to stage wind turbine foundation assembly for its proposed 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.

Liz Burdock CEO of the Business Network for Offshore Wind told 1000 attendees from an estimated 600 global companies that “in the U.S. we only have eight years” to reach the Biden administration's goal of 30 GW of offshore wind deployed noting that Europe took 30 years to reach that power output.

Burdock called on federal and state government officials to offer more incentives to expand the offshore wind supply chain and workforce recruitment and to aid in managing project risk. She said BOEM “should reduce its regulatory timeline.”

Interior Dept. Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told attendees in a video address that assessments of the first round of wind projects raised problems not apparent a decade ago according to sector publication Workboat.

More Developments

Meanwhile in a move that could ease some constraints in offshore wind farm development U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a ruling Aug. 23 that allows use of both foreign and U.S. certified vessels for the first time for a wind energy project. Under the federal Jones Act foreign vessels cannot be used for U.S. offshore energy sector transportation between ports.

While the ruling would apply narrowly to the 12-MW New England Aqua Ventus floating wind demonstration project being developed in Maine it still represents the first Jones Act decision related to the offshore wind sector says Charlie Papavizas a partner in law firm Winston & Strawn which represents Aqua Ventus.

But the U.S. industry's largest approved commercial scale offshore wind project to date the 800-MW Vineyard Wind facility off Massachusetts that now is in construction still is the target of opponent lawsuits. Two recently filed in federal district court in Boston against Interior Dept. officials seek to reverse the project permit.

In one suit Nantucket Island residents and others dispute conclusions of project owners and government reviewers that Vineyard Wind won't harm a nearby endangered whale species. In the other a solar power developer claims that federal reviews failed to examine safety or engineering issues in the project's use of GE-made 12-MW Haliade-X wind turbines including their ability to survive a Category 3 or greater Atlantic hurricane and risks of “catastrophic release of oil and contaminants” from turbine generators in severe coastal weather.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoc3YuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvdHJhY2tpbmctcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlcy_SAUZodHRwczovL3d3dy53aHN2LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L3RyYWNraW5nLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tracking power outages,"HARRISONBURG Va.

Mbappe has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid and they are said to have made a second bid of £145million for the French striker who has just one year left on his contract.

And according to former club president Ramon Calderon the transfer could be imminent.

“If you want him now you have to pay that amount – that’s clear” Calderon told the talkSPORT Breakfast.

“If PSG have made a counter-offer that means they’re negotiating and in those cases in my experience the signing is imminent.

“At the moment the two clubs sit down to negotiate in front of a table then things are quite clear.

And if Mbappe is to move to the LaLiga side PSG are said to be targeting Toffees forward Richarlison.

The Brazillian who could team up with his international teammate Neymar in the Parisian outfit’s front three has scored 34 goals in 107 Premier League games for the club.

4 Richarlison spent just one season at Watford in 2017-18

He joined the Merseyside outfit for around £35m from Watford in 2018 with the fee potentially rising to £50m.

He has constantly terrorised Premier League defences with his aggressive running and quick feet since his move from Brazil in 2017.

The Guardian is reporting that Richarlison’s agent is ready to get his client a move to the French giants if they decide to accept Madrid’s offer for Mbappe.

This could see the forward swapping the likes of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Michael Keane for Sergio Ramos and six-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi if he joins Mauricio Pochettino’s side.

The Guardian add that Everton could target Brighton striker Neal Maupay as a potential replacement for Richarlison.

Transfer expert Nicolo Schira claims Everton want around £85million for the forward.

With just a few days left of the transfer window Mbappe’s move to Real Madrid could spark a series of transfers across Europe including Richarlison and Maupay's moves.",,,,,,,,,

The US servicemembers were on a mission of mercy to evacuate at-risk Afghans after the disastrous US withdrawal led to a Taliban takeover. These are their stories:

Sgt. Nicole Gee 23

Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee was was a maintenance technician with 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Roseville California.

A week before she was killed Gee cradled a baby in her arms at the Kabul airport. She posted the photo on Instagram and wrote 'I love my job.'

Sgt. Mallory Harrison who lived with Gee for three years and called her a 'sister forever' and best friend wrote about the magnitude of her loss.

'I can't quite describe the feeling I get when I force myself to come back to reality & think about how I´m never going to see her again' Harrison wrote on Facebook. 'How her last breath was taken doing what she loved - helping people. ... Then there was an explosion. And just like that she's gone.'

Gee's Instagram page shows another photo of her in fatigues holding a rifle next to a line of people walking into the belly of a large transport plane. She wrote: 'escorting evacuees onto the bird.'

The social media account that includes many selfies after working out at the gym lists her location as California North Carolina and 'somewhere overseas.'

Photos show her on a camel in Saudi Arabia in a bikini on a Greek isle and holding a beer in Spain. One from this month in Kuwait shows her beaming with her meritorious promotion to sergeant.

Harrison said her generation of Marines hears war stories from veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts but they seem distant amid boring deployments until 'the peaceful float you were on turns into ... your friends never coming home.'

Gee´s car was still parked in a lot at Camp Lejeune and Harrison mused about all the Marines who walked past it while she was overseas.

'Some of them knew her. Some of them didn´t.' she said. 'They all walked past it. The war stories the losses the flag-draped coffins the KIA bracelets & the heartbreak. It´s not so distant anymore.'

Friends mourned Gee (right) whom they called a 'model Marine' and a 'Marine's Marine'

'She cared about people. She loved fiercely. She was a light in this dark world. She was my person' said friend and fellow Marine Mallory Harrison in a Facebook post on Gee (center right)

'She cared about people. She loved fiercely. She was a light in this dark world. She was my person' said Harrison in a Facebook post.

'I find peace knowing that she left this world doing what she loved. She was a Marine's Marine' she said.

'She was doing God's work…..a warrior. Searching Afghan women and children trying to get out of country' Captain Karen Holliday said in a Facebook tribute.

Holliday called Gee a 'Model Marine. A leader on the ground in a chaotic situation.'

She said that a photo released of Gee a few days before her death showing her escorting Afghans onto a waiting plane had been bombarded with sexist online comments 'degrading her for being a female Marine.'

'I prayed every day' she said.

He is one of four children; he is not married and has no children.

The mom last spoke with him the Tuesday before the attack.

'I just told him to be careful that I was worried about him and I couldn't wait for him to come back' Holguin said. 'He told me he was fine and not to worry…. He was brave. If he was scared he didn't show it.'

She said she holds no animosity toward the president saying her son 'wanted to be there.'

Marine Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum was killed in the attack

Marine Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum was named by his high school in Wyoming as a casualty in the attack.

He was expecting to become a father and was pictured with his pregnant wife shortly before deploying to Afghanistan in April.

Cheyenne McCollum Rylee's sister told DailyMail.com her brother had wanted to be a Marine since he was a toddler – and that his own baby is due in just three weeks.

'Rylee was an amazing man with a passion for the Marines. He was a son a brother a husband and a father with a baby due in just 3 weeks' she said.

'He wanted to be a marine his whole life and carried around his rifle in his diapers and cowboy boots.

'He was determined to be in infantry and this was his first deployment. Rylee was sent to Afghanistan when the evac began. Rylee was manning the check point when he suicide bomb went off.

'Rylee wanted to be a history teacher and a wrestling coach when he finished serving his country. He's a tough kind loving kid who made an impact on everyone he met. His joke and wit brought so much joy.

'To his friends and teammates and coaches he was family. Rylee will always be a hero not just for the ultimate sacrifice he made for our country but for the way he impacted every life around him for the better. Making us stronger kinder teaching us to love deeper. We love you Rylee.'

Rylee McCollum graduated from Summit Innovations School in Jackson in 2019.

Wyoming Schools Superintendent Jillian Balow said in a statement: 'Saying that I am grateful for Rylee's service to our country does not begin to encapsulate the grief and sadness I feel today as a mother and as an American.'

'My heart and prayers are with Rylee's family friends and the entire Jackson community' she added.

The Wyoming-born Marine's wrestling coach and close family friend Benjamin Arlotta said 'heads should roll' over the disastrous US exit and that the young soldier's family is 'absolutely broken'.

Arlotta told DailyMail.com that even in diapers McCollum would stand watch on his porch with a toy rifle first said he wanted to be a Marine aged eight and signed up on his 18th birthday.

In a glowing eulogy to the young expectant father whose new baby is due in three weeks Arlotta described McCollum as a 'personal hero' and a 'fantastic brother fantastic uncle and a wonderful friend'.

'I was his wrestling coach since he was six. He was one of the best. A great kid a great young man and an American patriot. He loved being a Marine' Arlotta said.

'He was just a good man all around. We're all hurting pretty bad.

'It's impossible. I'm sitting here with the family right now – with his dad and two sisters his brother-in-law and niece. They're shattered they're absolutely broken. The entire community is.'

Arlotta 37 said he is furious at the Biden administration and blames the White House for putting soldiers in an unnecessarily dangerous position.

'It's a junk show an absolute junk show. Not just for Rylee but for every serviceman and woman over there. They were put in a very terrible spot. In my opinion this entire circumstance has been mismanaged from every level' he told DailyMail.com.

'The only thing I can hope for is that accountability isn't forgotten. Because for the 13 men who were killed yesterday heads need to roll for the way things have gone.

Benjamin Arlotta and his wife Talia are long-time family friends of the McCollums. Benjamin said he is angry and devastated

'We're just seeing the beginning of it. It's not over it's only going to get worse. Everybody in the country needs to be praying for our servicemen and women right now. They have a scrap out in front of them.

'Sadly those 13 Marines aren't going to be the last ones to perish because of these terrible decisions that were made.'

Recalling fond memories of the young Jackson Hole native the wrestling coach told a heartwarming story of McCollum's determination.

'When he was 13 he came into the competition season 32lbs heavier than where he wanted to be' Arlotta said.

'He told me he would lose it. We made a bet. I was going to quit chewing tobacco if he could get down there. That was September by the time the state championship rolled around in January he had made weight.

'He entered the wrestling tournament at that weight and I quit chewing that day.

'He was first and foremost a man of his word. If he said he would do something by goodness gracious he stood right in front of you until he did it.'

McCollum moved to California for training. His pregnant wife Jiennah 'Gigi' Crayton lives in the San Diego area.

The 20-year-old lance corporal wanted to be a soldier since childhood first telling his parents he would join the Marines age eight.

'We were driving back from his first state wrestling tournament I was riding with his family' said Arlotta. 'We asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up he said he wanted to be in the Marines.

'He enlisted on his 18th birthday' the coach added. 'When he actually enlisted his recruiter told him he could be anything he could do any job. He swore up and down he wanted to be an infantryman.

'If you know Rylee you know you can't talk him out of a damn thing so that's what he did.'

U.S. Congresswoman Liz Cheney a fellow Wyoming resident issued a statement when she learned of Rylee's passing.

'I want to offer my deepest condolences to Rylee McCollum's family and loved ones. His bravery and patriotism will never be forgotten. His willingness to put himself in harm's way to keep our country safe and defend our freedom represents a level of selflessness and heroism that embodies the best of America.

'We know that the McCollum family is grieving this tragic loss. I ask that people in Wyoming and across the country please keep those close to Rylee in their prayers and remember that we are only free because of the courage and valor of service members like him.'

Marine Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui was a native of Norco California.

Nikoui's father Steve a carpenter vented his frustrations at Biden in an interview with the Daily Beast.

'They sent my son over there as a paper pusher and then had the Taliban outside providing security. I blame my own military leaders… Biden turned his back on him. That's it' he said

Steve Nikoui said he knew his son was dead when he saw two Marines approaching his home on the day of the attack at 7.15pm PST.

He said he sat with the two emotional Marines who cried more than he cried and then had them leave.

Steve also appeared on Fox with Tucker Carlson the day after his son's death to further criticize Biden in an emotional interview where he said the attack could have been avoided.

'From what I saw of the airport that they're in looked like a Turkey shoot. It's funneled in to a single file-type entry point at which if you have in sort of chaos of any sort they would all like gather to that one funneled area which they would all be accessed. That's what happened. It was just basically so chaotic and not really planned out' Steve said.

As he teared up he also said he was upset by how long it took to learn of his son's death.

'How long does it take for the military to you know inform the next of kin?'

Marine Kareem Nikoui pictured with his mother was killed. His father said he blames Biden for abandoning them in Kabul

'I was actually trying to console them. But at the same time I just wanted them to get out as soon as possible so that no one from my family came back and saw them.

'I thought it appropriate that I be able to tell them' he said.

He added that his son who was based at Camp Pendleton in California would often bring other Marines home on the holidays if they couldn't get back to their own families.

'My wife and I felt very honored that [since] these other boys weren't around their homes that we were able to provide some sort of family life for them.

'He really loved that [Marine Corps] family. He was devoted—he was going to make a career out of this and he wanted to go. No hesitation for him to be called to duty' he said.

Speaking outside Kareem's home a relative told DailyMail.com that Kareem's family were inside signing the documents required to repatriate him.

He added: 'They're totally devastated and they need some time. All the family are here and we're supporting them.'

A steady stream of people have been seen coming and going from the home all day among them some of Kareem's colleagues from the Camp Pendleton Marine base in San Diego.

The AiP chip product of Calterah is adopted by HASCO for the door open waring (DOW) feature of some premium car models to be mass produced next year.

Alps AiP Chip Auto and industrial applications

The compact size high performance and low power consumption were what made Calterah AiP stand out said the R&D head of HASCO ADAS BU adding time and costs for antenna design were saved and thus the DOW project could be accelerated. According to Hasco the DOW feature is not exclusive to premium cars and the next few years will see a greater presence of DOW in economy ones. As a result the cost size and ease of use of the radar enabling such a feature are among the first to be considered.

As a leader in CMOS mmWave radar sensor chip development and design Calterah in 2019 rolled out its second generation auto-grade CMOS 77-Ghz mmWave radar sensor AiP chip products.

The advantage of the AiP technology is making it a reality that the size of radar modules shrinks to one tenth of that of the traditional ones or even smaller while maintaining relatively high performance. Customers no longer need to design or develop antennas or use high frequency PCBs in manufacturing thus making easier the module production and reducing the R&D cycle time and costs.

Regarding reliability and safety which is essential to ICs Calterah's auto-grade AiP products meet the requirements of AEC-Q100 qualification and is compliant with ISO 26262 Functional Safety management process while undergoing a complete set of proprietary testing procedures.

Featuring an architecture of 4T4R (four-channel receiver and four-channel transmitter) Calterah's AiP products come from the Alps and Rhine families working at 77/79 GHz and 60 GHz for the auto and industrial markets respectively.

Auto Applications

As an essential sensor for vehicles mmWave radar can be applied to various advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) features including autonomous emergency braking (AEB) forward collision warning (FCW) lane change assistance (LCA) blind spot detection (BSD) automatic parking system (APS) etc. Inside the cabin mmWave radar can measure the driver's vital signs by detecting the micro motion caused by breathing and heartbeats and determine whether there are humans or any pets. In addition mmWave radar is more privacy-friendly than cameras. On top of these benefits AiP-based sensors as mentioned are more compact and cost-efficient making it easier to install them at the dome light or elsewhere.

Industrial Applications

The advent of AiP products also means more possible applications in the fields like smart home elder care etc.

Take air conditioning (AC) as an example. Calterah has developed a smart AC solution with the following features:

Accurate positioning  which enables tracking of the precise positions of people in a room so as to better control the direction of air flow. The feature differentiates the motion of people from the micro motion of objects like electric fans and plants so as to avoid false triggers of AC functioning.

TMZ has learned.

Tony was taken to the E.R. Thursday. His wife Lauren tells TMZ Tony did not have COVID. In fact she says he was tested 5 times in the hospital and all results were negative.

There is however a COVID connection ... Tony was in the E.R. for 24 hours because there were no beds -- a sign of the times with the Delta variant. Lauren says he's on the mend and his doctors think he could be released within a week. She adds ""On behalf of Tony and myself we thank you for your concern for him.""

76-year-old Dow is best known for playing Beaver's older brother Wally Cleaver for the show's entire run from '57 to '63 ... having acted in all 234 episodes. Word is ... Tony landed the role with almost no acting experience even though his mom worked in the biz.

He often played the straight man to the other quirky characters ... like his TV pals Eddie Haskell or Lumpy or even his kid brother himself the Beave -- who was always creating problems somehow.

TD reprised his role as Wally in other 'Beaver' spinoffs and revivals in later years ... always keeping that all-American boy charm about him when playing the character.

He's also starred in shows like ""The Greatest Show on Earth' 'Never Too Young' -- on which he had a significant role as Chet -- 'Lassie' 'Mr. Novak' 'Charles in Charge' and other hit series over the years.

His guest roles are also notable ... having appeared for one-off performances in 'Knight Rider' ""Quincy ME' 'Murder She Wrote' 'The Love Boat' 'Mod Squad' 'Emergency!' 'My Three Sons' and more.

He's got quite the directing career too ... his credits include episodes of 'Babylon 5' 'Harry and the Hendersons (the show) 'Swamp Thing' 'Coach' 'Star Trek' 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' among others. TD's also had a hand in producing a couple TV movies and has even dabbled in visual effects work too -- including for shows like 'Doctor Who.'

The guy's a noted sculptor as well -- some of his work has been featured in the Louvre. Word is ... he's focused on the latter a lot these days at his Topanga Canyon home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJtcGJzLm9yZy9ibG9ncy9yb2NreS1tb3VudGFpbi1wYnMvbG9uZS10cmVlLXJlc2lkZW50cy1ib29rLWhlYWRlZC1mb3Itc3BhY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lone Tree resident's book headed for space,"LONE TREE Colo. — Dow Phumiruk Lone Tree resident and member of the Lone Tree Arts Commission has illustrated 15 children’s books including “Counting on Katherine: How Katherine Johnson Saved Apollo 13.”

This book was recently chosen for Storytime From Space — a project of the Global Space Education Foundation that sends children’s books to the International Space Station.

Astronaut Megan McArthur will read the book from space and a recording will be made available on the Storytime From Space website.

The book details the story of Katherine Johnson an African American mathematician who worked for NASA during the space race. Her backup procedures and charts helped save the Apollo 13 crew after their mission to the moon was aborted.

“It was the space race at that time so they’re like 'Whoever wants to help us beat everyone else to the moon come sign up.’ And back then because we didn’t have any real computers like machine computers they hired people to do the calculations” said Phumiruk.

“And men actually thought that that was too boring and too tedious so they gave it to the women to do. And there were probably about 200 Black women that worked for NASA at the time which is amazing because we’ve never heard about any of them until recently.”

The original book was published in 2018. A second edition was published in the UK the following year for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.

Among other awards the book won The Cook Prize from the Center for Children’s Literature and the UK LA Literary Association Inaugural Information Book Award. Phumiruk also stated that around 100000 copies have been sold in the U.S. and UK.

Phumiruk wasn’t always a professional illustrator. She explained that she enjoyed art as a child but becoming a stay-at-home mom to her daughters from 2002 to 2006 was what led her to pursue art again.

“Being home with the kids I really had an opportunity to really explore my artistic side and I realized that that’s such a big part of me. There’s no way I could ever leave that part behind. In fact it’s taken over” said Phumiruk.

Phumiruk started learning on her own and researching techniques. In 2011 She joined the Society for Children’s Book Writers.

“That’s where I really took off with my art because I went to the conferences and got to know some other artists in the neighborhood and had a critique group going and I got an agent maybe four years after joining that organization” said Phumiruk.

Phumiruk previously worked as a pediatrician taught part time at Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine and worked on illustrations. She quickly realized that this was too overwhelming.

Phumiruk said “I came to a crisis of I can’t do it all. I can’t raise the children be a doctor teach medical school and all that and I ended up choosing to just teach and do the art.”

She expected to return to pediatrics but then was picked up by her agent and started working on paying projects.

Phumiruk’s newest book “Hello Tree” was written by Ana Crespo who is also from Colorado. It follows a little girl who finds friendship in a tree during the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs that took place in 2013. “Hello Tree” will be released on Sept. 14.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOC90ZWNoL2VsaXphYmV0aC1ob2xtZXMtdGhlcmFub3MtdHJpYWwtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wOC8yOC90ZWNoL2VsaXphYmV0aC1ob2xtZXMtdGhlcmFub3MtdHJpYWwtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth Holmes likely to accuse ex-boyfriend and former Theranos executive of psychological and sexual abuse court documents reveal,"CNN —

Elizabeth Holmes the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos whose criminal trial is set to begin in a matter of days is likely to defend herself by claiming she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend also a former Theranos executive court documents reveal.

According to the newly unsealed documents Holmes plans to have an expert testify about the psychological emotional and sexual abuse she experienced from Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani who served as the company’s COO including the abusive tactics he allegedly used to “exert control” as well as the psychological impact. Balwani according to a court filing “adamantly denies” the claims.

Holmes is also “likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed relied on and deferred to Mr. Balwani” according to a filing from Holmes’ attorney.

In a separate filing from Balwani’s attorneys they acknowledge Holmes’ plans to introduce evidence that Balwani verbally disparaged her controlled what she ate how she dressed and who she interacted with “essentially dominating her and erasing her capacity to make decisions.” The filing calls the allegations “deeply offensive to Mr. Balwani” and “devastating personally to him.”

These tensions ultimately led to the separating of the highly anticipated trials of Holmes and Balwani. Both were indicted more than three years ago on multiple federal fraud and conspiracy charges over allegations they knowingly misrepresented the capabilities of Theranos’ blood testing technology.

Attorneys for both Holmes and Balwani did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.

The two are accused of engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors from 2010 to 2015 and of defrauding doctors and patients who paid for the company’s blood testing services from 2013 to 2016. They each face two counts of conspiring to commit wire fraud and 10 counts of federal wire fraud.

Holmes and Balwani have pleaded not guilty and could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250000 plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and conspiracy.

Holmes’ attorney noted in court papers that “a joint trial presents the serious risk that Ms. Holmes would revert to a pattern of compliance with Mr. Balwani” saying that Balwani’s “presence and/or actions would trigger in Ms. Holmes significant psychological consequences” that could impact her during the trial.

Meanwhile Balwani’s attorneys argued that the only way their client could have a fair trial would be to grant his motion to sever allowing for two separate jury trials.

The court documents were ordered to be unsealed by Judge Edward Davila on Thursday after Dow Jones publisher of The Wall Street Journal moved to have the filings made public. Holmes’ attorney John Cline expressed preference to keep the documents sealed until after the jury had been selected and sworn in ensuring that the jurors would “never be exposed” to the information prior to trial. Kelly Volkar assistant US attorney argued that unsealing in advance would allow the prosecution to sift out any potential prejudice in jurors. Formal jury selection for Holmes’ trial is set to begin in San Jose next week following multiple delays due to the pandemic as well as the birth of her first child.

Holmes’ defense team had previously notified the government of its intent to use expert testimony from a clinical psychologist Dr. Mindy Mechanic whose work focuses on the psychosocial consequences of violence trauma and victimization.

Federal prosecutors were granted the ability to have Holmes examined by two experts — a psychologist and a psychiatrist — over two consecutive days for no more than 14 hours combined.

Holmes a Stanford University dropout founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion Theranos had a retail partnership with Walgreens and touted a high profile list of board members and investors.

Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company’s proprietary blood testing machine Edison as well as Theranos’ testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled “massive fraud” charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.

Balwani a former software executive joined Theranos in 2009 becoming Holmes’ second-in-command. Nearly 20 years Holmes’ senior the pair had met in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University’s Mandarin program.

Balwani’s case is slated to begin in 2022 after the completion of Holmes’ trial."

Horton nation's largest volume homebuilder now in business in Omaha area,"There’s a national builder in town and local real estate experts say the additional home supply and competition should mean good news for Omaha-area house seekers.

D.R. Horton — the country’s largest volume homebuilder according to Builder Magazine — has started construction on more than 50 new for-sale homes in four suburban communities and expects to grow locally.

Having a national homebuilder establish a presence in the Omaha area is affirmation of the hot local housing market those in the industry say. Founded in 1978 in Fort Worth Texas D.R. Horton is a publicly traded company that operates in 30 states and this year expects to sell more than 80000 houses nationwide.

“It tells us our market is maturing and we have enough demand to capture the attention of these entities” longtime local appraiser Gregg Mitchell said. “In a sense you can probably say we’ve grown up.”

Aaron Moulton vice president of D.R. Horton's Omaha operations said the company was attracted by the area’s growing population and economy its employment base and Offutt Air Force Base.

The company started off building dwellings in existing subdivisions in Bellevue Papillion Bennington and Gretna and also plans to expand and develop its own neighborhoods.

Moulton said in a statement that the company expects to offer mostly single-family homes ranging from 1500 to 2600 square feet and starting in the low $300000s.

Vince Leisey of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Ambassador Real Estate said at the recent Commercial Real Estate Summit that he sees D.R. Horton replacing some volume historically supplied by HearthStone Homes before that builder went bankrupt in 2012.

For years HearthStone battled with Omaha's Celebrity Homes to produce the top amount of newly constructed homes in entry-level price ranges.

Leisey said it seems a contradiction to describe ""entry-level"" and ""first-time homebuyer"" options as in the $300000 range but he said material and labor costs don't allow companies to build a new house for less than that these days.

Because volume builders deal in bulk they can often leverage greater discounts for materials and labor. They save time and money by building out entire blocks or neighborhoods at a time and can pass along some of those efficiencies in consumer pricing.

Moulton said D.R. Horton in many communities limits homebuyer selections of interior features or preselects them to increase efficiency and maintain affordability.

The Home Company has also tried to fill some of the gap in the local lower-end new construction market. It just unveiled a new series of home styles that will feature ""modest"" lot sizes and floor plans in the Sumtur Crossing neighborhood of Papillion and Belle Lago in Bellevue.

Dave Vogtman of the Home Company said the starting price for those homes is about $325000.

Andy Alloway of Nebraska Realty said he is eager to see more local housing supply. Although inventory has improved somewhat lately the Omaha area’s ongoing and unprecedented dearth of homes for buyers to choose from has led to bidding wars that have driven up prices.

So far this year the median price of an existing home sold in the Omaha area is $240000 up more than 14% over the same period last year. For new construction the median sales price is up about 8% to almost $364000 according to the Great Plains regional multiple listing service.

Said D.R. Horton's Moulton: “We are excited to bring quality new homes at an affordable price point to this undersupplied market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMS8wOC8yOS9jZW50cmFsLW9oaW8tbHV4dXJ5LWhvbWUtc2FsZXMtanVseS0yNi0zMC81NjE0ODQ4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Central Ohio luxury home sales July 26-30,"The Columbus Dispatch

Each can has 2.5 mg of THC enough to mimic the effects of a glass of wine.

During a recent party in the manicured backyard of the Copper House a neighborhood event space in Detroit’s Bagley neighborhood near the Avenue of Fashion brightly colored cans of a new drink are served alongside charcuterie and fruit. Outside a retro-style trailer dubbed the “Happi Camper” is parked on the street emblazoned with the brand’s smiling cartoon faces.

The event is a launch party for Happi a new cannabis-infused sparkling water that is the first of its kind sold in Michigan. The cans are expected to be available for delivery in the Detroit area via the Lantern delivery service in September and to be available for purchase at local dispensaries soon after.

The brand is eager to cater to a demographic they say is too often ignored: canna-curious women who are looking for a low-calorie alternative to alcohol. The cans come in three flavors: lemon elderflower which has 15 calories per can; raspberry honeysuckle which comes in at 20 calories; and pomegranate hibiscus which has 25 calories. Each can contains 2.5 mg of THC the psychoactive component of cannabis that gets your high. It’s a level that the creators say was meant to mimic the effects of a glass of wine — but with no hangovers the next morning.

Happi co-founder Joe Reynolds tells Metro Times that “the original lightbulb moment” came several years ago when his wife had some friends over and the discussion turned to the upcoming cannabis legalization efforts in Michigan and Illinois. “The conversation turned to ‘Well what if we could drink it?’” Reynolds says. “So I started researching and I really just fell in love with the idea of having a healthy alcohol alternative.”

Reynolds says he spent about six months testing different flavors. “I think there was like around 220 different iterations of it” he says. “When we started it did not taste very good. It was quite a journey to get to what you’re tasting.” Reynolds says the beverages were made using a “nano-emulsification” technology that breaks the hybrid indica-sativa strains down into smaller molecules that are dispersed equally throughout the liquid.

About a year ago Reynolds partnered with Lisa Hurwitz who became Happi’s president. Hurwitz had been working as the chief marketing officer for an Illinois-based cannabis company following a career in marketing and packaged goods. “I had a background in cannabis for the past few years and had been really really passionate about microdosing and about the female target feeling that it's very underserved” Hurwitz says. “Right now in the cannabis category it's a lot of high-THC flower. And for the ‘canna-curious’ of which many are women there weren't a lot of products on the market that felt accessible. So when Joe shared his vision for Happi I just felt like this was a perfect fit.”

Hurwitz says she learned that two of the top reasons people came into cannabis dispensaries were for help calming anxiety and sleep. “The interesting thing about alcohol is it messes with your sleep” she says. “And this doesn’t — so you could have a Happi in the evening to wind down and it won’t have that kind of effect of waking you up in the middle of the night if you’re very sensitive to alcohol. You get a very light buzz but it also kind of can take the edge off much like alcohol.”

Michigan nailed down regulations for THC-infused beverages in January and we can likely expect more of them in dispensaries soon. According to Headset a company that tracks cannabis sales data THC-infused beverage sales are up 40.3% from last year.

Infusing cannabis with a beverage means you’ll feel the effects more quickly than you would with infused edibles — in about 12 minutes as opposed to 30 minutes to an hour for edibles.

“Everybody’s different” Reynolds says. “Tolerance varies even more than alcohol but for your average consumer it should be roughly equivalent to a glass of wine.”

Beyond getting you high Happi uses all-natural ingredients including organic fruit. The products are 100% vegan and gluten-free. The flavors are so bold that you cannot taste the THC unlike many edibles.

“I think with [edibles] is you can often get a bitterness because the way the formulas work is they try to mask the cannabis taste with something bitter and then you end up with a really bitter-tasting gummy. It's been a long time on the formulation and kind of getting it just right.”

Happi has partnered with Buchanan-based Redbud Roots to produce the drinks. Before founding Happi Reynolds worked as CEO of a Chicago-based company called Red Frog Events that was involved with food and beverage as well as music festivals and other events.

Reynolds says he believes someday soon you’ll be able to buy and consume Happi at Michigan concerts and music festivals.

The company plans to partner with Lume the cannabis company that inked a deal with 313 Presents to be the first official cannabis brand for DTE Energy Music Theatre. The plan will see a Lume-branded lounge that will eventually sell cannabis on-premises. Reynolds says they hope to be able to sell Happi at DTE Energy Music Theatre by 2022 or 2023.

Hurwitz says the brand “is meant to be happy and upbeat and positive and incredibly inclusive” she says. The company has partnered with the Black & Brown Cannabis Guild a social justice advocacy group. All proceeds from Happi’s merch which includes yellow branded hoodies and T-shirts benefit the group.

“With the war on drugs the Black and brown communities have obviously been disproportionately affected” Hurwitz says. “And so just giving back to the community around cannabis is important.”

The cans are sold in four-packs for about $20. Hurwitz says she’s excited to learn about how their customers drink Happi. “Is it more for a social occasion? Is it more to sort of wind down?” she says. She’s also hopeful that it will help erase stigma against cannabis. “Drinking it makes it really comfortable” she says. “It’s a good first experience with cannabis and easy. We’re used to drinking. It’s how we typically socialize. We’ve witnessed a lot of people try cannabis for the first time that aren't even processing that it’s cannabis and not alcohol because it feels so natural. So for those people out there who are interested in cannabis and trying it for the first time I think this is probably the single best way to give it a try.”

Some street lights in Winston-Salem and beyond are defective,"Street lights in Winston-Salem have some people seeing purple.

And that’s literally true because some lights that Duke Energy has been installing are defective and over time begin to cast a purple glow over their illuminated space.

Duke Energy Corp. is working to repair or replace its LED street lights that have turned purple a company spokesman said Saturday.

While the vast majority of Duke Energy’s LED lighting performs well in communities across the state the spokesman said the company has identified some that have turned from the standard white color to a deep purple color.

Jimmy Flythe the director of local government community relations for Duke Energy said that the problem with the lights did not become immediately apparent because they only change color over time.

And because workers who change the lights might draw from different batches as they go about their jobs there’s no record of where the lights have been placed that turned out to be defective he said.

The problem with the lights is called delamination Flythe said. Flythe didn’t know the technical details but the bottom line is that the lights are giving off purple light.

Winston-Salem isn’t the only place where the lights have cropped up. Not by any means.

An internet search shows reports of purple lights in places as diverse as Wisconsin Florida and Iowa.

The change in color is due to a manufacturer defect that was identified earlier this year and is being addressed Duke Energy said.

Other than being purple the street lights continue to work the company said.

Flythe said the easiest way for people to report a purple light is to go to the company’s web site at www.duke-energy.com and click on the offending light.

To do that click on the customer service link at the top of the page then click again on the link to request a light repair. Eventually a map pops up that one can use to pinpoint the exact light needing a fix.

“We have got some and as people are reporting them we will change them out” Flythe said.

Still on social media some people are appealing for folks to not report the lights.

“I love the ones on Reynolda. Let’s all NOT report them” said one member of a Facebook group that solicits comments on all things Winston-Salem from its members.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGlzYnVyeXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvc2VwdGVtYmVyLWlzc3VlLW9mLXNhbGlzYnVyeS10aGUtbWFnYXppbmUtaXMtbm93LWF2YWlsYWJsZS00L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,September issue of Salisbury the Magazine is now available - Salisbury Post,"September issue of Salisbury the Magazine is now available Published 12:00 am Sunday August 29 2021

Frank Diaz Candidate for DuPont City Council Position 1

Frank Diaz has a reputation for initiating and completing projects. His proven track record of accomplishments makes him the ideal candidate for City Council. As a veteran entrepreneur and small business owner who has held countless leadership roles there has never been a task too big to complete nor a goal too grand to accomplish.

As a child growing up in a military family later as a serviceman Frank found himself living in various countries throughout the world including Iran Turkey South Africa Panama and Europe engraining in him a deep respect for diversity. Upon settling at Fort Lewis in 1977 it was that experience of finally having a place to call home that Frank gained an appreciation for life in Pierce County.

Serving on the DuPont Parks and Recreation Agency Frank has established himself as a “can do” guy; a champion in making DuPont a wonderful place to live work and play. He believes that to have true long-lasting impactful change it needs to be systemic. He will work tirelessly to gradually implement the institutional reforms needed to fix problems when efforts to change one aspect of a system fail. Frank believes that this must be a community-driven process.

Frank’s Priorities include economic development and improving the quality of life for DuPont’s citizens.

Candidate Frank Diaz and family

“The pandemic has been hard on our central business district and as a small business owner I have experienced firsthand the challenges of keeping my doors open and providing a livelihood for my employees” Diaz says adding “Now that we are working our way out of this crisis we need to identify ways to rebuild our local economy.”

“For one” Diaz shares “I will advocate for the creation of the DuPont Business Association (DPBA). It will be formed to engage all the businesses to help support and promote their respective business interests. Once formed the DPBA can attempt to collaborate with other stakeholders such as Parks and Rec DuPont Historical Museum etc. to sponsor monthly events such as Arts In The Park where people can sell arts and crafts food vendors can sell products live entertainment can be featured and local retailer can have a sidewalk sale. This monthly event will attract shoppers diners and families to our central business district helping to stimulate retail sales.”

“I am also committed to creating a more livable community in the City of DuPont especially for the most vulnerable residents who use our streets including children people with disabilities older adults and people who can’t afford or don’t have a car” Diaz says adding “I propose that we add more painted crosswalks bicycle lanes and pedestrian signals near many of our busier streets. Priority will be given to areas near parks schools and businesses.”

Before DuPont’s very own Frank Diaz threw his hat in the race for DuPont City Council he retired from his military/DOD career to launch a veteran owned – military and community serving small business featured in this INC Magazine article; a tour across the country highlighting the imagination diversity and resilience of American enterprise.

Diaz said that he would also like to develop a strategic partnership with organizations such as the YMCA Boys and Girls Club Parks & Rec along with others who can help deliver needed programs and services for the underserved residents of DuPont including childcare after school activities and the development of a community center.

Sarah Moore lost the rear of her car and spun into the tyre wall before Abbie Eaton followed. Ayla Agren and Beitske Visser were next to crash with the contact of Visser's car launching Eaten into the air.

As the most trusted manufacturer of thermal cameras their handheld devices sell for around £500 and up. There are cheaper options available as an add on to Apple or Android phones which sell for around £300.

This can be out of many ghost hunters price range perhaps leading them to consider some unbranded and cheaper alternatives the type available on eBay but are these £135 thermal imagers any good or do you get what you pay for?





A thermal imager is a special type of camera which is able to see and build a visual representation of the heat emitted by objects in it field of view. They are commonly used by ghost hunters as a way of seeing objects that are warmer and colder than their environment which might not be visible to the human eye or in the dark.





Of course this concept is slightly questionable fundamentally because if an object is invisible to the human eye then light would pass through it. This makes it unlikely that the object would be able to emit heat which radiates from objects in the form of infrared radiation that can be found on the electromagnetic spectrum alongside visible light.





However where thermal imaging cameras might be useful on a ghost hunt is where poltergeist activity is reported. You may be able to use the camera to see if an object that has been thrown or broken has been flash heated or cooled either through supernatural means or by some natural process or due to contact with a warm human.





But can a cheap thermal camera function as this sort of investigative tool on a ghost hunt? To put the cheaper models to the test I bought one. According to the eBay listing I was getting a 'thermal imaging camera LCD thermometer'.





The first thing to note is that this £135 camera only saves still images to its SD memory card it's not possible to capture video at all. So if you're hoping to get thermal video evidence during an investigation this camera is not for you.





The next thing I noticed was the terrible image quality. Admittedly the listing does say ""it is an ideal choice for electricians and maintenance technicians and can be used to quickly find the problem area.""





It might be fine for these purposes but on a ghost hunt this cheap thermal imager isn't fit for purpose. Take a look at the images below both were captured using the thermal imager. As you can see the visible light photo on the left is pretty poor quality. In fact the quality is so poor that I can't work out where I took this photo or who is in it. The thermal image on the right is equally unclear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L2N1b21vc2V4dWFscy1oYXZlLXBsZW50eS1vZi1sZWZ0b3Zlci1hbmRyZXctY3VvbW8tbWVyY2gtdG8tY2hvb3NlLWZyb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cuomosexuals have plenty of leftover Andrew Cuomo merch to choose from,"You won’t find Andrew Cuomo at the governor’s mansion in Albany but Cuomosexuals can still get their fix of the disgraced pol on ebay.

There are currently 333 items up for sale ranging from a signed “New York Tough” poster and a delusional Cuomo for President 2020 button ($3) to an “I have a crush on Cuomo” coffee mug being hawked for $12.99.

That merch sold like hot cakes during headier days when swooning celebs like comedian Chelsea Handler professed their love for anything Andrew.

Handler first revealed she had her eye on the self-professed COVID commander in her HBO Max special “Evolution” which debuted in October 2020 amid the pandemic.

“I offered myself up to Andrew Cuomo” she gushed to “Sway” host Kara Swisher. “In the pandemic I was very turned on by his morning news conferences as many of us were.”

In July the comedian 46 revealed she was over randy Andy after multiple women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.

Ebay merchants are now looking to profit on Cuomo’s plummet hawking T-shirts that read “Killin grannies… smackin fannies” for $22.50 and creepy decals of the “Peeping Governor” for $6.49.

4 “Cuomo for President” buttons have aged badly. Ebay

Sellers with a sense of humor are charging $400 for a Cuomo-signed copy of his laughable memoir “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic” and $80 for a pandemic press conference bobblehead ($80) that recalls the days of the governor’s cloying coronavirus updates that won him an Emmy — since revoked.

“Brand new” trumpets one seller is the front page of the Aug. 24 New York Post that depicts Cuomo hugging his pooch Captain and reads “Dog Gone … Hound Finally Leaves Gov’s Mansion.” That piece of history will set buyers back $8.95.

For those who may love Lucy but not Andy $99 will get you a 2012 signed declaration and pen of the governor renaming a span in Endicott NY the Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Memorial Bridge. The legendary comedian who died in 1989 was born in nearby Jamestown.

The last sports card show I attended until recently happened in Augusta Maine around 30 years ago. I don’t remember the exact year. I do remember that former Red Sox pitcher Bob Stanley was friendly enough as he sat in a folding chair and signed autographs for a buck or two.

I remember this more vividly: The most coveted cards were those featuring slugging Red Sox prospect Phil Plantier who would go on to play fewer than 200 games for the franchise before becoming Padres outfielder Phil Plantier. His cards I can report will not be helping pay for my kids’ college education or even a cup of coffee at Dunkin’ for that matter.

So I’d been away from the scene for a while when I bought a $5 ticket — passing on the $30 VIP option which got one in the building earlier — and popped in on the Causeway Card Show July 10 at the Big Night Live venue at TD Garden. That a glitzy new concert venue that touts its “red crystal chandeliers” and “beautiful wood-finished walls” on its website was hosting this two-day show should have been a clue that this was not going to be like the card shows of my relative youth. Thirty years ago the Augusta Civic Center did not have a single chandelier. Bob Stanley probably can back me up on that.

As an occasionally lapsed lifelong collector (almost all purchases the last 15 or so years have come via eBay) I was curious even eager to check out a show again. The hobby became massively popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021 eBay reported that sports card sales in 2020 increased on the site by 142 percent over 2019 with more than 4 million cards sold.

The market was driven in part by the wholly relatable tug of nostalgia and the quest to feel joy about something during months of isolation.

“People were home cleaning out their attics or messing around on eBay out of boredom” said Scott Edwards who was working at a table for Empire sports cards at the Causeway show “or maybe they just were thinking about a better time.”

The other reason for the boom? The chance to make a buck … or perhaps a few thousand bucks by finding a rare card with an autograph rare color pattern or other variation — of a superstar or coveted rookie in a pack. If you’re the luckiest of the lucky you might just open a package of cards that can change your life.

An intrusion of irrationality

In February a 2018-19 Panini National Treasures Basketball rookie card of Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic — the only one of its kind — sold for $4.6 million or more money than some of his teammates make in salary. The card which includes Doncic’s autograph and an NBA logo patch had been unearthed in a live “break” — the opening of packs on video or at a show in the hopes of discovering a valuable scarcity — by Layton Sports Cards in Florida.

It did not remain the most expensive basketball card of all time for long. In April a 2003 LeBron James Exquisite Collection patch card sold for $5.2 million. Classic cards long desired in the hobby also sold for prices in the millions: A 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle went for $5.2 million in January and an extremely rare tobacco card of early 20th century great Honus Wagner brought $3.75 million in May.

General merchandise stores such as Target couldn’t keep cards on the shelves with customers racing to buy $20 boxes and either open them in search of a rare hit or resell the unopened bounty on eBay for a large profit. Eventually Target couldn’t put them on the shelves at all after customers began fighting over them. In May Target made cards available only online.

“There’s always an irrationality in collecting” said Jeff Katz a collector author and former mayor of Cooperstown N.Y. home of the Baseball Hall of Fame. “But the irrationality in the last year and a half is a money chase not a card chase. People lining up at 4 a.m. at Target are not card collectors. They’re idiots.”

For investors high-end card collecting became an enticing way to try to make a lot of money fast much like non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies.

“The biggest thing even beyond people getting nostalgic during the pandemic was rich people and foreign investors” said Bill Simmons whose The Ringer podcast network now features one focused on sports-card investing and who himself opens — or “rips” per the parlance — packs with his son on Instagram.

“That was what changed. You had rich people being like ‘I want every card of every baseball Hall of Famer from the ’50s’ and they’re buying that whatever their quest was.

https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNgxpsPDyTZ/

“And then the other thing that was happening was that these groups were getting together and investing in stuff almost like a card hedge fund. ‘Let’s go get a ’52 Mantle there’s an auction coming up’ and boom they’d go get it. They were treating it almost like the way you’d buy art.”

Anyone who has seen the Mantle card a colorful portrait of the young Yankee in the first Topps set recognizes that it is art. But what fun is art if it can’t be admired?

Protecting cards in plastic casing as grading companies such as PSA and Beckett do after a card is sent to them to determine its condition and thus value makes sense. (PSA received such an overwhelming number of cards to grade during the pandemic that it had to halt submissions and only recently began accepting cards again; per Sports Collectors Daily the backlog exceeded 1 million cards in May 2020.) The $5.2 million Mantle for example had a desirable grade of PSA 9.

But some of the high-end group investors never even see the card they have purchased; it stays in safe keeping somewhere until the time comes to sell.

Television personality Keith Olbermann a lifelong collector of legendary renown is bewildered by that approach.

“That allows you for a significant expense to pretend that you own a very valuable card” he said. “But you don’t. And if it’s sold you will get that percentage of the profit and you will not be able to pretend you own any of the card. I’m not sure what the appeal is.”

At the Causeway show an upstart service called Starstock touted a system in which you send the company your cards and for a nominal seller’s fee (5 percent less than eBay’s 6-10 percent) they will help you buy sell and trade them like stocks. It sounded efficient and soullessly unappealing to me but Starstock employee Blaise Eshghi who was enthusiastically working the table at the Causeway show said customers appreciate the instantaneous aspect of it.

“It’s like day trading” he said noting they’ve surpassed a million submissions. “People love that.”

Some still do it for love

There have been previous explosions in sports card popularity particularly in the late ’80s and early ’90s when Ken Griffey Jr.’s 1989 Upper Deck rookie card was so coveted that it became and remains iconic within the hobby. Most of the other cards from that period — and those who invested in them — did not fare so well. It’s now known as the “junk wax” era the cards having been so overproduced that their value became next to nil.

“There are probably some sad stories about people that opened up sports card shops in the ’90s” said Mark Armour president of the Society of American Baseball Research’s board of directors and founder of its baseball card committee. “There seemed to be a couple of stores in every town. And then the market collapsed.”

There are still collectors who purchase cards because they jibe with their love of the sport. Fred C. Harris author with Brendan Boyd of the warm and hilarious 1973 classic “The Great American Baseball Card Flipping Trading and Bubble Gum Book” attended a show in Chantilly Va. the same weekend of the Causeway show. He didn’t find much there to add to his collection but he does elsewhere.

“I love Dennis Eckersley. I watch the Sox games and I love his commentary” said Harris. “So I went on eBay and for maybe 25 dollars I got 50 different Eck cards in different uniforms in different years just for the fun of it. They don’t mean anything to the people that are selling them.”

Ryan Fagan a baseball writer for The Sporting News resides in the nostalgic corner of collecting. Nearly every day on his Twitter feed he posts a photo of a recently opened pack of baseball cards usually from the junk-wax era and makes one engaging request of his followers: “Tell me your favorite story about one of these players or these cards.”

It’s a wonderful prism through which to view baseball and card-collecting a reminder of why a fan might have fallen for the hobby in unison with the sport itself in the first place. But even an unabashed nostalgist like Fagan recognizes the tough-to-resist appeal of hitting a jackpot.

(btw this was a 41-card jumbo pack. i obviously didn’t include every card) pic.twitter.com/mfFffbeMXT — Ryan Fagan (@ryanfagan) August 18 2021

“You’ll pay $10 a pack for some of the scarcer current products because there might be a chance that you can get a $300 card” he said. “And you can turn around the same card ungraded for $300 immediately if you want to get into like the exponential prices where you’re talking thousands and thousands of dollars for a card you’re going to have to get the card graded.”

While a company like PSA might put dollar signs in a collector’s eyes by giving a coveted card a perfect 10 grade its system is not perfect. The cards are graded by people and the influx of submissions during the pandemic required companies to hire more employees. Aligned objectivity among the graders simply is not possible. A 10 to one grader’s eye might be a 9 to another’s. The difference on a rare card can mean thousands of dollars.

A modern reckoning

Watch Chad Finn ‘rip’ a brand-new box of sports cards

11:34Chad Finn walks us through a box of sports cards purchased at the Causeway Card Show in July. (Video by Chad Finn/Globe Staff)

With my last card show experience being 30 or so years ago and all I’ll admit that I had some trepidation about whether the Causeway card-show-in-a-nightclub approach would be enjoyable or the kind of do-not-mix-these-things disaster last seen on the Island of Dr. Moreau.

Advertisement:

I can report with an exhale that the show which included an appearance by the Celtics’ Tacko Fall to rip packs was a good time something dealer Ed Pacheco seconded.

“They do a really good job with this” he said of event producers Chris Costa and Timmy Tens. “This is going to become a show New England collectors can’t miss.”

Celtics fan favorite Tacko Fall “ripped” packs at the Causeway Card Show with Chris Costa one of the organizers.BRANDI BISHOP

Attendees seemed to enjoy the bar and the photo booth sponsored by Maker’s Mark. I’ll admit to taking a little bit of time to get used to the live DJ mostly because I never in my life thought I’d hear “I Want Your Sex” by George Michael blasting while I asked a card dealer about his Bobby Orr selection.

The last time I was at a show the faces in the crowd tended to look like … well mine including Bob Stanley’s: white male probably wearing a baseball cap vowing to start that exercise regimen next week. The Causeway Card Show was a pleasant surprise of diversity including quite a few women.

One of the few kids I saw was working a table with his mom and dad. He handled the transaction when I bought a $37 box of 2020-21 Panini Contenders Basketball to rip as part of this project. I found myself hoping his childhood experience in the hobby was as satisfying as my own more than 40 years ago. I couldn’t envision how it could be.

Advertisement:

The show was not an assault on the senses but it was on the sensibilities. On one table a Tom Brady rookie card was priced at $35000. (A bargain compared with the scarcer autographed 2000 Playoff Contenders Championship Rookie Ticket edition Brady rookie that sold for $3.107 million in the Lelands Mid-Spring Classic Auction in June.)

On another table a 2011 Mike Trout Cognac Diamond Anniversary card carried a $7000 price tag. (I did not ask but I imagine the cognac refers to the color and not the cardboard’s flavor.) On another table: a 2017 Panini Donruss Optic Patrick Mahomes bronze rookie for $12500.

It soon dawned on me that most of the dealers had the same idea: Sell rare cards of popular current players for as high a price as possible. There was a desperation to some of it with the market having recently taken a slight but alarming downturn.

I resisted buying a lonesome signed N’Keal Harry for $8 added a sharp recent Bobby Orr Canada Cup card ($1) and a second-year card of Cam Neely in that ugly ’80s Canucks sweater ($3) to the previously bought basketball box and headed on my way. It was fun but not fulfilling.

In the days after the contrast of the Causeway show to the ones Olbermann told me from the hobby’s nascent days in the early ’70s kept coming to mind making me wish I could hijack Doc Brown’s DeLorean and go back to that moment in the hobby when it was about the cards and collecting and not the cash. Especially a show from 1973 in the basement of a union hall at Astor Place in Manhattan the second show in the hobby’s history per Olbermann’s recollection.

“There were something like 125 tables in the union hall” recalled Olbermann “and it was so packed with people coming in jaws agape that this stuff was available. People had seen it before when they were kids but they hadn’t seen it since they were kids and they were like ‘There are baseball cards from 1910 and I can buy one?’

“It was people discovering that the cherished memories from their childhood that they either had forgotten or had believed were destroyed — ‘my mom threw them out’ as the cliche goes and ‘all moms threw them away there are no more’ — and then they walked in and realized ‘Wait there’s a room of 125 dealers selling them. I get them all back now mom!’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnZldHRlYmxvZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOC9jb3J2ZXR0ZXMtZm9yLXNhbGUtYmlnLWJsb2NrLTE5NzQtY29ydmV0dGUtY29udmVydGlibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corvettes For Sale: Big Block 1974 Corvette Convertible - Corvette: Sales News & Lifestyle,"

The 1970s may not have been kind to the Corvette in the performance arena but that decade certainly showed Chevy’s sports car to be at the peak of its popularity sales-wise.

Indeed from 1970 to 1979 Chevrolet cranked out a remarkable 368906 Corvettes – including this 1974 big-block convertible that marked a new look for the nameplate.



While collectors may now bemoan the loss of the chrome bumpers that had adorned the front and rear of the Corvette through 1972 the fact is that back in the day the buying public didn’t seem to be very upset about the switch to the rubber bumpers to meet federal crash guidelines. In fact sales of the ’74 model increased to 37502 on the way to a record-setting number in 1979 when 53807 cars left the St. Louis factory. I myself as a 15-year-old high school student can remember drooling for hours over the new look for the ’74 Corvette dreaming of the day I would own one too.

This Mille Miglia Red 1974 being offered on eBay at the “Buy It Now” price of $23000 with the seller entertaining offers as well is actually quite the rare car. Only 5474 Corvettes that year were convertibles and furthermore just 3494 coupes AND convertibles featured the mighty 454/270 horsepower engine making its last appearance as the 350 was the only choice for buyers in 1975.



This one appears to be nicely equipped too with power steering power disc brakes power windows tilt-tele steering column Turbo 400 automatic transmission and rally wheels.

The seller boasts that the car “shows well” after he “just had the paint buffed out” and the photos do indeed show a very nice-looking Corvette that also “runs and drives well.” The nicely contrasting black ragtop also seems to be in excellent condition and the original saddle interior has held up nicely after almost half a century of use. Indeed the most noticeable problem we could find was a few small cracks in the driver’s armrest.

The car is now located in Portland Oregon but spent most of its life in California so rust doesn’t appear to be a concern.



One quick tip: You can always tell a ’74 by the seam going down the middle of the two-piece rear bumper. From ’75 forward the bumpers were one piece.

If this car lives up to an in-person inspection the way it appears in the photos someone is going to have a nice ’74 in their garage soon without breaking the bank in the process.

This is of course merely a broader protest and iterations thereof may be found across more specific practices such as animation music and the graphic arts. Those who field such ham-handed views may fancy themselves as the old guard of a glorious and wholly imagined creative past yet the key aspect of art itself that they invariably fail to grasp is that it has never been a static entity and that it is instead engaged in a constant state of give-and-take with the habitus it is created in and as a result is ceaselessly evolving and mutating in any way it can. And with regards to the identification of “soul” one need look no further than to practitioners such as Riccardo Franco-Loiri who is part of a growing community of digital artists that are continuously attempting to channel the instinctual emotional and ephemeral through a combination of techniques ranging from glitching to generative art and everything in between.

I’m a fallen star a piece that carries a distinct glitch sensibility Image: Riccardo Franco-Loiri

Franco-Loiri hails from Turin which lies to the north of Italy and pursues a practice that is built upon audio-visual artistry. He tells STIR “When I was 17 I was studying music and was simultaneously trying to expand my consciousness and my artistic knowledge in digital and electronic ways. After high school in 2014 I attended the APM School of Saluzzo and I got my degree in audio-visuals production. Then I started to work with studios and collectives all around Italy in video and audio production.” Franco-Loiri goes by the name ‘Akasha’ which is the Sanskrit word for ether or what the artist considers to be a “universal glue that links us all in a spiritual web”. His body of work is diverse and often blends recognisably human and natural actors with entities that are far more abstract. And while it doesn’t permeate through his entire oeuvre there is a strong presence of glitch sensibility within some of the artist’s works as well most distinctly of all his many static pieces. Acknowledging this Franco-Loiri explains “In 2015 my father died from the consequences of a bad cancer that took his life so fast it was the worst period of my life. All the things started to change my personal vision of life became a horrific place made of pain with some spots of intimate beauty and wellness. During this period I went down deep into glitch culture and music production. I developed a very personal relationship with glitch art. I think that through such errors we can see the world in a purified way free from the sterile contraposition between signifier and signified.” He adds highlighting an ephemerality within the medium that caused him to view glitched digital corruptions as epiphanies. He mentions that these give him esoteric sensations and make the artist feel as though he is an alchemist who is converting digital matter into gold through a transformative process.

Franco-Loiri’s initial years as an artist were just as hard as his time in college with him having to experience the loss of four people that were near and dear to him. He mentions feeling as though he was within the eye of a storm; screaming and punching at the air around him in vain. Through it all his artistic pursuits served as a way to focus himself and he mentions developing more complex and structured projects during this time. His work gained nuance and began to explore the complexities of human emotions through a striking audio-visual format. Eventually he would work towards diversifying his skillset by pursuing a Masters in 3D graphics motion and CGI whilst simultaneously also studying New Media Art and Multimedia at Turin University. He does not reflect warmly on this time however telling STIR “University was the worst place for my creativity due to the inexperience of other people and the teachers as well as the ruinous school system we have here.”

Blessed Blossom Image: Riccardo Franco-Loiri

Things would look up for the artist in 2018 when he would meet light and video mapping artist Tomasso Rinaldi who went by the name ‘High Files’. Franco-Loiri would join High Files along with a third artist Niccolò Borgia hence beginning a fertile collaboration that since earned great praise and has seen the team collaborate with other entities as well. Discussing their video mapping work the artist says “We have a particular and deeply personal vision of video mapping based on digital illusionism: we don't use the architectures as a sterile canvas for our artworks but instead try and put life inside the volumes and shapes through the light we cast. Light as a nucleus for the artistic happening; light as fuel for spiritual beings.”

Franco-Loiri’s pieces along with the emotive work created by the emergent artistic culture he is a part of have the power to create deeply spiritual experiences for a growing audience. However in his particular case it may be quite rewarding to experience works that mash together his glitch sensibilities with the moving image even more directly. The artist seems to be moving towards this as well and one may observe a growing incidence of glitch within his practice. Undoubtedly there are other fertile routes for Franco-Loiri to explore as well and regardless of his path his work will continue to evolve as digital production technology expands. It is a joyous sentiment to think that the times we live in however strange and chaotic they may be are also quite possibly the greatest era in human history thus far for artistic evolution. Our ideas can hardly keep up with the rate at which our ability to manifest them grows and what a happy predicament that is to have. Meanwhile artists such as Franco-Loiri remind us that the beating heart of creative practice is very much alive and indeed is perhaps more nuanced than it has ever been.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrc29udmlsbGUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYXJ0cy8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L2FydC1iaWtlcy1qYXgtb2ZmZXJzLWVsZWN0cmljLWJpa2UtdG91cnMtamFja3NvbnZpbGxlcy1wdWJsaWMtYXJ0LzgxODIxMTAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Art Bikes Jax offers electric bike tours of Jacksonville's public art,"Ron Rothberg has a thing for Jacksonville's public art installations.

He's got a mural painted on the wooden fence outside his home at Park Street and Talbot Avenue and he runs a company that leads tours of the murals and statues of Riverside Avondale and downtown. People who take the self-guided tours ride electric bicycles that are rolling pieces of art themselves each decorated by a local artist.

Art Bikes Jax operates out of the Open Road Cycles in Avondale. Rothberg said he plans to open a second location soon in San Marco.

He has a fleet of a dozen bikes for the tours that are real head-turners festooned with noses and wings and flowers and images of Jacksonville's bridges. The bikes are electric so riders can pedal if they want or use one of the five ""power-assist"" levels that push the bikes forward at up to 20 mph.

The bicycles are all ""step-throughs"" — what used to be called a girls' bike with no central crossbar — making them easy to get on and off. A thumb-activated throttle activates the power assist or the bikes can be set to provide an extra boost whenever they are pedaled.

Rothberg said that if you can ride a bike you can ride an electric bike. Riders have to be at least 18 and go through a quick safety check before they are turned loose. Helmets are provided and the bikes have Kevlar-laced tires to make them durable.

More:Electric scooters have arrived in downtown Jacksonville. Here's how you can use them.

Riders can book a bike for a 90-minute picnic lunch a self-guided tour or a Saturday trip to the Riverside Arts Market. Rothberg said he hopes to soon start tours for newcomers to Jacksonville and he is working on plans for a tour of historic churches and food tours that would hop from restaurant to restaurant. He's also planning Sunday guided tours led by artists photographers and storytellers.

Rothberg said he started the company as a way to show people the public art and architecture that is all around them. One of Art Bike Jax's most popular tours is a self-guided trip that takes riders along the St. Johns River and into downtown past murals painted on downtown buildings and the mosaics outside the Jessie Ball DuPont Center.

""The art community in this town is just so amazing” Rothberg said. ""I think that more people who live here in Jacksonville should know that this is a significant collection of international art.”

Riders download an app on any smartphone and simply follow the map for a three-hour tour. Each bike has a holder on its handlebars to make it easy to watch the map and the road at the same time. The tours stick to quiet residential roads designated bike paths and the Riverwalk when possible but riders do have to deal with traffic at some points of their ride.

He said he's seen a mix of locals and visitors taking the tours. Some are interested in the art others are just looking for a pleasant ride along the river to watch the dolphins at play. ""Some people want to learn about architecture or history"" he said. ""Others want to learn on their own.”

The e-Dart electric bikes cost around $1300 each. Rothberg worked with local artists to put a unique spin on each one. Sometime next year when the bikes are starting to show wear and tear he plans to auction them with proceeds going to the artists and an as-yet-undecided arts group.

More:'Artists are historians' and the pandemic isn't stopping them in Jacksonville

“Then we are going to start all over again” Rothberg said.

Rothberg is a native Floridian born in Miami and raised in Orlando. He moved to the Jacksonville area in 2004 and into Avondale in 2014.

The inspiration for the Art Bikes project came from a wooden fence outside his home along Talbot Avenue. During the early days of the pandemic a neighbor offered to paint a peacock on one end of the fence. It blossomed from there with his kids and their friends adding to it until it covered the entire length.

“That’s how this all got started” he said.

The three-hour self-guided tours are $50. Saturday RAM trips are $40 and 90-minute lunch rentals are $25.

The festival also includes a livestreamed digital concert night and other events featuring speakers performances and demonstrations. In addition three hours of Ars Electronica TV streamed online worldwide will focus on Garden Aotearoa.

“Ars Electronica Garden Aotearoa explores how the digital world connects with the physical world” said Associate Professor Uwe Rieger director of the University of Auckland’s arc/sec Lab for Cyber-Physical Architecture and Interactive Systems and one of the key organisers of Garden Aotearoa.

“It is for anyone interested in digital media whether they’re ten years old or 100. Visitors can explore digital information in ways that will delight their senses entertain them and make them think.”

Ars Electronica was founded in 1979 in Linz Austria. For more than four decades the festival has been at the forefront of the digital revolution involving a transdisciplinary range of artists scientists and technologists gathering for symposia exhibitions and performances scrutinising potential futures.

It is is one of the most influential festivals in the electronic arts and media world adds Professor Marc Aurel Schnabel Dean of Te Wāhanga Waihanga-Hoahoa—Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation. “And it’s incredibly special to host a part of this event for New Zealanders to explore experience and enjoy.”

The arc/sec Lab of the University of Auckland began participating in Linz in 2017 with large-scale interactive installations. In 2020 however the Covid-19 pandemic meant festival partners all over the world presented their exhibits in online “gardens” and both universities co-hosted their first cyber exhibition then.

This year as in 2020 the pandemic prevented a planned physical exhibition from going ahead in New Zealand but all 20 of the groups or individuals exhibiting have been able to adapt their work to the virtual format.

Highlights include LightSense presented by the arc/sec Lab at the School of Architecture and Planning in collaboration with the Augmented Human Lab and Empathic Computing Lab at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute.

LightSense is an immersive installation that augments physical constructions with holographic digital animations. Artificial intelligence allows the system to initiate and sustain conversations with audience members whether on-site or as virtual visitors.

The ‘structure’ has been trained to respond to verbal input with the use of artificial intelligence and 60000 poems. It also changes shape in response to what audience members say to it. It demonstrates a new form of reactive architecture that responds to the emotional tenor of the conversation with audience members.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an upcoming third-person action-adventure role-playing video game. It is inspired by the seventh Harry Potter book and the seventh installment in the Harry Potter series. The game is being published by Electronic Arts and it is in development at Electronic Arts Mobile Studios in Boston Massachusetts. It will be published for Windows on Xbox Live Arcade PlayStation Portable and iOS devices.

The game's story is set around 20 years after the events of the first Harry Potter book and will feature all the exciting action and adventure that has been known so far in the Harry Potter series. In this game Harry Potter and his friends are on a mission to rescue their friend Sirius Black who was taken prisoner and presumed dead by a Dark wizard. However something else happened to Harry as he and his friends were trying to find their friend and that is they had to save the world again this time using a Time-Turner which has the power to change the dates of certain events in the Harry Potter world and if used properly could completely alter history.

One of the main features of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that set it apart from previous video games is its use of a sandbox-style gameplay mechanic. Players are encouraged to go around the different locations of Harry Potter's home island of Hogwarts and interact with every character present. This includes such beloved characters as Hermione Granger Harry Potter himself Ron Weasley and their respective friends as well as non-playable characters such as Cho Chang Padma Patil Luna Lovegood and Anthony Goldstein. As you can imagine this is a highly interactive experience and if you have never played a video game that features this type of gameplay I highly recommend this title.",,,

The company got the positive news it expected as the ESC endorsed its blockbuster treatment Farxiga. The ESC update solidifies the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as first-line treatments for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

“It’s very exciting because it means that together with three other classes SGLT2s are now considered as essential treatments for heart failure” Joris Silon AZ’s chief of cardiovascular renal and metabolism said in an interview with Fierce Pharma. “In 2020 we were the first to come out with heart failure data for this class of drugs. We’ve been leading the charge.”

RELATED: ESC 2021: Eli Lilly Boehringer's Jardiance racks up data for 2nd nod in crowded heart failure field

First designed to treat Type 2 diabetes SGLT2s quickly proved in trials to also have cardiovascular benefits. So after Farxiga gained its initial approval in 2014 for Type 2 diabetes it pursued other therapy areas. Last year it was endorsed for patients with heart failure regardless of whether they had Type 2 diabetes. In April of this year it added an indication for chronic kidney disease (CKD) again for those with or without diabetes.

Farxiga is no longer the lone SGLT2 sanctioned for heart failure patients though. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance won approval for those with reduced ejection fraction just last month and at ESC presented data in patients with preserved ejection fraction too.

For its part AZ presented eight abstracts at ESC for chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Of particular note are results that demonstrate Farxiga's kidney benefits in patients with and without heart failure.

“It’s just an additional point that shows that our effect in protecting the kidney is really independent of any comorbidities” Silon said. “It’s exciting for physicians to be able to prescribe Farxiga in a very broad range of patients.”

Farxiga rang up $1.96 billion in sales last year and is looking to add even more indications. The next frontier for the drug will be heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Silon said. Trials also are underway for acute heart failure and for prevention of heart failure in patients who have had a heart attack.

“It’s such a fantastic molecule that we really have to explore all angles so patients can benefit from it” Silon said.

Also on Friday AZ showed in a real-world observational trial of 7000 participants that its clot-fighter Brilinta produced low bleeding rates and in the long term protected those who have had a heart attack.

The new ESC heart failure guidelines also recommend another AZ treatment Lokelma for hyperkalemia a condition that results from raised potassium levels in the blood and is associated with heart failure and chronic kidney disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Entergy says customers should finalize their storm preparations and follow the guidance of local and state officials. Based on historical restoration times customers in the direct path of a storm as intense as Hurricane Ida could experience outages for more than three weeks. While 90% of customers will be restored sooner customers in the hardest-hit areas should plan for the possibility of experiencing extended power outages.

In addition to the company’s local workforce Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans have requested mutual assistance.

Workers from across the country will continue pouring into Louisiana to assist in restoring power following Ida. With the additional requested resources the companies’ anticipate mobilizing a storm team of approximately 16000 a number that could fluctuate based on the storm’s path and intensity.

Entergy has moved equipment and crews from the path of the storm to quickly begin restoration work when safe to do so after the storm passes. Additionally crews have added flood protections for equipment in other areas that could see high water. High-water vehicles rear-alley machines marsh buggies drones and helicopters have been secured to assist in restoration efforts.

Crews will not move back into the area to begin restoration until it is safe to do so. While some work can be done on the ground crews cannot begin using bucket trucks until sustained winds are less than 30 mph. As crews learn more about the damage a plan will be put in place that restores power to critical infrastructure as well as the greatest number of customers safely in the shortest amount of time something that will be dependent upon damages and resources needed.

Crews will continue to practice social distancing while in the field due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Entergy asks that customers do the same. For the safety of crews and customers please stay away from work zones. If there is a need to report a service problem customers should call 1-800-ENTERGY.

Keeping customers informed before during and after a storm is important to Entergy. Here are some of the platforms we use to provide updates:

· Entergy App – Customers can use the app to report outages or check on the status of power at their home or business.

· Text alerts – Customers can register for outage text alerts through myEntergy. Be sure to update your notification preferences to participate in text alerts. Customers also can sign up for text messages about storm and restoration efforts by texting REG to 36778.

· Entergy Storm Center website – The website has storm safety preparation and restoration information that is updated regularly.

· Social media – Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Louisiana provide storm restoration updates through their Facebook and Twitter pages.

· Entergy’s View Outages website – The website includes maps that show where outages are located and give information about restoration progress.

An official in Jefferson Parish says a transmission tower that provides power for New Orleans and the east bank of the parish has collapsed into the river near Bridge City. According to the parish’s Emergency Management Director cables strung across the Mississippi River are now in the water but darkness is hampering visibility.

All eight major transmission lines are down according to Entergy. Due to the weather they cannot assess the damage. Entergy is providing backup power to the city’s Sewerage and Water Board but there are significant impacts to the pumping stations.

A boil water advisory has been issued for the entire east bank of Jefferson Parish.

Almost one million people were without power statewide as of 11 p.m. View the outage map here.

New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board provided the following statement:

As a city we are currently experiencing the worst impacts from Hurricane Ida yet. Although we have lost all Entergy power our teams are working quickly and decisively to make up for this with our self-generated power sources including Turbines 4 5 and 6 and EMD as well as backup generators located at our drainage pumping stations. The Entergy loss of power is a significant loss of power for our 60 hz pumps and the 25 hz pumps we power through the frequency changers but we are using our self-generated sources of power to drain stormwater and pump drinking water into the city. Lastly this power loss also impacts our sewer pumping stations. Currently there is no backup power to operate any of those that were impacted. We are assessing how many of the 84 stations are impacted but the number may be very significant. We have worked to obtain backup power for some of these stations and we will mobilize those units when it is safe to traverse the city. In order to prevent sewage backups we have asked residents to limit water usage at home thus decreasing the amount of wastewater we must pump and treat. This is a rapidly-developing and extremely fluid situation. We will keep you updated as circumstances develop.

Entergy released the following information:

As a result of Hurricane Ida’s catastrophic intensity all eight transmission lines that deliver power into the New Orleans area are currently out of service. When this occurred it caused a load imbalance in the area and resulted in generation in the area coming offline.

We are currently working to assess damage and identify a path forward to restore power to those who can take it in the area.

We have provided back-up generation to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board.

Power will not be restored this evening but we will continue work to remedy.

Governor John Bel Edwards released the following:

We are in communication with Entergy and the City. Right now all we can do is shelter in place and when it is safe at first light they will begin to assess the damage. We do not know how long power will be out. We will have a better idea when damage assessments start in the morning. They have utility crews staged and ready to assess damage. Everyone needs to stay away from downed power lines.

Entergy announced via text message that all of Orleans Parish lost electricity “due to catastrophic transmission damage” just after 7 p.m.

Once Hurricane Ida made landfall residents in Jefferson and Orleans parishes began losing power quickly. By 2:04 p.m. 294004 customers in the state were without electricity according to data provided by power company Entergy Louisiana.

In Jefferson Parish 103307 homes were without power and in Orleans Parish 81220 homes had lost electricity. Those numbers multiplied quickly and officials expected the number of outages to grow once Ida moved over cities New Orleans and Baton Rouge with sustained winds of up to 100 mph.

Five hours later the entire city of New Orleans went dark.

“Where the wind blows and hits a transmission line or a feed or anything like that we will have outages” said Ramsey Green deputy chief administrator for infrastructure in New Orleans. “And given that the winds are where they are there's really nothing anybody can do about it.”

In a press conference this morning Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Entergy New Orleans would not be able to restore service during the storm. An advisory from the power company Saturday noted that Louisiana residents could be out of electricity for weeks. Entergy said it would be able to fix most outages within a few weeks.

“We have to wait until the storm subsides and then we can do something about it.”

Green also said that power to the sewage lift station was impacted by the storm reducing the ability for wastewater to go through the system. He asked that residents in New Orleans reduce the amount of water they are using to alleviate pressure on the system.

He explained that Entergy New Orleans had dedicated ten generators to addressing issues with sewage but that fixing any challenges while the extremely dangerous storm passes may not be possible.

“We are anticipating 15 to 20 inches of rain inside of a 24 or 48 hour period” Green said. “We're concerned about flooding — primarily right-of-way flooding and low-lying areas. And we are not into the thick of this yet. It is going and it's only going to get worse for a little while.”

Poor design choices can worsen health with underlying issues of inequality a driving factor. Share on Pinterest Where we live and the design of our living spaces have a significant impact on health. Andrew Thomas/Getty Images Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family.” This includes housing food clothing medical care social services and security if events beyond a person’s control affect their livelihood. Researchers have shown that adequate housing has intimate links to a person’s physical and mental well-being. According to the Executive Summary of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Housing and Health Guidelines  poorly designed housing can increase the risk of trips falls injury isolation and stress for older people or people with disabilities. Further insecure or unaffordable housing can exacerbate stress. Housing that is too hot or cold or exacerbates indoor air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiometabolic issues. Crowded housing or housing with a poor water supply can increase the spread of infectious diseases. Speaking to Medical News Today Robert Huxford Director of the Urban Design Group London said that questions around the relationship between health and urban or housing design have a long history. “It’s often forgotten that the links between housing and urban design and health go back hundreds of years such as the 19th-century public health movement including the Health of Towns Association of the 1840s or the Model Byelaws issued in the 1870s that governed urban development in England for the next 50 years.” “They focused on lighting ventilation overcrowding damp and sanitation. They specified the minimum width of streets minimum spaces around buildings and that habited rooms should have a window at least one-tenth of the floor area. Over 100 years on developers are bringing forward proposals for windowless flats.” For Huxford the COVID-19 pandemic has brought historical concerns around housing and infectious diseases back to the fore. “In the 19th century the main causes of death were infectious diseases such as tuberculosis cholera and typhoid” said Huxford. “The public health works of the 19th and 20th-century saw infectious disease brought under control further aided by advances in medical science. However the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that we remain vulnerable to infectious disease; and the prospect of drug-resistant diseases is a grave international concern.” “It is of the utmost importance that housing and urban design provides resilience to infectious disease risk.” Backing up Huxford’s point in an article in the journal PLOS ONE  researchers found an association between the amount of poor quality housing in a United States county and COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

Car-dependent development According to Katja Stille Chair of the Urban Design Group and Director of Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design broader urban design choices can have direct adverse effects on a person’s health. Speaking to MNT Stille said “the main urban factors that negatively affect a person’s mental and physical health are air pollution from road traffic as well as noise pollution.” “Living in a car-dependent development will impact negatively on people’s ability to exercise and encourage a sedentary lifestyle that easily leads to obesity heart disease and diabetes. The opportunity to be physically active throughout one’s day-to-day life such as active transport — walking and cycling — is important to avoid obesity.” Dr. Steven Fleming author of Velotopia: The Production of Cyclespace in Our Minds and Our Cities also highlights the issue of car-centric urban design. Dr. Fleming said to MNT that a “house with a garage is designed to send you on your way driving for a day of no exercise whatsoever. An apartment block is only slightly better because the day of walking it was designed to set in motion — with its lift or stairs leading onto the street — will have negligible metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes. If you [already have overweight] you’ll be looking for a taxi or bus because walking is painful for [people with obesity].” The definition of one MET is “the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest.” “In my book Velotopia” continued Dr. Fleming “I detailed in drawings and architectural jargon apartment-style housing that would set you on your way on your bike. You would leave your tenth story apartment and rather than waiting for a slow lift just ride past all the other apartments arranged around a sloping typically spiraling corridor or what we call an ‘access gallery’ or sometimes an ‘aerial street.’” “That would be the start of a day with far more MET-minutes than the one you started on foot and that wouldn’t be painful if you [have obesity].” Robert Huxford also has issues with designs that prioritize motor vehicles: “The impact of motor vehicles is significant bringing noise high intensity street lighting air pollution and the risk of injury from collisions into urban areas.”

Mental health Housing and urban design issues can also adversely affect mental health. Speaking to MNT Dr. Layla McCay Director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health said that “homelessness and housing insecurity are a key risk factor for mental health problems.” “For those who do have a home the affordability of the home is key as economic concerns have links to mental health problems; so too is the quality of the housing including dampness noise pests and overcrowding.” “Location of the housing is also important including neighborhood quality and safety access to key facilities including education jobs and healthcare. And any aspect of the housing that stigmatizes its residents can also negatively affect residents’ mental health.” “Housing that is available safe adequate affordable and comfortable and that offers its residents a degree of privacy while also facilitating multi-generational living where desired can benefit people’s mental health” she continued. “Housing has the opportunity to further support people’s mental health by facilitating residents to develop positive relationships with their neighbors and to foster feelings of inclusion and belongingness.”

Security and homelessness As Dr. McCay highlights the security of housing — whether a person owns their home or cannot keep up with the mortgage; whether they have a long-term rental contract; or whether they face the possibility of eviction with no notice — can be just as important a factor for a person’s well-being as the physical conditions of the home. Prof. Deborah K. Padgett of the Silver School of Social Work in New York University an expert on the intersection of homelessness and mental or substance use disorders spoke with MNT. She explained that while insecure housing is a complex topic it has some key root causes. “Global housing instability is due to severe poverty and lack of institutional support for ‘public’ or ‘social’ housing that is affordable.” “The United Nations-endorsed concept of ‘housing is a right’ is in my opinion the most contested and least attractive of human rights supposedly guaranteed by governments. This is in part because demand so overwhelms supply as world population growth soars.” “But the last decades (since the Reagan administration here in the U.S.) have seen heavy privatization of housing development and this naturally excludes the poor. In countries like India the millions living in slums are not considered ‘homeless’ but this obscures the deplorable living conditions they endure.” “From a personal level day-to-day survival is a struggle to procure food clean water sanitary facilities etc. — whether living in a slum a shantytown or on a park bench” said Prof. Padgett. For Prof. Padgett a primary factor that affects the relationship between housing and mental health is homelessness. However people too often presume that mental health issues cause homelessness when the reality is not straightforward — a point Prof. Padgett recently outlined in an article for the journal BJPsych Bulletin. Prof. Padgett told MNT that “homelessness and mental health have a bi-directional relationship but it’s also complicated. While serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia account for a minority of homeless persons these individuals are more likely to be chronically homeless and have needs that create more costs for the system — hospitals jails shelters and so on.” “They are also more likely to be visible in public and thus skew public perceptions away from the fact that most homeless people are families with small children youth ‘new’ homeless (older Baby Boomers) and others.” “Sadly the hyper-focus on serious mental illness diverts attention from the trauma caused by being homeless and this remains under-studied — in part because it is often trauma compounded by childhood adversity and traumatic events earlier in life.”

Inequality For Dr. McCay an underlying issue in poor health associated with urban and housing design is wealth inequality. “Housing is inextricably linked to mental health and well-being but access to housing and the quality of that housing varies according to a wide range of factors particularly wealth” said Dr. McCay. “Inequalities in people’s access to safe affordable good-quality housing can lead to inequalities in their mental health and well-being. People’s mental health can also be affected by ‘segregation by design’ for example where people who own their homes are separated by design features from people who live in social housing even within the same building creating stigma and exacerbating inequality.” “During the COVID-19 pandemic we saw evidence of housing-related inequalities where some people were able to relax and play in their gardens while others had no outside space; some had good quality local parks and others had to travel outside their neighborhood to find safe and pleasant green space.” For Prof. Peter Bishop a professor of urban design at the Bartlett School of Architecture University College London various forms of social deprivation including poor housing and urban design correlate with worse health outcomes. Speaking to MNT Prof. Bishop said: “There is a clear correlation between physical and mental health and indices of multiple deprivation. Public Health England lists childhood experience education stable housing and secure employment as the core contributing factors to health and well-being.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

EL,Estée Lauder Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlLzA4MjctYmluYy1tYWctdGhlLWVzdGVlLWxhdWRlci1jb3MtdGhyb3VnaC1hbi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWxlbnMtMTIzNDg5MTg3MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Estée Lauder Cos. Through an International Lens,"International expansion has long been a central facet of the Estée Lauder Cos. Inc.’s business strategy. It began in 1960 14 years after the company’s birth and remains a key component today.

“The international ethos really deserves to be credited to Leonard” said Cedric Prouvé group president international at the Estée Lauder Cos. referring to Leonard A. Lauder today the company’s chairman emeritus.

Prouvé who has held that role since the end of 2002 and been with the company for almost 30 years described the Estée Lauder Cos.’ overseas evolution as having had numerous phases. The group began as a small New York-based entrepreneurial company that expanded throughout the U.S. and morphed into a big American cosmetics player exporting to the rest of the world.

Its first step abroad came in 1960 when the Estée Lauder brand launched in Holt Renfrew in Toronto. Very soon thereafter it went into Harrods in London which Prouvé described as “the first beachhead to Europe” with a huge draw for local and international clients. There was a foray into Puerto Rico too.

“When Leonard went international he had a lot of patience” said Prouvé. “His goal was not to generate the biggest business necessarily. At the beginning he was really working toward enhancing the reputation prestige and equity of the brand.”

Crucial to that was securing the best in-store location.

“Leonard was very passionate very early on about location location location” said Prouvé. “So he had to fight other competitors. You wanted to be in the nerve center of the store to be seen and to shine.

“That’s a mindset we still keep even when we go online. It’s all about visibility location and awareness first” he continued.

The 1960s saw other international pushes for the group: in Sweden Hong Kong Australia France and Japan — all by the year 1968.

“He was picking places that would enhance the awareness and international visibility of the brand” said Prouvé adding: “Leonard didn’t choose the easy path.”

That’s to say the executive eschewed hiring a distributor or a representative in those countries abroad. Instead Lauder signed on people he trusted to take care of the brand and build up its worldwide reputation. (Prouvé called them “the cosmetics barons.”) This strategy in turn created staying power: Many of those people remained with the group for decades. Peter Kurtz for instance remained with the Estée Lauder Cos. in Austria for more than 35 years.

“These people really lived and breathed Estée Lauder and the expansion of the group” said Prouvé. “It was an investment in people and in local entities — in the local retailers and local consumers. It was an interesting way to go international.

“One of the keys to our success is this investment in people” he maintained.

And the company’s international strategy kept evolving from there.

New markets were entered. In 1973 business contacts were started up in the then-Soviet Union where the Estée Lauder products became available in hard-currency shops. In 1989 the group opened its first freestanding shop in Budapest and an Estée Lauder perfumery in Moscow. Four years later the company opened the doors to the Estée Lauder Perfumery in Warsaw.

Also in 1993 the group entered China with corners for the Estée Lauder and Clinique brands at the Isetan Department Store in Shanghai. That helped set the expansion in the country — and elsewhere in Asia — in motion.

The next year the group unveiled its first freestanding store in Prague and in 1995 it established an in-store boutique selling Estée Lauder and Aramis products in Kiev.

Prouvé highlighted that when he joined the Estée Lauder Cos. in 1994 each brand the group owned had been nurtured by the Lauder family. He called that approach unique vis-à-vis the competitions’ strategy.

“We went public in ’95 and decided to be a growth company” said Prouvé describing that as a “turning point.”

Another way to expand reach abroad was by investing in and acquiring beauty brands outside of the U.S. That started by the Estée Lauder Cos. taking a minority stake in Canada-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994 followed by a full-out acquisition of the makeup brand in 1998 and the purchase of Jo Malone London in 1999.

The group then kept snapping up brands abroad. In the first decade of the 2000s the company acquired Darphin in France and took a minority stake in Forest Essentials in India.

Another prong in Lauder’s international expansion was its establishment of regional innovation centers in Asia and Europe to work in tandem with the company’s research and development team in North America. That way innovation processes could be put in action in a specific market to create the most relevant product to that place.

“We transformed the company from this kind of export mentality to really more of an integrative globalized company where innovation can come from anywhere and [there’s] a lot more local relevance” according to Prouvé. So the idea was to target what’s best in a market and then bring it to the rest of the world.

“The whole international expansion took a different turn” said Prouvé explaining it became about establishing the right capabilities around the world in all regions. That included decentralizing processes and making sure the group’s products were relevant in the geographies building capabilities and expanding and optimizing the portfolio.

In the 2010s the Estée Lauder Cos. acquired Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle Kilian Paris Dr. Jart+ (in 2019 four years after an initial investment) and took a first stake in the Deciem family of brands which then was purchased outright by the company this year.

The Estée Lauder Cos.’ geographic mix evolved rapidly and it’s already been more than 15 years since the business abroad became larger than at home for the group.

In its fiscal year 2020 the Americas represented 26 percent of total net sales; Europe the Middle East and Africa 44 percent and the Asia-Pacific region 30 percent.

“Our heritage market is the U.K.” said Prouvé. “We were the first really big international company to step foot in the U.K. and expand and invest in our structure.”

Today the Estée Lauder Cos. is the largest prestige beauty player in that country. Harrods remains the heritage retailer there and it’s now carrying practically every brand the Estée Lauder Cos. retails in the U.K.

China is an important fast-growing market for the group which opened an affiliate in the mainland in 2002.

“It was a tiny business” recalled Prouvé.

Fast-forward less than two decades and in fiscal-year 2020 the company’s net sales in mainland China including those from travel retail there generated about 24 percent of the Estée Lauder Cos.’ consolidated net sales. To give a sense of the rapidity of growth: That compares to approximately 17 percent in fiscal 2019 and about 13 percent in fiscal 2018.

“I remember we went through the first $100 million $500 million and now today it’s a multibillion-dollar business” said Prouvé. “China has grown super super fast.”

The executive has instigated numerous strategies while building the company’s international activity. “What we’ve done is build regional platforms with talent and services and capabilities that can service our affiliates” he said. “Our affiliates are focused on giving us consumer insights and executing with excellence.

“The second thing I really focused on was emerging markets” Prouvé continued.

India and Brazil were two major ones he opened.

An editor tipped him off that India was ready for a brand like MAC.

“Everybody was cautioning us about going to India [saying] it’s very difficult to do business [there] you have to be patient and take a distributor” he said. “One of the first decisions we made was no distributor. We went our own way with our own retail stores.”

Two vectors of development were chosen: Bollywood and weddings.

“MAC took off like a rocket” he said recounting attending the brand’s first door opening in the Mumbai suburb of Jehu. “We had 500 people in front of the store at 8 o’clock in the morning. We were stunned.

“To this day MAC is a love brand in India” continued Prouvé. “The departure in Brazil was very similar.”

The Estée Lauder brand was just launched this year in Brazil the last major market in Latin America where it was not yet present exclusively with Sephora in-store and online “phenomenal success” he said.

“It really starts with the consumer” Prouvé said of the strategy overall.

Those consumers differ in terms of cultural preferences. The consumer in China for instance has the most aspirational mindset brand-wise. So the brands that have always done best there are the most luxurious.

“The first task is looking at the road map for all of our brands” said Prouvé. “Then we look at which categories dominate the market in terms of consumption.”

In the early years in China 90 percent or more of the group’s business came from skin care then makeup gained a lot of traction. At first in India and Brazil the focus was on makeup and Europe was primarily a fragrance market.

Big shifts have taken place since.

“We actually see fragrance and luxury fragrance doing really well in China. We just launched Frédéric Malle and Killian in China this year for the first time and the early results are super encouraging” said Prouvé.

The third big criterion for international expansion is securing the right distribution and whether it can create the proper awareness desirability and experience.

“One factor that’s really helping us right now in emerging markets is online” said Prouvé. “Online is a game changer.”

That’s because it brings full consumer coverage. “Opening physical distribution city by city — in the biggest tier cities first then the midtier cities and the low-tier cities takes a lot of time capital and investment etcetera” he said. “Online gives you access to everything.”

In India the Estée Lauder Cos. began working with Nykaa which is the country’s largest omnichannel beauty destination. “We started reaching consumers in 950 cities” said Prouvé.

The Estée Lauder brand — the most distributed brand from the group — has a physical presence in about 130 cities in the country but through Tmall it has transactions being made in 750 Chinese cities.

Another big piece of being a globally integrated company is the travel-retail channel which for the Estée Lauder Cos. spans more than 100 countries and territories worldwide. The group claims to be the leader in travel retail which represents approximately 25 percent of its overall sales.

“The way we expand in emerging markets is thinking not just about the business we’re going to do in these countries but also the business we’re going to do with our consumers when they travel” said Prouvé.

When the Russian economy does well and travel is fluid the Russian corridor includes countries such as Paris Dubai and Turkey.

“So we are looking at all that and this is what’s driving our investment into new markets” said Prouvé.

Other important emerging markets for the group include Russia the Middle East Mexico Turkey and South Africa.

“What we’re focusing on increasingly is the emerging middle class around the world” continued Prouvé. “That is going to be the future growth of the company.”

He called the group’s expansion abroad “a really fascinating journey” and his time at the company a privilege. Prouvé lauded the Lauder family’s attitude toward internationalization and investments which William Lauder executive chairman of the company calls “patient capital.”

“Even though we’re a publicly listed company we behave like a luxury company” said Prouvé. “We’re not going to sacrifice the long-term health of our brands and our organization for the quarter. So first and foremost for us is this idea of sustainability values and long-term. I think that’s why we’ve been around for 75 years.

“Leonard always told me that his dream is that we’ll still be around 75 years from now” he said.

Chairman emeritus Leonard A. Lauder is as engaged as ever in the ins and outs of the company and the industry overall; Ronald S. Lauder serves as chairman of Clinique Laboratories; William P. Lauder is executive chairman of the board; Aerin Lauder is the founder and creative director of Aerin and the style and image director for the Estée Lauder brand and Jane Lauder is executive vice president enterprise marketing and chief data officer for the company overall

“We are focused on family values the very highest level of performance with the consumer at the core” said Jane Hertzmark Hudis executive group president of the Estée Lauder Cos. “Family values is about the continuity of the Lauder family through the generations. The idea of relationships and treating others with respect is so much of what we’re about.”

While each family member plays a different role common threads run throughout. “Each successive family member has brought their own vision and style to the company” said Ronald S. Lauder. “Ahead of her time in every way my mother Estée defied conventions and set the tone for the family business. She and my father Joseph always reinforced following a passion and instilled a persistent work ethic that was passed down to their sons and grandchildren.”

Estée and Joseph Lauder

William P. Lauder often speaks of the robust business discussions that would happen around the family dinner table while growing up.

That dynamic continues today. “We are forever sharing stories and memories with the next generation at the dinner table and family gatherings” said Ronald Lauder.

“You don’t take a job at Estée Lauder — you join Estée Lauder” said John Demsey executive group president. “Leonard likes to say that once there is blue in your blood it is blue forever. Of course — we are not related. We’re not in the will. Yet somehow we feel completely immersed as members of a broader family. There is a kindness and respect for hard work here that is really appreciated.”

Hudis who worked with Estée Lauder early in her career notes that the values embodied by the founder are still very much in play today. “She was such a powerful woman and you felt it” said Hudis. “She led by example by not only creating great products but by standing in the stores and serving women herself — customer by customer treating them with dignity and respect.”

Estée Lauder in the 1970s.

Estée Lauder was also fiercely committed to quality and was famous for her instinctual understanding of what women want. “She tinkered and tinkered and tinkered to the last second — whether refining a juice or changing a package. It had to be the best” said Hudis.

“There is something to a woman’s instinct” she continued. “In this business it is incredibly powerful. You can have all of the data in the world but in your bloodstream you need to know what is right. Mrs. Estée Lauder was very inspiring in that way because she knew what was right.”

The stories about Mrs. Estée Lauder are legendary. Demsey recalled a meeting with Bloomingdale’s to talk about a proposed spa in the 59th Street flagship. “Leonard brought Estée and everybody was in shock because Estée was immovable if she didn’t get what she wanted. She had incredible drive and stamina” he said.

With Estée in the room everyone knew that resistance on the part of Bloomingdale’s would be futile.

“Mike Blumenfeld [the Bloomingdale’s executive credited with building the retailer’s beauty business] looked at Leonard and said ‘This is unfair. If I had known you were bringing your mother I would have brought mine!.’

“That to me says everything” said Demsey.

The Lauder family’s influence extends beyond business. As their wealth grew so has their commitment to giving back both as a family and as a business. Evelyn H. Lauder the late wife of Leonard founded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and the company’s Breast Cancer Campaign has to date raised almost $100 million for breast cancer research. MAC’s Viva Glam has raised over $500 million since its inception to support HIV/AIDS awareness and research while the Estée Lauder Cos. Charitable Foundation Girl’s Education Initiative provides corporate funds and resources to support educational programs for girls in more than 13 countries.

“We have been a very generous family from a philanthropic standpoint and that is a value that’s imprinted on our company in so many ways” said William P. Lauder noting that many of the brand have important initiatives as well. “That is a meaningful point of inflection for our company — we are not just here to sell lipstick. We help raise money for things that are important.

“That value system is such a key part of who we are and what our DNA is” Lauder said “and I certainly hope that in the next 75 years we never lose that.”",,,,,,,,,

Going out with a bang so to speak the final season of The Walking Dead brings the Commonwealth (a community of survivors) from the comics to the screen. The introduction of this utopian-seeming community offers the opportunity for a fashion infusion into the zombie apocalypse series which returned Aug. 22.

Joining the AMC show toward the end of season 10 costume designer Vera Chow eagerly took on the challenge of expanding the wardrobe scope of the entire series beyond the established utilitarian and tactical survival essentials. And while she can’t say much about the looks she chose for members of the Commonwealth one hint is the use of brands like vibrant knitwear maker YanYan known for its cozy and charming cardigans.

Chow also changed up the sourcing process by shopping BIPOC- women- and LGBTQ+-owned businesses. “A show like The Walking Dead has such a giant platform” says Chow via a call from set. With an average of 4.5 million viewers per episode in season 10 and 7 million followers on the show’s Instagram account the long-running series presents multiple mediums to amplify the work of underrepresented designers who often are overlooked during the bulk department-store buying trips that many costume departments rely on.

Designers used in the new season of The Walking Dead include Sky Iron Sanctum (known for its industrial-chic jewelry). @Skyironsanctum/Instagram

Chow cast a wide net searching via Instagram and Etsy rabbit holes for finds plus getting old-school word-of-mouth recommendations from friends. “It spans the world” says the Chinese American costume designer who also worked with BIPOC and indie designers for Eddie Huang’s 2021 feature film Boogie. She lists off Lagos Nigeria-based designer Imad Eduso; sustainable brand Butcher Apparel headquartered in Goa India; zero-waste line Deploy London by British Asian designer Bernice Pan; and the apocalypse-adjacent style of Hong Kong’s Hamcus.

“My favorite is B.Yellowtail” says Chow. Founded by Indigenous designer and FIDM alum Bethany Yellowtail the brand and retailer celebrates authentic Native American designs and artistry. “The prints are really cool” says Chow. “I won’t go into descriptive details or else it becomes very obvious which character I’m talking about.”

The Commonwealth denizens also will wear pieces often customized by Chow’s team by gender-norm-breaking Wildfang; Bedouin-inspired Gipci; D’iyanu founded by Nigeria-born Addie Elabor; and ethical casualwear by Portland Oregon’s Sara Bergman.

After finding industrial-cool jewelry line Sky Iron Sanctum on Etsy Chow collaborated with its designer Kristina Van Istendal to custom-make upward of 60 pieces. “We found it very appropriate for a particular group of people on our show” hints Chow who will tag and credit the brands on social media as new episodes are unveiled.

She emphasizes that taking the time and effort to research and source from a diverse group of designers benefits her process as well as the overall storytelling. “I have to interact with every single vendor and talk about the show. But I feel like that actually helps me think about the characters more than just plowing through a Bloomingdale’s and being like ‘This looks like Yumiko.’ ‘This looks like Daryl.’ ‘This looks like Carol'” says Chow of her intentional “slow fashion” approach. “This helps me really curate.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvNDAtZXh0cmVtZWx5LXJhbmRvbS10aGluZ3MtMjAwMHMtMDExNTExMDExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,37 Extremely Random Things From The 2000s You Definitely Forgot About,"1.

Growing library of classes

Ample storage

Quality dumbbells/kettlebells Cons No form monitoring

Can be heavy/bulky to move

When it comes to fitness equipment NordicTrack leads the way. Known for its ski machines and treadmills the company expanded its lineup to include ellipticals weight machines and eventually smart home gyms. Now NordicTrack is again forging ahead with the Vault a home gym and smart mirror combo. How does it hold up against the competition? We tested the Vault to find out.

Convenient storage reasonable size

NordicTrack did a great job with the size of the Vault. The bookshelf-sized cabinet is big enough to hold all the kettlebells and dumbbells you’ll need without taking up too much space in your house. It’s freestanding which is perfect for apartment dwellers who probably can’t install a smart mirror permanently onto the wall. At six-feet tall two-feet wide and a little over one-foot deep you can squeeze the Vault into any corner of your room. It also has a brushed metal finish and mirror front that is attractive enough to work in any space. Choose your location carefully though as the Vault is heavy and can be difficult to move without an extra hand or two.

All mirror no form

The NordicTrack Vault has a nearly full-length 61.5-inch reflective mirror and a 32-inch touchscreen display that makes it easy to watch the instructors and mirror their form while you work out. Unlike other smart gyms the Vault does not offer feedback on your form which is a big detraction. You have to rely on your keen eye to ensure you are doing the exercises correctly and keeping up the pace.

The mirror on the front has an excellent 360-degree hinge. You can swing the mirror open in tight spaces like a door to access the dumbbells/kettlebells and work out directly in front of the Vault with the mirror in its closed position. If you have the extra space you can extend out and angle the mirror so you can work out anywhere in your room.

Market-leading exercise library

The Vault is powered by iFit which has a growing library of exercises broken down into such categories as strength yoga recovery/mobility/stretching and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) training. And iFit was the one motivator that kept me on the treadmill all winter so it’s not surprising that it was the feature that drew me into using the Vault.

iFit hires some of the best trainers and videographers on the market.

It’s also important to note that iFit hires some of the best trainers and videographers on the market — and it shows. Video quality is outstanding with most exercises filmed in either a studio-like gym or a scenic outside location. The videographers take the time to capture just the right camera angles for you to see the movement.

The trainers are upbeat and encouraging without being annoying. Especially in the beginner level workouts the trainers provide detailed instructions on each exercise that are easy to follow. In most cases you practice the exercises first before doing them during an intensive workout.

New exercises and trainers are also added to iFit regularly. You’ll keep coming back to see what fresh new workouts are now in the library.

Learning while lifting

While iFit offers a diversity of content that’s not its only winning feature. It excels at teaching you how to work out. I can’t tell you how many times in the past I picked up my dumbbells to start a strength-training program and then stopped a few weeks later because I only knew a few exercises. I made minimal progress and was bored with the routine.

The iFit training programs alleviated all my uncertainty. I learned how to use kettlebells properly and when to use dumbbells. The trainers taught me multiple exercises for each muscle group and rotated through different activities to work out my whole body instead of just my arms and shoulders. I didn’t just work out; I learned how to work out as well. Unlike the Tonal home gym which focused primarily on strength the Vault improved my overall fitness and well-being.

Price

The NordicTrack Vault is available in two versions — a $1999 basic option without any accessories or a complete $2999 option filled with dumbbells kettlebells resistance bands and more. Though pricey the complete package is the best value for those who don’t already own free weights.

The NordicTrack Vault is powered by iFit which requires a subscription. The Vault ships with one free year of iFit and you can add on a subscription for as low as $15 per month. It’s important to note that iFit is reasonably priced compared to the competition some of which charge $40 or more per month. And iFit also works across all your fitness gear allowing you to simultaneously use the same subscription on your treadmill and Vault.

Our take

The NordicTrack Vault is a modern storage system for your fitness gear and a powerhouse fitness tool thanks to its growing iFit workout library. With its professional trainers high-quality video and workout variety iFit is what separates the Vault from the competition. If you already own an iFit treadmill or bike then the Vault is a must-have fitness-boosting companion.

Is there a better alternative?

The Vault’s closest competitor is the Mirror by Lululemon which is smaller and more stylish-looking than the Vault. It also offers more live and on-demand classes than the Vault at this point. The Mirror does not include the kettlebells dumbbells and resistance bands that ship with the Vault’s complete package option though. It also doesn’t have any storage for these free weights. After you purchase weights you’ll have to inconveniently leave them on the floor or spend even more money to buy a dedicated rack.

There’s also the Tempo Studio which much like the Vault keeps some of the weights and accessories hidden inside of its cabinet. While it’s not as attractive the Tempo Studio does offer tracking for proper form.

How long will it last?

The NordicTrack Vault has a sturdy construction that will last for several years. The Vault’s weak point is its full-length mirror. It doesn’t crack or scuff easily — we bumped it several times without any damage — but a hard impact could shatter the glass.

The iFit software will go the distance. The company is known for its regular updates that add new exercise programs and new features to NordicTrack’s fitness equipment.

Should you buy it?

The Nordic Track Vault is an excellent option for those looking to build a home gym for general fitness. The stylish unit holds a full suite of dumbbells and kettlebells and has a growing library of exercises for all abilities and levels.

In today’s Digest all about the poultry poop and dairy doodoo plans what CleanBay Renewables bp Chevron Brightmark had to say about it ExxonMobil’s take what this all means and more.

Poultry Poop Power

Let’s start with the bp CleanBay Renewables RNG news since that’s a brand-new agreement and with more than 14 million tons of chicken litter produced each year in the United States alone the feedstock is aplenty.

bp and CleanBay Renewables announced a 15-year agreement where bp will purchase renewable natural gas processed from poultry litter – a mixture of manure feathers and bedding – and sell it as fuel for the US transportation sector.

CleanBay manages this process by mixing poultry litter with water in an anaerobic digester. One of the end products is biogas which includes methane. The biogas can be processed into RNG and used to fuel vehicles.

CleanBay’s approach builds on the sustainability efforts of the agriculture community by re-purposing poultry litter into RNG and a controlled-release fertilizer designed for optimized nutrient management. Each of their plants can recycle more than 150 thousand tons of chicken litter annually.

Through this agreement bp’s trading and shipping team will sell the fuel to its customers initially in California. There is strong demand for RNG fuel in the state due to incentives from its Low Carbon Fuel Standard. RNG-fueled vehicles are estimated to result in up to 95 percent lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than those fueled by gasoline or diesel on a lifecycle basis according to a US Department of Energy study.

The Poultry Plans

CleanBay is an environmental technology company focused on the production of sustainable RNG and engineered organic fertilizers. This agreement with bp directly supports the financing for its first active bio-conversion facility planned in eastern Maryland.

CleanBay is actively exploring sites for future facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Southeast and California. Its goal is to establish a portfolio of RNG and power facilities that reduce local emissions and provide farmers with an alternative use for their poultry litter and a fertilizer to increase their food production. Each of the 30 proposed CleanBay facilities is expected to generate enough sustainable energy to power 9200 cars per year by recycling more than 150000 tons of poultry litter annually.

CleanBay has incorporated measures to further reduce its carbon footprint including co-located solar power fields to meet the onsite power needs and the production of alternative products like green hydrogen.

Reactions from the stakeholders

Michael Thomas vice president biogas origination bp said “Working with innovative companies like CleanBay will be key for bp to reach our net zero ambition. As one of the largest suppliers of RNG to the US transportation sector this agreement will help us continue delivering competitive reliable energy solutions.”

Thomas Spangler executive chairman CleanBay Renewables said “By collaborating with bp we continue taking steps to positively impact our environment. Not only will our process improve the air soil and water quality around our agricultural facilities but our RNG is a sustainable environmentally-friendly way to help reduce GHG emissions.”

Donal Buckley CEO CleanBay Renewables said “RNG is a necessary energy transition approach in the near-term but green hydrogen and the use of RNG to power electric vehicle charging stations will be the backbone of a fast transition to a net zero future.”

Dairy Doodoo

Ok let’s take a look at the Chevron Brightmark news about their second expansion of their previously announced joint venture Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC to own projects across the United States to produce and market dairy biomethane a renewable natural gas.

Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC’s subsidiaries currently own RNG projects in New York Michigan Florida South Dakota and Arizona. Additional equity investments by each company in the joint venture will fund construction of infrastructure and commercial operation of 10 dairy biomethane projects including new sites in Iowa and Wisconsin and additional sites in Michigan and South Dakota. Chevron will purchase RNG produced from these projects and market the volumes for use in vehicles operating on compressed natural gas.

Reactions from the stakeholders

“This latest expansion with Brightmark advances our strategy of higher returns and lower carbon” said Andy Walz president of Chevron’s Americas Fuels & Lubricants. “Opportunities like these not only reaffirm our commitment to investing in ways that are good for the environment our consumers and our stockholders they also bolster our previously announced objective to increase RNG volumes tenfold by 2025 over 2020 volumes.”

“Brightmark’s expanded partnership with Chevron is another positive step forward in the decarbonization of the farming industry” said Bob Powell founder and chief executive officer of Brightmark. “Our carbon-negative projects are successfully reimagining waste and delivering significant environmental benefits while improving economics for our dairy farm partners. We look forward to executing on these new RNG projects with Chevron and partnering with dairy farmers to expand our RNG footprint across the country.”

What about ExxonMobil?

Interestingly ExxonMobil’s news from a few days ago caught our eye too – but it wasn’t RNG. In fact we couldn’t really find anything RNG related from ExxonMobil’s website but it seems they are focusing on renewable diesel and hydrogen instead.

ExxonMobil just announced its majority-owned affiliate Imperial Oil Ltd. is moving forward with plans to produce renewable diesel at a new complex at its Strathcona refinery in Edmonton Canada. When construction is complete the refinery is expected to produce approximately 20000 barrels per day of renewable diesel which could reduce emissions in the Canadian transportation sector by about 3 million metric tons per year. The complex will utilize locally grown plant-based feedstock and hydrogen with carbon capture and storage (CCS) as part of the manufacturing process.

The renewable diesel production process will utilize blue hydrogen which is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage. Approximately 500000 metric tons of CO2 are expected to be captured each year utilizing CCS. The blue hydrogen and biofeedstock will be combined with a proprietary catalyst to produce premium low-carbon diesel fuel.

A final investment decision will be based on several factors including government support and approvals market conditions and economic competitiveness. Imperial will lead the project which is expected to create about 600 direct construction jobs. Renewable diesel production is anticipated to start in 2024.

The Strathcona renewable diesel project is part of ExxonMobil’s plans to provide more than 40000 barrels per day of low-emissions fuels by 2025. In the United States the company has agreed to purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel annually from Global Clean Energy to supply markets in California.

Reactions from the stakeholders

“ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions has made the broad commercialization of carbon capture and storage our initial focus and we are seeing increased momentum for projects that include hydrogen and biofuels – areas that we are uniquely suited to address and advance in combination with CCS” said Joe Blommaert president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “We strongly support an economy-wide price on carbon because it is the most efficient approach to changing behaviors and accelerating investments in low-emission technology. However Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulation could be a model for other countries considering a sectoral approach. Technology-neutral lifecycle carbon-intensity based fuels policies like the one proposed in Canada can quickly bring projects like Strathcona to scale and rapidly reduce emissions at a low cost to society.”

“Canada’s proposed low-carbon fuel policies incentivize the development of lower-emission fuels that can make meaningful contributions to the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy including transportation” said Ian Carr president of ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Company. “The Strathcona project is an example of how well-designed policies allow us to leverage our existing global facilities for capital efficiency utilize our proprietary catalyst technology and bring our decades of processing experience to develop low-emission fuels.”

Bottom Line

No matter how you look at it big oil companies are teaming up with biobased companies like Brightmark and CleanBay to support more sustainable fuels. Sure we’d like to see more action and more money from the big guys but something is better than nothing. Tackling both the huge animal waste issue that the U.S. has from all those chickens and cows while getting some RNG and renewable fuel out of it is a move in the right direction. We hope to see many more projects like this in the future being backed up by those that have the means and money to do so like the bp’s Chevron’s and ExxonMobil’s of the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9lbmVyZ3kvZXh4b24tcmVkdWNpbmctYmF0b24tcm91Z2UtbG91aXNpYW5hLXJlZmluZXJ5LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tc3Rvcm0tdGhyZWF0LXNvdXJjZXMtMjAyMS0wOC0yOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon reducing Baton Rouge Louisiana refinery production on storm threat -sources,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-reducing-baton-rouge-louisiana-refinery-production-storm-threat-sources-2021-08-28/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9lbmVyZ3kvZXh4b24tcmVkdWNpbmctYmF0b24tcm91Z2UtbG91aXNpYW5hLXJlZmluZXJ5LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tc3Rvcm0tdGhyZWF0LXNvdXJjZXMtMjAyMS0wOC0yOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BsYXNoMjQ3LmNvbS9ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby1vaWwtZmlybXMtc2h1dC1pbi05MS1vZi1vaWwtODUtb2YtZ2FzLWFoZWFkLW9mLWh1cnJpY2FuZS1pZGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gulf of Mexico oil firms shut in 91% of oil 85% of gas ahead of Hurricane Ida - Splash247,"Hurricane Ida – upgraded from Tropical Storm Ida since Friday – became a Category 4 storm on Sunday morning with sustained winds of 150 mph according to the US National Hurricane Center. Expected to hit the Louisiana coast on Sunday afternoon the Center said the storm is “extremely dangerous.” Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng called the storm “unsurvivable” for residents in low-lying areas.

According to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) as of 11:30 am CDT on Saturday personnel had been evacuated from 279 production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico almost 50% of the 560 manned platforms in those waters. Crews had also been evacuated from all 11 non-dynamically positioned rigs operating in the Gulf. Of the 15 dynamically positioned rigs in the Gulf 11 had been moved out of the storm’s projected path. Crews have remained on board and will return the rigs to their drilling locations once the storm has passed.

From operator reports the BSEE estimated that 91% of current oil production and 85% of gas production in the Gulf has been shut in.

After the storm all facilities will be inspected. Production from undamaged facilities will be brought back online immediately but facilities that sustain damage will take longer to resume production.

According to Reuters ExxonMobil cut production at its Baton Rouge Louisiana refinery to 50% of its 520000-bpd capacity ahead of the storm and shut in one of the two 110000-bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic crackers at the refinery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9leHhvbi1kZWxheXMtZGVjaXNpb24tb24tZHJpbGxpbmctZm9yLXNlY29uZC1rYWlldGV1ci1ibG9jay13ZWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon delays decision on drilling for second Kaieteur block well,"ExxonMobil Corporation has delayed a drilling decision for a second well in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana in order to do additional data analysis.

This was disclosed by Westmount Energy Limited last Monday.

Westmount cited Ratio Petroleum which owns a 25% stake in the offshore block as saying that the date for elective nomination of the prospect target has been extended by seven months to March 22 2022.

Westmount noted that the original Kaieteur second well prospect nomination date was August 22 2021 with any drilling consequent to this decision to start within nine months of the nomination date.

Last year Exxon the operator made a non-commercial oil discovery at the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur block failing to replicate a string of successes made in the nearby Stabroek offshore block where it has so far found more than nine billion barrels of oil.

The Tanager-1 exploration well drilled by the Stena Carron Drillship was the deepest well drilled in the Guyana-Suriname Basin to date. It was spudded on August 11 2020 eventually reaching a total depth of 7633 meters.

Westmount said that the Kaieteur Block partners agreed to the decision to delay the nomination date “to facilitate continuing analysis by the operator and integration of extensive multi-play drilling results and comprehensive data collection programs into regional petroleum system models and the prospect nomination decision.”

Following the Tanager-1 discovery Hess increased its working interest in the Kaieteur Block from 15% to 20% by acquiring a 5% working interest from Cataleya Energy Limited (CEL). The Kaieteur Block is currently operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso Production & Exploration Guyana Limited (35%). Westmount holds approximately 5.4% of the issued share capital of Cataleya Energy Corporation the parent company of CEL and around 0.7% of the issued share capital of Ratio Petroleum Energy Limited Partnership the ultimate holding entity with respect to RGL.",,,

At that point it was clear that Reed was no longer his target. Even with two straight birdies he wouldn't be able to clear the 1380 hurdle.

Amidst the waves of noise from the boisterous galleries on every hole and playing alongside the imposing thundering force that is Bryson DeChambeau an unhurried and unflappable Cantlay finally put an end to an instant classic at the BMW Championship by making a 17-footer for birdie on the sixth playoff hole at Caves Valley Golf Club to topple DeChambeau.

His back against the proverbial wall including on the final three holes of regulation the first three holes of a playoff and then on the fifth extra hole after DeChambeau hit first and knocked his wedge from 186 yards to 6 feet on the par-3 17th Cantlay came up clutch every time.

BMW Championship: Leaderboard | Prize money | Winner’s bag

After making putts for par on the 16th from 9 feet and for bogey on the 17th from 8 feet Cantlay rolled in a 21-footer for birdie on the 72nd hole to force a playoff. After surviving three DeChambeau putts to end the playoff the first three holes Cantlay followed DeChambeau’s brilliant tee shot on the fifth extra hole with a shot to inside three feet and both made birdie.

On the final hole both found the fairway and Cantlay won the second FedEx Cup Playoffs event and his fifth PGA Tour title with his day-ending putt on the sixth extra hole in the fading light.

“I felt like I tried to stay in my own little world” Cantlay said. “I’m just as focused as I can be. If I look the way I do it’s because I am locked in and focused and I felt like that today. My game feels really good. It has for a while now since Memorial and I’m finally starting to putt like me again.”

Cantlay gained 14.58 strokes on the field with his putting the most strokes gained putting in a 72-hole event since tracking began on the PGA Tour in 2004. And he became the only player to win three times during the PGA Tour’s super season adding to his victory in the 2020 Zozo Championship and the Memorial.

Both finished regulation at 27 under – Cantlay with rounds of 66-63-66-66 DeChambeau with rounds of 68-60-67-66. Cantlay made 31 birdies for the week while DeChambeau made 27 birdies and four eagles.

Conditions were so ripe for scoring all week that all 69 players in the field finished under par the first time that’s happened in the history of the FedEx Cup Playoffs.

Because of the staggered scoring format used in the upcoming week’s Tour Championship the playoffs finale Cantlay will have a two-shot lead to start the first round at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.

And Cantlay also secured a playing spot on the U.S. Ryder Cup team. His win made him the sixth automatic selection as qualifying came to an end and he joined Collin Morikawa Dustin Johnson Brooks Koepka DeChambeau and Justin Thomas. Captain Steve Stricker will make six discretionary picks to fill out the team after The Tour Championship.

DeChambeau who was a 6-foot putt shy of shooting 59 in the second round could have won on the 72nd hole but missed from 12 feet. He had chances to win on the first three playoff holes but missed from 17 6 and 18 feet.

DeChambeau trying to win his ninth title and third of the season declined to be interviewed after the playoff.

Sungjae Im came home with a 67 to finish third at 23 under.

Rory McIlroy closed with a 67 to finish fourth at 22 under.

Erik Van Rooyen shot 65 to finish fifth. By making birdies on two of his final three holes Van Rooyen jumped from 45th to 27th in the FedEx Cup standings which as one of the top 30 gets him to East Lake in Atlanta for The Tour Championship the playoffs finale.

Sergio Garcia was the only other player to jump into the top 30 going from 44th to 28th with a final round 69 that left him in a tie for sixth with Dustin Johnson.

Charley Hoffman and Max Homa were the two players that fell out of the top 30.

Outdriven all day – DeChambeau hit 48 drives over 320 yards for the week – Cantlay stuck to his own blueprint stayed in his own quiet world and unleashed his own style of fireworks in toppling his playing partner in a playoff.

Cantlay isn’t exactly short – he is one of the game longest straightest drivers – but his putter was almost magical. He made more than 537 feet of putts this week. He switched to a Scotty Cameron Phantom X5 he got at the Wells Fargo.

“Finally have one that feels absolutely perfect” Cantlay said.

He could use the description for his demeanor too.

“I’m as focused as I can be on every single shot and I try not to let my mind get past the moment that I’m in and maybe that’s why I come across a little sedated out there” Cantlay said. “But I’m locked in and I’m as focused as I can be. Then I kind of let the chips fall where they do. Try not to get caught up in being out-driven 45 yards or whatever it is. I just try and lock in and do my absolute best in that moment and my best is pretty good.

“I’m a little tired but very happy. I played really well all week. At the beginning of the week I didn’t realize it would take that many under par to just force a playoff. But I hit a lot of good shots today and it was just enough.”"

The disengagement letter came a few weeks after they were invited for “training” and it was followed by their ex-gratia — a sum of N200000 irrespective of years of service.

In July some employees of the b ank woke up to a letter announcing their selection for training. However upon attending the training they returned home with the news that they no longer had a job.

According to the email received by each of the laid-off staff they were to attend a training on the date specified at a location based on the region of their workplace. Workers in the South West attended the regional training in Lagos while others attended in places such as Abuja and Kano.

“None of us knew what the training was about. But since it was from the bank we attended and were taught how to become POS operators. I attended the training at Lagos Chamber of Commerce Ikeja.” Tola (not real name) one of the retrenched told FIJ.

After the training participants were addressed by Akeem Odion Head of Operation Fidelity Union Securities Ltd (FUSL) who told them that they no longer had jobs with the bank. He promised that the bank would pay them some sort of remuneration but said he had no idea how much.

Another of the dismissed employees Patricia (not real name) explained that she had to travel with pregnancy enduring the discomfort only to reach the training and be told verbally that they had been sacked.

“People from different branches attended the training as specified in the mail. I travelled to Lagos from Ado-Ekiti with a three-month pregnancy only to be told during the training that I no longer had a job. Why didn’t they send an e-mail? Sending the mail directly would have saved us a lot of trouble” she said.

Following the verbal announcement emails notifying them of their disengagement followed a few days after. However the email left a bitter taste in the mouth of the employees as it stated they would be paid an ex-gratia rather than a severance pay as many of the employees expected.

“Rather than tell us directly that we had been sacked they organised a training to teach us to become independent POS operators who will still make money for the bank even when they sack us” Idowu (not real name said).

“We know we cannot work for Fidelity forever but all we want is to be paid our entitlement. I cannot put in 10 years and 9 months only to be given that amount.”

All retrenched employees received an ex-gratia amounting to an average of N200000 irrespective of their years of service. Tola (not real name) explained that he had given a good part of his life to the bank and therefore deserved a good severance package and not an ex-gratia.

Tola was employed in 2007 by Fidelity as a Fidelity Union Securities Ltd (FUSL) staff member with an Ordinary National Diploma (OND). Although promises were made that he and many other note counters would be made full staff if they pursued and tendered their Higher National Diploma (HND) or undergraduate egrees they went unfulfilled.

Tola is not the only FUSL employee who has been with Fidelity for that long. According to him several others spent up to 10 years more than 10 years and even 23 years. All of them were laid off with only N200000 as compensation.

All efforts by the retrenched staff to see to it that a worthy compensation that matches their contributions to the bank is paid has been futile.

“This is not the first time that Fidelity Bank is doing this. In 2017 when the drivers were in our position they protested and argued” Tola said. ” It was later decided that they would be paid N100000 per year for each year that they worked in the bank. We deserve the same if not more.”

In 2017 reported that about 50 drivers who were sacked barricaded the bank’s headquarters on a Monday morning over the non-payment of their severance packages.

Also in 2018 drivers of the bank held a protest over the non-payment of their entitlements.

When FIJ contacted Akeem Odion Head of Operations FSL he said he could not make any comment on the phone. He requested that the reporter come down to his office for answers to questions asked.

Sheikh Muhammed Secretary National Union of Banks Insurance and Financial Institution Employees (NUBIFIE) an affiliate organisation of the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) told FIJ on Friday that the organization had been made aware of the ongoing disagreement and it was working.

“I have received the report and I have instructed that they collect all the grievances so that we can initiate a discussion with the management. We are working on it” Sheikh said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In just over 10 years Roush Fenway Racing’s partnership with Fifth Third Bank N.A. has grown to become one of the strongest in the sport. As that partnership enters its second decade the team and the industry-leading bank are proud to announce a multiyear renewal that will see Fifth Third continue to serve as a primary partner on Roush Fenway’s No. 17 Ford Mustang.

It has been a little over a decade since Roush Fenway Racing “teased” the media with news of a “new number” for NASCAR champion and then No. 17 driver Matt Kenseth. The new number was that of Fifth Third joining the team. The bank initially joined the team in 2012 as a primary partner with Matt Kenseth. A season later they paired with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. in a relationship that would encompass seven seasons and included a pair of wins. Chris Buescher has wheeled the Fifth Third machine the last two seasons.

“For the past 10 years Fifth Third Bank has been a true partner to Roush Fenway Racing” said team president Steve Newmark. “On and off the track they have been there in full support of our efforts – both as our official bank helping guide our financial path and as a primary on the No. 17 Ford. The relationship with Fifth Third has grown into one of the strongest partnerships in NASCAR and we‘re privileged to announce this a multi-year renewal that will ensure Fifth Third will remain as part of the Roush Fenway family and a key supporter of our sport for years to come.”

The Fifth Third Ford went to victory lane in May of 2017 when Stenhouse won at Talladega and just two months later he won again at Daytona. With Chris Buescher at the wheel the Fifth Third Ford has earned a pair of top-10s at Darlington and Charlotte earlier this season.

“We couldn’t be prouder of our partnership with Roush Fenway Racing and are pleased to extend our relationship with this iconic team for up to another five years” said Lee Fite president of Fifth Third Bank’s Mid-Atlantic region. “Roush continues to outperform and overdeliver on their commitments to Fifth Third yielding a best-in-class ROI on our sponsorship.”

Since 2012 Roush has served as the anchor for Fifth Third Bank’s motorsports practice which today also includes premier teams in IndyCar with Rahal Letterman Lanigan and in NHRA with Kalitta Motorsports. Through these partnerships Fifth Third has become the de facto bank for race teams tracks suppliers other racing industry stakeholders and racing fans.

Buescher is in his sixth full season in the NASCAR Cup Series. Through the first half of the season he totaled four top 10 finishes and powered the No. 17 into playoff contention with a career high in laps led through the spring. In 2022 he will enter his seventh Cup season and his third with Roush Fenway.

Since joining the fold in 2012 Fifth Third has two wins 13 top-10s and five top- five’s in more than 50 starts in the NCS. Three drivers have driven the No. 17 in the ten seasons that Fifth Third has been a primary partner.

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. – Continuing on a decade of partnership Fifth Third Bank has renewed its partnership with Roush Fenway Racing with Chris Buescher to continue driving duties behind the wheel of the No. 17 Ford Mustang.

The partnership began in 2012 when Matt Kenseth was the driver and has continued with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and now Buescher. The ongoing relationship put the bank in front of millions of racing fans and now sees a new era at Roush Fenway Racing signing a five-year extension just as Brad Keselowski comes on board as one of the team owners.

“We couldn’t be prouder of our partnership with Roush Fenway Racing and are pleased to extend our relationship with this iconic team for up to another five years” said Lee Fite president of Fifth Third Bank’s Mid-Atlantic region. “Roush continues to outperform and overdeliver on their commitments to Fifth Third yielding a best-in-class ROI on our sponsorship.”

Team President Steve Neumark said Fifth Third has become partner with the team on and off the track – not only with their logo on the car but also from a financial aspect.

“The relationship with Fifth Third has grown into one of the strongest partnerships in NASCAR and we’re privileged to announce this a multi-year renewal that will ensure Fifth Third will remain as part of the Roush Fenway family and a key supporter of our sport for years to come” Neumark said.

However the official results show that he finished 40th. The reason is that NASCAR disqualified him after the No. 17 failed post-race inspection.

The sanctioning body issued a press release after the race noting that the Buescher’s stock car did not conform to the drawing in the NASCAR rule specifications regarding the track bar mounting assembly. Instead of walking away with his first top-five run of the season Buescher ended the day behind every other driver in the field.

With the scoring adjustment Bubba Wallace moved up to second and added another runner-up at Daytona International Speedway to his resume. Buescher’s teammate Ryan Newman moved from fourth to third and marked his best finish since taking fifth in the dirt race at Bristol Motor Speedway on March 29.

The Disqualification Disrupted a Big Day for RFR

The No. 17 team entered the regular-season finale on a mission to win and lock up the final spot in the playoffs and they appeared within reach of accomplishing this goal. Buescher led eight laps and fought with Ryan Blaney for the win during the final race to the caution flag that ended the race. He also did so with a longtime supporter on the stock car.

RFR announced prior to the Aug. 28 race that Fifth Third Bank had agreed to an extension that will keep the company around for years to come. The sponsor that first became a primary for Matt Kenseth back in 2012 will return for 2022 and beyond as a primary for Buescher and RFR.

Now in his sixth full-time season Buescher put Fifth Third Bank in the spotlight during one of the biggest races on the schedule. He brought extra attention to the sponsor at The World Center of Racing and created the belief that he could deliver a stunning win and reach the playoffs completely shaking up the bottom of the playoff picture. Once the race came to an end the situation completely changed.

The Season Now Continues With the 4-Round Playoffs

With the regular-season finale complete the top 16 drivers in the standings will continue to pursue wins and the coveted spots in the championship four. Richard Childress Racing’s Tyler Reddick took the final available spot after recovering from significant damage to the No. 8 Chevrolet and finishing in the top five due to Buescher’s disqualification.

The playoffs will begin on Sunday Sept. 5 at Darlington Raceway. The Round of 16 will continue at Richmond Raceway on Sept. 11 and then end at Bristol Motor Speedway on Sept. 18. The field will drop to 12 drivers for races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Sept. 26) Talladega Superspeedway (Oct. 3) and the Charlotte Roval (Oct. 10).

Following the Round of 12 the field will drop to eight drivers for the final set of cutoff races. They will Texas Motor Speedway on Oct. 17 Kansas Speedway on Oct. 24 and Martinsville Speedway on Oct. 31 to set up one final showdown between the top four drivers. The championship race will take place on Sunday Nov. 7 at Phoenix Raceway determining the 2021 Cup Series champion.

Buescher and the other drivers below the cut line will not be eligible to compete in the playoffs during this final portion of the schedule. However they will continue to suit up each week and fight for points to determine their final standing at the end of 2021.

Just 33 hours later on August 10 the joint ESA/JAXA BepiColombo spacecraft flew by the planet coming within 552 km of the surface.

The historic double flyby was a result of the two spacecraft attempting to reduce their orbital energy while en route to their respective destinations. BepiColombo is traveling to Mercury where it will study the planet in-depth while Solar Orbiter is finishing its last flybys before entering the correct orbital inclination to best observe the Sun.

The double flybys required great accuracy and precise deep-space network coordination to ensure the two trajectories did not cross. During the flyby both BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter collected data on Earth’s sister planet.

Venusian imagery

Both Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo are equipped with cameras; however they are not high-resolution. Nonetheless their science cameras were able to capture black-and-white images — showing the planet’s immense brightness and full cloud coverage.

Solar Orbiter’s SoloHI imager used primarily to image the solar wind or the charged particle streams ejected from the surface of the Sun was used on the Venus flyby to observe the nightside of the planet during the approach.

BepiColombo like Solar Orbiter used a suite of three science cameras to collect imagery of the planet as well. The spacecraft collected images throughout the entire flyby.

The full set of BepiColombo images from the flyby can be found in ESA’s Planetary Science Archive.

BepiColombo feels Venus’ heat

Venus is the solar system’s hottest planet and it was expected that when BepiColombo came within 552 km of the surface on the dayside of the planet it would experience a temperature increase on its instruments and systems.

JAXA’s contribution to the BepiColombo mission the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) recorded a temperature increase of 110ºC on one of the module’s eight solar panels. The panel’s temperature changed from -100ºC to a +10ºC at the time of closest approach.

However inside the spacecraft the temperature only increased 2-3ºC proving that the spacecraft’s insulation is effective.

On ESA’s Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) the temperature increased by 50ºC on an onboard radiator. The Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) recorded a temperature change of about 20ºC.

Strong Venusian gravity

To stay pointing on course both BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter use reaction wheels to maintain their orientation. These wheels spin faster at times when the spacecraft is experiencing periods of intense gravitational pull like they did during the Venus flyby.

The Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA) instrument on the MPO module of BepiColombo collected data on the spacecraft’s acceleration with great sensitivity.

Using data from the angular momentum of the reaction wheels during the flyby the BepiColombo ISA instrument team translated the acceleration data into a frequency audible to the human ear.

Additionally the ISA was able to detect the effects of tidal forces on BepiColombo from Venus. This marked the first time an accelerometer recorded the effects of tidal forces on a spacecraft at another planet.

The BepiColombo and ISA teams will use this data to fine-tune the instrument ahead of its use at Mercury.

Comparing magnetometer data

During their respective flybys both spacecraft collected data on Venus using their magnetometers. This provided the Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo teams the unique ability to compare data between the two spacecraft. Specifically the ability to compare solar wind interaction with Venus’ atmosphere.

The BepiColombo team took the data from the MPO magnetometer and created a simple sonification of the variability of the magnetic field. The audio from the sonification presents low-frequency wind-like noises from the solar wind’s interaction with the Venusian atmosphere.

BepiColombo’s transition into calm solar wind at the bow shock the location where a planet’s magnetosphere meets the solar wind was clearly recorded.

The Solar Orbiter magnetometer data was similar to that of BepiColombo’s showing the magnetic field was increasing in magnitude during approach due to the compression of the magnetic field. As the spacecraft crossed the bow shock the magnitude sharply decreased.

Teams from both of the missions are currently undertaking a detailed analysis of the two datasets from the flyby.

Ions in the magnetosphere

Sensors on BepiColombo’s MPO and MMO modules monitored ions circulating in the Venusian magnetosphere. The Search for Exospheric Refilling and Emitted Natural Abundances (SERENA) and Planetary Ion Camera (PICAM) instruments on the MPO module measured a peak in hydrogen ion density during BepiColombo’s closest approach to Venus (552 km).

With an encounter this close the MPO module’s MErcury Radiometer and Thermal infrared Imaging Spectrometer (MERTIS) instrument could capture atmospheric spectra of Venus while the planet filled its field of view.

This kind of high-resolution spectra data had not been obtained since the Soviet Union’s Venera 15 mission in the early 1980s.

A snapshot from @bepicolombo #VenusFlyby captured only a few hours ago! This image was taken 6 minutes after closest approach from a distance of 1573 km. More images will be sent back overnight – #StayTuned! #ExploreFarther https://t.co/gpg2iaUXIk pic.twitter.com/s6OzWH3Nbp — ESA Science (@esascience) August 10 2021

From the data an expected band of carbon dioxide and other spectral features was seen. A full analysis of the data and the atmosphere’s thermal structure will take weeks to complete.

Like the ISA the use of MERTIS at Venus helped fine-tune the instrument before its use at Mercury where it will perform the first-ever thermal infrared observations of the planet by a spacecraft.

BepiColombo is expected to perform its first of six flybys of Mercury on October 1 2021. In 2025 BepiColombo will release the two planetary orbiters it is carrying into Mercury’s orbit where they will study all aspects of the solar system’s smallest planet.

Solar Orbiter is currently expected to complete its final flyby of Earth on November 27 where it will pass just 460 km above the surface. After the flyby the spacecraft will be in the correct orbital inclination to study the Sun and Solar Orbiter’s primary mission will begin.

It will continue to perform flybys of Venus for the duration of its mission to increase its orbital inclination for optimal observation of the Sun’s unknown polar regions.

Tracks such as “Stoned at the Nail Salon” for example feature backing vocals from no less that Phoebe Bridgers and Clairo while “Secrets From a Girl (Who’s Seen It All)” includes spoken word from Robyn.

The latter cameo isn’t completely unsurprising given Lorde’s well-documented admiration for Robyn. While working on Melodrama in 2016 she emerged to perform a haunting version of the pop icon’s “Hang With Me” and has gone on record citing “Dancing On My Own” as a “perfect” track.

“Secrets From a Girl” meanwhile casts Robyn as an air hostess for “Strange Airlines”. “Welcome to sadness” she says. “The temperature is unbearable until you face it / Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines / I will be your tour guide today.”

“Solar Power” becomes the 923rd No.1 Album in Australia (1965 to 2021) the 773rd No.1 on the ARIA Album Charts (1983 to 2021) the 559th to debut at No.1 the 23rd chart-topping album for 2021 and the first for ‘Universal’ (direct) this decade with their last being the ‘Fifty Shades Darker’ soundtrack on February 20th 2017 plus their fifteenth overall since their first in 1998 for Aqua.

Lorde previously topped the ARIA Album Charts with her first two releases “Pure Heroine” (1 week on October 7th 2013) and then “Melodrama” (1 week on June 26th 2017) meaning it’s been just over four years since her last album was released. Lorde’s tally of three weeks at No.1 from three albums mirrors that of other acts in Prince You Am I Bliss N’ Eso Arctic Monkeys Tool Paul Kelly The Weeknd and The Killers placing them all at equal 159th on the listing for ‘Accumulated Weeks at No.1: Albums (1965 to 2021)’

This is the first time that the word ‘Solar’ has appeared in a No.1 Album title while it’s the third ‘Power’ at the top after Vanessa Amorosi with “The Power” (1 week on April 10th 2000) and the last was AC/DC’s “Power Up” (4 weeks from Nov. 23rd 2020). The album has also landed her a third No.1 Album in New Zealand this week while the set has so far debuted at No.2 in England and Scotland No.3 in The Netherlands and at No.4 in both Ireland and Germany.

The new No.1 Album for Lorde is now the twelfth chart-topping album by a New Zealand act with Lorde’s last album in June 2017 being the last time a NZ’er was at the top in Australia. Of the four New Zealand acts to have hit the top in Australia Lorde now equals the three No.1 Albums achieved by Split Enz in the 1980’s (1980 ’81 and ’82) while the leader with five is the rebirth of the ‘Enz in Crowded House (1987 ’88 ‘ 96 2007 and 2010) plus the lead singer in both of those acts Neil Finn has logged one solo album in 1998. For Solo Female Artists (local or overseas) this is the 146th No.1 Album and the ninth for 2021 while Lorde is still the only NZ Female Solo Artist to have topped our charts. The new album has also landed three Top 100 entries so far this week’s new entry at No.29 “Mood Ring” the albums first single and title track “Solar Power” (HP-14 TW-39) and second issued track “Stoned at the Nail Salon” (HP-74 August 2nd 2021).

On hold at No.2 and No.3 are “SOUR” for Olivia Rodrigo and “Planet Her” for Doja Cat (a sixth week at it’s peak of No.3) respectively with “SOUR” returning to No.1 in England this week (fifth overall week there) with the fourth and fifth female singers within the Top 10 being Billie Eilish and “Happier Than Ever” (4 to No.5 No.1 in America for a third week) and “Future Nostalgia” for Dua Lipa (7 to No.8) with Lorde Olivia Doja and Billie holding the top four spots on the New Zealand Albums chart this week.

Australian act Holy Holy see their fourth studio album “Hello My Beautiful World” debut at No.4 this week becoming their fourth Top 15 entry second Top 10 and now highest charted set as their second album “Paint” made it to No.7 in March of 2017. Down one spot to No.6 is Kid Laroi with his “F**k Love” sets with the album regaining the No.1 spot in Canada this past week thanks to his U.S. Canadian and Oz No.1 single “Stay” holding the top spots. The third and final Australian act within the Top 10 this week is the new entry at No.7 for Melbourne group Tropical F**k Storm” and third third album “Deep States” which becomes their third chart entry and now second Top 10 placed set as their second album “Braindrops” made it to No.10 in early September of 2019. And as the group has three female members within it’s four-member ranks they become the sixth and final female act within the Top 10 this week.

U.S. rapper and singer Trippie Redd sees his fourth studio album “Trip at Knight” debut at No.9 this week becoming his first Top 10 album in Australia as he has previously charted with his first three albums and two mixtapes making this his sixth overall Albums Chart entry with his previous highest charted album being his first release “Life’s a Trip” (HP-14 August 2018).

Activist Commentary: ValueAct has been a premiere governance-oriented investor for 20 years and since 2017 has been helmed by Mason Morfit as chief investment officer. ValueAct has broadened the activist playbook a little under Morfit but it continues to be a premier governance-oriented investor with its partners on the boards of approximately half of the firm's core portfolio positions.

This investment in Fiserv is right in ValueAct's sweet spot – a technology company with good management products and relationships that are somewhat misunderstood by the market. Some of ValueAct's most profitable investments were in other misunderstood technology businesses like Microsoft Seagate and Adobe. For example both Microsoft and Seagate were viewed as PC companies when they were really Cloud companies. The market now views Fiserv as an old legacy technology company when it is really a new world company.

Even as a legacy technology business Fiserv is a good company growing at approximately 8% per year. But Fiserv is transforming itself well before being disrupted by smaller competitors and it has the relationships to scale their technology with their deeply integrated clients. A perfect example of this is Clover the company's smart POS terminal. Clover came out a few years after Square but Clover's business is already bigger with the amount of payments it is processing and growing faster than Square. Clover could be valued today at $30 billion to $45 billion including debt on a standalone basis and could be worth $185 billion by 2024.

But Clover is just one opportunity to transform. The key here is that management is embracing this transformation strategy and could find other organic and strategic opportunities to further it. If the company fully embraces its evolution it should be able to achieve an annual growth rate of at least 15%. This transformation can increase the company's lifetime value of its products by 60%.

In order to get there there are three main areas for the company to focus on. First investing to drive this growth rate up. Second growing through acquiring and integrating a few other businesses that are like Clover. And third simplifying its strategy and how it communicates with the market. The market needs to better understand the company and its opportunities.

Right now FISV trades at a discount to the average S&P 500 company even though its growth rate is higher than the average S&P 500 company without giving credit for additional growth from Clover. ValueAct can be very helpful in assisting management in achieving this transformation just like they did at Microsoft Adobe and Seagate. As history has shown they will be at least an engaged and supportive shareholder and if need be will provide value as a director to create value for shareholders. They will certainly continue to engage with the company on a supportive basis as they get to know each other better and if they do end up taking a board seat it will likely be on an amicable basis to support management.

This will be his fourth coaching job since retiring from the league. During the recent Mavericks media day he also spoke about Giannis Antetokounmpo and his new book.

Reigning finals MVP Giannis had a book written about him; ‘Gianniѕ: The Improbable Riѕe of an NBA MVP’ written by Mirin Fader covers the life of the two-time MVP. However Kidd made it clear that he has no intention of reading the book.

Jason Kidd waiting for Giannis Antetokounmpo to write his own book

Even though Kidd has refused to read the book about Giannis’ life it does not mean that the relationship between the two has gone sour. In fact it’s the exact opposite; Kidd is waiting for the Greek Freak to write his own biography and unless that happens Kidd will not pay attention to any such literature.

Speaking to media about the same he said “There are no feelings about it because it was not Giannis’ book. The cool thing is my relationship with Giannis goes beyond basketball.

“I talked to him a couple of hours after his son was born. Cool little name ‘Maverick.’ See you guys didn’t know that. That’s how close we are.”

The book has not been kind to Jason Kidd as it includes his time as the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. The book says that his ways of training were like ‘psychological warfare’. But Kidd told the media that many players who spoke to him said the author “didn’t come across the right way.”

The Milwaukee Bucks hired Jason Kidd as a head coach in 2014 one year after Antetokounmpo came into the league in 2013. Hence their relationship goes a long way back.

Kidd was Giannis’ second coach in his NBA career. After winning his first championship Giannis even praised Jason Kidd for pushing him when he was a young player in the league.

Fred Jones an orphan raised by his aunt in Tennessee stepped off a train in downtown Oklahoma City in 1916 and quickly got a job at the new assembly plant west of downtown. Four years later he joined the ownership of a Ford dealership in Blackwell and started the family business that is now run by his three grandsons Fred Boots and Kirk Hall.

Over the ensuing decades Jones opened dealerships across the state and while those dealerships were later sold by his grandsons the firm still has 50% of its holdings in automotive operations with plants in China Portugal Poland and the United States.

That 100-year legacy was marked this week with a statue of Jones unveiled Wednesday at the assembly plant that is now the 21c Museum Hotel the heart of a sprawling mixed-use development that also consists of a music hall restaurants shops and apartments.

Fred Hall CEO of Hall Capital kept manufacturing operations at the plant for years while rebuffering numerous purchase offers by developers who envisioned the landmark being turned into housing or offices.

“As a company that buys and sells there are a few gems that we keep forever” Hall said. “My grandfather said that this was our Camelot that we should buy the building from Ford. And that building will be in our family forever. “

The Model T assembly plant that drew Fred Jones to stay in Oklahoma City was one of 24 regional assembly plants designed and built between 1910 and 1915 to accommodate what was then an unprecedented expansion of the Ford Motor Co.’s assembly process across the country.

The company itself was just hitting its stride having started out with production of the Model A in 1903 followed by the roll-out of the model T in 1909. Henry Ford constantly looking to increase production efficiency and make cars affordable to the masses.

Two dozen cities were chosen to become regional assembly plants that would receive “kits” of car parts by train that would then be assembled and painted for distribution throughout the region.

Jones is listed as the first person to “punch the clock” at the plant when it opened. After joining the ownership at the Blackwell dealership he added a second in Tonkawa sold both in 1922 and opened his first dealership in Oklahoma City that same year.

Historian Bob Blackburn researched the family’s history while writing “Here We Go!” a history of Fred Jones and Hall Capital. The book co-written by Mayor David Holt also director of investor relations at Hall Capital details Jones traveling the country taking on jobs ranging from construction to working in an automotive parts department.

Jones was working as a salesman for a cutlery company when he stopped in Oklahoma City to visit his cousins.

“When he came here in 1916 Oklahoma City was like a rambunctious teenager” Blackburn said. “Raging hormones. It was one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. And the oil industry added to that.”

Jones applied for a job at the plant but was rebuffed by the hiring manager who saw a 24-year-old not substantial enough to work in an assembly plant Blackburn said.

Jones didn’t shy away from pushing to be hired telling the manager “If I can’t do more work than any of these other guys do in a day give me a week and if it doesn’t work you can get rid of me without paying me a penny.”

By 1926 at the age of 34 Fred Jones was the largest Ford dealer in the southwest. He also became a pioneer in the remanufacturing of auto parts and an early supporter of the local aerospace industry.

Blackburn said Jones and his wife Mary Eddy emerged as civic leaders in Oklahoma City with Fred Jones serving as chairman of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber and helping to secure Tinker Air Force Base and Mary Eddy Jones becoming a leading arts patron.

Jones was a family man Blackburn said and encouraged employees to keep them as a priority in their lives. The Jones family was hit with tragedy in 1950 when Fred Jones Jr. a war veteran and student at the University of Oklahoma died with two friends when their plane crashed in Arkansas while flying to Florida.

Jones was 79 when he died in 1971. His Fred Jones Manufacturing Company based at the historic 1916 plant had grown into the largest of 29 authorized Ford remanufacturing companies in the country.

The next generation

Starting the 1980s Mary Eddy Jones and daughter Marylin guided the three grandsons in taking over operations. Under their leadership and with Fred as CEO the company increased overall sales from $200 million to $1 billion and their employee count to over 9500.

Between 1998 and 2000 the company sold the car dealerships but remained involved in the automobile business with it accounting for 50% of its investment.

“We have three automotive firms” Fred Hall said. “We have the old Fred Jones companies that still distribute Ford and Chrysler parts. We have JAC Products which builds most of the rooftop racks in the world for SUVs — a 70 percent share. And we have Modineer which makes auto parts for vehicle body sides.”

Hall Capital has commercial real estate holdings in Oklahoma Tennessee Florida Texas Alabama and South Carolina. Their more visible local holdings include East Wharf a mix of offices and restaurants along the east shore of Lake Hefner and West Village a mix of restaurants apartments and shops built around the 1916 assembly plant.

That plant meanwhile is home to the 21c Museum Hotel and its curated art gallery that is open 24 hours a day seven days a week. The hotel’s restaurant is named “Mary Eddy’s” in tribute to the family matriarch.

The Hall family also longtime live music supporters are partners in the Jones Assembly home to an indoor/outdoor concert venue an upscale restaurant with a bar on both floors.

The diversity of the Hall interests represents the philosophy of the company founder Blackburn said.

“Fred always had a plan; be patient” Blackburn said. “In one interview I did with Fred (Hall) Ms. Eddy always told Fred have three pools of money in how you look at business. One take a risk. If you see an opportunity chase it and be ready to lose.”

That approach Blackburn said included Jones investing in golf carts and a motor hotel by the State Capital.

“Second was to invest in infrastructure you have now that will pay off in two to three years” Blackburn said. “You have to look at the next plateau you have to climb.”

The final part of the advice was to take care of the family.

Blackburn said the Hall brothers have stayed true to their grandfather’s approach to business and family and maintained their family’s contributions back to their community.

“At any time those guys could have sold their assets and lived comfort on the Riviera” Blackburn said. “They didn’t. They kept on investing finding opportunities to promote their community. A lot of capital venture groups spend others’ money. They put their own money in. And that’s how Fred Jones would have done it — he would never ask others to invest without putting his own money in first.”

But every now and again something that is decidedly vintage catches my eye as was the case with this funny little electric car that appears to be heavily inspired by the original Ford Model T. And fortunately for whatever random factory seems to be hawking this hot mess it tickled my fancy enough to land it a coveted spot as the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week!

This isn’t exactly the first vintage-styled electric car to hand-crank my starter.

I’ve stumbled upon other hidden EV gems such as a distinctly debonair British roadster and a quaint electric horseless carriage fit for Cinderella herself.

But none of those would have one of America’s most celebrated bigots Henry Ford rolling over in his grave more than this awesome little electric Model T knockoff.

It might not have the same giant wagon wheels or leak as much (or any) oil as the original but damn if it doesn’t have charm in spades.

Chugging along at its top speed of 30 km/h (19 mph) it’s only about half as fast as the original. It’s also rocking a third of the original’s motor power with just a modest 5 kW electric motor on its rear axle.

So horsepower for horsepower I’ll chalk that up as a win for the Chinese version here.

It doesn’t quite match the original Model T’s range as the imitation T only packs a 7.2 kWh battery that is sufficient for a claimed 100 km (62 mi) per charge. The good news is that it will do those miles without vibrating and shaking its occupants until the contents of their change purse are lost in the upholstery.

Those batteries are also lead acid instead of lithium-ion which I can only assume is a throwback to the former car’s era. The original Model T debuted just over a century ago and that lead acid battery technology is definitely period correct.

But even though this knockoff doesn’t exactly excite the senses with its power speed or range it makes up for it with class.

Check out that gold-plated (or more likely gold-painted) trim and classy convertible top. And take a gander at those big ol’ headlamps from back when the glass protected an actual oil flame. It even has the old-school folding windshield and a spare tire. You probably wouldn’t even need a jack to change a tire — just grab a fender and lift up one corner of the car.

I also love that slick-looking wooden dashboard and giant steering wheel which comes complete with power steering. This thing actually looks pretty darn well outfitted. I can’t speak to the quality of course. That sheet metal might be thinner than paper for all we know. But it definitely looks the part!

Surely these things are meant for novelty purposes like rental rides in the park or birthday parties. But that’s not how I’d use one.

Imagine the looks you’d get driving this car to the coffee shop — or picking up a few gallons of paint at Home Depot.

Anyone with money can have a fancy Ferrari or a lifted truck. Driving one of these bad boys around town takes a certain amount of spunk and a distinct lack of giving a flying flip what others think.

And as the sales page on Alibaba tells me it also takes $6300 smackeroonies. Fortunately the vendor only requires a minimum order of quantity of one unit.

Booking a $20000 shipping container though that’s going to be the trickier part…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi1mb3JkLW1hdmVyaWNrLXBpY2t1cC10cnVjay1tYXktcmVjZWl2ZS1vZmYtcm9hZC1hbmQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtdmFyaWFudHMtMTY4Mjc2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Ford Maverick Pickup Truck May Receive Off-Road and Performance Variants,"FWD

There is however an elephant in the room that Ford hasn’t addressed thus far. As you’re well aware the Maverick is manufactured in the Mexican plant where the Blue Oval also makes the Bronco Sport off-road crossover. In other words the pint-sized pickup truck may be improved for overlanding.

Ford Authority understands that the Timberline is under development as we speak with unique suspension tuning Pirelli Scorpion tires revised bumpers for better approach and departure angles and so forth. Maverick marketing manager Trevor Scott said that many people ask the Ford Motor Company about the ST and RS versions as well but he couldn’t give a clear answer to what’s on the horizon. The only thing he could tell the cited publication is that Ford “will continue to monitor that to see if there is an opportunity.”If you ask me the RS isn’t going to happen because Rallye Sport has always been reserved for go-faster hatchbacks and rally-bred automobiles not trucks. The ST nameplate seems more likely because it’s not as highly strung albeit I still believe that a pickup and Sports Technologies don’t go together.If the Ford Motor Company does make a case for a hotter version of the Escape- and Bronco Sport-based Maverick the 2.3-liter EcoBoost would be the perfect candidate for propulsion for it cranks out 350 horsepower and 350 pound-feet (475 Nm) of torque in the previous-gen Focus RS hot hatchback.For the 2022 model year the most powerful Maverick of them all is the 2.0-liter turbo with 250 horsepower and 277 pound-feet (376 Nm) on tap. Customers who prefer fuel economy can get the-only hybrid that flexes an EPA rating of approximately 40 miles per gallon (5.9 l/100 km) in the city.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbHRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2FsdGVybmF0ZS1lbmVyZ3ktZm9yZC1leHBlY3RhdGlvbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC10aGVuLWRpc2FwcG9pbnRtZW50L2FydGljbGVfMjQ1OGVhZWYtNTA2MS01ZDBiLTk3ZjMtMDZkZmI3M2UwMDc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ALTERNATE ENERGY: Ford — Expectation development then disappointment | Environment | fltimes.com,James Bobreski is a process control engineer in the power production for 43 years.

DG ECHO and the Canadian Government contributed to replenishing the DREF for this operation. On behalf of the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) the IFRC would like to extend gratitude to all for their generous contributions.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

Senegal experienced heavy rainfall during the rainy season of 2020 exceeding the average amounts usually experienced during that period. In early September 2020 all regions of Senegal recorded excess rainfall compared to the normal ranging from 100mm to 1900 mm depending on the geographic area. The regions of Dakar and Thiès recorded 800 mm of rainfall mainly in the suburbs and the department of Dakar as well as several departments of Thiès causing flooding and the displacement of more than 3300 people. The Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) teams conducted field assessments that revealed a critical situation for 16798 affected people (5879 men and 10919 women). Following the announcement of the Ministry of the Interior declaring the triggering of the ORSEC Plan disaster relief efforts were initiated by the state services local authorities and other actors including the Red Cross but the scale of the disaster far exceeded the resources mobilized.

Based on the needs and capacity of the SRCS to respond to the situation the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) through the Sahel Country Cluster Delegation launched a DREF Operation on 12 September 2020 for CHF 331410 to address the urgent needs of 8100 people or 900 households most affected by the floods in the following targeted regions: Dakar region (departments of Dakar Guediawaye Pikine and Rufisque) and Thies Region ( department of Dakar). The operation was initially to take four months. However in January 2021 the National Society requested a two-month no cost timeframe extension which was granted. This was as a result of the implementation of cash related activities which was delayed due to the delay in signing the agreement with the Financial Service Provider (FSP). Additional information is available in the DREF Operation Update.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LINDA MCMAHON TAKES DIG AT BIG TECH OVER CENSORSHIP: PEOPLE COME TO OUR COUNTRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH

On Wednesday Argonne unveiled Polaris a testbed supercomputer made up of 280 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Apollo Gen10 Plus systems and powered by 2240 of NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units and 560 of AMD's second- and third-generation EPYC processors.

Polaris is expected to deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical artificial intelligence performance up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers. (A single exaflop is equal to one ""quintillion"" calculations per second or 1000 petaflops. A single petaflop is equal to one ""quadrillion"" calculations per second.)

The machine will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications that will be used by Intel's $500 million Aurora supercomputer for a range of scientific projects from advancing cancer treatments and the nation’s energy security to expanding the boundaries of physics with particle collision research.

""Polaris is well equipped to help move the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility] into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users"" ALCF director Michael Papka said in a statement.

Polaris which was delivered and installed in August will go into use starting in early 2022 before opening to the broader high performance computing community in the spring of 2022.

A spokesperson for Argonne National Laboratory confirmed to FOX Business that the Aurora system will be faster than Polaris providing greater than 1 exaFLOP of double precision peak performance. Aurora was originally supposed to be delivered in 2021 but has been delayed for several months.

The delay is being caused by Intel's Sapphire Rapids core processing units and Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units key components of the Aurora system. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business that Aurora remains on track for delivery next year with the chips expected to go into production in 2022.

The struggle for Intel and opportunity for NVIDIA and AMD comes as the three tech giants are battling it out for dominance in the data center chip market.

In addition to Polaris AMD will help power the National Nuclear Security Administration's $600 million El Capitan supercomputer which is set to be delivered to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in early 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the world's fastest exascale computer producing record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops 10 times faster than the current most powerful supercomputer.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is currently powering Oakridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer developed in collaboration with IBM which can produce 200 petaflops or 200000 trillion calculations per second.

LINDA MCMAHON TAKES DIG AT BIG TECH OVER CENSORSHIP: PEOPLE COME TO OUR COUNTRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH

On Wednesday Argonne unveiled Polaris a testbed supercomputer made up of 280 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Apollo Gen10 Plus systems and powered by 2240 of NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units and 560 of AMD's second- and third-generation EPYC processors.

Polaris is expected to deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical artificial intelligence performance up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers. (A single exaflop is equal to one ""quintillion"" calculations per second or 1000 petaflops. A single petaflop is equal to one ""quadrillion"" calculations per second.)

The machine will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications that will be used by Intel's $500 million Aurora supercomputer for a range of scientific projects from advancing cancer treatments and the nation’s energy security to expanding the boundaries of physics with particle collision research.

""Polaris is well equipped to help move the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility] into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users"" ALCF director Michael Papka said in a statement.

Polaris which was delivered and installed in August will go into use starting in early 2022 before opening to the broader high performance computing community in the spring of 2022.

A spokesperson for Argonne National Laboratory confirmed to FOX Business that the Aurora system will be faster than Polaris providing greater than 1 exaFLOP of double precision peak performance. Aurora was originally supposed to be delivered in 2021 but has been delayed for several months.

The delay is being caused by Intel's Sapphire Rapids core processing units and Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units key components of the Aurora system. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business that Aurora remains on track for delivery next year with the chips expected to go into production in 2022.

The struggle for Intel and opportunity for NVIDIA and AMD comes as the three tech giants are battling it out for dominance in the data center chip market.

In addition to Polaris AMD will help power the National Nuclear Security Administration's $600 million El Capitan supercomputer which is set to be delivered to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in early 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the world's fastest exascale computer producing record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops 10 times faster than the current most powerful supercomputer.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is currently powering Oakridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer developed in collaboration with IBM which can produce 200 petaflops or 200000 trillion calculations per second.

The Facebook page Hoy Amhi Shetkari (HAM) which was started by Ankush Chormule and his five fellow directors have been a driving force for more than 4 lakh sugar cane growers across the sugar producing states of Karnataka Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh. These directors themselves were modest cane farmers who had launched Ganna Master the speciality product aimed at better per acre yield.

Through the page the team have been instructing the farmers on how to improve agricultural practices and sharing their knowledge. A retired Soil Scientist from the Mahatma Phule Agricultural University is the main advisor to the team. The Ganna Master was developed after many experiments and by narrowing down to the five chemicals which were sure to give the best results. Before this final kit hit the stalls they were given to the farmers free of cost and was applied over 300 acres of land.

Chormule notes how these kits act like tonic which boosts the growth of the plants. The kit has Master root Master Bonus Master Growth and Master Speed which are to be either sprayed or applied through water. He emphasises on the need to provide boosters and micro nutrients apart from basic minerals and nitrogen fixers to enable better growth and increase per acre tonnage. Seeing the successful result of the product Chormule and his team launched a company called as the Ganna Master Agro Industries Private Limited.

Word spread through social media platforms especially Facebook about the benefits of the product which led to its fame growing across the cane growing states. They have kept their goal very organic and aim at reaching the farmers directly. Through the Facebook page the team act as cane consultants as they themselves hail from families whose main source of income was farming and thus understand the complex economics of this agricultural structure better than anyone else.

The company has grown from its simple origin to now selling over 2500 kits a month. They have also moved their storehouse to Pune and have launched many new kits for other crops like Onion Master Turmeric Master and Vegetable Master.",,,,,,

The Congolese government early this week formed a commission to inevestigate the reserves at the Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM) copper and cobalt project which is majority-owned by China Molybdenum Co

But the DRC which supplies more than 60 per cent of the world’s reserves of cobalt ore believes it may be getting short-changed by foreign mining companies – and is investigating whether unfair foreign mining contracts were signed during the previous administration.

The world depends on the Democratic Republic of Congo for its cobalt to electrify vehicles

The commission which is chaired by Guylain Nyembo the chief of staff of President Felix Tshisekedi “would also propose explore and implement solutions aimed at eliminating all forms of disparities or avoiding any situation likely to affect operations of the mining project” according to documents shared with media by Tshisekedi’s office.

Gecamines owns 20 per cent of TFM and China Molybdenum is the main shareholder.

The investigation comes just a few weeks after the Chinese company announced a US$2.5 billion investment with the Congolese government probably looking for a bigger share of its minerals.

Three months ago Tshisekedi vowed to review deals that he said were skewed in favour of foreign mining companies.

Tshisekedi believes his predecessors in Kinshasa signed lopsided contracts with mining companies that denied the Congolese people their fair share of the benefits from the sale of their nation’s minerals.

“I have really had enough. They come with empty pockets and leave billionaires” Tshisekedi said in May while on a visit to the mineral-rich town of Kolwezi in the south of the country. “It is time for the country to readjust its contracts with miners to seal win-win partnerships.”

Tenke Fungurume Mining is majority-owned by China Molybdenum which it bought in 2016 from US company Freeport-McMoRan.

Last December the American firm sold its indirect 95 per cent interest in the Kisanfu copper-cobalt deposit for US$550 million to China Molybdenum helping cement the Chinese company’s grip on the DRC’s copper and cobalt resources.

Christian-Geraud Neema an independent Congolese mining and policy analyst said a 2002 mining code was deemed to be more favourable to foreign companies than the Congolese government.

In most cases the state barely held between 10 and 20 per cent of the shares through companies such as Gecamines.

Civil society and the International Monetary Fund have in the past decade been piling pressure on the government to make public the contracts it signed.

Neema said former president Joseph Kabila published a new mining code in 2018 that was supposed to rectify this situation.

Contracts signed under the new code such as the Deziwa copper-cobalt mine project a joint venture between Gecamines and China Nonferrous Metal Mining have been presented as a model because the Congolese state held 49 per cent and the Chinese 51 per cent.

The Congolese government has said it will revise some contracts with foreign mining companies. Photo: AFP

In July the International Monetary Fund reported that the DRC had started publishing new mining contracts as part of an argreement to improve transparency and governance in the mining industry.

It said Kinshasa had published 146 of 162 contracts prepared by the DRC Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and other organisations. This year at least 21 contracts signed before 2012 have been published.

Neema said many were surprised by the decision to start the process of revising contracts with the TFM project because “it has not recently been the subject of particular criticism from civil society”.

When it acquired the project in 2015 China Moly inherited the terms of a contract that had been revised in 2010 by the Congolese government and Freeport McMoRan.

“So what could have changed between 2015 and 2021 for President Tshisekedi to decide to start with TFM that remains a mystery” Neema said.

“The terms of the decree creating the review committee are vague enough at this point to determine what the Congolese government intends to get from the revision of this contract. Time will tell.”

Chris Berry president of commodities advisory firm House Mountain Partners in New York said with higher copper and cobalt prices “I’m not at all surprised to see the DRC government looking at contractual obligations.”

Berry said it seemed as though this always happened when commodity prices reached new heights. According to the London Metal Exchange cobalt has risen above $50000 per tonne approaching 2018 levels boosted by demand for electric vehicles in Europe China and the US.

“Perhaps the DRC government wants to see more of the copper-cobalt supply chain built inside the country as opposed to shipping the mined ore back to China or Europe” Berry said. “Given that there is such an enormous focus on supply-chain buildout for batteries in particular this makes sense.”

However he said the issue was not likely to hurt Chinese companies in the DRC over the long term. “China is a major source of foreign direct investment in the country which benefits both China and the DRC at the end of the day” Berry said.

Other Chinese companies operating in the DRC include Huayou Cobalt Chengtun Mining Wanbao and China Nonferrous Metal Mining.

One of the biggest deals signed under Kabila was in 2008 when Gecamines formed the joint venture Sicomines with a consortium of Chinese firms led by Sinohydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation to develop a copper and cobalt mine.

China Eximbank then awarded Sicomines two credit lines totalling US$6.2 billion for the development of the mine and public infrastructure projects according to the New York-based NGO Natural Resource Governance Institute.

The DRC agreed to pay back the funding with future copper and cobalt output from the project in what are known as resource-backed loans.

In mid-August Globe Miami and surrounding areas were hit hard with rain and in turn heavy flooding. Flood damage destroyed every first-level room at the Oyo Hotel off the US60 Highway in Globe and destroyed carried and covered mobile homes in mud at Little Acres Mobile Home Park.

As of Thursday the United Fund of Globe-Miami has raised $258018.97. Community businesses who helped contributed were Pinal Mountain Lions Foundation BHP Billiton Freeport-McMoRan Capstone Pinto Valley Mine and Southwest Gas Corporation along with money from a GoFundMe created to help with damage caused by the Telegraph Fire.

""Work on the gap of these people that affected by this flood waiting on the state and federal funding"" said Globe Mayor Al Gameros who has been advocating for state funding to go directly to people displaced by flood damage. Homeowners can apply for $2500 in addition to federal state and county resources available to residents through Gila County Health & Emergency Management.

In July Gila County was able to secure money to help with flood mitigation and cleanup in Globe and surrounding areas however Gameros said money for cleanup isn't enough. He said the residents of Globe and others displaced by flooding need resources for temporary housing.

""If your house was burned in the fire you would be covered with insurance. If you’re flooded out because of this fire you’re not covered"" said Gameros. ""I have not heard from Governor Ducey. We’ve been on our own here trying to help these people and that’s the frustrating part.""

The Salvation Army is currently set up in Miami at 2448 E. US 60 HWY. just a few miles south of Globe next to Walmart. More resources for donations and the food bank can be found on the City of Globe Facebook Page.",,,,,,,,,
GRMN,Garmin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYmR0ZWNodGFsa3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvZ2FybWluLXZlbnUtc3EtcmV2aWV3L9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vYmR0ZWNodGFsa3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvZ2FybWluLXZlbnUtc3EtcmV2aWV3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Venu Sq review: Solid fitness tracker with smartwatch finesse,"The Garmin Venu Sq has just about all the fitness and health-tracking features one could want in a state-of-the-art smartwatch at a more reasonable price in comparison to major brand names such as Apple Samsung and Fitbit. Coming with a bright LCD touchscreen the Garmin Venu Sq provides a built-in GPS SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking and up to six days of battery life. In short for those seeking solid fitness tracking capabilities alongside some smartwatch features while choosing not to spend several hundreds of dollars the Venu Sq is definitely one option to think about.

This may not be the smartwatch that catches your eye and does lack features that some may consider critical such as a voice assistant and altimeter. However Garmin’s professionality is proven in how the Venu Sq’s health and fitness features stand out from the rest.

“Good” sturdy watch but no wows

The general build of the Venu Sq is a square watch face with rounded edges differing from other watches in the Garmin sports line that are traditionally circular designs. The 1.3-inch color LCD display is similar to Apple’s 42mm line of watches and may take some time getting used to for those who have or crave large watch faces. I personally used to own a Samsung Galaxy Watch so the transition process from a large circular face to a smaller square one took a week or so.

The Venu Sq’s LCD display is quite clear and adequate. Those who spend many hours outdoors however may need to set the brightness a bit higher.

Considering the smaller display size I suggest taking time and adjusting your workout pages so you can monitor the most vital data such as heart rate with a glance and leave others to scroll for during your breathing periods.

The aluminum bezel used provides a sturdy build and don’t let the buttons and plastic case fool you into thinking this is a cheaper watch than others in its range such as Apple Watch SE Fitbit 3 or Galaxy Watch Active 2 that come with OLED displays and metal finishes. One major bonus for the Venu Sq’s aluminum bezel build is its lightweight which I found amazingly important down the line.

The Venu Sq comes with two side buttons: the upper button is used to start/stop activities and the lower to navigate back and forth between various menus. I found that getting the hang of it was quite easy and logical.

My main issue with the Venu Sq has been the screen response to my touch commands which I consider to be rather slow. Furthermore at times when I haven’t accessed my phone for a few hours I would realize the Garmin Connect app would take some time to sync with the Venu Sq. Hopefully Garmin will resolve this issue in future updates.

Blood oxygen heart and sleep monitoring

The Venu Sq continues to hold the Garmin flag high in providing excellent health and fitness tracking. It has an SpO2 sensor to identify blood oxygen levels either as a spot check or automatically throughout the day and night similar to the $399 Apple Watch Series 6. Although setting it to monitor constantly will reduce battery life a lot faster. And while we’re here a suggestion that Garmin can take into notice is making the SpO2 option easier to find in the menus.

In general do keep in mind that the Venu Sq is not approved as a “medical device” and diagnostic purposes should use more professional devices. While monitoring your heart rate and blood oxygen levels is important always consult with your physician about your health-related issues especially when it comes to your particular medical conditions.

The Venu Sq provides you the option of receiving notifications for high and low heart rates coupled with automatically contacting emergency units through your phone in case of an incident or urgent circumstances. Unfortunately the Venu Sq does not come with an ECG or electrocardiogram as you can find in the Apple Watch Series 6 and Galaxy Watch 3 which of course are considered a higher strata in today’s smartwatches market.

The Venu Sq determines stress levels using heart rate variability stopping short on providing much guidance on how one can decrease stress. However the Garmin Body Battery meter using heart variability data activity levels and sleep info in its calculations delivers far more accurate information on your body work. This helped me plan my workout schedule for the next day and configure the intensity level. After several weeks you can find the exercise trend that your body finesses to best. This Garmin feature is truly more understandable than the Stress Management Score found on the Fitbit Sense.

Breathing rates and estimated VO2 max meaning the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise routines are two other useful info features found on Garmin. This enables you to monitor and upgrade your athletic performance at a reasonable pace. The higher the number the more fit your body is.

The Venu Sq also provides excellent sleep tracking with clarifications of your REM deep and light sleep stages. Breathing rate and SpO2 information will also be available when you wake up in the morning. Unfortunately and again the Garmin Connect app falls short in providing you tips on how to improve sleep quality.

Garmin watches including the Venu Sq provide menstrual cycle tracking along with pregnancy tracking to monitor baby movements and log symptoms.

Burn it!

When it comes to workouts you will find a range of preloaded exercises available on the Venu SQ including cardio Pilates strength and yoga. Unlike others this Garmin watch will not provide visual cues on the screen. For example if you’re doing yoga you will have to memorize the meanings of text cues such as “low lunge pose” or “standing forward bend pose” in order to continue your workout uninterrupted.

The Garmin Connect app allows you to build your own workout routines be it circular weights a running program or Pilates and then sync them to your watch. You can also load over 50 additional Garmin-created workouts.

The Venu Sq can also track more than 20 different types of exercises varying from the typical walking and running variants to pool swimming biking cycling and even golf. If you’re looking to reach a certain goal or maybe train for a race there is also a personal training coach available as a useful guide. Unlike Samsung Galaxy watches (and others) the Venu Sq does not provide personalized feedback on your form or deliver audio cues. However this Garmin watch is more of a guide advising you when to warm up or how long you should schedule your run all available on your wrist.

Thanks to the Venu Sq’s built-in GPS you won’t need to have your phone nearby to track your paced distances while being outside. As mentioned before locking on to a GPS signal is a bit slow on the Venu Sq at times even more than 30 seconds. So be patient continue your stretches and warm-up routine and you’ll see that the excellent GPS accuracy in this watch is worth the wait.

For those who consider accurate elevation data a must I’m sorry to say that the Venu Sq is not for you as it has no gyroscope or altimeter. Another downside is that while the Garmin Connect app provides a long range of clear details about your workout it fails to deliver deeper metrics available in rival watches such as the Apple Watch SE or Fitbit Versa 3 that come at a similar price range.

The Garmin Live Track is available on the Venu Sq like other Garmin watches allowing you to share your location during your outdoor exercising with a safety contact. A cellular connection is required however meaning your phone must be with you to activate this feature.

Smart enough

Yes the Garmin Venu Sq is focused more on fitness and health tracking. However this doesn’t mean smartwatch features are not be included. Becoming a must in today’s world the Venu Sq provides notifications from your watch and helps you find your phone if you lose sight of it within Bluetooth range of course (my brother has found this very useful).

Notifications will come through at ease yet only Android users can decline calls and respond to text messages from the available prewritten responses. Voice-to-text responses is not available due to the absence of an onboard microphone and speaker.

The Venu Sq is based on Garmin’s exclusive operating system (Garmin OS). It is more responsive and regarded as stable than the Fitbit OS while falling short in comparison to Apple or Samsung smartwatches. Garmin OS syncs faster for updates and you will not experience a lag in menu options selection or opening apps. Logging data however comes with a short lag that may become annoying during workout transitions.

One slight drawback for iPhone users. The Garmin Connect app on iOS simply relays all notifications from your phone onto your watch and will not allow you to apply any filters. While not important to some I know certain people who prefer to define and control what notifications and text messages appear on their wrist for obvious reasons. On this topic Android users enjoy far more control over the phone-watch notification relationship.

At $50 more the Venu Sq Music edition provides onboard music storage with offline listening from apps such as Spotify (with a Premium subscription) or songs that you already own. The Music version also provides faster data transfer as it enjoys both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity while the regular Venu Sq version only comes with Bluetooth.

Watch faces are abundant with Garmin along with third-party options that help personalize the look for you. This is alongside a considerably wide range of apps available through the Connect IQ Store app (which you will need to install on your phone). One short note here: it would be far better for Garmin to morph both their apps into one.

Garmin Pay also allows you to use contactless payments on both Venu Sq versions. To see all your stats and change watch settings you will need to head to the Garmin Connect app. Adding apps and watch faces however is exclusive to the Connect IQ Store.

While some consider it a standard for smartwatches these days there is no voice assistant feature in the Venu Sq. This is not a deal-breaker for me but some do enjoy having hands-free voice control.

Last but certainly not least the Venu Sq comes with excellent battery life and up to six days’ worth of use before the next charge up. Of course like all smartwatches that number may differ depending on your usage habits especially if you are fond of numerous GPS workouts continuously tracking blood oxygen levels and a must for some listening to music. Garmin provides 14 hours of life if you are using it in constant GPS mode up to eight hours when playing back music or up to six hours with GPS and music playback.

There is no wireless charging with the Venu Sq which is a setback. However my experience showed a three-hour charging lasted five to six days which is far better than Apple watches and slightly better than Samsung.

Great watch without the brouhaha

The Garmin Venu Sq is definitely a solid choice for better health and fitness tracking. And sacrificing a few smart features is definitely worth it considering the money you save in comparison to rival watches from major brand names. In my honest opinion the Apple Watch SE is the Venu Sq’s main rival that iOS users may want to consider.

Keep in mind: Although I recommend the Garmin Venu Sq as an excellent smartwatch for exercise pundits like myself I also insist on putting in the time doing your research and knowing exactly what you want from your watch before purchasing.

Pros

Excellent fitness tracking

Up to six-day battery life

Solid sleep monitoring

Continuous blood oxygen tracking

Cons

GPS signal should lock faster

Touch screen should respond better

Even in the stock market an ESG-focused business performs better than a company with no focus on ESG DD Mishra a senior director analyst at Gartner told ET.“Given the increased scrutiny of organisations on ESG parameters by analysts and rating agencies ESG is evolving as a separate function. EMA is working on at least four such ESG-focused leadership roles” said A Ramachandran senior partner EMA Partners.Companies are looking at handing out pay packets of Rs 1.5-2 crore before stock options to leadership talent. The hunting ground for this pool is among consulting companies including the Big 4 as well as sustainability and CSR-focused enterprises. With a paucity of this talent pool companies are also looking for people outside India and building talent within the organisations.“Along with internal elevation and movement to critical roles we are looking at external talent who can bring a global perspective to the business” said Madhu Srivastava chief HR officer at the Vedanta Group.At the group level Vedanta is in the process of developing an ESG advisory board that will work with the core team and senior management. CEOs of the business units at Vedanta have recently set up an ESG transformational office made up of 10-12 young cross-functional leaders.“We are also onboarding global consultants to provide external expertise guide us … to become one of the leaders in the sector in this regard” said Srivastava. The company has also recently appointed an internal high-level resource in a director-level position handling a critical role encompassing ESG carbon and social performance domain.According to a Gartner global report by 2025 around 50% of companies will have ESG among the top five business priority areas. “Research shows that business performance has only improved if a company is invested in ESG and helps reduce risks over a period of time” said Mishra.Marico’s ESG function is headed by a sustainability leader who is a home-grown talent with over two decades of experience and has a team of dedicated sustainability and CSR experts.“The pandemic-induced disruptions in the business environment have propelled different stakeholder groups to accelerate their ESG strategies so as to future proof their value creation paradigms” said Jitendra Mahajan chief operating officer - supply chain IT & MENA business - at Marico.Marico is currently prioritising its “decade of action” goals towards climate action restoration of natural assets promoting eco-conscious consumerism and delivering socially inclusive growth.In January 2021 Welspun adopted an ESG approach called ‘WELOCITY’ to propel the well-being of all stakeholders at each stage of operations.“As we move forward we are evaluating all our actions through the ESG lens” chief HR officer Rajendra Mehta said. In line with the company's commitment to achieving ESG goals by 2030 Welspun India has appointed two independent directors to its board of members to enable a stronger framework for corporate governance and decision-making.Tata Steel is also hiring senior executives to head specialised verticals like environment. As this is an evolving area the company is also focusing on developing in-house talent said a spokesperson. Apollo Tyres has a dedicated team for ESG that is going to continue investing in the health programme for the trucking community solid waste management and sanitation community development and environment conservation said its president Sunam Sarkar.,,,,,,

In the remaining four months of this year an aircraft could be approved that could one day pose a threat to Airbus and Boeing.

And that comes as no surprise to Tobias Grosche a professor at the University of Worms and an expert in flight planning and passenger demand forecasts.

“The fact that the first ‘COMAC’ aircraft is about to receive national approval is only the logical step in the efforts of the Chinese government also in the aviation sector towards the wester to unlock countries ” Grosche told the Business Insider in a special report.

COMAC is the abbreviation for an amalgamation of Chinese companies that is likely to be viewed critically in Hamburg Toulouse and Seattle.

It stands for Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and brings together design and research centers universities and aluminum and steel manufacturers.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install.

For comparison: the Airbus A320 flies for Lufthansa with space for up to 168 passengers the Boeing 737 has space for around 150 passengers i.e. similar sizes. The two types of aircraft are also similar in terms of range the report said.

Depending on the version the Airbus A320 can travel up to 5700 kilometers the Chinese counterpart C919 promises a range of up to 5555 kilometers.

This means that the Chinese aircraft could for example reach all national destinations from Shanghai in eastern China — and get even further.

The major elements of the C919 such as the nose fuselage outer wing vertical stabilizer horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC. Credit: COMAC.

Beijing has made no secret of its desire to break the western giants’ duopoly helping smooth the C919’s development with up to US$72 billion in state-related support according to estimates from US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

According to Simple Flying the Shanghai Aircraft Airworthiness Certification Center of CAAC (SAACC) signed and issued the first Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) for the C919 program.

This means that the plane has officially entered into “authority certification” flight testing.

However natural icing trials which were set to take place in March 2021 have had to be postponed until fall.

While the aircraft is expected to be approved and will start scheduled service with OTT Airlines a subsidiary of the largest airline in Asia China Eastern Airlines it is doubtful that this first-generation C919 will challenge the world’s aircraft manufacturers Business Insider reported.

Not yet anyway.

Says Grosche: “A second or third generation could be dangerous for Airbus and Boeing.

“Ultimately it’s an economic question. If a Chinese model is efficient and safe I see no reason why western airlines should not also operate these aircraft.”

After all Lufthansa for example not only has Airbus and Boeing aircraft in its fleet but also models from its subsidiary Cityline the former Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and the Brazilian Embraer.

Furthermore Grosche is certain that COMAC will one day be able to offer the C919 for sale at comparatively cheap prices.

Even Guillaume Faury Airbus chief executive has acknowledged COMAC’s rise telling an industry event “we will probably go from a duopoly to a triopoly at least on the single aisle by the end of the decade.”

Overall a total of 815 orders have been placed by 28 customers. China Eastern’s Big Three counterparts – China Southern and Air China will also deploy the C919 along with other powerhouses such as Joy Air and Hainan Airlines.

The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install. Credit: COMAC.

There has also been some international interest.

The head of the low-cost airline Ryanair Michael O’Leary announced ten years ago that he wanted to support alternatives to Boeing and Airbus and signed a non-binding letter of intent with COMAC the report said.

And while Boeing and Airbus have the advantage of having been on the road around the world for decades China which historically plays the long game is looking much further into the future.

The type CR929 is supposed to compete with long-haul airliners like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787.

And the type CR929-600 could have a range of up to 12000 kilometers and space for up to 280 passengers.

What are Boeing and and Airbus up against? The C919 will be state-of-the-art both inside and out along with some refreshing updates.

While the major elements of the airplane such as the nose fuselage outer wing vertical stabilizer horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC the company has enlisted Western expertise notably that of French high-tech industrial group and aero-engine manufacturer Safran which is producing the aircraft’s cabin and nacelles CNN Travel reported.

The C919’s LEAP-1C engines are being produced by CFM a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran. Subsidiary Safran Cabin says it will supply the lavatories galleys and cockpit doors for the C919.

The company told CNN that “the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft.”

That will be welcome news for passengers forced to do contortions in modern airplane toilet compartments.

More spacious lavatories would mean it would be possible to move around with less contact with surfaces and it could also make cleaning and maintenance a less onerous task for the crew that scramble on board between flights to disinfect the toilets — a boon in the Covid era.

The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized galley with ample space for the flight crew to work.

Safran says it “recognizes that many of its airline partners based in China will fly these aircraft on short routes within China which makes meal service a challenge.”

To address the compressed flight times on domestic routes Safran says its cabin designers have come up with an “ergonomic galley design with large work surfaces equipped with easy-to-maneuver “Hybrite S trolleys” which help the crew get meals snacks and drinks out to passengers quickly.

Spacious galleys are also likely to be a selling point worldwide as airlines work towards complying with new inflight catering guidelines set out by the Airline Catering Association.

As for environmental concerns Safran says it “has made advancements in its composite structures which enable interiors to be both lightweight and durable helping to reduce carbon footprint while withstanding the rigors of short-haul service.”

The aircraft’s engines are also claimed to be more efficient.

The CFM LEAP-1C engine which was selected by COMAC as the sole Western engine option for the C919 offers “a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines and up to a 50% margin on NOx emissions” says Safran.

The engines will also mitigate noise in and around the airports where the C919 operates.

The C919’s cockpit is being developed by the Chinese Aeronautical Radio Electronics Research Institute (CARERI) and will feature integrated 15.4-inch avionic Display Head Assembly units coming from Barco Display Systems of Atlanta Ga.

“The distance between the T-38 and an F-35 is night and day” said General David L. Goldfein U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff. F-35 and F-22 are USAF’s fifth-generation fighter jets and T-38 is the jet trainer that’s currently in use with a decades-long career.Although the T-38 Talon supersonic jet trainer underwent a complex modernization process in the 2000s it was only meant to extend its service life until 2020. The truth is that the T-38 fleet is aging and the fatal 2019 crash confirmed it.Just a year prior to that in September 2018 the T-X advanced pilot training system designed by Boeing and Saab had been selected by USAF in order to replace the almost 60-year-old T-38 fleet.Today’s most technologically advanced military aircraft require an equally capable jet trainer and this is what USAF’s T-X program was designed for. The $9.2 billion contract that had been awarded to Boeing included 351 T-7A aircraft 46 simulators plus the associated ground equipment.The future trainer was named Red Hawk in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen also known as the Red Tails the first unit of African-American pilots and personnel who fought in World War II. Their P-51 Mustang aircraft had distinctive red tails which gave them the famous name that would now be associated with the newest jet trainer.The T-7A is a game-changer from the innovative way it’s been developed to its impressive capabilities. It was designed by Boeing using 3D model-based processes that allowed it to go from concept to first flight in just 36 months for the USAF competition. By the beginning of 2021 two T-7A aircraft were already in flight tests ready to move to the second testing phase later this year.According to the manufacturer the “norm-breaking” development process of the T-7A resulted in an 80% reduction in assembly hours a 50% reduction in software development and verification time and a 75% increase in engineering quality. The digital design and manufacturing techniques also meant that the future jet trainer would be able to integrate additional capabilities faster and easier.Another innovative aspect of the Red Hawk is its easy-to-maintain design. As both Boeing and Air Force officials stated one of its key assets is the fact that it was developed “with maintainers in mind”. What this means is that it was built with features such as a side-opening canopy for fast ejection seat changes upright access to doors (“high wings”) plus drop down panels and doors for rapid and easy access.Also the use of interchangeable parts (rudders and actuators) makes things easier when it comes to supply chains. As far the engine goes Boeing claims that “four people can change it before lunch”. All in all these features make the future jet trainer easier to maintain with fewer costs while also lowering life cycle costs over time.Red Hawk is also as performant as it is easy to maintain. As Air Force officials stated in the aircraft’s announcement the new T-7A’s single engine can generate almost three times more thrust than the dual engines of the T-38C. It’s also capable of flying in a way that’s closer to real world conditions thanks to the twin tails and big leading-edge root extensions that enable precise maneuvering at low speeds.Since its main purpose is to prepare pilots for fifth generation fighters this jet trainer integrates capabilities that the T-38C was missing such as high angle of attack flight characteristics night operations plus information and sensor management. With the help of this next-gen trainer pilots will be better equipped to handle data links radar information and smart weapons.The T-7A’s innovative digital DNA even helped accelerate testing and uncover issues that would’ve normally taken years to detect. Most recently one of the two jets that were already built successfully passed a high angle-of-attack maneuverability test after an anomaly called “wing rock” had been previously detected and then fixed.Even though the recent health crisis has delayed the production of the T-7A Boeing and USAF representatives are confident that the first jet trainers will arrive at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas by 2023 which will mark the beginning of a new era in military pilot training. It’s no wonder that the T-7A Red Hawk was included in Popular Science’s top 100 “most pivotal influential and just plain awesome innovations” of the year in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2xvcmV0dG8taG9zcGl0YWwtaWxsaW5vaXMtYXR0b3JuZXktZ2VuZXJhbC1iZXR0ZXItZ292ZXJubWVudC1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1iZ2EvMTA5ODA2OTgv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3Y2hpY2Fnby5jb20vYW1wL2xvcmV0dG8taG9zcGl0YWwtaWxsaW5vaXMtYXR0b3JuZXktZ2VuZXJhbC1iZXR0ZXItZ292ZXJubWVudC1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1iZ2EvMTA5ODA2OTgv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loretto Hospital in Austin under investigation by Illinois attorney general for potential misuse of charitable assets: Block Club,"Loretto Hospital Chicago under investigation for potential misuse of charitable assets: BGA

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The Illinois Attorney General's Office is investigating Loretto Hospital after reports by Block Club Chicago and the Better Government Association revealed millions of dollars in insider contracts.

An earlier investigation revealed reports of a COVID vaccine scandal and that the publicly funded hospital on Chicago's West Side paid millions to three companies that have ties to former COO and CFO Dr. Anosh Ahmed.

A spokesperson for the attorney general issued a statement about the investigation.

After the Storm

If you lose power turn off large appliances and air conditioners and wait 10 to 15 minutes after power has been restored before turning them back on.

Keep freezer doors closed and sealed. Well-filled freezers keep most foods frozen two to three days if the door is kept closed.

Continue listening to local news for the latest updates.

Stay alert for extended rainfall and subsequent flooding even after the hurricane or tropical storm has ended.

If evacuated return home only when officials have said it is safe.

Drive only if necessary. Avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges.

Keep away from loose or dangling power lines. Any power line could be energized. You can’t tell by just looking. Report them immediately by calling 911 or reporting to your local provider: Mississippi Power 800-532-1502 Coast Electric 877-769-2372 or Singing River Electric 888-605-1416.

Don’t attempt to repair the electrical system or pull tree limbs off lines. Let trained work crews perform this potentially dangerous work.

Generator Safety

If you plan to use a generator always think safety first.

Never connect a generator to your home’s wiring. This can energize power lines endangering power workers and even you. It’s best to connect generators by using a transfer switch or connect appliances directly to the generator.

Operate your generator outdoors NOT in a garage storage room or near your open window. Always read the instructions first.

Be sure the generator you have selected has ample capacity to supply the lighting appliances and equipment you plan to connect.

Do not operate your generator while standing in wet conditions.

Do not attempt to fill your generator’s fuel tank while it is operating.

Do not tamper with engine’s speed adjustment. This could cause a fire.

Have a charged fire extinguisher nearby as a precaution.

In view of the growing belligerence by China that has been conducting invasion drills every now and then Taiwan is planning to buy additional US-made F-16 fighter jets and has earmarked $1.44B for this acquisition.

In addition to this the US recently exhibited its prized possession the F-22 Raptor at the Singapore Airshow although the stealth fighter jet is not for sale. All this indicates Washington’s bid to showcase its fighter jets equipped with advanced technology in the Asian market and send a clear message to China.

It’s not just Taiwan major Asian powers such as Japan and India are also acquiring American military aircraft in big numbers to counter an expansionist China.

Taiwan – Biggest Fleet Of F-16 Jets In Asia

Taiwan’s never-ending confrontation with China has increased the demand for American weapons including fighter jets in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has thrown its support behind the self-governing island which China claims as its territory.

Washington which does not officially recognize the island’s sovereignty has been strongly opposing the alleged Chinese military aggression in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea on the pretext of promoting freedom of navigation.

Under provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act the US is required to provide weapons of a defensive nature to Taiwan. Since 2010 Washington has announced more than $23 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including the most advanced F-16s.

The US had in 2019 approved the sale of 66 Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 70 fighter jets to Taipei for an estimated $8 billion. With this the number of Taiwan’s ‘Fighting Flacons’ will increase to 200 the largest fleet o F-16 fighter jets in Asia.

Developed by American aerospace giants General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin the fast and agile fourth-generation F-16 combat-proven multi-role fighter jets are considered the most successful cost-effective fighters in the world. There are approximately 3000 such fighters operational in around 25 countries according to an earlier report by The EurAsian Times.

The Biden administration also approved a potential $750 million deal earlier this month which includes the sale of 40 new M109 self-propelled howitzers and almost 1700 kits to convert projectiles into more precise GPS-guided munitions according to Bloomberg.

Japan – Biggest Fleet Of F-35s

Lockheed secured a mega-deal to sell its most advanced F-35 stealth jets to Japan. Last year the United States approved a planned purchase of 105 F-35 joint strike fighters drawing Japan one step closer to be the biggest foreign customer of the fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

The approved package includes 63 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing aircraft and 42 F-35 short takeoff and landing variants.

Japan will be the second-largest operator of the joint strike fighter after the United States and just ahead of the UK. Soon Japan will become the fourth largest user of the F-35B variant capable of short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). The US Marine Corps the UK Royal Air Force and the Italian Navy currently use the F-35B.

Japan and China have contested claims over a group of uninhabited Senkaku (Diaoyu in Chinese) islands that fall in the East China Sea. Tokyo has also indicated its military support for Taiwan in the event of a full-scale conflict with China.

Nitin J Ticku a strategic analyst and a senior journalist with the EurAsian Times states that the biggest fleet of F-16 and F-35 stealth jets outside the US would be based in Asia. The US’ most advanced F-22 Raptors have also been deployed in Asia at the US military base in Guam.

This clearly indicates that after the Middle East and Afghanistan the Indo-Pacific region could be the hub of next global confrontation.

India’s P-8I Aircraft – Biggest Fleet After The US

India another major power in Asia is also on a weapons-buying spree in view of a protracted border conflict with China.

New Delhi has signed several defense deals with Washington in the past few years including an agreement for 22 AH-64E Apache helicopters and 17 CH-47F(I) Chinook heavy-lift helicopters — both manufactured by the defense and aerospace giant Boeing.

India is also increasing its fleet of Boeing P-8I Neptune maritime multi-mission aircraft (MMA). The P-8I is the Indian-specific variant of the P-8A Poseidon flown by the US Navy and international customers.

The P-8I differs slightly from the P-8A in that it is equipped with an aft-facing radar (that operates independently of the forward-facing Raytheon AN/APY-10 surface search sensor) providing full-hemisphere coverage and an aerial target-tracking capability.

The Indian Navy currently has 10 P-8I spy planes including the two that were delivered last year as part of its additional order for four aircraft which it had placed in 2016.

The Indian Navy-operated aircraft was also deployed in Ladakh as a surveillance platform during border tensions with China. The move was intended at building synergy between the three services of Indian armed forces while keeping a hawk-eye on China.

“This proposed sale of an additional six P-8I aircraft will allow the Indian Navy to expand its maritime surveillance aircraft capability for the next 30 years” the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said at the time of the approval in April.

The Indian Navy is expected to operate the biggest fleet of submarine-hunting P-8 aircraft outside the United States.

Recently the Indian Navy received two of the 24 MH-60 Romeo anti-submarine helicopters it ordered. The first batch is expected to land in the country next year. In 2018 the Navy got approval to pursue the acquisition of 24 Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters. The contract was finally sealed in February 2020 during President Trump’s visit to India.

The $2.6 billion deal includes helicopters communication systems weapons systems eight anti-surface Hellfire missiles which can be used to hit ships MK 54 lightweight torpedoes 50 cannons and precision rocket systems.

Ticku says – the US defense industry has got a massive boost due to the perceived threat of China. Earlier it was the USSR later it was the threat of terrorists in the Middle East and elsewhere then for Saudi’s UAE and Israel it was the Iranian threat and now the China threat factor is driving the arms sales in Asia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzI5L2l0cy1nb2luZy10by1kby1ub3RoaW5nLWJ1dC1nby11cC1tZWQtc2Nob29sLWpldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's going to do nothing but go up': Med school jets housing expected to increase Fort Smith population over decade ...,"FORT SMITH -- The city is no longer second-largest in the Arkansas but leaders believe it's primed to grow much faster over the next decade.

Fort Smith grew from 86209 to 89142 between 2010 and 2020 but lost its place as second-largest to Fayetteville according to decennial census results. Fayetteville's population according to the 2020 count is 93949.

While Fort Smith's growth is modest compared to other cities leaders and developers believe a more prominent sudden population jump is possible due to initiatives such as Arkansas Colleges of Health Education's health and wellness research center and fighter jets set to relocate at Ebbing Air National Guard Base.

The census every 10 years determines how federal money is appropriated to communities throughout the United States. These dollars can go to schools hospitals roads and public works according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

While the Fort Smith grew 3.4% it fell to third behind Fayetteville the southernmost large city in Northwest Arkansas and home to the University of Arkansas. Northwest Arkansas is home to Walmart Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport -- three of the country's largest companies.

Fort Smith's county Sebastian didn't grow as much as other parts of the state either. Sebastian County grew 1.6% while Benton and Washington counties in Northwest Arkansas grew 28.5% and 21.1%. In central Arkansas Saline County grew 15.2% while Craighead County in the northeast part of the state grew 15.3% data shows. Saline County is part of the greater Little Rock area while Craighead County holds Jonesboro home of Arkansas State University.

Mayor George McGill said he puts an asterisk next to the city's 2020 census because of how the social restrictions in place to prevent the spread of covid-19 might have affected the process. He believes Fort Smith's population should be closer to 95000.

""At this point what we're doing is just gather the information and do an honest assessment of what we should do moving forward"" McGill said.

Despite the drop to third some say the city's comparatively modest growth is cause for optimism. State Rep. Justin Boyd R-Fort Smith said the numbers show resilience from the 2012 closing of the city's Whirlpool plant. At its peak in 2005 the appliance plant employed 4500. It eliminated more than 1000 jobs with its closing.

In the past decade the city has added thousands of homes in the Chaffee Crossing area. Engineered material manufacturer Glatfelter opened one of its production plants in that area. And The Unexpected arts festival has helped renew interest in downtown Fort Smith.

""They've arrested their decline which is step one"" said Mervin Jebaraj director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas' Sam M. Walton College of Business.

Rod Coleman chairman of ERC Holdings noted the limited amount of land for development in the city could be partially responsible for the more modest growth. He said housing in Chaffee Crossing the fastest-growing part of town wasn't built until recent years.

Coleman also noted growth in nearby Greenwood just south of Fort Smith. The town grew from 8952 to 9516 in the last decade census data shows. All other towns of more than 1000 people in Sebastian and Crawford counties -- where Fort Smith and Van Buren are -- also gained population according to the census.

But within the city leaders and developers point to Arkansas Colleges of Health Education as a current driving factor for growth and development. The school broke ground in 2015 and now has a college of osteopathic medicine and offers a master's degree in biomedicine and occupational and physical therapy programs. It's set to have a health and wellness research program following a $32.3 million grant.

Leaders also point to the selection of Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Fort Smith as the preferred location for up to 36 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. The initiative is expected to bring more than 800 pilots support workers and dependants to the area according to military estimates.

McGill said ""things are just now starting to fall in place"" in Fort Smith that will drive population upward.

Fighter jets med school and Chaffee Crossing

Parker estimates 3900 rooftops have emerged in Chaffee Crossing since Colleges of Health Education was built. While Parker attributed this growth to his college others say the school isn't the only contributing factor.

Chaffee Crossing is the product of the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority working to develop more than 7000 acres of former Army land into east Fort Smith and Barling. Since 1997 the land has seen more than $2 billion in investments according to Redevelopment Authority Marketing Director Lorie Robertson.

Coleman who for 50 years has worked in housing in Fort Smith said consistently low interest rates on homes have allowed the city to steadily grow over the last decade. He said interest rates are even better after covid-19 due to an excess of cash in the lending market.

Coleman also said Chaffee Crossing ""in the last four or five years"" has afforded housing developers unused land to build homes. He also said people have moved from outside Fort Smith to Chaffee for jobs at ArcBest and Mars Petcare.

""The last year has been great growth"" Coleman said of Chaffee. ""There has not been anybody who hasn't been able to build something and put it on the ground that did not sell immediately almost.""

But Coleman also said the medical college has been a driving factor in the growth. The college in 2021 graduated its first class of 150 doctors Parker said. These numbers don't account for the colleges' other programs that push the total number of students to around 900.

""We intentionally underbuilt our student housing because we wanted the community to benefit from what we're creating"" Parker said.

Most of the students come from the school's ""service area"" of Arkansas Oklahoma western Tennessee southern Missouri and northern Louisiana. About a third are from other places in the United States Parker said.

Of the graduated class of doctors 10 of them are completing their residencies in Fort Smith Parker said. He estimated 83% of doctors stay where they complete their residencies. And each doctor accounts for four additional medical employees he said.

The college also has more than 180 employees. More than 80% of them moved from outside Fort Smith Parker said.

The medical colleges is also going to expand into the old Golden Living center where it will house its Research Institute Health and Wellness Center. The facility will facilitate biomedical research and more educational opportunities for students according to Susan Devero communications director for the colleges.

Once complete the facility will be filled with about 100 employees with Ph.D.s plus additional staff Parker said.

""There's not 100 Ph.D.s available in Fort Smith Arkansas"" Parker said. ""We've got to bring them in from the outside.""

Parker also said the employees themselves -- many of whom make more than $100000 per year -- have an impact on the population because of their expendable income. He said the money spent on activities like dining creates more business thus leading to more jobs in the area.

The selection of Ebbing as the preferred location for Foreign Military Sales and a F-35 training center is also expected to positively impact the area's population and economy. The base will house up to 36 F-16 and F-35 fighter jets for Singapore and Foreign Military Sales participants according to the U.S. Air Force. Foreign Military Sales allows the U.S. to sell defense equipment lend services and hold training exercises to a foreign country when the president determines it will strengthen world peace the Air Force states.

The initiative is estimated to bring 345 U.S. military personnel 180 Singapore military members and 300 dependents to the River Valley according to a Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce news release. Officials expect the initiative to have up to a $1 billion economic impact on the region.

""The next three years is going to be very very successful in the housing business out here just because of what we've heard and know about based on the jobs at the med school based on the Singapore mission"" Coleman said.

McGill who helped convince the Air Force and Singapore delegation to select the city as the location said be believes the people in charge of locating projects such as these trust the region will grow. He said the decisions to locate in Fort Smith is ""simply preparing for that.""

""What we're trying to do is make sure we're providing infrastructure for that kind of growth"" he said.

'Amenities amenities amenities'

While housing and economic wins give McGill hope for the future he said these alone aren't enough to keep growing the city.

McGill said amenities -- things for residents to do outside of work -- are decisive in whether people move to another area or stay where they are. The same is true for businesses that wish to attract and retain qualified employees said Propak CEO Steve Clark.

McGill said amenities in Northwest Arkansas -- just one hour north of Fort Smith -- were a draw for the Air Force and Singapore delegation to move planes to the city. The region touts amenities such as nightlife in Fayetteville Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville and the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers.

""If I'm taking my family to another town whether we have this this and this whether it's a skate park or trail system or whatever it may be it's going to weigh in to those decisions"" Clark said.

Residents and visitors have shown renewed interest in downtown Fort Smith from The Unexpected arts festival which Clark founded. Before covid-19 the festival annually brought a handful of nationally and internationally acclaimed muralists to the city for a week to paint their works on buildings throughout downtown.

In the last five years downtown has had venues including a coffee shop cigar lounge and skate park open to the public. The Bakery District a multipurpose gathering space with a coffee shop bookstore food truck and patio area has also opened. But the area also lost a brewery and music bar during covid-19 and a western wear store in spring 2021.

Clark gave a nod to Peacemaker Music Festival and Steel Horse Rally which combined bring more than 100000 people to the downtown area each year. He also said development on the city's riverfront will contribute to the attractiveness of the city -- the openings of the U.S. Marshals Museum and Community School of the Arts in that area are expected in 2022.

""In the world we live in now it's amenities amenities amenities"" McGill said. ""Quality of life is the attraction.""

While McGill expects people to move to Fort Smith for jobs he also expects the development of the riverfront and downtown will be a draw. He said people who move to Fort Smith for this reason will fill jobs city leaders wish to attract.

But Clark said the city still needs to accelerate its development of amenities. Some are on their way such as the renovation of the park at West End in downtown and of the barracks in Chaffee Crossing.

""There's a lot of other municipalities that are trying to woo the same employers and employees that we currently have and want in our town"" Clark said.

A positive outlook

When asked what he expects Fort Smith's population to do in the next 10 years Parker's answer was simple: ""It's going to do nothing but go up.""

One of the keys to this growth Jebaraj said is consistency in investments and improvements. Clark agrees -- he said the city won't continue to grow if its stakeholders don't continue to invest in good jobs and amenities.

Coleman predicts the city will witness the same growth in the next five years that it saw in the last decade.

Boyd said community leaders will continue to make the city ""the right place for businesses to grow"" and improve life in the city.

""I feel very positive about our community and our ability of people to live in Fort Smith and surrounding communities as well and look forward to seeing what the next decade has in store for our community for Fort Smith for our surrounding communities and the state of Arkansas"" said Boyd."

“Magnetic compassionate zealous Boricuban values-based leader committed to driving positive change and empowering others.”

Hometown: San Juan Puerto Rico

Fun Fact About Yourself: I started dancing ballet as an adult only three years ago and I’m already dancing on pointe. It was a childhood dream and it fills me with pride that I didn’t give up and finally went for it!

Undergraduate School and Major: BA in Marketing Management from the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras.

Most Recent Employer and Job Title: For the past two years I was a Consulting Associate at Nielsen IQ where I guided CPG manufacturers in measuring outcomes and driving business improvements through a deeper understanding of what consumers buy.

Aside from your classmates what was the key part of Cornell’s MBA programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? First and foremost I researched schools that valued Diversity and Inclusion. I decided to apply only to Consortium member schools whose missions include promotion and the inclusion of African Americans Hispanic Americans and Native Americans in American business. I believe representation matters and if I’m the only Latina in the room I want to be in a place where I’m able to open the door for other minorities like me. Through the diversity of faces that I saw at the many virtual events sponsored by the school such as Meet & Greets for Consortium and Latin American students and a Consortium Super Day I was assured that Cornell’s MBA program embodies these important values.

What course club or activity excites you the most at Cornell? I learn best by doing which is why I am excited about the school’s Immersion learning model. I plan to participate in the Strategic Product and Marketing immersion where I hope to strengthen my skills in decoding consumer behavior and apply insights to develop relevant effective marketing solutions.

What excites you the most about living in Ithaca and the Finger Lakes region? So many things! Having lived in the Caribbean all my life this will be my first time seeing the seasons change. I’m looking forward to all the activities that come with each season and trying local produce from the Ithaca Farmers Market. I am equally excited by the prospect of being surrounded by all the beauty the region has to offer from the State Parks to the more than 100 waterfalls within 10 miles of downtown not to mention Cayuga Lake and the amazing Cornell campus.

Describe your biggest accomplishment in your career so far: It was driving successful brand activations and surpassing sales targets for Haagen-Dazs Old El Paso Cheerios and other cereals in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean while being the youngest brand manager in General Mills LATAM team at the time. If I had to choose just one moment it would be the launch of Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes cereal which disrupted the largest segment of the category and brought a 2pp value share increase to General Mills!

How did COVID-19 change your perspective on your career and your life in general? The first few months during quarantine I learned to savor slow weekend mornings where I could read novels and enjoy stress free time without the pressure of always having to do something or be somewhere. Our society has taught us that being busy is good and that if you’re not then you’re lazy and wasting time. The pandemic has taught me that there is beauty and value in resting and disconnecting. I will carry this lesson with me as I begin my MBA journey. Career-wise it confirmed that I need to work for a company that is flexible empathetic respectful and understanding of their employees across all levels.

What led you to pursue an MBA at this point and what do you hope to do after graduation? Ever since starting my undergraduate studies I always envisioned myself taking this step. I am at a point in my career where I want to strengthen my marketing knowledge and skills and develop into a well-rounded and strong business leader. The MBA degree will lead me to the next step of my career by improving my leadership and strategic thinking skills expanding my network and providing opportunities to learn about other functional areas and industries.

Post-MBA I want to help build brands and products that positively impact the world are aligned with my values and whose teams and communication are diverse and inclusive. My passion is serving the customer and I strive to do it in a way that doesn’t bring suffering to animals people or the earth.

What other MBA programs did you apply to? University of Michigan – Ann Arbor and Emory University both members of the Consortium for Graduate Studies in Management.

What advice would you give to help potential applicants gain admission into Cornell’s MBA program? I was a re-applicant having gone through the process for the first time in 2019. What I believe made the difference in my admission the second time around was having a better-defined story improved GMAT scores and more engagement with current students and alumni.

I would advise potential applicants to do the following:

1. Do some introspection and be sure of your story. Ask yourself: what has your journey been how has it brought you here where are you going and how can Cornell Johnson help you get there?

2. Take the GMAT multiple times. This shows the admissions committee that you are perseverant and always strive to improve yourself.

3. Truly get to know the school its people and culture to understand if it’s the best fit for you and vice versa as well as what you can contribute to the community if admitted. Take advantage of the many events Johnson offers for applicants to connect with students professors admissions personnel and alumni.

Woldt David Luther Born October 9th 1941 died August 21 2021 due to complications from Lewy Body Dementia. Dave was the son of Enno and Clara Woldt of Lansing Michigan. As the son of a pastor his faith was always a guiding force in his life even though he could test the patience of Job with his antics when accompanied by his brothers. He graduated from Western Michigan University in 1965. During that time he met the girl who stole his heart Bethany Huffman and they were married a few short years later. After graduation he began his lifelong career with General Mills. During these years Dave and Beth were blessed with two daughters who were the other two loves of his life. He was always most happy when surrounded by his girls. Dave never sat still! He loved anything having to do with the outdoors. Whether he was skiing playing tennis sailing washing his car mowing the lawn hunting fishing or chopping wood his love of life was evident and infectious. David's gregarious personality lent itself well to community service. During their retirement Dave and Beth enjoyed volunteering in various community and faith-based activities. Dave and Beth considered themselves blessed to have enduring friendships that they cherished. If you were their friend you were their family. Anyone who knew Dave was well acquainted with all of his ""pearls of wisdom."" Even in his final days his humor was strong and comforting. Dave is survived by his wife Bethany; daughter Amy May of Whitefish Montana son-in-law Eric & grandsons Jake and Luke; daughter Heather Koelling of Saint Michael Minnesota son-in-law Gary & grandsons Henry and William; several brothers and sisters-in-law and numerous nieces and nephews.

A quick glance at General Motors’ guiding principles on their website and the first thing they mention is their “aspiration to be the most inclusive company in the world.” A big feat for a company who was under fire last year for discriminatory and systemic racist business practices.

But in just a short year CEO Mary Barra is making good on her word. Earlier this year GM revealed a new five-part plan — the result of a series of meetings between Barra and Black-owned media representatives — that pledges to offer better access to advertising dollars with GM. The changes address multiple aspects of the media ecosystem including overall spend spend distribution measurement deal structure and infrastructure development. To date GM has also committed $4 million of their $10 million Justice and Inclusion Fund to support the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund the MLK Memorial Foundation’s Inaugural Social Justice Fellows Program the Asian Pacific American Institute Congressional Studies Fellowship Program and other organizations doing critical racial justice work.

Barra also tapped Telva McGruder to lead the organization’s diversity equity and inclusion vision for the Office of DEI and she celebrates one-year in her role this month. Juanita Slappy was also promoted to lead Multicultural Marketing for Cadillac brand.

And even despite these achievements in such a short time still Barra continues to be vocal about her focus on driving that supportive inclusivity not only within General Motors but in the communities in which GM operates.

For example General Motors and its Cadillac continued their Black community commitment just this summer as the first-ever sponsorship activation as presenting sponsor of the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival. The festival featured dynamic panel conversations about the path to inclusivity moderated by GM’s McGruder a Director’s Brunch honoring Spike Lee and Regina King on how women in the industry are driving impact and influence in how we experience film today and the future.

“On our journey to become the most inclusive company in the world GM is aligned by our guiding principles: Our Words (what we say) Our Deeds (what we do) and Our Culture (who we are)” says McGruder. “We launched our Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) to help guide our work to increase diversity and create an inclusive internal culture where employees can show up as their authentic selves. Through our giving we are activating on Our Deeds as we continue to establish alliances to advocate for and achieve equity in racial justice education health care and economic opportunities.”

Additional progress that has resulted include signing on to the Business Roundtable Multiple Pathways Initiative and the OneTen initiative; introducing our “Be Inclusive” behavior to celebrate diverse backgrounds opinions and ideals; and curating training content that includes videos courses and articles for self-guided learning focused on three areas: recognizing and addressing unconscious bias promoting an inclusive organization and understanding and combating racial inequity.

“We are reimagining workforce strategy and evaluating our systems to ensure that all GM employees have equitable impactful experiences with positive moments that matter” GM proclaims. “Exploring new pathways to onboard a broader array of talent that will strongly contribute to our outcomes. For example we joined OneTen a coalition of 30+ companies and leaders that aim to upskill hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement.”

While Black Americans have been disproportionately underserved in all sectors of business General Motors is making it clear that they are on a mission to change that. And quite frankly many companies need to follow suit. With these moments of progress we can’t wait to see what the future holds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wOC9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy1tYXktaW52ZXN0LW1vcmUtaW4tZWd5cHQv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA4L2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLW1heS1pbnZlc3QtbW9yZS1pbi1lZ3lwdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Motors May Invest More In Egypt,"General Motors may be looking to expand its operations in Egypt.

According to a recent report from the Egyptian business publication Enterprise General Motors President and Managing Director Middle East and Africa Luay Al Shurafa recently met with Egyptian Trade and Industry Minister Nevine Gamea to discuss a possible expansion by General Motors in the region. The discussions included dialogue pertaining to how the automaker’s expansion plans could complement Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly’s desire to increase car exports and localize electric vehicle production.

The Madbouly government recently approved a 500 million EGP ($32 million USD at current exchange rates) plan to incentivize automakers that export vehicles as part of a broader 6 billion EGP ($382 million USD) subsidy program.

Per the Enterprise report Al Shurafa praised the export subsidy program but did not list details of any possible General Motors expansion in Egypt.

For the moment the only General Motors brand sold in Egypt is Chevrolet. Products sold in the market include the Chevy Malibu sedan the Chevy Captiva crossover and the Chevy Optra sedan as well as a selection of commercial trucks and vans.

Back in 2015 General Motors announced it would invest $46 million in Egypt over three to four years. At the time President and Managing Director of GM Africa Mario Spangenberg addressed the investment during a speech at the Egypt Economic Development Conference saying “Egypt enjoys a promising investment environment with lots of potential… with diversified demands. Egypt’s strategic location promotes exports making it North Africa’s hub.”

More recently in April of 2020 Egyptian Prime Minister Madbouly visited the General Motors Egypt Plant praising the automaker for its preventative measures to protect its employees from the spread of COVID-19 while also underlining the government’s interest in supporting the car industry in Egypt.

At that time Chairman and Managing Director of General Motors Egypt Tarek Atta highlighted the automaker’s investments over the last five years estimated at $120 million.

Continuously improved over the next four decades the biggest of the Big Three in Detroit had to replace the venerable powerplant in the late ‘90s.

Photo: General Motors

The LS family of engines may follow a similar recipe to the original small block from the Golden Bowtie yet it’s considered a clean-sheet motor in many aspects. Like a lot! From the six-bolt layout to the relocated spark plugs better flow of the heads larger camshaft steam vents and plastic intake that suffers from less heat soak these changes aren’t only skin deep.Early in the 2000s there was hearsay according to which General Motors had a few upgrades in store for the LS. The fourth-gen small block launched in 2004 with a focus on displacement on demand better known as Active Fuel Management in the automaker’s jargon. Variable valve timing needs to be highlighted as well because it offers better performance and fuel economy.Then rumored to premiere in the seventh-generation Chevrolet Corvette sports car the fifth-generation small block is called LT as a tribute to the LT-1 from the ‘70s and LT1 350 from the ‘90s. Rather confusingly the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray’s powerplant for the 2014 model year is also called LT1.Heavily related to the LS3  this fellow boasts direct fuel injection revised cylinder heads better cooling and valves that are flipped from the LS. Continuously variable valve timing a variable displacement oil pump and piston cooling jets pretty much sum up the LT family along with a rather controversial fuel-saving technology that we’ll cover later on.The 6.2-liter engine is SAE-certified 460 horsepower and 465 pound-feet (630 Nm) of torque from 4600 revolutions per minute with the performance-oriented exhaust system which is plenty enough for such a light vehicle. It’s also easier on the dinosaur juice than its predecessor with the Environmental Protection Agency rating it at 21 miles to the gallon (11.2 liters per 100 kilometers) on the combined testing cycle.The LT1 further sweetens the deal with available dry-sump oiling a camshaft-driven fuel pump for the DI System and the runners-in-a-box intake manifold that allows for high-efficiency airflow packaged beneath the Corvette’s hood line. Based on the design of the previous-generation LS7 the four-into-one exhaust manifolds are necessary to mention as well.Also for the 2014 model year General Motors launched the L83 and L86 truck engines that were developed into the L84 and L87. The primary difference between the L83/L86 and L84/L87 is Dynamic Fuel Management which is capable of alternating between 17 firing orders to save fuel whenever possible. As opposed to the four-cylinder AFM DFM is capable of running in two-cylinder mode which seems to be overkill in light-duty workhorses and utility vehicles such as the Silverado and Suburban.The LT4 was introduced for the 2015 model year in the Corvette Z06 then shoehorned under the hood of the 2017 model year Camaro ZL1. Loosely inspired by the LS9 from the sixth-generation Corvette ZR1 this lump is an LT1 with a thumpin’ great supercharger on top. The Roots-type blower is shared with the LT4 in the 2022 model year Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing which pumps out 668 horsepower and 659 pound-feet (893 Nm) of torque.General Motors followed suit with the LT5 in the supercar-shaming C7 Corvette ZR1 which is topped with a 2.6-liter Eaton TVS supercharging system and a beefier intercooler. The LT5 also combines direct injection with port injection marking the first dual-injection system offered by the Big G.The iron-block L8T sports a larger stroke than every other LT we’ve covered so far translating to 400 cubic inches or 6.6 liters of displacement. Developed for heavy-duty truck applications this engine makes over 11 percent more horsepower and 21 percent more torque compared to the previous gas engine for large trucks. Interestingly enough the L8T doesn’t flaunt Active Fuel Management Dynamic Fuel Management or start-stop.As for the latest and most radical member of the LT family the mid-engine Corvette Stingray features the all-aluminum LT2 with dry-sump lubrication. Moving the powerplant from the front to the middle of the car translates to redesigned exhaust manifolds relocated coil packs a different layout for the accessory drive and a rearward-facing throttle body. Of course GM has also modified the intake system to a significant degree. The intake plenum for example displaces 14.1 liters instead of the LT1’s 11.1 liters.Even the exhaust valve lift has been increased by 1 millimeter to improve the exhaust valve flow rate from 122 to 125 grams per second. The flywheel had to shrink because the engine sits so close to the ground and finally the torque-converter automatic of the seventh-generation Corvette Stingray had to be swapped for a dual-clutch automatic transmission supplied by Tremec.Although it’s not a V8 we couldn’t end this guide without mentioning the LV3. Often described as an LT1 with the two rearmost cylinders loped off the 4.3-liter V6 is a stout engine developing 285 horsepower and 305 pound-feet (414 Nm) of torque in the Silverado. Just like the 5.3- and 6.2-liter V8s described earlier the LV3 is marketed under the EcoTec3 moniker.Looking forward the 2023 model year will bring forth the LT6 in the Corvette Z06 a flat-plane crankshaft V8 that makes in the ballpark of 600 horsepower.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc0MjEzMTAvY2hldnJvbGV0LWJvbHQtZXYtcmVjYWxsLXJ1bGVzLXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not All Chevy Bolt EV Drivers Are Following Recall Rules: Study,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37421310/chevrolet-bolt-ev-recall-rules-problems/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc0MjEzMTAvY2hldnJvbGV0LWJvbHQtZXYtcmVjYWxsLXJ1bGVzLXByb2JsZW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Country-level data offers clues. The Washington Post analyzed available data and focused on three countries that offered revealing case studies: Peru Thailand and France.

Of the women who lost jobs in 2020 almost 90 percent exited the labor force completely compared with around 70 percent of men.

The first year of the pandemic knocked 54 million women around the world out of work widening the gender gap in employment. It could take years for that gap to narrow again.

Labor participation among men and women has always been unequal. Data from 55 countries shows a lower percentage of women employed than men. The pandemic made things worse. In several countries for which data is available women’s labor participation rates fell dramatically. Some countries were more affected than others. Eight countries had a more than 6 percentage-point drop in the rate of women’s labor force participation compared with the same period in 2019. Even in countries where the impact on women was less severe pandemic lockdowns caused millions of women to lose their jobs. But in those countries recovery has generally been easier.

Even more than men many women work in precarious conditions without job security regular hours or benefits. In Peru for example the pandemic has pushed more women than men out of formal employment. A year and a half in Claudia Huapaya 46 and many others are still struggling to care for children and elders while earning far less than before.

Women in many countries were disproportionately represented in the type of service-sector jobs — hospitality retail food service — that were devastated by lockdowns. In Thailand the sudden drop in tourism has put women including Pimonrat Sriprapat a 40-year-old tour guide out of work upending plans and prospects.

In France the social safety net failed to protect all women though early research suggests that social welfare programs may have cushioned the fall across the European Union. Andrea Watkins 50 and living in Paris lost her job but received unemployment payments and a spot in a job-training program for women over 40.

The three women — who spoke to The Post at length and whose stories are presented below in their own words — are among the millions who lost jobs globally according to estimates by the International Labor Organization (ILO) that show women’s employment declined by 54 million or 4.2 percent in 2020 compared with 3 percent for men.

“What the data are telling us is that it could take a generation longer to get to equality” said Saadia Zahidi managing director at the World Economic Forum. “There have been greater job losses for women than for men and the risk now is of an even more uneven return to work.”

Not only did women suffer a disproportionate share of job losses but research suggests that their hours of unpaid labor increased as they undertook more than their share of child care home schooling and elder care.

Although the full impact of the pandemic is not yet clear the fear is that the gender gap will widen both within and between countries said Sher Verick head of the ILO’s employment strategies unit. “The gains that have been made in recent decades” he said “you could lose that all in the response.”

In Peru ‘the informal economy is what people fall into’

Peru saw one of the world’s most dramatic drops in employment during the pandemic. The country went into strict lockdown in mid-March 2020 and by the end of June 2020 labor force participation rates had fallen 20 percentage points among men and 25 points among women data from the ILO shows.

Lima the capital has been hit hard. The number of women in the workforce initially fell by 55 percent in the city and had not returned to pre-pandemic rates by March of this year according to the Peruvian census agency.

Since that initial drop some women in Peru have been able to regain their footing in the job market but experts believe this is because women moved from the formal to the informal workforce where jobs are not regulated or protected by the state.

“The informal economy is what people fall into” said Carmen Roca Lima coordinator for Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing a research and policy network.

Claudia Huapaya 46 spent the pandemic in Lima with her husband and two of her children ages 18 and 15. Her older daughter 26 and her 5-year-old grandson live across town.

Claudia Huapaya 46 in the living room in Lima where she sleeps with her husband on a mattress. Before the pandemic she and her husband worked independently and the family lived in an apartment they were paying off. During the pandemic her husband sold the car he had used as a taxi driver and Huapaya's convenience store went out of business and they later moved with two of their children into a rental apartment. (Daniela Rivera Antara for The Washington Post)

Y ou’re talking to a mother of three children a person who worked. We had acquired an apartment with the bank. I had set up my own convenience store. My husband had managed to acquire a vehicle. My children were studying. Everything was going well.

We heard about the news about the virus first from other countries where the pandemic had already arrived. We didn’t expect that in Peru — that from one day to the next they would tell people that there was a curfew and no one could go out.

My husband is a driver a taxi driver of his own vehicle and overnight he couldn’t go out.

My mother had covid. I had to look out for her because I am the oldest daughter and to pay her costs.

My father was also sick and as result with my father’s sickness my husband also fell ill with covid. We also had to have him treated privately because here if you go to the state you die.

I started to sell off what I had in the shop and we were able to live off that. And like that five six seven months eight months went by and the business was finished.

Our savings for the house what we paid the down payment is gone. We lost everything.

In October I handed over our apartment to someone else who could pay and we had to leave and look for a rental somewhere to live.

We both started going out with great care with a kid staying at home to be able to pay the monthly rent. Searching and searching I found an ad for someone who was looking for home help.

The woman had a family with an elderly person who was in a care home and the woman had a house that was half-built empty.

In January I was living in this borrowed house and also working as a nanny. And bit by bit on Sundays I’ve also started selling meals again — meals that are traditional here in Peru — and earning some more income for the family starting from zero again after so much time.

I do everything. I’m looking after the pet. I’m looking after the old woman’s home. I do the cleaning. I look after the baby. I cook to sell. I sell perfumes. If you tell me that tomorrow there is some trash outside I’ll do it.

This is the capacity that many women here have: to find a way to earn a living however we can. You do whatever you have to. You don’t say “No I don’t know how I can’t.”

Huapaya worked during the early months of the pandemic at a restaurant where she cut her hand on a bottle. She now works as a house cleaner twice a month and as a nanny for another family and sells meals on Sundays. (Daniela Rivera Antara for The Washington Post)

I sometimes think “What if I had studied?” Because I think that people who studied and who use it to work for the state or to work in a company are better off than a person who didn’t study who works informally independently.

If I were a lawyer a teacher perhaps I would be working and having a slightly higher income. Perhaps I would have social security health insurance perhaps benefits? I don’t know.

My son is in ninth grade but he just goes to school by telephone. His phone is not great. The state doesn’t worry about that.

My second daughter I can’t give her anything right now. I feel like a failure — a failure is what I feel for not being able to give her the support and the help that she wants.

I had my business. It was my pride and joy. I have photos of my store. I started with four boxes of beer three boxes of sodas. I started with five packets of cookies. And I was able. I could. I managed it. I had it in my hand.

Thailand’s tourism collapse hit women harder

When pandemic-related travel restrictions hit Thailand’s tourism sector women bore the brunt: 339000 fewer women were employed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 5500 fewer male workers according to ILO data. In Thailand 30 percent of women work in sectors vulnerable to the economic effects of the pandemic such as retail manufacturing and accommodation and food services according to the ILO.

Women who have been able to return to work may not have found the same type of job or earn the same wages as before said Sara Elder senior economist at the ILO’s regional office for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok. “There’s a great sense of anxiety. You can feel it in the air.”

Pimonrat Sriprapat 40 spent years on the road as a tour guide based outside Bangkok. When the borders shut her job vanished.

B efore covid-19 I was working on a one-month trip to Indochina. The tourists at the time were mostly Americans Canadians and English.

I had been working with this company for about two years. The first year I was working with them as a freelancer. About a year later they promoted me to a full-time job. They have a name for this position that is different from other companies: CEO.

CEO is “chief experience officer” — the ones giving tourists experiences wherever we take them.

We started hearing that China had closed its borders and forbidden its people from leaving. Wuhan was in lockdown. I started to think “Oh damn this isn’t normal.”

The last day that I worked was March 22nd [of 2020]. The next day Thailand announced a border shutdown.

The very first thought was “Well it won’t be long.” I believe that a lot of people thought the same way — that it wouldn’t be long and it would end. The issue is it didn’t end.

They announced a lockdown.

I came back and was staying home full time. I was taking care of my mother. Well let’s say we take turns taking care of each other.

By the third week I started to stress out: Why couldn’t I go anywhere? Why can’t I work?

When everything was closed and we couldn’t travel anywhere in the world the company sent us emails to terminate the contracts of those in the full-time CEO position and to change us to freelance.

My income from the company was zero because the agreement in the contract states that they will pay based on the trips that I am assigned.

I still have my savings that I can use. That might last me until the end of this year.

For household expenses I have to rely on my mom.

In February things looked better.

I was contacted about multiple jobs to help with operations program writing and work on tours. I had discussions with companies that operate tours in Thailand.

Now news about the number of the cases or various clusters in Bangkok and outside Bangkok makes me realize that this time the third wave won’t end easily.

In my previous plan I planned my life that I would settle down and that I should start a business so that I could live my life and earn money.

If I invest and the business isn’t successful it would be like I burned my money. I have to stop and think: “Should I do this or not?”

I have to find a career as my second or third job or it can become a main job for me in the future.

If I have one career and something like covid-19 happens I will be drifting a capsized boat.

French social spending may help preserve women’s gains

The French government moved quickly to bolster the country’s safety net expanding partial unemployment benefits and supporting businesses. Although it is too soon to gauge the impact of specific programs there are signs that stimulus and social spending helped cushion the blow across the E.U.

Some European countries have begun to rebound. In the fourth quarter of 2020 employment rates for women ages 20 to 64 in France and much of the European Union returned to pre-pandemic levels according to data from Eurostat.

As countries begin to mull recovery programs Europe offers some lessons said Martina Bisello a research manager at the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.

But gender-specific social spending is needed to ensure that recent gains are not lost she said. “To make sure we are moving in the right direction the gender element has to be part of the plan.”

Andrea Watkins 50 was in Paris with her two daughters 12 and 20 as the city struggled through multiple lockdowns.

Andrea Watkins 50 lives in Paris near Montmartre hill and has often walked there since the start of the pandemic to clear her mind. During the pandemic she lost her job as an office manager for a software company. (Sandra Mehl for The Washington Post)

I think at the beginning we thought “Okay by tomorrow we’ll be fine. Everybody’s going back to their lives and it is going to be okay.” But not at all not at all.

I was working for a company that develops software to manage data on ICUs and was the office manager for France. I used to work in a very nice place here in Paris.

The youngest she didn’t have school. In March they stopped and she studied at home.

On school days they had classes the whole day and I was not able to work some days.

The main thing for us women is well it’s already difficult for us on the job market. It was difficult for us because most of us we had kids at home. If you’re working at home and you have small kids how in the world can you just concentrate in a meeting if you have a baby around? It’s sort of impossible.

The second [lockdown] was the most difficult for me because it was unexpected and I knew I was losing the job.

We only had one client and we were in the phase of looking for clients. So I knew it would be fatal for us. I started to walk to the Sacré-Coeur every day. There’s lots of hills in Montmartre. I walked like an hour a day and it was life-changing: arriving [at the top] and seeing the whole of Paris. The first week I would cry every day.

It was in January when I finally finished everything with the company and I went to what they call the unemployment agency.

I had a first meeting with a very kind person what they call an adviser. And at the end of the meeting he asked me what do you think would be an obstacle to you finding a job? And I just said “I’m 50 years old and we’re in the middle of a pandemic.”

It’s going to be difficult for everybody. But for a woman a 50-year-old woman it is going to be quite difficult.

Since January Watkins has been a volunteer at the MaMaMa organization in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. MaMaMa was formed by four women during the first pandemic lockdown and provides emergency boxes of food clothing and hygiene products to mothers and babies. (Sandra Mehl for The Washington Post)

I received an email from the unemployment agency: a program from the city of Paris to introduce women to technology and jobs.

It’s part of a program that is called Paris Code to introduce women to coding and technology because it is a man’s world. So there’s this program and they have a lot of classes and a lot of schools. And this program is particularly for women over 40.

It’s very sweet because my first day of classes my oldest daughter brought a cake for me and some flowers.

When I used to walk during the winter I used to arrive at the Sacré-Coeur and cry for a few minutes. Now I have a purpose. I have a project.

I just finished classes last Friday. I will continue to educate myself and take some new classes so that I can specialize myself. I know what I would like to learn so I think it’s a good start for me.

I am very happy with what I’m doing — for now. I don’t know what will happen in six months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvZGlwbG9tYWN5L2FydGljbGUvMzE0NjY3OC9jaGluZXNlLWludmVzdG9ycy1hcmUtYWdhaW4tcG91cmluZy1taWxsaW9ucy1hZnJpY2FzLWZpbnRlY2jSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hL2RpcGxvbWFjeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDY2NzgvY2hpbmVzZS1pbnZlc3RvcnMtYXJlLWFnYWluLXBvdXJpbmctbWlsbGlvbnMtYWZyaWNhcy1maW50ZWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese investors are again looking to Africa’s fintech start-ups,"They include OPay a mobile-payments platform based in Nigeria which last week said it had raised US$400 million in a funding round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 the investment vehicle of the Japanese conglomerate. It was also backed by a list of Chinese investors: DragonBall Capital Sequoia Capital China Source Code Capital Redpoint China and 3W Capital.

After more than a year of staying away funds are again looking at start-ups – particularly in fintech

An investment drought in Africa brought on by the coronavirus pandemic could be coming to an end as venture capitalists return to the continent especially from China.

With the new funding OPay is now valued at US$2 billion making it one of five tech unicorns – start-ups valued at over US$1 billion – in Africa. The others are Flutterwave Jumia Interswitch and Fawry.

“We want to be the power that helps emerging markets reach a faster economic development” OPay chief executive Zhou Yahui said in a statement on Wednesday.

The Chinese tycoon who founded online games firm Beijing Kunlun Technology Co and was the previous owner of dating app Grindr  set up OPay in 2018 and has helped attract other investors to Africa’s start-up scene.

Chinese venture capitalists pumped millions of dollars into start-ups on the continent between 2018 and 2019 but the economic uncertainty of the pandemic saw investors put the brakes on. Now they appear to be back looking for new opportunities in the emerging market.

OPay allows people to send and receive money and pay bills through its many agents and it has thrived in a region of 1.2 billion where many people are either unbanked or underbanked – meaning they might have a bank account but rely on alternative financial services – and where smartphone and internet use is expanding. OPay’s monthly transaction value has now surpassed US$3 billion.

The fintech company – developed by Kunlun’s Opera web browser unit – said it would use the new capital to boost its market position in Nigeria and Egypt and expand in other African nations and the Middle East. It said it had seen the biggest growth in registered accounts in those regions in the last five years and has millions of active users across Africa where the potential transaction value is estimated at US$490 billion.

“We believe our investment will help the company extend its offering to adjacent markets and replicate its successful business model in Egypt and other countries in the region” said Kentaro Matsui managing director of SoftBank Group

The group first invested in OPay through its venture capital arm Softbank Ventures Asia in 2019 as did several Chinese funds.

As well as Nigeria where the company is based founder Zhou is focusing heavily on Kenya where Opera is developing a platform for consumer lending apps OKash OPesa and Credit Hela to offer unsecured loans often without the need for the applicant to provide any credit history.

Others are also jumping into the market. Early this month another start-up Wapi Pay – headquartered in Kenya – raised US$2.2 million in pre-seed funding the earliest stage. Its target is global payments and remittances between Africa and Asia.

China-based investors include MSA Capital Transsion the largest seller of smartphones in Africa Gobi Partners and Future Hub.

Transsion has also invested in PalmPay – another Africa-focused payment start-up that launched in 2019 with US$40 million in seed funding including from Chinese tech firm NetEase and Taiwanese chip maker MediaTek.

Wapi Pay has offices in Nairobi Singapore and the Chinese city of Tianjin and provides a payments gateway for African businesses to send and receive money from Asia via mobile platforms and bank accounts. Co-founder Eddie Ndichu said the initial capital raised would be used to diversify the company’s product range and drive growth “so that we can evolve remittances into real-time global cross-border payments starting with Africa and Asia – all while minimising the cost of transactions”.

Ndichu said Chinese and Asian investors had seen the opportunity in African start-ups especially in financial and other technology.

“I think like everyone else not Chinese alone adoption of technology by Africans is at an all-time high and penetration of mobile phones is also high” he said. “Africa is a very young market the average age is below 25 years it is where the future lies for the adoption of technology.”

Wapi Pay investor MSA Capital a global fund headquartered in Beijing said Africa to Asia was a large trading corridor that had been overlooked and was underserved by tech firms.

“We are excited to support our extensive China fintech network and playbook” the company said.

Thomas Tsao co-founder of venture capital firm Gobi Partners echoed that view saying there was a tremendous opportunity for investors in connecting Africa with Asia. He said recent investments in start-ups on the continent were just the “tip of the iceberg” and more Chinese venture capitalists would go looking for opportunities in the emerging market. “The market is huge and it has been relatively underserved but people are now starting to pay attention” said Tsao whose company is based in Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur.

Gobi Partners was one of the first to invest in Wapi Pay and also partnered with Transsion to invest in Future Hub a China-Africa incubator and venture ­capital fund. Future Hub has in turn invested in Nigerian start-up Termii a messaging and analytics company.

Tsao said interest from Chinese investors would be “particularly strong” as many saw parallels in Africa with the situation in China 20 years ago when the country’s GDP per capita was very low.

“The Chinese market quickly developed through technology and innovation” he said. “When you look at Africa a lot of people say it lacks infrastructure and has a large unbanked population but investors in China would see this as something they are familiar with and see it as an opportunity” Tsao said. “It is the beginning of an exciting phase for Africa.”

It followed a 40000-square-foot deal for Reddit in the publisher’s no-longer-needed space. Advance parent of Condé Nast plans to unload 400000 of its total 1.1 million square feet.

The asking rent for the Condé sublease space is in the $60s per square foot The Post reported earlier this month.

As we first reported on Aug. 1 peace broke out between Advance and the Durst Organization the tower’s managing and leasing agent after the media giant dropped its threat to leave and also paid nearly $10 million for four months’ back rent.

The settlement included Durst’s agreement to “collaborate” with JLL on Advance’s sublease effort by being flexible and helping to “facilitate” any deals. It was understood that Durst’s cooperation would cut red tape and shorten the time for landlord approval of subtenancies.

Constellation which will move from 110 William St. nearby offers tech-enabled marketing and creative services through a proprietary advertising engine. The company provides a hybrid approach to advertising through internal and client-facing technology tools.

JLL tristate President Peter Riguardi said that the still-available Advance space at One World Trade “provides tenants with significant flexibility spectacular views and access to abundant amenities.”

The main finding of the Partnership for New York City’s revised survey of how many employees would return to their offices this fall was widely reported — namely that 41 percent would be back after Labor Day down from a pre-Delta estimate of 62 percent last May.

But some intriguing details went mostly overlooked. Among them:

* The real estate industry perhaps not surprisingly accounts for the highest percentage of employees in their offices — 85 percent up from 70 percent in May.

* In financial services 29 percent of employees were at their office terminals up from 14 percent.

* Large companies with 5000-plus employees contributed most to the summer’s overall physical-occupancy uptick — climbing from 8 percent in late May to 25 percent in late August.

Currently Manhattan office buildings are only about 21 percent occupied although rent is being paid on 95 percent of space according to major landlords and industry analysts.

The Partnership projected that 76 percent of employees would be back by January based on a survey of companies. But that of course could be chopped should another dangerous variant emerge. Nervous landlords are crossing fingers that it won’t.

How badly did Lower Manhattan empty of residents after the pandemic struck?

Very badly at first according to some revealing new data from the Alliance for Downtown — but an ongoing rebound is gradually putting life back on the streets.

Of 64000 pre-pandemic residents in the Alliance’s territory (which roughly extends to Chamber Street but doesn’t include Battery Park City) about 40 percent moved away starting in March 2020 according to cell phone data obtained by the organization.

But today the live-in population “is currently nearing daily levels seen in early 2020” the Alliance report said.

Alliance President Jessica Lappin further clarified “As of July we were back to nearly 84 percent.”



There’s still a way to go but the return trend bodes well for the district where office vacancy of nearly 20 percent is the highest of any Manhattan commercial zone.

The delivery start-up founded by a pair of Drexel University students has expanded across the United States and Europe partnered with tech giant Uber and more than tripled its valuation to $15 billion — all within the last year. Based on North Third Street just north of Spring Garden Street it now delivers beer snacks and toiletries in more than 1000 cities. It could be the next big thing in on-demand delivery.

But as GoPuff grows it’s facing a backlash from drivers. Much like Lyft DoorDash and other gig economy firms GoPuff drivers are mostly deemed independent contractors. Their pay can rise and fall like a roller coaster based on supply and demand. And it has dropped by hundreds of dollars a week in recent months drivers report.

Those complaints spilled into public view in July when GoPuff drivers released a petition demanding better pay and working conditions. More than 600 workers across the country signed it according to Working Washington a pro-labor group that’s organizing drivers.

» READ MORE: With goPuff Philly got a tech unicorn with a household name. Now what? | Opinion

The open letter calls for “an hourly guarantee that pays a living wage after mileage and other expenses” that drivers cover like gasoline and car maintenance.

The workers also said that in a way GoPuff represents the worst of both worlds in the gig economy. GoPuff unlike others of its kind encourages drivers to sign up for scheduled shifts yet does not provide them with the benefits given regular employees.

These issues recently reached a flash point back home in Philadelphia. In an Aug. 4 email GoPuff told drivers at its Passyunk Square facility in South Philadelphia that it would slash their minimum guaranteed pay from $12 an hour to $8.50. The announcement first reported by Business Insider was made five days after GoPuff raised its latest $1 billion from investors. There were similar cuts in at least 47 other facilities according to Working Washington.

Some drivers became so angry that they discussed not showing up to a shift in protest according to messages on a scheduling app that GoPuff drivers use. One called for a “revolution or a riot.”

GoPuff had no direct response to the petition. It did say that the higher $12 “subsidy” — the guaranteed hourly rate that drivers earn if there are few orders during a shift — was always meant to be temporary. But GoPuff officials acknowledged that they never told some drivers that the subsidy increase in May wasn’t permanent.

“During an internal audit we identified that a limited number of delivery partners received an email that did not specify the duration of the earnings adjustment” a GoPuff spokesperson said. “This is inconsistent with our goal to provide earnings transparency. As we grow we will continue to invest in and improve our communications channels with delivery partners.”

How GoPuff drivers are paid

GoPuff makes it simple for customers charging a flat fee of $1.95 per delivery. GoPuff says it makes money by buying products in bulk and pricing them at market rates.

It’s more complicated for drivers who are paid through a combination of commissions tips subsidies and other incentives. The pay structure can be confusing and can change their compensation drastically drivers told The Inquirer. They said the firm has occasionally miscalculated their pay too.

GoPuff drivers currently earn $18 to $22 an hour on average across the United States according to the company.

The Inquirer interviewed seven Philadelphia drivers who split on whether they earned that much. One driver said he made $9 an hour during a recent shift while another said she collected $25 an hour.

Drivers said it depends on order volume when they work and whether there are incentives for those shifts. It also depends on how many hours they work. Drivers noted that the hourly pay doesn’t factor in expenses such as gasoline. And the pay has generally gotten worse lately drivers said.

Generally the pay structure works like this:

GoPuff drivers earn a commission that ranges from $2.25 to $5 per order. Commissions can vary by city or neighborhood. For example drivers for the Passyunk Square facility said they earn $3 per delivery. In Manayunk it’s $2.75.

“What we are told at the Manayunk facility is that we’re in a good area and the tips are better in this area so we don’t deserve more than $2.75” said Candace Hinson a 29-year-old driver from Roxborough.

GoPuff will “boost” commissions for certain shifts often overnight that can increase pay by $1 to $8 an order depending on the day according to company texts and emails. The company told drivers about upcoming boosts days or even hours before they began.

On top of that GoPuff pays weekly bonuses to drivers who rack up high numbers of deliveries. Drivers keep all of their tips.

Finally there is the so-called subsidy which sets an hourly earnings floor for drivers who schedule their shifts in advance. For example if a Passyunk Square driver’s weekly earnings amount to just $6 an hour from orders GoPuff pitches in extra money to achieve the guaranteed hourly minimum of $8.50.

“Given the fast-moving nature of our industry we will make adjustments to partner compensation to balance a continuously changing supply-and-demand dynamic in each market we serve” a GoPuff spokesperson said. “This is industry standard and we do so to ensure delivery partner earnings are not adversely affected as best as possible.”

By using independent contractors instead of staffers gig economy companies such as GoPuff don’t have to pay for drivers’ health insurance or vacation time.

But the biggest savings with the gig industry is paying people for the time they’re most productive said Gad Allon the Wharton School’s director for the management and technology program.

“It allows you to scale up or down based on demand. It allows you to pay people only for the time they’re actually productive in their delivery” Allon said. “So you’re not paying for their cost when they’re sitting on the corner waiting for something to happen.”

GoPuff which has about 8000 employees in offices and warehouses would not say how many independent contractors it uses to deliver orders. The company’s website said it has 15 locations in the Philly area in Bala Cynwyd Bensalem Cheltenham Elkins Park Feasterville Gladwyne Jenkintown Malvern Manayunk Merion Station Narberth Newtown Square Passyunk Square Trevose and Wyncote.

Fewer deliveries

For some drivers GoPuff was a good gig for a while. There were plenty of orders to go around especially at the peak of the pandemic.

And GoPuff was seen as a better job than gig economy rivals such as Instacart which requires delivery workers to weave through aisles of grocery stores to grab items. GoPuff runs its own warehouses with staffers who prepare bags and hand them to drivers.

But now some drivers said they are getting fewer deliveries and earning less money. They said the company has partnered with too many drivers reducing the number of deliveries for any worker per trip. This they add has made longer drives across the city less profitable when accounting for gas mileage.

Two drivers said they at times made as much as $1000 in a week or $33 an hour last year. Now they earn about $500 or about $17 an hour.

“Our money is decreasing drastically because we’re not getting the same amount [of deliveries]” said Hinson the driver from Roxborough. “There are times where I’ll go in and I’ll work at night and I’ll get a bag. I’ll come back and I have to wait 45 minutes until I get another one or two bags.”

In GoPuff’s Ludlow facility south of Temple University in North Philadelphia GoPuff temporarily boosted pay in May as it had drivers deliver to just one customer per run according to an internal email.

The firm aimed to cut the time drivers spent waiting in line for orders and deliver bags to customers faster. GoPuff advertises deliveries that take half an hour.

But the Ludlow pay bump has since expired. The single-customer trips are less profitable for drivers who pay their own gas mileage. The Ludlow driver says she now at most delivers to two customers a trip. She used to make about 80 deliveries in a 20- to 25-hour workweek she said. Now she handles only 40 deliveries.

There are drivers who are happy at GoPuff. Julius Hayes a 74-year-old from Mount Airy is retired and delivers orders to make extra cash for his grandchildren.

He said it’s an easy job that doesn’t require much contact with customers during the pandemic and he generally likes the managers who assign him orders. Hayes noted that he’s in a different situation from other drivers who rely on GoPuff as their primary income.

“For me if I can average in a five-day week or even a four-day week $500? Well that’s like gold to me” Hayes said.

GoPuff’s global growth

Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola were sophomores at Drexel when they came up with the idea behind GoPuff. According to the company’s website they found shopping for snacks and essentials time-consuming on top of schoolwork and their social lives. They drafted mock-ups of the app on class notes and delivered convenience items around campus from the back of a Plymouth Voyager minivan.

Eight years later and fueled by $2.5 billion from investors just since 2020 GoPuff has bought up rivals and expanded across North America and into France Spain and the United Kingdom.

Since last year the company has acquired the California liquor delivery service BevMo! a U.K.-based last-mile delivery platform called Fancy and another European delivery service named Dija.

GoPuff also reached a deal to deliver Items for Uber Eats customers a partnership reportedly under federal scrutiny as anticompetitive. The company has expanded its offerings to include hot meals such as chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks too.

That rapid growth has gotten the attention of the labor advocacy group Working Washington which the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) helped found in 2011. The group which published the GoPuff petition online takes credit for pushing Instacart and DoorDash to reverse policies that took some tips from drivers.

GoPuff is in some ways unique from those other gig delivery firms because drivers are encouraged to work scheduled shifts and are managed by company staffers but remain independent contractors said Working Washington spokesperson Sage Wilson.

Drivers Wilson said “don’t get the benefits of employment don’t get the flexibility to be a contractor. They just get whatever GoPuff wants to give them.”

Working Washington is in contact with hundreds of GoPuff drivers and evaluating next steps for its campaign he added. Their immediate demand is for GoPuff to reverse the recent cuts to driver subsidies.

Up to this point the priority for GoPuff was to grow the business according to Wharton’s Allon. But there is pressure from investors to show that the business is sustainable too. That could either mean raising prices for consumers or decreasing pay for drivers.

“Customers are not going to be willing to pay more and the drivers will not be willing to work for lower pay” Allon said. “So what you’ll see in the next few years is a lot of tugging back and forth between the two pressures.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA4LTI5L2FtYXpvbi1mbGV4LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRyaXZlcnMtdm9pY2Utc2FmZXR5LWNvbmNlcm5zLzEwMDQwNDQ5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Flex delivery drivers tell of insecurity low pay and safety concerns in 'uber for parcels' scheme,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-29/amazon-flex-delivery-drivers-voice-safety-concerns/100404498 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA4LTI5L2FtYXpvbi1mbGV4LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRyaXZlcnMtdm9pY2Utc2FmZXR5LWNvbmNlcm5zLzEwMDQwNDQ5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

When Jordan Talty fainted at the nail salon just before Christmas 2019 she described it as “peaceful.”

After going through several tests including an EKG the 2021 Reading High graduate was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia or POTs a condition that affects blood flow. She worried it would signal the end of her burgeoning figure skating career.

But through two medications increasing her sodium intake and working with a sports psychologist to control her breathing Talty has been able to continue competing culminating this summer when she was named the Bay State Games’ Female Athlete of the Year.

Talty said POTs which often result in lightheadedness or fainting when standing up has never affected her during competition although it has occurred while practicing.

“I’ve had to sit down and almost passed out” she said. “I get head rushes and my heart gets really fast.”

Talty first learned to skate at age 2 and remembers landing her first axel at age 8. She grew up training at Burbank Ice Arena and competed in her first Bay State Games in 2012 winning gold in pre-preliminary test track. She returned in 2013 and 2017 when she won gold in the open free skate advanced to the State Games of Americas and brought home two medals. She returned in 2019 to pick up five medals (three gold two bronze).

This summer she won gold in the senior ladies short program and captured silver in senior ladies frees kate. Last week she received the email notifying her of her Athlete of the Year honor.

“I wasn’t expecting it at all” she said. “I was in a little bit of shock. It was nice to have that senior year as a final thing.”

While training was tough from March to June 2020 when rinks were shuttered due to COVID-19 she’s been back on the ice for the last year under the watchful eye of her longtime coach Amy Hanson-Kuleszka.

“She’s like a second mother” Talty said. “I give her a lot of credit.”

Talty who took first in ladies intermediate at the 2019 Excel National Festival left this week to attend Michigan State where she will skate for the school’s figure skating club. She plans to major in biomedical laboratory and go into a career in forensics. She’s also considering coaching figure skating.

“If I really don’t like my major I would consider being a coach” she said. “I think that’s something I would definitely enjoy.”

Spending and saving are unquestionably a big part of being financially responsible even for a teenager. Marsai Martin recently sat down with Margaret Anadu the Global Head of Sustainability & Impact at Goldman Sachs for an episode of In the Know: Money with Marsai Martin to talk how to spend money wisely. Take a look at what the pair had to say below.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CS_9yD9npH4/

Martin asks Anadu to weigh in on spending money to make money

“You have to spend money to make money” and how it applies to everyday spending. “You can spend money in a way where it is 100% out the door” Anadu begins. “Like if you buy a way too expensive dress that you’re never gonna wear. That’s not gonna pay back dividends. But if you’re investing in your education or you realize in your community you’re gonna need a car to get to school or get to a job that’s an investment that’s gonna make you money over time.”

Martin asks Anadu to weigh in on cash vs. credit cards



Frequently when performing their own personal finance health check many wonder whether they should be using cash or plastic. Anadu has some great advice.

“You never want to borrow for something that isn’t going to increase in value” says Anadu. “So if you’re using a credit card to buy [a shirt] and that shirt is $20 and you’re using a credit card to buy it it doesn’t cost you $20. It costs you $20 plus all of the interest on that credit card. And so that shirt the second you buy it it’s going down in value so why are you letting it cost you more with that interest on that credit card?”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CH8e87hHVYL/

Martin asks Anadu what to do when cash isn’t an option

“I think there’s a difference between credit cards where you’re really borrowing money and just cards that are your debit card or it’s a card that’s actually just linked to cash you have in your bank account” says Anadu. “So you can definitely use electronic forms of payment that are still just a way of using cash or the money that you have. Or a lot of people for example they’ll use credit cards because they love the points. But they’re paying off that credit card every single month in full so they’re not paying all that interest over time.”

Martin asks Anadu to give us all some solid spending advice

Anadu wisely states that spending is all about choices.

“You wanna make sure that you’re spending your money in a way that’s investing in your future that’s gonna somehow make you more money or quite frankly make you happy” she explains. “So I think with every single choice with every single dollar just say ‘Is this what I wanna be spending my money on? Is this who I wanna be spending my money with? Is this how I wanna be spending my money?’ Because it’s an important choice. I just think it’s really important for teens to start with that healthy relationship with money from early on and I think that’s just a way to be more thoughtful about it.”

Now his agency might be in charge of regulating the volatile and often murky crypto market.

Gensler is a rarity in Washington: he understands the technology he's trying to rein in.

Washington has historically been in short supply of lawmakers and enforcers who actually understand the technology they're seeking to regulate.

Gary Gensler is among those changing that.

He's the new chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission an agency that might also be responsible for creating rules in the volatile and wildly popular crypto space.

But before joining in April he taught blockchain technology at MIT — he can quote Satoshi Nakamoto the mysterious Bitcoin creator from memory Bloomberg reported.

So he's not against the burgeoning $1.6 trillion crypto world but he's also called it the ""Wild West."" The once-niche decentralized currency has plunged into the mainstream in recent years worrying regulators like Gensler who want to throw up guard rails to protect customers from fraud scams and market manipulation — a reality that some crypto fanatics aren't too keen on.

Gensler 63 has a background in blockchain technology and financial policy has years of government service under his belt and spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs where he became a partner in the Mergers and Acquisitions department.

In 2002 Gensler — a progressive — helped create the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which became a defining piece of legislation to protect investors from corporate fraud following high-profile scandals like those involving Enron.

President Obama appointed him to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2009 and he served until 2014.

Then Gensler a graduate of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania started teaching at MIT in 2018 including a course called Blockchain and Money — meaning he's interested in cryptocurrencies but has said that doesn't mean he's against protecting investors.

What does Gensler want to do?

Then-CFTC chair Gary Gensler in 2012. J. Scott Applewhite/AP

For one he asked Congress to pass a law allowing the SEC to monitor all crypto exchanges and he's open to possibly green-lighting a Bitcoin-focused ETF.

Gensler told Bloomberg this month that digital currencies could be a boon for economic progress but only if they have robust regulation. He likened it to the auto industry going mainstream when traffic lights and speed limits were introduced.

The SEC is currently eyeing how to rein in multiple areas of the crypto space including stablecoins lending platforms and decentralized finance or DeFi he told the outlet.

There's disagreement on Capitol Hill about who should police crypto

Former CFTC chair Christopher Giancarlo is among those who thinks the SEC shouldn't be charged with policing crypto. Mike Blake/Reuters

Right now there isn't a specific government agency whose job it is to monitor crypto-related happenings. And before crypto regulation is assigned to the SEC or the CFTC law enforcers need to agree on what cryptotokens are.

Are they commodities? Investments? In 2018 Gensler said they're both.

""I know that's not an answer that a lot of people like but that's kind of where we are right now"" he said in an MIT blog post in 2018.

Bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency is a commodity thanks to the Commodity Exchange Act. But thousands of others like ether don't have an official designation — however Gensler thinks they're securities which would mean he and the SEC would police the digital assets.

Some don't agree with that though.

CFTC Republican Commissioner Brian Quintenz said earlier this month that the SEC ""has no authority over pure commodities or their trading venues whether those commodities are wheat gold oil….or #crypto assets.""

Former CFTC head and Republican Christopher Giancarlo said something similar.

""Only one US regulatory agency has experience regulating markets for #Bitcoin & #Crypto and it is not @SECGov"" he tweeted.

The listing of LIC is set to be India's biggest ever IPO with the government aiming to raise Rs 800 billion-900 billion ($11 bln-12.2 bln) from its stake sale.

In all the government plans to raise Rs 1.75 trillion from a privatisation programme in the current fiscal year ending in March one of the sources said.

It has selected 10 investment banks including Goldman Sachs Citigroup and SBI Capital Market to handle the LIC initial public offering the two government sources said.

The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.

""The potential size of the IPO is expected to be far larger than any precedent in Indian markets"" one of the sources said adding the LIC IPO has been put on a fast track as it could help partly meet budgetary spending plans.

The government plans to spend Rs 34.83 trillion including capital spending of Rs 5.54 trillion in the current financial year.

A ministerial panel called the Alternative Mechanism on strategic Divestment is expected to decide soon on the size of the stake to be sold. It could be around 10% sold in two tranches the two government sources said.

Sixteen banks including seven global banks and nine domestic bank had been in the race to handle the IPO.

The other selected lenders are JM Financial Ltd Axis Capital Nomura BofA Securities J.P. Morgan India Pvt Ltd ICICI Securities and Kotak Mahindra said the source who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

JP Morgan Citigroup BofA and Goldman Sachs declined to comment while Nomura JM Finance Axis Kotak and others were not immediately available for a comment.

A finance ministry spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

The roadshows would be held in coming months in all major global financial centres to attract investors and the government would make all efforts to attract retail investors and employees to invest in the company one of the sources said.

LIC with assets of over Rs 34 trillion ($461.4 billion) has a subsidiary in Singapore and joint ventures in Bahrain Kenya Sri Lanka Nepal Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh.

Bank privatisation

The government had previously announced plans to sell at least two state-run banks in the current fiscal year as part of its privatisation plans and to consolidate state banks but has not named the banks.

Plans to privatise the proposed two banks were going slowly due to various procedural issues as well as internal assessments indicating limited appetite among investors to buy at the desired value said one of the sources a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter.

Another banking industry source who participated in discussions said despite a bullish market there were few takers for weak banks saddled with bad loans.

""There have been discussions on the sale of banks but thinking now has shifted to first look at monetising other assets and then come to banks after that"" the source said."

By Ronni Newton



The look and feel of “back to school” for the 2021-2022 academic year will be much closer to “normal” than it was last year with all students attending in-person classes the return of all fall sports (with fans other than possibly for girls volleyball) regular (rather than block) schedules at the secondary schools extracurricular activities and lunch periods.

School begins for all students on Wednesday Sept. 1.

Superintendent Tom Moore sat down with We-Ha.com Thursday and his message for families is that returning to school this fall should be a time for optimism and hope.

“I hope that we’ve earned your trust over the past year and a half” he said. “Don’t confuse my desire to get kids in school as a blasé attitude toward health and safety. If I have to make hard decisions I will but the best place for kids is in West Hartford Public Schools” he said.

Moore announced earlier this month that all individuals – students teachers other staff guests – regardless of vaccination status will be expected to wear masks while inside the school buildings or on buses at least through Sept. 30 in accordance with Gov. Ned Lamont’s executive order requiring masks in schools.

The governor reiterated that requirement during an Aug. 17 press conference. His executive order however will expire at the end of September unless extended or codified by the state legislature.

Enrollment and staffing

After a decline in enrollment for the 2020-2021 academic year this year the district is far ahead of its projected number of students.

“Right now there’s at least going to be 100 more elementary students” Moore said.

Some of it is because people held their kindergartners back last year but a large percentage of the growth is due to what’s been happening with real estate in town.

The elementary level is when people tend to move into the district Moore said and the housing trends in West Hartford have led to a surge in elementary age students.

It used to be that elementary class lists were sent out on Aug. 1 he said. Then it moved to Aug. 1o. This year the class lists were distributed on Aug. 11 and already there have been four new classes added.

“At Duffy we had nine more move-ins in one weekend” Moore said.

ESSER II funds are being used to hire new teachers. “We are committed to keeping classes small” Moore said and as of Aug. 25 the average elementary school class size was less than 19 students.

There are 205 elementary school sections for 2021-2022 rather than the 195 planned he said.

The goal is to have 3 feet of space between students in classrooms. It’s not a set requirement Moore said but within the constraints of classroom sizes they are trying to space desks as far apart as possible.

Elementary school classes are the smallest they have ever been with the exception of last year when 20% of students were in the Remote Learning Experience (RLE).

RLE will not exist this year.

“I understand fear and concern but here’s what we know” Moore said. “West Hartford did hybrid and remote learning better than anywhere … but the learning loss we know is tremendous. The social and emotional loss – it’s not how we make a society better.”

Parents who choose not to send their children to school can home school them or utilize lesson modules offered by the state.

“Public schools have to be public but they are not schools of choice” Moore said. The state is not supporting remote learning and the district can’t afford to do it.

To run the RLE last year which was the district’s largest school staff was pulled from various other positions to which they have returned including tutors and other important support roles.

There are about 60 new teachers in this district this year some replacing staff who have retired or moved on and many filling positions due to increased enrollment as well as new special education and social and emotional support roles that are being funded through ESSER II. Many of the new teachers have extensive experience in other districts.

“It’s a really strong group” Moore said and includes eight West Hartford Public Schools alumni.

There are five new administrators beginning the year including Melissa Caballero who was appointed director of Pupil Services following the retirement of Gretchen Nelson on June 30 and Melissa Hickey who was previously in an interim role but has been appointed an assistant principal at Hall High School.

Masks sports/extracurriculars and vaccines

“I hope at some point masks can go away” Moore said particularly at the high schools where all students are old enough to be fully vaccinated.

He said when the vaccine is approved for those younger than 12 the district will once again host clinics to ensure easy access so as many students can be vaccinated as quickly as possible.

Masks will be required for everyone inside school buildings other than while eating lunch and must be worn on buses but will not be required outdoors. There will be opportunity for mask breaks for all.

Participants in sports will not be required to wear masks Moore said other than for girls volleyball. Other than girls swimming and diving girls volleyball is the only indoor fall sport.

Football returns along with full seasons and championships for other traditional fall sports this year and boys golf also has a fall season. Football practice began Aug. 16 and other sports began practice Aug. 26. Competition begins on Sept. 9 with the exception of golf which begins on Aug. 31.

Fan attendance will not be restricted for any outdoor sports and Moore said the fan policy is still TBD for girls volleyball.

“I want parents grandparents friends to see kids play” he said. Night games are community events and are on the schedule. The annual Conard vs. Hall football game also a community event is scheduled for Saturday Nov. 20 at 1:30 p.m. at Hall.

“I’m excited to have events again” Moore said. When weather permits as much as possible will take place outdoors including choir practice.

Field trips were a casualty of COVID-19 for the 2020-2021 academic year and while there won’t be any in the first month “I am confident during this school year that kids will get to do field trips” Moore said. “I know the value of them.”

Now that there is a vaccine mandate for Connecticut teachers – announced by the governor on Aug. 19 – staff members will need to report their vaccination status to the district by Sept. 27 Moore said. He said he will provide the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated employees as soon as he has the information.

“By Sept. 27 anybody not vaccinated will have to do weekly testing and submit evidence” Moore said. There are three choices: vaccination weekly testing or “you can’t work for West Hartford Public Schools” he said.

“Staff members want their colleagues vaccinated and families want to know that their children are safe in school” Moore said. Had the governor not issued a mandate he said the district was considering its own mandate.

Lunchtime

“The biggest fear people have are lunches” Moore said. During the last academic year there were dramatic accommodations with only grab and go lunch available at the secondary schools and elementary students eating either at their desks or outdoors.

In West Hartford a tremendous percentage of middle and high school students are vaccinated. According to data released Thursday by the state among 12-17 years olds in West Hartford 87.81% have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine while 79.4% are fully vaccinated.

“Delta’s different; I get that” Moore said but he also noted that while middle and high school students will once again have a lunch period they won’t be crammed together in a crowded cafeteria.

The space and ventilation in school cafeterias is actually much greater than in classrooms he said. Overflow spaces will also be used to allow for extra space for students to eat and many will also be able to eat outside.

Meals – breakfast and lunch – are available to all students in West Hartford Public Schools free of charge due to an extension of the the U.S. Department of Agriculture waivers Tim Prosinksi director of Food Services said.

“One of the hidden benefits of this [COVID-19] crisis is being able to talk about and eradicate food insecurity for our kids” Moore said. There are no forms for free and reduced lunch and all students can have breakfast and lunch at school if they need or want it.

The type of food being served at West Hartford Public Schools is not impacted by the extension of the USDA waivers Moore said.

Building improvements and buses

Summer is always the time when major school building projects take place but supply chain and material shortages have prolonged or delayed some of the work.

“There’s a lot of backlog in the supplies and materials and not a lot of people available to do the work” said Andy Morrow assistant superintendent for administration.

The roof projects at Sedgwick and Hall are in fine shape he said.

As part of the revamping of security throughout the district another large project was rebuilding the Whiting Lane office. It will be substantially complete for the return to school other than a few finishing touches Morrow said. There are finishing touches remaining for flooring and paving projects at schools throughout the district as well but they won’t impact the opening.

Shade structures and tents have been on order for schools since May. “They’re all on their way” Morrow said and expected in mid-September.

Buses will be at regular capacity Morrow said. “We will continue to have windows open and everyone will have to wear masks” he said.

Bus driver shortages have made news headlines and Morrow said he has continued to have conversations with West Hartford’s bus companies First Student and Specialty Transportation.

While they have workforce challenges “the last word we had is that they have their routes covered and drivers in place” Morrow said.

The first week or two may be challenging due to some new drivers on the routes but overall Morrow said he doesn’t expect major problems with buses.

What are other COVID-related changes?

In addition to masks smaller classes and the use of overflow spaces for lunch a few other things will look different in West Hartford Public Schools this fall.

Water fountains will still be off limits but water bottle filling stations will be available.

“Standard cleaning practices work” Moore said and there will no longer be daily deep cleaning of all school spaces.

“We invested nearly $200000 in re-engineering our ventilation systems” said Moore. While some buildings are old all will be operating at their optimal ventilation levels.

Moore said that two weeks ago he didn’t think there would be a need for a COVID dashboard but due to the Delta variant-fueled surge that thinking has changed. The district prides itself on transparency and while it may not be updated daily “there will be a dashboard” he said.

Students and staff who are fully vaccinated will no longer need to quarantine if they are exposed to COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic. In addition the policy indicates that “students seated 3 feet or more from another student diagnosed with COVID-19 do not need to quarantine as long as they remain asymptomatic and masks are in place.”

There is a recommendation that all who are exposed get tested two to three days after exposure and they will be asked to wear masks as much as possible even outside of school buildings.

Because of the high level of vaccination among eligible students in grades 7 through 12 the quarantine numbers should be dramatically lower than last. year.

“We will have kids test positive like last year we will have kids in quarantine like last year but the vast majority of cases are going to come from non-school settings” Moore said.

A variety of testing options through the state that could provide useful for the district are being investigated he added.

Convocation was completely virtual last year. Moore said the district determined it was not a good idea to bring 900 teachers together in the Conard auditorium for the annual event this year. Instead there will be 16 separate in-person welcoming events for staff at each school. Moore has recorded a video message which all will have a chance to view.

Important message to school community

“Please don’t send your kids to school if they don’t feel good. You’ve got to monitor them daily” Moore said.

Teachers also need to stay home if they don’t feel well.

In addition to ensuring their kids are healthy before coming to school Moore asked parents to be positive.

“Kids are always learning. They watch us they see us they feel our emotions” he said. “It’s not the time for fear and despair; it’s the time for optimism and hope.

“If you think our country is headed down the wrong path the only way to right our ship of state is through education” he said.

Piedmont Healthcare’s service area now covers about 85 percent of Georgians following its acquisition Aug. 1 of four hospitals through a sale to be funded with $1 billion of debt according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service.

These acquisitions combine with Piedmont’s existing network to set the stage for continued expansion analysts wrote in a rating action released Aug. 16:

“This statewide presence will enable the Piedmont Clinic PHC’s clinically integrated physician network and market differentiator to continue to expand into new markets and attract independent physician groups.”

One such expansion is in Augusta where Piedmont Healthcare has signed a letter of intent to acquire University Health according to the rating action.

The four facilities new to Piedmont are in regions of growing population according to the Census report released Aug. 12: Snellville Cartersville and Macon.

Together the facilities add 882 beds to Piedmont’s network. The figure includes an in-patient behavioral health facility in Macon according to a statement issued by the entity that sold the four hospitals HCA Healthcare of Nashville Tn. The statement does not indicate how many of the beds are set up and staffed capable of serving patients.

HCA announced on May 3 the sale to Piedmont Healthcare of the following four facilities for a total of about $950 million:

Snellville: Eastside Medical Center 310 beds;

Cartersville: Cartersville Medical Center 119 beds;

Macon: Two facilities – Coliseum Health System and its two acute care hospitals Coliseum Medical Centers 310 beds; and Coliseum Northside 103 beds; plus Coliseum Center for Behavioral Health with 40 beds for inpatient treatment.

The credit rating released Aug. 16 by Moody’s indicates analysts are fairly optimistic Piedmont will be able to service its debt – which will total about $2.4 billion once this latest round is sold. Piedmont reported $3.9 billion in operating revenues in fiscal 2020 according to the rating action.

The analysts reported that Piedmont’s past performance in absorbing acquisitions informed their decision to issue a credit rating of upper-medium grade on the planned bond issue. Analysts wrote:

“The A1 rating is further supported by management’s demonstrated ability to effectively integrate several acquisitions in recent years.”

Another document from Moody’s a credit opinion issued Aug. 18 expanded on the theme of Piedmont’s proven ability to absorb its purchases and continue to post operating revenues:

“PHC has demonstrated the ability to effectively and quickly integrate acquired assets as demonstrated in particular by the acquisition of Athens Regional in 2016 and Columbus Regional in 2018.”

However analysts also have provided cautionary warnings. In 2018 Moody’s provided a negative outlook on the credit rating and noted that potential headwinds include the inability to absorb acquisitions while sustaining strong revenues; pressure from payers that could reduce the system’s market share and – in a nod to Piedmont’s expansion plans – “Additional acquisitions that will impede deleveraging or dilute operating performance.”

The later is offset by investors’ appetites for growth. The No. 2 factor that could lead to an upgrade of the system’s credit rating was: Expansion of the system further outside the Atlanta service area without diluting operating margins according to the 2018 credit opinion.

Potential revenue growth is a tonic for many credit challenges according to the Aug. 16 rating action:

“These recent acquisitions will increase PHC’s total operating revenue by about 18% and expand the system’s presence in Macon Georgia as well as fortify its presence in and around Atlanta. PHC will now cover about 85% of the population of the state of Georgia. PHC’s focus on integration will likely enable it to absorb the 70% increase in debt over the next few years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZGZsb3JpZGFuZXdzcGFwZXJzLmNvbS9oaWdobGFuZHNfbmV3cy1zdW4vcGh5c2ljaWFuLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyL2FydGljbGVfNzQ2NjAxNmEtZmU4Ny0xMWViLWEzOWYtM2YwZWFlODE5OTgzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Physician of the Year | Highlands News-Sun | midfloridanewspapers.com,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

As the band took the stage to a mostly-filled stadium with several rollercoasters from the adjacent amusement park visible above the grandstands Weir channeled that 1985 Hershey show right away by kicking off the show with the tour’s first version of “The Music Never Stopped” with Mayer singing the vocals originally handled by vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux. The jazzy 6/8 interlude in the middle gained momentum before the song’s upbeat closing jam took over and the song doubled as a nice start to the show and a welcome nod to history.

Dead & Company – “The Music Never Stopped” – Hershey PA – 8/28/21

From there Weir steered the song directly into ’90s-era Dead tune “Easy Answers” a complex Weir rocker that never fully caught on with Deadheads in its initial incarnation. However the song fares much more favorably during its occasional appearances with Dead & Company whose players effortlessly negotiate the song’s twists turns and backing vocals and another lengthy jam also unfolded nicely over several minutes before a final verse and a transition back into a reprise of “The Music Never Stopped”. The pair of songs made for a cohesive 23-minute start to the show and “Touch of Grey” followed without a pause making its second appearance of the tour and remaining a welcome anthem of resilience.

A trio of Europe ’72-era classics followed with the Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter-penned “Tennessee Jed” kicking things off at a slower pace before concluding with a gently surging guitar solo from Mayer. The Ron “Pigpen” McKernan-written “Mr. Charlie” followed with Mayer delivering a brisk bluesy reading of this welcome little demon of a song. Weir completed the trio with his own mid-paced classic and ode to American travel “Black Throated Wind” one of his best works with longtime collaborator John Perry Barlow.

Weir stayed on lead vocals for a second straight song with “Cassidy” his classic that first appeared on his 1972 Ace LP before becoming a live fixture from 1974 onwards. After an extended take on the structured solo between verses the band took an eventful six-minute wander through the improvised section of the song before Chimenti led the charge to the closing vocals with a series of thick dramatic piano chords. “Don’t Ease Me In” closed out the first set which was notable for its consistency and for its inclusion of four complex Weir/Barlow songs a change from the predominance of Garcia/Hunter material in typical Dead & Company setlists.

The second set kicked off with the second version of “Here Comes Sunshine” of the tour and it would be one of the two highlights of the night. This wholesome title of the 1973 Garcia/Hunter vehicle obscures the rustic optimistic survival tale of its lyrics but Mayer has successfully absorbed both of these themes and this song has become another Dead & Company signature song for him alongside “Althea” “Brown-Eyed Women” “Cold Rain and Snow” and “Deal”.

During the long upbeat kaleidoscopic instrumental section Mayer traded notes and smiles with Chimenti as the two of them continued their entertaining onstage bromance. Several minutes later Burbridge generated a nice surge of notes from higher up on the neck of his bass which prompted a similar surge from Chimenti and in turn led to Mayer dropping into the song’s main riff to usher the band into the final verse.

Weir countered with another of his best original songs “Estimated Prophet”. It was a unique version of the song that emphasized exploration over power during its 16 minutes of controlled murkiness as well as an exceptionally long take on the mid-song solo that slowed down and threatened to stop before a burst of energetic piano from Chimenti got everyone back up to a trot. Weir then chose to forego the usual surge and power chords in favor of singing the final verse and an extended vocal outro before ceding to a second Garcia/Hunter classic from 1973.

“Eyes Of The World” picked the pace right back up with the tempo of the song coming in a little faster than the Grateful Dead’s early epic versions on which Dead & Company’s typical readings are based. Chimenti’s emphatic jazz piano solo after the second verse would be the song’s peak and it was yet another moment during the past week that increased the volume of the whispers that Chimenti is having the best Dead & Company tour of his career.

Following Burbridge’s signature bass solo to close the song Mayer counted in the aforementioned “Althea” which was bolstered by his soaring guitar solo and a full slide guitar solo from Weir before the final verses. The “Drums” segment that followed took a heavier consistent and powerful approach from Kreutzmann and Hart for its duration but Hart would provide counterpoint by making his solo Beam segment comparably softer and and heavier on the drones. Following a few minutes of a free-form “Space” segment by the guitarists and Chimenti the drummers returned for a run of songs that featured covers by four legendary American music figures alongside one Weir/Barlow original.

First up was the second highlight of the show a headlong flight through the Miles Davis-penned “Milestones” that lasted 10 minutes and featured Burbridge in an outsized role offering up lead bass lines that wove between runs from Mayer and Chimenti while Weir played a series of chords that felt like ongoing reactions to whomever he happened to be focused on at the moment.

The set’s closing run of songs kicked off with Woody Guthrie’s “Going Down The Road Feeling Bad” with Dead & Company opting for the less frantic approach taken by the Grateful Dead in their classic 1971 versions of the song. Each of the four vocalists sang a verse with Chimenti’s gruff vocals generating the loudest cheers.

From there it was straight into a solid and well-received reading of the Reverend Gary Davis’ somber lament “Death Don’t Have No Mercy” which hadn’t been played since the tour’s opening night in Raleigh. The set closed with a quick run through Weir’s “One More Saturday Night” and the band stayed in place to knock out a snappy version of Bob Dylan’s “Quinn The Eskimo” as the encore finished the show less than two minutes before the venue’s hard curfew of 11:00 p.m.

Dead & Company’s tour continues September 2nd with a two-night run at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield MA. Head here for tickets.

Siller 68 is the CEO of Tunnel to Towers an organization that helps families of fallen first responders and severely injured service members as well as Gold Star families by paying off their mortgage or providing smart homes to accommodate injuries. It was founded by the Siller family after their brother Stephen Siller an FDNY firefighter died on Sept. 11 2001.

Over the last week the Westerleigh resident has been walking through hills and rain in Pennsylvania and made a weekend stop in Hershey this weekend.

THE WALK

Siller is walking the entire stretch — more than 500 miles — stopping to pay tribute to first responders at each 9/11 crash site. The walk goes through Maryland West Virginia Pennsylvania and New Jersey before coming to an end in lower Manhattan at Engine Co. 10/Ladder 10 near the World Trade Center.

As part of the walk he’s encouraging Americans to “never forget” the sacrifices of the nearly 3000 Americans murdered by the events of 9/11 — including his brother Stephen who was off duty when he became one of 343 New York City firefighters killed responding to the tragic events that day.

His second goal is to encourage 1 million supporters to sign on to donate $11 a month to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation created in his late brother’s memory. The foundation thus far has spent more than $250 million and has provided 200 mortgage-free homes this year alone to the families of lost military and first-responders.

Alerted by friends who know of my deep interest in the subject I went online to watch the GNPC Boss’ interview on Ghana’s most popular local language radio station this morning myself.

Any thoughts I had about the purpose of the public engagement being about making up for the failure of the GNPC to conduct extensive consultations ahead of such a momentous decision as indeed is required under the EITI framework to which Ghana subscribes dissipated quickly as the interview progressed.

When asked to comment on the campaign of Ghanaian Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) against the GNPC’s recommendations to Government to invest over a billion dollars in the two Aker-AGM blocks (Pecan and Nyankom) he dismissed every argument the CSOs have ever made out of hand putting everything down to mischief or ignorance. As far as he was concerned nothing said so far by the CSOs has any merit nor can the activists be said to be motivated by even the tiniest shred of genuine concern.

His way of dramatically illustrating his attitudes towards the CSO movement was to suggest that the analysis its members have so far been producing must likely be the result of “indigestion caused by fufu”. Now the CSO movement in Ghana has been accused of many things in the past but excessive binging on fufu takes the prize for sheer imagination and vividity. It had to be fufu. What with all the fears about cyanide in cassava and the well known effects of starchy calories bloating the guts with mind-numbing gases the image of CSO activists loading themselves full of the stuff before retiring to their rocking chairs to type nonsense is just the painting of alarm one expects the head honcho of a major parastatal to draw at this juncture.

Apart from the colourful fufu metaphors however there were few insights to filter from the interview on Peace FM and the subsequent ones on Joy FM both major radio stations based in Accra.

Having conceded that he finds Aker-AGM’s willingness to reduce their stakes to such low levels (10% for Nyankom and about 13% for Pecan) somewhat strange the GNPC Boss’ only explanation for why Ghana conceded in the first place to hand over such massive rights worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Aker in June and December 2019 only to now buy them back at a premium was “desperation”. Ghana according to him was so desperate to have Aker-AGM develop the blocks that it signed away precious concessions over only then to discover that Aker-AGM’s owners had set up three renewable energy companies suggesting a disinterest in moving forward with the development and production of oil on the two oil blocks. But he still trusts them.

A much simpler explanation of course is that Aker-AGM knew where to find suckers: Ghana. They knew that it would be easier to offset all their risks upfront if they engineered this very state of affairs. Buy into two offshore blocks in Ghana for $135 million convince the country’s pliant leaders to raise your stake for free have laws changed to remove checks on you and then return after you have failed to make the investments you promised to warrant all these candies to collect a cool billion dollars before handing back the country’s own assets back to them to hold the bulk of the risk for further development. All the while retaining enough control of decision-making to ensure you are still in pole position to squeeze any margins from operations because your “joint operator” status remains intact. And should the poor benighted country still bumble its way into producing oil well your share is guaranteed. Only upside never downside!

Ghana is not a country where leaders get asked hard questions. It was cringeworthy listening to the GNPC Boss make one implausible claim after another without a single rebuttal. In accounting for the shocking about face in 2019 which saw hundreds of millions of dollars of rights handed over to Aker only for the country to buy them back in just a year and half he returned to the hapless theme of “energy transition”. In his world no one knew of the energy transition in December 2019 when Parliament of Ghana was signing bonanza after bonanza off to Aker based on the GNPC’s advice.

His esteemed team one must assume missed the commitments made by the energy majors in 2017. Though excessive fufu eating is unlikely to be the cause something else must have plugged their ears and covered their eyes. They never heard about the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative and the strong endorsement of Net Zero (carbon emissions neutral) oil operations by the oil majors in 2016 either. Begs the question: can Ghanaians trust a GNPC leadership so cut off from the strategic trends in the industry they operate? Anytime a GNPC executive talks about the energy transition as being a sudden development warranting kneejerk remedies to long-term strategic problems they have created they worsen fears about their current actions.

Nor was the head honcho of the GNPC averse to abject disinformation. His claim is that before Hess sold the Pecan block the largest of the two blocks in controversy to Aker for $100 million they had spent a whopping $1.2 billion developing it. Very dangerous stuff. If Hess had spent that much and exited at $100 million they would have recorded massive write-offs. But we know from their annual report covering 2018 (pages 10 21 and 32 especially) the year they sold out to Aker that they wrote off less than $300 million. GNPC’s continued efforts to inflate these “inherited costs” have massive implications down the line since our petroleum tax laws allow investors to recover some of the money they spend finding oil from the State through tax credits.

In a similar vein he brazenly claimed that Aker’s discoveries since they bought Pecan exceeds 100 million in additional net oil resources. Yet in a presentation he made to the Cabinet and the Economic Management Team it is clear that the only discovery made on Pecan by Aker is Pecan South East.

Chart extracted from page 12 of GNPC’s Presentation on the Aker-AGM blocks’ Acquisition to the EMT

The true picture badly distorted in the interviews with Peace and Joy radio stations is that Aker itself at the end of the entire appraisal campaign which included all the 3 wells they drilled following their 2018 purchase of the Pecan block from Hess which you might remember had already drilled seven successful wells before selling out to Aker concluded that the total estimated new oil resources discovered were between 5 and 15 million barrels of oil. To have a situation where the Head of a National Oil Company is inflating the resources added by a foreign company in order to justify paying them more than they deserve is beyond frightening.

For those not too familiar with the subject it bears emphasising the point: when Aker bought Pecan from Hess in 2018 the latter company had already drilled seven wells and made a firm estimate of discovered oil volumes of 340 million barrels. It had also found evidence suggesting additional volumes to the tune of 110 and 210 million barrels of oil could be recovered from under the ocean floor. Most of this work was done by 2013. Aker comes into the picture in 2018 drills three wells and conclude that an additional amount of between 5 and 15 million barrels of oil could be extracted. The CSOs consequently make the argument that since buying into the block for $100 million Aker has not changed the commercial picture significantly for GNPC to want to pay the billion dollar figures they have been bandying around. To discredit the CSOs the Chief Executive of GNPC concocts a mysterious figure of 100 million barrels as the additional discoveries made in Pecan.

Following the same pattern he proceeds to accuse CSOs of lying about the potential of competing assets in Ghana’s oil basin to undermine the arguments his organisation has made for the commercial uniqueness of the Aker-AGM blocks for which reason Ghana must pay so much just for the right to take the larger share of risks in developing them.

What did the CSOs say? We argued that if GNPC did not have an underhand interest in the Aker-AGM deals they would have benchmarked the attractiveness of the Aker-AGM blocks with other “stranded” assets (commercial and sub-commercial discoveries that have not been developed by their lease owners in Ghanaian waters).

We deliberately highlighted discoveries that the IHS Markit Resource Ranking databases suggest have more contingent resources (loose estimates of oil volumes) or reserves (firm estimates of oil volumes) than Nyankom the second and smaller of the two Aker-AGM blocks that GNPC believes is worth over $800 million and is aiming to acquire for nearly $400 million. These include the likes of Kosmos’ Wawa and Akasa and the abandoned Dzata block.

We also pointed out a particular block which we would call the “Erin Block” after its now bankrupt former operator where far more work has been done than Nyankom. So far only two wells have been drilled on Nyankom and one was a hopeless disappointment. The Erin block on the other hand has seen as much as 14 wells drilled since the 70s with considerable test production. The GNPC head honcho takes issue with our suggestion that Erin has contingent resources of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent compared with Nyankom’s highly speculative 127 million barrels (according to data provided by GNPC and Aker to Lambert). “Highly speculative” because Aker has not been able to come up with an official volume analysis estimate to its shareholders since promising to do so in its 2019 letter to shareholders and also because only one successful (slim-bore) exploratory well has been drilled in Nyankom and that unappraised. The GNPC Boss insists that Erin has sub-commercial volumes in the region of 50 million barrels.

In essence the Head of the country’s National Oil Company (NOC) is bastardising blocks in the country’s oil basin that are still on the market looking for investors. Even after an independent reserves auditor has established contingent resources of 500 million barrels the NOC Chief because of his parochial interest in another deal is broadcasting to the whole world not to come for this stranded block. Unbelievable! Of all the dangerous things the GNPC Boss said in his hurriedly arranged interviews designed to ensure that no serious questions would be asked this one takes the biscuit!

As if all the preceding was not enough he started serving the Ghanaian public different numbers from what they had communicated to the Economic Management Team Cabinet and television.

On page/slide 49 of the now legendary presentation by the GNPC to Government the numbers indicated as capital costs on Pecan and Nyankom by Aker-AGM totalled $965 million (see below). This number is of course in conflict with the $1.2 billion that the GNPC boss now claims Hess spent on Pecan (which we dispute above) plus as yet unconfirmed amounts spent by the previous holders of the Nyankom block. The over $1 billion in costs are to be offset in the future by GNPC Aker and a string of as yet unnamed “indigenous oil companies” against tax liabilities without regard to depreciation and tax statutes of limitations meaning simply that taxes owed the state will not be paid.

Extract from page/slide 49 of the GNPC Presentation to the EMT/Cabinet

Yet during his interview the numbers metamorphosed to $1.2 billion spent by Hess and $712 million spent by Aker and a host of finance charges he claims the foreign oil companies are right to saddle Ghana with.

As I have explained clearly and simply above the foreign oil companies are owned by entities registered in their home countries. They file returns and taxes in those places. Their costs are duly recorded in compliance books. Hess disclosed spending of $280 million. Aker has disclosed spending in the region of $200 million. Adding a dime here and a nickel there and making provisions for spending by passive partners take us to roughly $600 million as eligible investments in the field so far.

Their willingness to inflate the amounts that these companies have spent in Ghana so far merely goes to reinforce our suspicions of GNPC’s motives. Especially also when such number gaming is used to justify crazy valuations and lay the grounds for future tax heists.

One of those suspicions relate to the role of as yet unnamed “indigenous oil companies” that are supposed to be introduced into the joint venture entity GNPC is proposing to integrate their operations with Aker’s after the acquisitions.

There have been serious controversies over the involvement of Fueltrade in Aker-AGM matters because the son of the GNPC head honcho is the CFO there. So when Lambert in its valuation presentations (see below) suggests a quiet sale of Quad’s stake in Nyankom (SWDT) to Fueltrade one’s unease about the real dynamics at play here grows. Especially when CSOs had previously accused Quad of being a mere placeholder for others during the early campaign against the Government’s plans to downgrade Ghana’s stake in the Aker-AGM blocks (the same stakes that are now being repurchased at a premium).

Extract from page 8 of the Lambert Advisory Presentation on the Aker-AGM Blocks’ Valuation Exercise

No matter how anyone dices or minces it the position of the CSOs remains robust so far: Aker-AGM has not done enough to de-risk the two oil blocks since paying $135 million for both. To the extent that the commercial picture has remained stagnant since they last bought them and the external environment for fossil fuels worsened leading to likely higher breakeven costs of production (decarbonisation pressures equipment scarcity and lower investments in extraction technologies) and lower prices (major analysts now projecting a long-term oil price of $50) in the future GNPC should not pay more than $400 million (or $2 per pro rata proven reserve barrel) to acquire the majority rights to participate in this highly risky venture.

A cue can be taken from Total’s acquisition of Tullow’s 33.3% stake in the much more prolific Lake Albert basin in Uganda for $575 million where the French major updated the market with pride about paying less than $2 per barrel.

With only 340 million estimated reserves (repeat: Nyankom has not been properly audited much less appraised) and the production horizon much farther into the future GNPC’s willingness to pay roughly $7 per barrel is completely ridiculous.

If such counsel requires eating bowlfuls of fufu to arrive at can we recommend that the GNPC Boss tries same but with prekese-infused soup?

LINDA MCMAHON TAKES DIG AT BIG TECH OVER CENSORSHIP: PEOPLE COME TO OUR COUNTRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH

On Wednesday Argonne unveiled Polaris a testbed supercomputer made up of 280 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Apollo Gen10 Plus systems and powered by 2240 of NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units and 560 of AMD's second- and third-generation EPYC processors.

Polaris is expected to deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical artificial intelligence performance up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers. (A single exaflop is equal to one ""quintillion"" calculations per second or 1000 petaflops. A single petaflop is equal to one ""quadrillion"" calculations per second.)

The machine will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications that will be used by Intel's $500 million Aurora supercomputer for a range of scientific projects from advancing cancer treatments and the nation’s energy security to expanding the boundaries of physics with particle collision research.

""Polaris is well equipped to help move the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility] into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users"" ALCF director Michael Papka said in a statement.

Polaris which was delivered and installed in August will go into use starting in early 2022 before opening to the broader high performance computing community in the spring of 2022.

A spokesperson for Argonne National Laboratory confirmed to FOX Business that the Aurora system will be faster than Polaris providing greater than 1 exaFLOP of double precision peak performance. Aurora was originally supposed to be delivered in 2021 but has been delayed for several months.

The delay is being caused by Intel's Sapphire Rapids core processing units and Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units key components of the Aurora system. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business that Aurora remains on track for delivery next year with the chips expected to go into production in 2022.

The struggle for Intel and opportunity for NVIDIA and AMD comes as the three tech giants are battling it out for dominance in the data center chip market.

In addition to Polaris AMD will help power the National Nuclear Security Administration's $600 million El Capitan supercomputer which is set to be delivered to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in early 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the world's fastest exascale computer producing record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops 10 times faster than the current most powerful supercomputer.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is currently powering Oakridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer developed in collaboration with IBM which can produce 200 petaflops or 200000 trillion calculations per second.

Now the Hilton Tokyo Bay Hotel the official hotel for the Tokyo Disney Sea theme park announced that it’s going to hold a special Halloween dessert buffet with a magical girl twist we couldn’t wait to hear more. Every Saturday Sunday and public holiday from September 4 to October 31 a lounge at the hotel will be dedicated to a spread of light meals drinks and (naturally) desserts. The food on selection is even sorted into groups based on the arc of a typical magical girl story!

▼ A selection from the pre-transformation Daily Life Area selection.

The buffet is themed around a timid young girl who helped a plush toy rabbit out of trouble. Her special compact mirror turns her into a magical girl once she utters her catchphrase whereupon she can do battle with those with evil lurking within their hearts.

The three phases of the story are grouped into individual areas. First up is the Daily Life Area where the sweets represent this sweet young girl’s life leading up to her fateful encounter with a bunny toy. This area is full of sweets shaped like cute schoolgirl items that you might recognize as staples of the genre: a test marked with a failing grade tiny bento lunch boxes love letters and stationery.

▼ This poor budding magical girl scored only five marks on her delicious-looking test!

▼ Here we see pencils erasers and a tiny heart-stamped envelope recreated in sugary perfection.

But quickly let’s get to the good stuff! The second section at the buffet is called the Transformation Area and contains a mystique all of its own. Here you can find chocolate cakes that envisage a fully transformed magical girl outfit meringue cookies fashioned to look like magic wands and of course a special compact mirror that conceals a tiny tasty cheesecake.

Now that the magical girl is all suited up and ready to go you can sample some delights from the Combat Area. This is where some devious villains congregate—in cake form of course. Here not only can you face off against fancies like the Most Fearsome Foe! Boss Encounter Chestnut Mousse but also literally eat their magical attacks with other sweets like the Caramel Spice Attack! Pear and Chocolate Pudding. There are even tiny adorable mook enemies like the Mind the Thorns! Cactus Pistachio Tarts.

▼ Are YOU a bad enough gal to take this guy out?

If none of that appeals then fear not: the buffet will also have stations to whip a sweet treat up in front of you and a spread of light savory dishes are also made to order to comfort those of us who aren’t as keen on sweets. You can have staff make a Dreamy Cute White Chocolate Mont Blanc with Apple and Honey Sauce right then and there.

▼ It’s served with a dusting of popping candy and a dash of pizzazz from the dry ice machine.

▼ No sweet tooth? No problem! Just order a savory dish instead.

Though the buffet has a fixed entry fee for all who enter (3900 yen [US$35.45] for adults 1500 yen for children) you can also order a special non-alcoholic cocktail from the buffet for an additional 950 yen (US$8.63). Its glamorous pastel tones will please anyone’s inner magical youth young or old.

Around 20 different sweets are on offer and you’ll want to try out as many as possible. Your ticket to the buffet also includes a pass to the drinks bar which serves 15 different kinds of beverages to patch your throat after all that magical butt-kicking. The buffet ends on October 31 though so you’ll have to look to other hotels for your magical girl fix after that!

More than 250 associates from the company’s merchandising operations and supply chain teams are working around the clock to move truckloads of products to stores in Louisiana and Mississippi. Products like generators water tarps batteries and flashlights are moving into stores in the area.

Stores will remain open as long as it’s safe to do so.

“We’re praying for minimal impacts from Hurricane Ida” said Kelly Mayhall president of the southern division. “We know our customers are counting on us to help them prepare and potentially recover and we’re so grateful for how our associates are serving their communities.”

The Home Depot Foundation is working with national nonprofit partners including Team Rubicon Convoy of Hope Operation Blessing All Hands and Hearts and ToolBank Disaster Service.

With lumber prices going into free fall lately after soaring to record highs just a few months ago at least one prominent American business executive has a simple explanation: It’s all a matter of supply and demand.

See: New IRS Update To Child Tax Credit Portal

Find: Where To Invest Your Money When Inflation Is High — and What Investments To Avoid

That’s how Home Depot COO Ted Decker explained the wild price swings that have hit lumber since the spring. In a conversation with Fox Business last week Decker said demand for lumber has finally returned to normal as prices of the commodity have retreated.

Home Depot and Lowe’s saw a slowdown in sales of lumber to do-it-yourself customers when prices were spiking earlier this year. Now that prices have come down unit sales have improved.

“Supply and demand dynamics worked as expected” Decker told Fox Business.

One thing is for sure: lumber has been on a crazy ride of late. On Friday the price of framing lumber fell to $399 per thousand board feet according to data provided to Fortune by Fastmarkets Random Lengths an industry trade publication. That marked the 11th straight week that the price of lumber went down.

Since hitting an all-time high of $1515 on May 28 the cash market lumber price has sunk 74% Fortune reported. Not only has the slump erased all of the market’s 2021 gains it also has sent prices all the way back to 2018 levels.

As previously reported on GOBankingRates as of last week the price of lumber had increased a staggering 377% in only one year. A boom in home renovations combined with an increase in disposable income stemming from the coronavirus pandemic caused prolonged shutdowns that contributed to the rise in lumber prices.

Higher prices of lumber and other building materials even contributed to a slowdown in homebuilding last month Fox Business reported in a separate article. Housing starts fell 7% in July to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.534 million the Commerce Department reported last Wednesday. That was below analyst expectations of 1.6 million starts.

AutoConduct hosts monthly themed meets for all makes (and all people). This was the only time that they have repeated a theme—wagons—and it begged the question “What is it about wagons that stirs all this passion?”

This column was not intended to be a plea for BMW to bring wagons back to the U.S. but as I started writing it friends said that I’d be remiss if I didn’t touch on it. So since you asked here’s a little basic tenet for you: BMW would sell more wagons in the U.S…. if it sold wagons in the U.S. It’s like a restaurant that closes at 1:00 p.m. and wonders why they don’t sell many dinners.

And yes I am waving my hand that I would buy a new performance-oriented new Touring if it were sold here. That’s one!

National publications also claim that BMW should sell wagons here. Car and Driver said just last year “Note to BMW: America needs more fast wagons” and then cited the RS6 Avant that Audi happily (and quickly) sells here. But for now let’s focus on the fact that so many people appreciate the wagons that we do have and why we like them.

To get us there let’s start with the host of the Wagon Roll-in at AutoConduct BMW CCA member Leo Mayorquin. Mayorquin has been such a fixture in the SoCal (national?) car scene that his Instagram account is simply “@cncpics.” Now vice-president at AutoConduct he sees plenty of automotive enthusiasm. “The wagon passion is certainly unique” Mayorquin explains. “Of all the themes we’ve hosted at AutoConduct this one had so much demand that we had to do it again. And it did not disappoint us at all. You can still do mods to these cars since most emanated from sedans and you can make them fast—faster than you’d expect from a wagon. But you can still do your family activities including a run to Home Depot but still enjoy the car in the process. For both wagon meets we had people travel a long way to get here for it!”

One of those folks was San Diego Chapter member Osami Bandi. He drove the two hours in his 2016 F31 328i xDrive Touring. He acquired his wagon for functional reasons too. “I initially got the wagon to take my mother to her chemotherapy sessions” he says. “After she passed I could not bear to sell it so I decided to build it into something I’d continue to enjoy every day. I love it because of it’s so versatile in every aspect and even with the mods it’s a great car for anything.”

He didn’t just tiptoe into the mods either; he took advantage of the platform similarity with the F30 and made this F31 a head-turner. “Some of the mods include a Dinan big turbo Dinan intercooler AFE turbo pipe VRSF catless downpipe Mishimoto oil catch can Active Autowerke exhaust for the F30/F31 and a BM3 stage two tune” he says.

Not to be outdone Edrees Popal drove up from San Diego too—but with three BMW Tourings. He drove a relatively freshly imported E36 Touring his brother Elyas Popal drove an E30 Touring Design Edition and friend Johnny Carranza drove his bagged E39 Touring.

I had to check in with Popal; I met him at an event in San Diego last year he seems to be a go-to guy for wagon insight including recently selling another E30 Touring to my friend Dawson Graf. “I got into wagons when I bought my first E39 Touring years ago” Popal says. “I love them because of the cargo space for one. I also used to restore small vintage two-stroke motorcycles and the wagons were big enough that I could haul one or even two in there and still have a great ride.

“I had always wanted a manual BMW wagon and years ago I finally found my first (and only) E39 manual wagon on Craigslist for $1500” he continues. “I opened up my dealership and started importing and buying E30 Tourings. America never got the cool cars; I have a friend in Europe who helps me find the cars I bring in and sell—or keep.”

He’s not kidding; his current collection includes more than twelve BMWs including that Design Edition E30 Touring I want—and a 1957 Isetta never to be confused with a wagon.

At the first wagon meet held at AutoConduct in April I remember a stop-in-my-tracks moment courtesy of Joe Barrios owner of the M Shop LA. Mayorquin had generously (and perhaps optimistically) had me park my wagon next to two of Barrios’ gems an S54 SMG-swapped E46 Touring and an S62-swapped E39 Touring. I had hoped some of that M-ness might rub off on my E61 as I nestled up to them.

Barrios’ wagon appreciation evolves from his childhood. “Wagons are like a blast to the past for me” he explains. “They remind me of my uncle’s 1970’s Chevy Chevelle wagon. I remember how much fun it was to go for rides in that car even if it was just to go to the market. Wagons are definitely a favorite in general.”

It’s obvious that wagon passion is not unique to SoCal. I know that our friends in the Pacific Northwest also love wagons—we could have done a column just on their WagonFest alone—and apologies to Tim Alfaro and crew and many more for not including you in here with your amazing wagons. We did check in with Peachtree Chapter member Nick Wood in the Atlanta area—Newnan Georgia specifically—and his E91.

“I like it because I can haul almost anything I want but it’s still a relatively smaller car—the best parts of a car and an SAV” he says. “It certainly looks more aggressive than a standard E90 sedan. It’s the perfect car for daily duties whether that’s hauling antiques my wife may buy or hitting a cars and coffee.”

Wood almost lost the wagon—and more—when tornados whipped through Newnan earlier this year. “The E91 actually suffered some damage during that storm but I couldn’t get rid of it” he recalls. “Without BMW selling news ones here and the size of the E91 being so ideal for us I’m going to do everything I can to keep this one for a while!”

With a recently restored E9 a ’73 2002 and a Dinan S1 E36 M3 in the stable this Touring is in good company.

Speaking of classic BMWs Lance White is one member who knows a thing or ten about classic BMWs—all BMWs I’ll add. It should emphasize the extent of wagon passion when a collector such as White has such an appreciation for wagons; he owns two of the 118 1995 Euro E34 M5 Tourings among a few other gems.

“Wagons are fun because they sort of fly under the radar” says White. “A lot of people think wagons can’t be cool but they are generally a blast to drive can take all our stuff can be pretty fast and even get great mileage. My E34 M5 is so much fun on the roads we take heading down to Carolina with sport-suspension options and the six-speed manual makes it even better—just a blast to drive.”

White’s wagon enthusiasm extends back to the old family truckster. “Our family wagon growing up was a 1968 Chrysler wagon dark green with fake wood paneling” he recalls. “Fast-forward to 1975 and my first wagon of my own was actually a wedding present from my father-in-law—an Opel sport wagon complete with rally wheels gauges and a manual! We were actually a two-wagon couple briefly with my wife’s Datsun 510 wagon.

“I remember lusting after a golf yellow 2002 Touring I saw in Germany” he adds. That probably stoked the BMW wagon interest and led to the Inka 02 Touring he currently has—and to more fun too. “Before I knew we could import them—gray-market back then—I built a clone E34 M5 Touring” he says “but I’m glad I imported the actual M5s with their 3.8-liter engine and these six-speed manual transmissions.”

Many BMW wagon fans appreciate other wagons as well. “I’m a hot-hatch guy too” White adds. “I have an Audi RS4 Avant clone that might be my fastest car.” In addition to the aforementioned fun White also includes an S54-swapped E30 Touring he got from Terry Sayther.

The parallels with the 2002 Touring extend to a number of folks. Robert Tran was also at the AutoConduct meet in August and had debated trying to bring both his 2002 Touring and his newly imported E36 Alpina B3 3.2 Touring. Tran knows that the wagon community is a unique one.

“It was great meeting other BMW enthusiasts who were as nerdy as I am on the niche things” he says. “It helped that I rolled in with an Alpina B3 Touring. But it was also neat that I quickly found others more knowledgeable of Alpina cars than I am. I’m definitely looking forward to future events and contributing to the community.”

It might be a niche community but as I’d seen while caravanning to Legends with Tran a week before in our Tourings those who know know.—Kyle van Hoften

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

LINDA MCMAHON TAKES DIG AT BIG TECH OVER CENSORSHIP: PEOPLE COME TO OUR COUNTRY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH

On Wednesday Argonne unveiled Polaris a testbed supercomputer made up of 280 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Apollo Gen10 Plus systems and powered by 2240 of NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units and 560 of AMD's second- and third-generation EPYC processors.

Polaris is expected to deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical artificial intelligence performance up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers. (A single exaflop is equal to one ""quintillion"" calculations per second or 1000 petaflops. A single petaflop is equal to one ""quadrillion"" calculations per second.)

The machine will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications that will be used by Intel's $500 million Aurora supercomputer for a range of scientific projects from advancing cancer treatments and the nation’s energy security to expanding the boundaries of physics with particle collision research.

""Polaris is well equipped to help move the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility] into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users"" ALCF director Michael Papka said in a statement.

Polaris which was delivered and installed in August will go into use starting in early 2022 before opening to the broader high performance computing community in the spring of 2022.

A spokesperson for Argonne National Laboratory confirmed to FOX Business that the Aurora system will be faster than Polaris providing greater than 1 exaFLOP of double precision peak performance. Aurora was originally supposed to be delivered in 2021 but has been delayed for several months.

The delay is being caused by Intel's Sapphire Rapids core processing units and Ponte Vecchio graphics processing units key components of the Aurora system. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business that Aurora remains on track for delivery next year with the chips expected to go into production in 2022.

The struggle for Intel and opportunity for NVIDIA and AMD comes as the three tech giants are battling it out for dominance in the data center chip market.

In addition to Polaris AMD will help power the National Nuclear Security Administration's $600 million El Capitan supercomputer which is set to be delivered to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in early 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the world's fastest exascale computer producing record-breaking speed of 2 exaflops 10 times faster than the current most powerful supercomputer.

Meanwhile NVIDIA is currently powering Oakridge National Laboratory's Summit supercomputer developed in collaboration with IBM which can produce 200 petaflops or 200000 trillion calculations per second.

In some ways I think we probably have it too easy as contemporary car enthusiasts.

What I mean is that we’re spoiled today for both information and ease of access to tuning products. While a lot of development is required in order to provide this easy access it still makes me laugh that you can take a brand new car to your local tuning house they can plug in a laptop and 20 minutes later you’re up 50 horsepower (or more) without even lifting a spanner.

It’s fantastic for sure but it also leaves me a little bit cold in other ways.

I think it’s one of the reasons why I’ve become more fond of late ’90s and early ’00s Honda builds over the last few years. What were once noise-making nuisances on the road have become something I’ve come to admire and respect. Part of this is down to the fact that only the diehard Honda enthusiasts are left with what feels like the few remaining cars and there are few as diehard as Honda drivers.

Presented with the new world’s temptations of easily-tuned turbo cars I have nothing but admiration for those who persist with eking every last naturally aspirated horsepower from a Honda engine. There’s just something about the purity of it.

Nicky Dunlea’s EK2 Civic hatch is a perfect example of the Honda ethos. It’s simple it’s light and it’s fast. Don’t be put off by the ‘2’ which comes after EK here; it’s been a long time since this Honda of humble origins was powered by a 1.3-litre SOHC engine. In fact when Nicky first bought the car it was already K-swapped with a K20A but that setup didn’t last particularly long.

“I blew that up and decided to go the K24 route. I had heard and read a lot about K20 x K24 ‘Frank’ builds and had a goal of 300 horsepower N/A” Nicky says.

“During the build I changed the engine management system to a Hondata V4 to allow for a second map on the ECU and bought a full direct-port nitrous kit. I compromised slightly on compression with the idea of using the nitrous further down the line. Instead of 13:1 compression with Drag Cartel 4:2 cams I went with 12:1 and a slightly smaller cam.”

The nitrous hasn’t been installed yet but the car is currently making 304hp. Nicky reckons the cast intake manifold is robbing him of some power so the plan is to change that to a Skunk2 equivalent which should raise power to between 310 and 315hp and then add the 100hp nitrous kit which has already been purchased.

“The higher compression option with the bigger cam would have allowed for 325 to 330hp N/A. It’s something I might chase down the line but I want to try the nitrous for now” Nicky adds.

As things currently sit the K24 bottom end with Manley connecting rods and oversized CP 12:1 pistons is mated to a hand-ported K20A cylinder head equipped with a Supertech valve train and Drag Cartel 3:2 cams and is all held together with ARP fasteners. There’s a PPR ported intake manifold Skunk2 74mm throttle body and a Solid Fab exhaust manifold running into a 3-inch stainless steel system.

There’s no lack of ‘go’ in the car’s current setup not that the K24 has a huge amount of weight to pull. A conservative guess would see the semi-stripped Civic at somewhere around 1000kg (2200lb).







Much like the subdued hue of the car stylistic flourishes have been kept relatively simple and subtly. A Seeker V2 rear spoiler BYC skirts an M&M Honda front lip with a First Molding vented bonnet could easily be overlooked at first glance. “The black does hide a lot of the aggression” Nicky admits.

Nicky has been tempted by the idea of a bare metal respray but then worries that he might not drive the car as hard if he’s just dropped five or six thousand euros into paintwork. Until recently the car was his daily driver and only car.

For what it’s worth I think the scars make the car.

From a suspension wheels and brakes perspective the car sits on BC Racing coilovers with Skunk2 front and rear camber arms LCAs and extended ball joints. The Enkei RPF1 wheels are wrapped in Yokohama Advan AD08Rs and measure 15×7.5-inch all around. Finally EK4 calipers clamp PBS race pads onto drilled and grooved discs.









The interior is simple. In here you’ll find a Key!s Racing steering wheel a pair of matching Recaros and not much else.

The battery has been relocated to the most rearward point of the car in order to have at least some weight there.

I’m not sure you can describe a car which regularly screams its way towards 8000rpm as ‘discreet’ but then it’s a car and build which has earned the right to be as loud or quiet as it wants to be.

Still I can’t be the only one curious as to how much more violent it’s going to be with another 100hp right?

The new model also replaces the ZBook Create G7 which was essentially the same laptop as the ZBook Studio G7 albeit with GeForce instead of Quadro graphics. Thus the ZBook Studio G8 has consolidated and inherited all the configurations of the two older G7 models for a long list of configurable options ranging from vPro to non-vPro Tiger Lake-H CPUs and both Quadro and GeForce GPUs.

Our test unit is a higher-end configuration equipped with the vPro-enabled Core i9-11950H CPU RTX 3070 GPU and 4K OLED touchscreen for approximately $4200 USD retail. Lesser SKUs with the Core i7-11800H integrated Iris Xe graphics only FHD display or Quadro T1200 graphics are available for significantly less. There are no Xeon options however.

HP ZBook Power G8 specs Price: $1899 (starting); $5990 (reviewed at)

CPU: Intel Core i7-11850H vPro

GPU: Nvidia RTX A2000

RAM: 64GB

Storage: 2TB SSD

Display: 15.6-inch 4K UHD

Battery: 7:48

Size: 14.8 x 9.9 x 1.2 inches

Weight: 4.4 pounds

The HP ZBook Power G8 brings workstation performance in a reasonably compact and affordable package.

The laptop’s 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11850H CPU Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU and 64GB of RAM can crush a variety of tasks but it can get a little too toasty when pushed. While the performance can easily handle a variety of creative tasks the display’s lack of color and color accuracy make it a tough sell for video work unless you are relying on an external display.

The HP ZBook Power G8 may be the perfect workstation for some users but there are too many missteps for it to be among our best workstations page.

HP ZBook Power G8 price and configuration options

The HP ZBook Power G8 is the affordable entry in HP’s workstation lineup. Affordable is a relative concept in the world of workstation laptops but the $1899 base price for the ZBook Power G8 certainly meets that definition. Just be aware that the specs at that price point are disappointing with no discrete GPU 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.

As with most workstations pricing can go up astronomically. My review unit is a high-end configuration with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11850H vPro processor Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU with 4GB of VRAM 64GB of RAM a 2TB SSD and a UHD (3840 x 2160) IPS display. This model would ring up for $5990 however another common feature of workstations is near perpetual discounts and even direct from HP you can currently buy it for $4013.

Maxing out all the specs on the ZBook Power G8 takes you to an 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11950H vPro Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU with 4GB of RAM 64GB of RAM two 2TB SSDs and a UHD (3840 x 2160) IPS display. That bumps you up to a retail price of $7613 but again don’t expect to pay that. As of this writing it’s available at HP for $5100.

HP ZBook Power G8 design

The HP ZBook Power G8 does a solid thin-and-light impression for a workstation assisted by the tapered edges on all sides which give it a slightly more svelte look. The design doesn’t otherwise stand out with a dark grey magnesium finish that blends in with many other laptops.

The signature stylized “Z” that cuts across the back of the laptop in a reflective silver offers a little more flair to the otherwise staid design. Opening the lid things remain pretty nondescript. With the exception of the glinting beveled edge of the touchpad there isn’t a lot to stand out inside of the ZBook Power G8.

I like the oversized lettering on the keyboard particularly given that the primary keys are offset by the number pad. It’s nice to have the lettering so prominent. An optional color-matched fingerprint sensor is set off to the right below the number pad. It’s an awkward spot for it given your expected hand placement.

The large speaker grille running across the top of the laptop is a bit misleading as you’ll see in the audio section but it does offer a break from the otherwise plain interior. The matte finish around the display doesn’t do the ZBook Power G8 any favors as it draws more attention to the bezels than the glossy finish favored by most.

At 4.4 pounds and 14.2 x 9.2 x 0.9 inches the HP ZBook Power G8 doesn’t just disappear into your laptop bag  but neither will it cause immediate crushing back pain like some workstations.

It isn’t alone in making this move though. HP’s own ZBook Create G7 (13.9 x 9.3 x 0.7 4.3 pounds) is slightly smaller and competitors like the MSI WS66 10TMT (14.2 x 9.7 x 0.7 inches 4.6 pounds) and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (14.2 x 9.9 x 0.8 inches 4.4 pounds) are nearly identical in size.

The HP ZBook Power G8 doesn’t manage to stand out either way on its design. There’s nothing particularly upsetting about it but nothing to wow you either. To be fair that is somewhat par for the course when it comes to workstation laptops but that doesn’t stop me from wanting a bit more.

HP ZBook Power G8 security and durability

The HP ZBook Power G8 features a solid host of security features and should be able to hold up to the rigors of most work environments.

My review unit didn’t include it but you do have an optional IR camera for Windows Hello facial recognition and I did have the optional fingerprint scanner . I have a hard time dealing with a laptop without a fingerprint scanner now as I’m too accustomed to relying on it for login and password entry. A nano security lock offers you a physical security option if you have to leave your laptop in a communal space.

TheZBook Power G8 features a discrete TPM 2.0 chip to ensure the encryption of your files; it also qualifies the HP workstation for Windows 11 . An optional Smart Card Reader is also available for those who require it.

The sturdy feel of the HP ZBook Power G8 is backed up by its MIL-STD 810G certification. This means it can handle working in tough environments with protection from drops and shocks as well as extreme temperatures. The keyboard is also spill-resistant if the most extreme risk that your laptop faces is a spilled beverage.

HP ZBook Power G8 ports

A proliferation of ports is something you expect on a workstation and the HP ZBook Power G8 delivers. My only complaint is that there is just a single Thunderbolt 4 port otherwise it does an excellent job of covering all of the bases.

On its left side there are three ports: an HDMI 2.0 port a USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 port and an RJ-45 Ethernet port. You’ll also find an optional Smart Card reader and a security lock slot.

The right side adds the power port two more USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports (1 always-on) the Thunderbolt 4 port and a combination headphone/mic jack.

If that leaves out any of your needs the Thunderbolt 4 port opens you up to add a USB Type-C hub.

HP ZBook Power G8 display

The ZBook Power G8’s 15.6-inch 4K (3840 x 2160-pixel) display does not disappoint when it comes to most productivity workflows that require bright-and-sharp image rendering. The base 1080p resolution would obviously lose some of that advantage.

While it won’t be winning any thin-bezel competitions the HP ZBook Power G8 manages to keep all four sides reasonably trim for a workstation-class laptop. The top bezel feels slightly larger due to the angled laptop cover jutting out slightly above it.

Watching the 4K trailer for Eternals the ZBook Power G8 offers a crisp image that faithfully reproduces every detail but the colors are notably a bit muted. In a scene with an enormous pale-green crystalline wall that overtakes the entire screen it isn’t able to deliver the vibrancy that it should. I’ve watched the same trailer on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2  and you are losing some of the deep greens of the wall itself along with the brilliant gold filigree that runs between the crystals.

Our colorimeter verified that the ZBook Power G8 is a bit behind the competition. Its panel covers 78% of the DCI-P3 color gamut . That matches the MSI WS66 10TMT (78%) but distantly behind both the HP ZBook Create G7 (148%) the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (121%) and the workstation laptop average of 141%.

Brightness testing went much better for the HP ZBook Power G8 peaking at 394 nits. That placed it ahead of all of its nearest competitors like the HP ZBook Create G7 (357 nits) the WS66 10TMT (346 nits) and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (339 nits). However it still comes up shy of the 409-nit average for workstations.

HP ZBook Power G8 keyboard and touchpad

The typing experience on the HP ZBook Power G8 is quite good. The keys have a pleasantly springy response and are suitably quiet while still offering enough feedback. Depending on your needs the full number pad to the right of the keyboard may be a blessing. If not it does mean that the standard keyboard and the touchpad are offset to the left which can be slightly off putting at first.

I did run into an ergonomics issue typing on the ZBook Power G8. I’m accustomed to some tilt being available to give you an angled typing experience that among other things goes easier on your wrists when typing for an extended period. For creatives the target audience for this laptopit’s likely less of a concern but worth considering depending on your usage. To alleviate the issue I stole the wrist pad from my external keyboard and that helped considerably.

Testing my typing speed I averaged 90 words per minute with 96% accuracy on the 10fastfingers.com typing test slightly faster than my average of 86 wpm. With the exception of the ergonomics concern which isn’t attributable to the keyboard itself this laptop offers an excellent typing experience.

The 4.5 x 2.8-inch surface of the ZBook Power G8 touchpad is large enough to carry out Windows 10 gestures easily and was responsive enough to navigate the 4K display even at its native resolution.

HP ZBook Power G8 audio

You can’t miss the top-firing speakers on the HP ZBook Power G8. They dominate the entire top section of the laptop above the keyboard. I had high hopes for the audio experience as a result but those were quickly dashed. The speakers struggled to fill my 18 x 12-foot listening space and were tinny — even by laptop standards.

I listened to “Mood” by WizKid and while the relaxed and vocal-heavy song didn’t press the complete lack of bass available from the HP ZBook Power G8’s speakers it still came off as distant. I’ll give HP credit that there is no vibration or distortion present even at top volume but whether you are listening for enjoyment or work you will want a pair of wired or wireless headphones to avoid relying on these speakers.

HP ZBook Power G8 performance

Ultimately performance is the prime motivator for purchasing a workstation and here the HP ZBook Power G8 crushes it. The Intel Core i7-11850H processor with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD laughed in the face of any task that I threw at it. I loaded up 40 Google Chrome tabs including three YouTube videos running at 4K and a pair of Twitch streams and the HP ZBook Power G8 churned through all of it like butter.

The action on screen never stops stutters or shows the slightest sign that it is even noticing the computing equivalent of gnats that I’m trying to irritate it with. However that isn’t to say that it is always quiet about it. Through my typical work routine the fans are off most of the time and then will kick in for 30-45 seconds at a modest volume. But I did manage to occasionally actually push the system and that elicits the full jet engine routine. Returning to our discussion of the headphones you’ll want them to drown out the fan noise if you’re doing anything intensive with the ZBook Power G8. And given that it’s a workstation I hope that you are planning to tax it.

With those more advanced uses in mind we put the HP ZBooker Power G8 through our benchmarking that includes a number of real-world and synthetic tests.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Sean Riley)

It managed one of the highest Geekbench 5.4 overall performance test results that we’ve seen with a multi-core score of 9176. That put it ahead of every rival we’ve tested and the caegory average of 6575. That includes HP’s own ZBook Create G7 (8003 Core i9 10885H) the MSI WS66 10TMT (6735 Core i9-10980HK) and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (6076 Core i7 9750H).

Our Handbrake video transcoding test requires the laptop to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution and it performed well here too. The ZBook Power G8 finished in 7 minutes and 49 seconds. That’s not the fastest time we’ve seen. The ZBook Create G7 (7:21) edged it out here but it was well ahead of the MSI WS66 10TMT (8:28) and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (10:25).

The HP ZBook Power G8’s 2TB SSD is as blisteringly fast as it is spacious crushing our 25GB file transfer test with a 1788 MBps transfer rate. That demolished the performance of the ZBook Create G7 (640MBps) and the MSI WS65 9TM (727 MBps). It even managed to beat one of the previous leaders in the category: the MSI WS66 10TMT (1254 MBps).

HP ZBook Power G8 graphics

The HP ZBook Power G8 features an Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU with 4GB of VRAM  which as our 3DMark Fire Strike synthetic graphics benchmark shows isn’t the most powerful with a score of 9404. That places it significantly behind the HP ZBook Create G7 (14260 RTX 2070 Max-Q) the MSI WS66 10TMT (16788 Quadro RTX 5000) and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (13767 GeForce RTX 2060). However it does beat the category average of 4341.

This is not a workstation that can pull double duty as your gaming laptop. If that’s what you need you’ll have look to one of the alternatives or consider one of the best gaming laptops . If it’s just something you do occasionally and you have somewhat more modest gaming tastes it will likely be enough. It managed 42 frames per second on Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: Gathering Storm in 4K above our 30-fps playability threshold but below the 58fps category average. Just don’t set your expectations for current AAA titles at max settings.

HP ZBook Power G8 battery life

Now the battery life on the HP ZBook Power G8 isn’t going to last all day but considering the power and the 4K UHD display on my review unit I was thoroughly impressed.

It clocked 7 hours and 48 minutes in our battery test which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness. That’s particularly solid when compared to other 4K workstations the ZBook Create G7 (5:57) came up almost two hours shorter and the Asus ProArt StudioBook 15 (3:39) is distantly behind both. It’s also ahead of the workstation average of 6 hours and 23 minutes.

The MSI WS66 10TMT (10:10) with its 1080p display dominates them all. However I suspect you would get something much closer to this if you opted for the 1080p model of the ZBook Power G8 as well.

Naturally the 1080p display of the MSI WS66 10TMT (10:10) gives it a significant edge here. Users are presumably using their workstation plugged in anyway but if on-the-go use is a factor you would be wise to go with the 1080p display option on the ThinkPad P15 Gen 1.

HP ZBook Power G8 webcam

The 720p webcam in the ZBook Power G8 gives middle-of-the-road results. Even in my office where I have considerable control over the lighting I got a lot of grain in the image for photos and video.

I say this about most laptops on the market so the ZBook Power G8 shouldn’t take it too hard. If you do a lot of video conferencing or video chat and care about image quality you need to pick up an external webcam .

As I mentioned in the security section there is an optional IR camera for Windows Hello support. I didn’t have it in my review unit to test but it’s a very convenient extra.

HP ZBook Power G8 heat

The HP ZBook Power G8 has one large vent across the bottom that runs nearly the full width of the laptop and another concealed behind the hinge. As I noted in the performance section they keep reasonably quiet during less intense tasks but can get oppressively loud when the system is pushed.

After our testing which involves playing a 15-minute 1080p video and taking temperature readings on various parts of the laptop I could see why the fans work as hard as they do. We found that the bottom of the laptop spikes well above our 95-degree Fahrenheit threshold for comfort. The touchpad kept its cool at a reasonable 83 degrees. The keyboard got up to a toasty 96 degrees and the underside was scorching at 110 degrees. Now it should probably go without saying that a workstation isn’t the most lap-friendly of laptops but in this case definitely avoid that situation.

HP ZBook Power G8 software and warranty

The HP ZBook Power G8 ships with Windows 10 Pro and keeps clear of bloatware . HP’s own apps add up but these are helpful utilities and don’t leave the system feeling too cluttered.

HP Support Assistant is the most generally useful if you are experiencing any issues with your system. It offers a dashboard to view your system performance and diagnostic tools to help identify and fix anything that is going wrong. In the event that you can’t solve a problem by yourself this is also where you will access customer support.

The HP ZBook Power G8 comes with a three-year limited warranty but you can opt for higher tiers of protection up to five years. You can see how HP does overall in these regards in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

The stellar performance of the HP ZBook Power G8 may be enough to make some overlook the issues with the laptop — this is a workstation after all. But with a number of solid alternatives on the market it shouldn’t be your first choice.

For most users there are just too many tradeoffs in a laptop that could be several thousand dollars when configured properly. Creatives in particular need to look elsewhere; the display is simply not suitable for video or photo work.

Even for those that aren’t worried about the display the heat rises to the level of being a concern to me as 110 degrees is considerably beyond our threshold and concerning for the overall thermal performance of this laptop.

The HP ZBook Power G8 is a capable workstation that is able to tackle most computing tasks thrown at it but unless you are essentially using it as a desktop and aren’t affected by many of the drawbacks that I’ve pointed out there are better options available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21hbmhhcnQtbWg1LWd0ci1pcy1hLTc3N2hwLWJtdy1tNS1jcy1vbi1wb3dlcmJveC1zdGVyb2lkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manhart MH5 GTR Is A 777-HP BMW M5 CS On Powerbox Steroids,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21hbmhhcnQtbWg1LWd0ci1pcy1hLTc3N2hwLWJtdy1tNS1jcy1vbi1wb3dlcmJveC1zdGVyb2lkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

But it wasn’t for a track and field meet.

High school students were in the venue to network with more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and up to 50 employers at the 2021 Battelle College Career & Community Fair.

The event was part of the Classic for Columbus a week of programming activities and a football match between Central State University and Kentucky State University at Ohio Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

Jobs in Ohio:Here’s how Ohio corporations are partnering with HBCUs to advance racial equity

Which companies were at the fair?

The building bustled with music and conversation as people hopped around to booths decorated with colorful logos. PNC Bank the Columbus Division of Fire and Quantum Health were just a handful of companies onsite. Students earned a free ticket to the football game if they received a passport stamped by six schools or businesses.

A trio of high school students from Lima Senior High School in northwest Ohio were there checking out potential options for their college careers.

“It’s really nice. I’m learning a lot of information” said Emonie Young a 15-year-old sophomore who wants to study nursing. She said she was interested in learning more about Central State.

“I’m thinking about that one too” said her best friend Honesty Baker also a 15-year-old sophomore who wants to be a traveling nurse. Baker said she learned about an opportunity to take a free State Tested Nurse Aides (STNA) course from one of the companies at the fair.

Anastazja Kirklen a 16-year-old junior who is interested in studying child psychology also is interested in attending a HBCU. But she'd prefer to go out of state “just to be around something different” she said.

How many people attended the career fair?

The fair was presented by Nationwide Huntington Bancshares the city of Columbus the Franklin County Board of Commissioners and Revolution Mortgage. More than 500 students from Columbus City Schools registered for the fair according to James Ragland who is on the Columbus City Schools Board of Education.

“It’s a dream come true for us” said Ragland who was at Saturday's event. “We understood that they’re already thinking about college but many of our students just needed a little bit more of a (push) to get over the hump with that. If we can catch them right now inspire them and move them towards that college track that’s really good for us.”

Ragland said he remembers attending the Classic for Columbus decades ago at the since-demolished Cooper Stadium in Franklinton. The Classic continued to operate in different parts of the state but went on a brief hiatus in recent years.

Classic board member Leonard Hubert said he was excited to help bring the event back to Columbus.

""Anytime you talk about an HBCU Classic everybody thinks football"" he said. ""Football is a central part of it but one of the things we talked about was the importance of having youth exposed to what a HBCU is about.""

How a North Linden church got involved in the career fair

New Salem Baptist Church in North Linden was another partner in the college career and community fair.

“Every day we try to wake up and figure out how the church can use its resources and relationships to create a connected community” said Adam Troy chief engagement officer of the Community of Caring Development Foundation the nonprofit arm of the church.

“Here in this setting it’s very nurturing. We have a number of students here who are high achievers but have just never been introduced to the HBCU experience. Today is about access and exposure.”

Both Adam Troy and his brother Eric attended Morehouse College an HBCU in Atlanta.

Eric Troy founder and CEO of Eficionado a brand management company said it was important to have OSU as a partner.

“We have so many people of color that don’t even see Ohio State’s campus"" he said. ""And so to have that kind of exposure is pretty cool.”

Representatives from rivals Central State and Kentucky State also were present to speak with students.

“We’ve got a lot of exciting things going on"" Lauren Young an enrollment specialist at Central State said. ""We have a brand new president. He’s pushing a lot of great incentives for students. Right now we have free books for all students all year. We have lots of different scholarships available and today we’re just here to spread that news and beat KSU.”

KSU recruiter and 2019 graduate Alona Davidson said it was important to give students opportunities to ""spread their wings"" beyond Ohio.

“When you go to K-State it feels like you’re walking into a family barbecue"" she said. ""You can be yourself fully with no judgment or no bias.”

As the event sponsor Battelle's goal was to ""lean into"" the HBCU community according to Chief Information Officer David White.

""We’re really working hard to embrace what that represents and how we can leverage that to help bring more diversity to the company” he said. “We really want to build that next generation of scientists. We look at the workforce we have today and we see an underrepresentation of people of color. And so we really are trying to figure out 'How do you solve that problem?' And part of that is reaching back into the universities.”

The Ohio State and Minnesota football programs are no stranger to each other having met on the gridiron 53 times before Thursday’s 2021-22 season opener. In fact for many years this was an annual affair. But after the Big Ten expanded and the teams were put in different divisions they've only played three times in the last 11 seasons.

Here is what a snapshot of the series looks like ahead of the 54th meeting between the Buckeyes and the Golden Gophers set for primetime this Thursday on Fox.

Opponent: Minnesota Golden Gophers

All-Time Record: OSU leads 46-7

First Meeting: Oct. 15 1921 (Ohio State 27-0)

Last Meeting: Oct. 13 2018 (Ohio State 30-14)

Current Win Streak: OSU 11

Despite the dominance Ohio State shows with their record and win streak in this series (OSU has won 27 of the last 28 meetings) the scores of these previous games are a mixed bag of blowouts and close finishes. The last 12 games include both 44-0 (2006) and 52-10 (2010) wins as well as games that ended 31-28 (2001) and 31-24 (2014) still in favor of the Buckeyes.

Minnesota's most recent win in the series came in 2000 when the Golden Gophers defeated the Buckeyes in Columbus by a score of 29-17.

While the Buckeyes hold a significant advantage in the all-time series anything can happen especially when the Golden Gophers boast a home field advantage. Though the Golden Gophers only have seven wins in the history of this matchup five of them (~70%) have come on their home turf.

Add that to a game in which fans will be in attendance for the first time in over a year plus a new freshman quarterback making his first career start and this has the makings of being a challenge for the Buckeyes.

This will be the first meeting between the two cross-division foes in three years. On October 13 2018 at The Shoe Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins blew out the Golden Gophers with an epic performance. He finished the game 33-of-44 through the air accounting for 412 yards and three touchdowns. It was his second straight (in what turned out to be three consecutive) 400-yard passing game. But most impressively of the five total such games he had during that magical season the Minnesota game was the only one in which he did not throw an interception.

Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins drops back to throw against Minnesota on October 13 2018.

Trailing 7-3 late in the first quarter Haskins unleashed a perfect throw down the middle of the field for a 41-yard TD to Terry McLaurin to give the Buckeyes the lead currently of the Washington Football Team in the NFL.

The offense had trouble finding its stride in the first half as they trailed 14-10 late in the second quarter. But a crazy 1-handed grab by K.J. Hill put the Scarlet and Gray out front on a 38-yard score. Ohio State would never relinquish that lead and Hill caught a second touchdown in the second half.

For Minnesota quarterback Zach Annexstad went 13-for-23 for 218 yards and two interceptions. Ohio State only turned one of those picks into points thanks to a 21-yard field goal from kicker Blake Haubeil. Haubeil hit all three of his attempts that day the longest of which was good from 47 yards.

This will only be the third time these two schools have played each other in Huntington Bank Stadium (formerly known as TCF Bank Stadium) since it was completed and opened in 2009. When it was finished the venue was the Big Ten Conference’s newest football stadium since 1960. The Buckeyes have won both of the two previous games at Huntington Bank Stadium.

Petersen Jr. DDG 121 Arleigh Burke-class Flight IIA destroyer,"According to information published by Huntington Ingalls on August 27 2021 Huntington Ingalls Industries Ingalls Shipbuilding division announced the successful completion of builder’s trials for guided missile destroyer Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121). The Arleigh Burke-class Flight IIA destroyer spent three days in the Gulf of Mexico testing the ship’s combat system which included firing a missile.

The USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG-121) is an Arleigh Burke-class Flight IIA guided missile destroyer built for the United States Navy. The contract for the construction of the ship was first announced in a press release from Huntington Ingalls Industries on March 30 2016. The keel of the ship was laid on 21 February 2017. She was launched on July 13 2018. and was christened on October 6 2018.



The Arleigh Burke is a class of guided missile destroyers (DDG) in service with the United States Navy built around the Aegis Combat System an American integrated naval weapons system developed by the Missile and Surface Radar Division of RCA and now produced by Lockheed Martin. The Flight IIA Arleigh Burke ship has several new features including two hangars for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopters and a new longer 5-inch/62-caliber (127 mm) Mark 45 Mod 4 naval gun.



Huntington Ingalls has delivered 32 destroyers to the Navy and currently has four more under construction including Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123) Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125) Ted Stevens (DDG 128) and Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129).

Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are highly capable multi-mission ships and can conduct a variety of operations from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection — all in support of the United States military strategy. The guided missile destroyers are capable of simultaneously fighting air surface and subsurface battles. The ship contains a myriad of offensive and defensive weapons designed to support maritime defense well into the 21st century.



The USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. is powered by four General Electric LM2500 gas turbines developing 100000 shp. She can reach a top speed of 31 knots (57 km/h). The ship is armed with one 5 inches (127 mm)/54 caliber Mk 45 naval gun 25 mm Mk 38 automatic cannons four .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapon System) two Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes for Mk 46 torpedo 96-cell Mk 41 VLS (Vertical Launching System) able to launch RIM-66M medium-range surface-to-air missiles BGM-109 Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC anti-submarine missiles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvZm9yZC1jbGFzcy1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVycy1ibG93LW5pbWl0ei1jbGFzcy1jYXJyaWVycy1vdXQtd2F0ZXItMTkyNTkw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford-Class Aircraft Carriers Blow Nimitz-Class Carriers Out of the Water,"Key Point: Ford’s entry into active service will once again raise the Navy’s carrier force to eleven ships. The Navy’s carrier fleet is unique in having a congressionally mandated minimum force level: U.S. Code § 5062 states “the naval combat forces of the Navy shall include not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers.” For now the Navy is operating with a waiver.

In 2009 the U.S. Navy finally began construction of the first new type of aircraft carrier in nearly thirty-five years. Named after former president and naval aviator Gerald R. Ford the USS Ford fully takes the nuclear supercarrier into the twenty-first century. The technological innovations built into the new ship while causing the inevitable delays involved in building a first-in-class vessel will keep the Navy’s unique fleet of super flattops the largest and most advanced in the world for the foreseeable future.

USS Ford follows in the steps of the highly successful Nimitz-class carriers. Construction began in 2009 at Huntington Ingalls Industries in Newport News Virginia—the same location where the Ford’s predecessors were built. Indeed the Ford class resembles the Nimitz ships in many ways: they measure 1106 feet long versus the Nimitz’s 1092 feet. Both classes weigh the same: approximately one hundred thousand tons fully loaded. Layout is similar too with an island on the starboard side four catapults and an angled flight deck.

The ship is powered by two new-design AB1 nuclear reactors. The reactors are manufactured by Bechtel which beat out longtime naval reactor giants General Electric and Westinghouse for the reactor contract. Together the two reactors create six hundred megawatts of electricity triple the two hundred megawatts of the Nimitz class. That’s enough electricity to power every home in Hampton Virginia; Pasadena California; or Syracuse New York.

Ford is going to need that power not only to reach its estimated top speed of thirty-plus knots but also the new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) which uses electric currents to generate strong magnetic fields that can quickly accelerate an aircraft to takeoff speeds. The system is touted as easier on aircraft extending their service lives easier to maintain in general and capable of generating up to 25 percent more sorties than the older steam catapult system.

The new carrier will also use a new system to land aircraft. The new Advanced Arresting Gear uses a water turbine and induction motors to halt the momentum of landing carrier aircraft. Like EMALS the AAG is expected to be more reliable than the existing aircraft arresting system on Nimitz-class ships and easier on airframes.

Ford will also have the most modern radar systems in the fleet. The Ford will have the new Dual Band Radar which combines both the X-Band AN/SPY-3 Aegis radar and the S-Band Volume Surveillance Radar. DBR is capable of search track and multiple missile illumination detecting enemy aircraft and missiles and then guiding Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) to intercept.

For self-defense Ford will have two Mk. 29 missile launchers with eight ESSM each and two Rolling Airframe Missile launchers. It will also have four Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems for point defense against aircraft missiles and small ships and four M2 .50 caliber machine guns. Ford’s generous electrical capacity means that the ship could someday mount laser self-defense weapons. Powered by the ship’s nuclear reactors such a system would have a virtually limitless ammunition supply vastly increasing the ship’s defensive capability.

The carrier air wing will form the carrier’s primary means of deploying both offensive and defensive firepower. The Ford class will embark two squadrons of ten to twelve F-35C Joint Strike Fighters two squadrons of ten to twelve F/A-18E/F Super Hornets five EA-18G Growler electronic attack jets four E-2D Hawkeye airborne early-warning and control aircraft and two C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery (COD) planes. It will also carry eight MH-60S Seahawk helicopters. Down the road it will embark the MQ-25 Stingray refueling and intelligence collection drone the eventual planned sixth-generation fighter to replace the Super Hornet and if Sen. John McCain has his way a new long-range strike drone. The V-22 Osprey tiltrotor is also set to replace the C-2 Greyhound in the COD role.

Ford’s entry into active service will once again raise the Navy’s carrier force to eleven ships. The Navy’s carrier fleet is unique in having a congressionally mandated minimum force level: U.S. Code § 5062 states “the naval combat forces of the Navy shall include not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers.” For now the Navy is operating with a waiver.

More ships will follow. USS John F. Kennedy the second aircraft carrier to bear the name of the thirty-fifth president of the United States is under construction at Newport News and expected to enter service in 2020. The third carrier Enterprise is expected to begin construction next year and will join the fleet in the early 2020s. The current push by President Donald Trump and the chief of naval operations to a 350–355-ship fleet will likely include at least one additional Ford-class carrier in the near term.

Some players are unique geniuses; they discover new paths for creative minds; new ways to look at the game of chess. Philidor LaBourdonais Morphy Capablanca Tal Planinc- these are a few of the ones that push chess forward. My favorite player Bronstein falls into this category as well. Parapphrasing World Champion Tigran V. Petrosian: ""Some players think that modern chess started with the Informator. But players of my generation know that modern chess started with David Bronstein!""

I always wondered what Petrosian meant by that and recently I found a quote where he explained that Bronstein took old openings and gave them a new interpretation.

Before I go on I want to give an honorable mention to Andras Adorjan who I also consider a genius of creative chess. There are others of course; Chigorin and Alekhine are also in this category.

recently I sent away for a book about Planinc:

I have been looking at some of his games specially from his most successful tournament IBM 1973 in Amsterdam. He tied for first place with Petrosian.

He won 7 games and lost 2. His two losses came at the hands of Petrosian and Quinteros.

One player that had an amazing record against Planinc was GM Borislav Ivkov. He had a 5-0 lifetime record against Planinc!

Ivkov by the way was no slouch. See how he demolished Fischer in 1965.

GM Borislav Ivkov (1933- )

Now to some of Planinc's games from this tournament.

In the following game GM Donner shows an amazing unfamiliarity with the nuances of the Indo-Benoni and Planinc achieves positional superiority with amazing ease.

GM Jan Hein Donner (1927-1988)

In round 4 Planinc faced Drazen Marovic.

IM Drazen Marovic (1938- )

This game is a textbook example of the strategy to follow in the Indo-Benoni with Black.

In round 5 Planinc won against Ulf Andersson. Now Andersson was known for two things: great defensive skills and great endgame play. In this game Planinc outplays Andersson in both facets of the game!

GM Ulf Andersson (1951- )

In round 6 Planinc played with the Black pieces against Kick Langeweg.

IM Kick Langeweg (1937- )

Planinc's superior understanding of the dynamic aspects of the position ruled the day.

In round 8 Planinc had the white pieces against Jan Timman.

GM Jan Timman (1951- )

In round 9 Planinc had the Black pieces against GM Zoltan Ribli. Ribli was a very strong GM who was twice a Candidate for the World Championship.

GM Zoltan Ribli (1951- )

In this game Ribli chooses the ""solid"" fianchetto system with White against Planinc's King's Indian. Planinc on the other hand plays in the Old Style taking on d4 and playing Re8 Nc5 a5...well you'll see!

Dear chess lovers this is all I have energy and time now for. Until next time and I hope you enjoyed the games!

Now thanks to [Mike Chambers] you can add to the IRC ecosystem by hosting your very own MS-DOS based IRC server.

This port of ngIRCd (Next Generation IRC Daemon) has already been spun up on 8088-based PCs running at just 4.77MHz but you’ll still need at least 640KB of RAM. If your vintage IRC server takes off you might want to think about dropping in an 10MHz V20 for a bit of a performance boost. Even so it’s impressive that this server can get up on the 40-year-old IBM 5150 and should absolutely scream on an AT-class system.

The limitations of the 16-bit platform means that SSL and ZLIB are unsupported and Mike has capped total connections at 50 in his port (however this limitation can be adjusted by rebuilding from source should you want to find out how far 640KB of RAM can take you). You’ll also need a few other things to get your server up and running such as a packet driver for your network card and an mTCP configuration file.

Setting up your own IRC server is arguably a right rite of passage for most hackers and tinkerers but getting this up and running on a decades-old beige box would make for a fun weekend project. [Mike] has all the juicy details on GitHub and you can check out a test server running the latest build over at irc.xtulator.com .

Also don’t forget to visit the #hackaday IRC channel over on irc.libera.chat .

These three companies aren’t so dissimilar. They’ve got rock-solid balance sheets and by all accounts are set to generate lots of free cash flow in the coming years. They also have attractive valuations at the moment. Here’s why aviation company AAR Corp. ( AIR ) industrial giant 3M ( MMM ) and leisure company Brunswick ( BC ) are good value for money.

Free Cash Flow Valuations

Free cash flow (FCF) measures how much money a company generates that management can use to do value-enhancing things for investors. It’s calculated after working capital requirement and capital expenditures are taken from net earnings. FCF can be used to pay off debt pay dividends repurchase stock or even acquire funds. In theory a company could use FCF to pay all of its dividends. That being said a growing revenue base is obviously more attractive.

All three of the companies we’re going to discuss have plenty of FCF floating around. They’re priced relatively cheaply at the moment but don’t let that make up your mind for you. Here’s why we think the market has got them all wrong.

Brunswick

The marine leisure company has actually been a winner due to the pandemic. Social distancing has meant that any sport where you can get away from others has been massively in demand. Marine leisure is of course one of the prime candidates for this kind of activity.

Short-term the pandemic has proven to be a bit of a boon for this boating company. What worries investors though is long-term potential. As restrictions ease some worry that this stock will be able to sustain its current momentum.

So far those fears have been unfounded. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) new powerboat sales were up 32% on a rolling 12-month year-over-year basis through April. In fact the real problem is that supply hasn’t been able to keep pace with demand.

Brunswick actually makes more money from its propulsion parts and accessories than it does boats. In 2020 the propulsion part of Brunswick’s business generated $286 million in operating earnings with parts and accessories achieving an equally impressive total of $275 million. That compares against a total of $70 million achieved just from boats. Ultimately the parts and accessories side of Brunswick’s business turns over more operating and recurring revenue than just boats.

AAR Corp.

The substantial government support given to AAR hasn’t been able to totally offset the sheer scale of slump hitting the aviation industry and the overwhelming majority of analysts are worried about the future of this industry. But there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that travel is slowly working its way back to pre-pandemic levels.

Although flight departures are still significantly below 2019 levels they are up 46% compared to this time last year. To aid with the streamlining of the business’ services AAR CEO John Holmes has been shedding the company’s non-core assets so when travel does eventually return in droves we think this is a company that is well-placed to grow quickly again. How quickly we can expect any kind of return to normality in the aviation industry is difficult to predict but the vaccination campaign is clearly having an effect and that gives this industry every reason to be optimistic.

And there’s more good news. AAR has also been signing plenty of agreements such as with United in order to maintain the company’s provision of United Airlines’ narrow-body fleet. All told there are signs commercial flight is returning and that makes AAR an exciting company.

3M

3M is also looking good on an FCF basis. The company’s management has been hard at work over the last few years restructuring its healthcare business cutting costs and changing the way the company makes money. Following from this we think Wall Street is severely underestimating this stock.

So why are some investors reluctant? One reason investors might be apprehensive about buying this stock comes from the company’s potential liabilities related to its manufacture of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It’s true that there are a couple of law suits relating to PFAS environmental contamination but it’s not yet clear how any of these cases will relate back to 3M. The market though seems to be assuming the worst.

In a similar position is Illinois Tool Works and we can use this company as a useful case study in predicting how 3M’s stock may move. Based on current Wall Street prices Illinois Tool Works trades at 26.6 times estimated 2021 FCF. Applying this same scale to 3M’s estimated FCF of $5.7 billion we then have a target market capitalization of $152 billion for 3M. That’s nearly $35 billion higher than the company’s current market cap. That would make 3M’s current trading price an overly steep discount.

Liability or not we still think that 3M looks to be good value for money and we’re suggesting that investors seriously consider this company again.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now more than ever.

It’s a myth that you need a bank account the size of Warren Buffett’s to start investing and it’s also a myth that you should only invest in companies like Amazon. Investing on a budget is often the best way to start your investing career as it forces you into making considered well-researched investments. It can also be extremely profitable.

So if that’s you here’s two stocks you should be looking at.

Why Invest in AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca ( AZN ) made waves when it announced it was going to be one of the first pharmaceutical companies to have a COVID vaccine ready. Now although it didn’t make as many waves as we were hoping for we still think that this stock’s big winnings lie elsewhere.

AZN has a slate of treatments that are selling fast with some of the most exciting ones coming in the oncology division of the business. Cancer is one of the biggest and fastest-growing drug markets in the entire industry and spending on these drugs is only going to keep increasing. Spending is forecast to rise to an annual compound growth rate of between 9% and 12% by 2025.

The oncology division has achieved sales of 20% year-on-year and now totals around $3 billion in the first quarter alone. The likes of Tagrisso Imfinzi and Lynparza are all drugs that have sold well and are certainly pushing a large amount of AZN’s growth. Tagrisso increased by 17% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter Imfinzi was up 20% to $556 million and Lynparza’s sales came in at $543 million 37% higher than last year.

More good news comes in the shape of the company’s patents. Both Tagrisso and Imfinzi have patents that won’t expire until the 2030s so investors can look forward to many more years of growth from these two drugs. In fact these drugs aren’t just limited to the field of oncology and both are currently being featured in a number of different clinical trials.

Following AstraZeneca’s acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals another area of optimism for the company will come through the rare diseases industries division. Formerly Alexion’s top-selling products Soliris and Ultomiris are the only approved treatments for the rare blood disorders paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).

Alexion had been in the process of building up a number of new and innovative treatments and last year announced that 10 potential new products were slated for release in 2023. With these products continuing along this timeline AstraZeneca looks very well consolidated for the next few years. Thanks to the company’s own timeline of treatments as well as this acquisition this is a stock worth buying and holding onto.

Why Invest in Incyte?

Incyte’s ( INCY ) stock price for the year is down by 25%. If that sounds disappointing it’s important to put the stock’s performance into context. The wider trend is down but if this underperformance tells us anything it’s that the stock was somewhat overpriced a year ago. Incyte doesn’t also have an overly diverse revenue stream and continues to generate the majority of its revenue from Jakafi a treatment for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera and for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Jakafi was approved by the Federal Drugs Agency (FDA) in 2019 and remains the only treatment currently on the market for GVHD.

Financially Incyte announced total revenues of $605 million up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile Jakafi’s revenue came in at $466 million only a 1% increase in the same time period. Putting these figures into context we see that Jakafi’s sporadic sales figures are largely as a result of the pandemic as timelines for the purchases for drugs have been forced to change. This being said Jakafi still makes up 70% of Incyte’s revenue.

So why should investors care? Well sales of Jakafi are certain to grow within its current market and as it grows its applications beyond its current label. Although there is the prospect of its’s patent expiring in 2027 this drug will continue to grow in utility and profitability. Second the company has a quickly diversifying timeline of drug candidates. These include parsaclisib which is currently being tested in phase 3 clinical trials as a potential treatment for mantle cell lymphoma among other illnesses.

Of course Incyte will continue to draw revenue from its existing drug catalogue featuring cancer treatments like Monjuvi and Pemazyre. So although the company has lagged a little in its recent share price performance there’s little reason to be overly concerned at the broader trend. With one of the company’s diversifying portfolio existing drugs and new approvals investors should look to keep this stock firmly in their basket for the foreseeable future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

INTC,Intel,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbGlsaXB1dGluZy5jb20vYXMtY29yZS1tMy04MTAweS1yZWFjaGVzLWVuZC1vZi1saWZlLWludGVsLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5lYXJseS1pZGVudGljYWwtcGVudGl1bS1nb2xkLTY1MDB5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Core m3-8100Y reaches end of life Intel launches nearly identical Pentium Gold 6500Y,"The Intel Core m3-8100Y is a low-power processor designed for use in thin and light laptops and tablets and it’s proven particularly popular since the chip launched in 2018 among Chinese PC makers like GPD and One Netbook who have used it in a number of mini-laptops.

But Intel began phasing out the processor earlier this year with the final shipments set to go out to customers in October. While there are a number of other options available for PC makers looking for a low-power chip for use in laptops tablets or mini PCs one new option is particularly interesting… because on paper the new Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y processor looks nearly identical to the Core m3-8100Y.

Both chips are 5-watt processor manufactured using a 14 nm process. Both are positioned under Intel’s “Amber Lake” processor lineup.

Both are also dual-core processors with support for hyperthreading allowing for up to four threads. Both have base clock speeds of 1.1 GHz and support for boost speeds up to 3.4 GHz although either chip can be configured with a base frequency as low as 600 MHz or as high as 1.6 GHz.

And both feature Intel UHD 615 graphics with 300 MHz base and 900 MHz max graphics frequencies.

There are at least two differences:

The Pentium Gold 6500Y may be more energy efficient as it supports TDP-down configurations as low as 3.5 W or TDP-up as high as 7W while still apparently offering similar speeds to the m3-8100Y (which supports 4.5W down or 8W up).

Intel launched the Pentium Gold 6500Y in the first quarter of 2021 making it about two and a half years newer than its predecessor. As such it’s still available and fully supported.

Intel seems to be moving away from the Core m3 brand altogether and positioning the current version of this chip as a “Pentium Gold” processor helps differentiate it from higher-performance chips sold under the Core i3 or higher names.

But honestly the chip appears to be very closely related to another new processor the Intel Core i3-10100Y which has similar features but slightly higher CPU and graphics frequencies.

According to information posted recently to the GeekBench website the next-gen Microsoft Surface Go tablet may be available with a choice of Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y processor options which suggests that the top-tier version of the upcoming Microsoft Surface Go 3 may not be all that different from a top-of-the-line Surface Go 2 (which already has a Core m3-8100Y system-on-a-chip) but the entry-level model could be a significant upgrade over starting configuration for the Surface Go 2 (which has a 1.7 GHz Pentium Gold 4425Y processor that does not support Intel Turbo Boost technology).

During the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 Intel's (INTC -0.28%) market cap briefly surpassed $500 billion. At the time its smaller rival AMD (AMD -0.02%) was only worth about $12 billion.

But today Intel has a market cap of just $215 billion and AMD is worth $130 billion. Let's see why Intel's value tumbled as AMD gradually caught up and whether or not AMD could eclipse Intel by 2025.

How Intel lost its momentum

At its dot-com peak Intel was valued at nearly 50 times its 2020 earnings. Today the stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings compared to AMD's forward P/E ratio of 35.

The market's enthusiasm for Intel waned as it ceded the CPU market to AMD in the early 2000s. However AMD spread its resources too thinly after it expanded into the GPU market with its acquisition of ATI in 2006 and it struggled to battle Intel and Nvidia (NVDA 1.20%) across two different markets.

Intel struck back with new CPUs and it comfortably controlled 82.5% of the global CPU market by the third quarter of 2016 according to PassMark Software. AMD controlled the remaining 17.5%.

But over the past five years the tables turned. Intel struggled to maintain its two-year ""tick-tock"" cycle of shrinking down chips and refining them and its internal foundry fell behind TSMC (TSM 4.41%) in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips. It repeatedly struggled with delays and shortages and frustrated OEMs shifted back toward AMD.

AMD spun off its internal foundry as GlobalFoundries in 2009 and became a fabless chipmaker that outsourced its chips to third-party foundries. AMD initially outsourced most if its orders to GlobalFoundries but eventually switched to TSMC and Samsung's more advanced processes. That decision enabled AMD to produce more advanced chips than Intel while delivering a stable supply of CPUs and GPUs to OEMs.

As a result AMD claimed 39.8% of the global CPU market in the third quarter of 2021 according to PassMark while Intel held a 60% share. That stunning reversal caused AMD's revenue growth to outpace Intel's by a wide margin over the past five years:

How Intel plans to catch up

Intel recently renamed its existing processes doubled down on the expansion of its foundries and claimed it could catch up to TSMC by 2024 and reclaim the process lead by 2025. Meanwhile AMD's future will likely remain tethered to TSMC's new processes through 2025.

Therefore the upcoming battle will be between Intel and TSMC instead of AMD. But even in a best-case scenario it should take Intel a few more years to manufacture smaller chips than TSMC.

AMD's current CPUs are built with TSMC's 7nm process. Intel's latest chips are built with its own 10nm process which is comparable to TSMC's 7nm node in terms of density but larger and less power-efficient.

AMD plans to launch its 5nm Zen 4 CPUs in 2022 and those chips could include an integrated RDNA 2 GPU to simultaneously compete against Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs. Intel will launch its ""Intel 7"" (formerly 10nm) and ""Intel 4"" (formerly 7nm) chips in 2022.

Intel believes its ""Intel 4"" chips will outperform TSMC's 5nm chips (and draw some attention away from exact node sizes) but it has a lousy track record: It previously fumbled its transitions between its ""old"" 14nm 10nm and 7nm nodes. If Intel drops the ball again it could face more delays shortages and market share losses to AMD which merely needs to rely on TSMC to remain competitive.

How AMD could eclipse Intel by 2025

Analysts expect AMD to grow faster than Intel over the next two years.

Metric AMD

(FY 2021) AMD

(FY 2022) Intel

(FY 2021) Intel

(FY 2022) Revenue Growth 60% 16% (5%) (1%) EPS Growth 93% 23% (10%) (7%)

We should take those estimates with a grain of salt but they reflect the current strength of AMD's CPU and GPU businesses its robust sales of custom APUs for gaming consoles and Intel's market share losses across the desktop laptop and server markets. Intel's earnings will also likely decline as it expands its domestic foundries and develops new chips.

It's difficult to tell what will happen after 2022. Intel might miss its own targets resulting in more market share losses to AMD or it could fulfill its goals and strike back at AMD with more powerful chips.

If Intel stumbles and its growth stagnates through 2025 there's a strong chance AMD's growth will accelerate its stock will more than double and its market cap will eclipse Intel's. But if Intel's turnaround plans pay off its stock could rally and make it much more valuable than AMD again.

The bottom line

I'm not sure if AMD will be more valuable than Intel by 2025. However I believe AMD will remain a superior investment for three reasons: It's led by a visionary CEO who has skillfully boxed Intel into a corner its business is better diversified across the CPU GPU and APU markets and it wisely relies on TSMC and other foundries instead of manufacturing its own chips.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2ludGVsLXByZXZpZXdzLWJpZ2dlc3QtY2hpcC1zaGlmdHMtaW4tZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zb21lLWRldmVsb3BlZC1pbi1pc3JhZWwv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vaW50ZWwtcHJldmlld3MtYmlnZ2VzdC1jaGlwLXNoaWZ0cy1pbi1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNvbWUtZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWluLWlzcmFlbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel previews biggest chip shifts ‘in generation’ some developed in Israel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.timesofisrael.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A few days ago we covered the new Intel Xe HPC GPU in Intel Ponte Vecchio is a Spaceship of a GPU. Between Intel Architecture Day 2021 and Hot Chips 33 we published about a month’s worth of STH content in a five-day period. As a result the video for that piece was delayed a few days.

Intel Ponte Vecchio Video after Architecture Day and Hot Chips

In the video like the article that came out a few days ago we go into why the Intel Ponte Vecchio GPU required a lot of innovation. It is a major leap forward in humanity’s ability to create new processing packages. As a result we call the upcoming GPU a “spaceship” and those that build the chip version of the spaceship “chipbuilders.” We did have a small number of new details on Ponte Vecchio at Hot Chips 33 this week that have been incorporated but there was not enough new this week to warrant a new article on the subject. Intel largely showed the same slides but with a small handful of changes.

Here is the video if you want to listen and work around the house this weekend:

As always we suggest opening the video in another tab window or the YouTube app for a better viewing experience.

Final Words

We are a bit backed up at STH and have a number of big reviews coming in the next few days. Still we wanted this video to get some air time since it took work to get out.

Hopefully as we transition into September between the big move and summer vacation season ending we get back into our normal operating rhythm. We have a number of very cool projects that are coming out over the coming few weeks so it is going to be worth subscribing to the STH YouTube channel. We will still have web versions of our articles this is just an occasion where the web version came out before the video version due to time constraints.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy90aGlua3BhZC14MTMtZ2VuLTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review: Is it a cheaper dupe of the X1 Carbon?,"The ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 serves up zippy video transcoding impressive overall performance and a productivity-boosting keyboard but you’ll be better off shelling out a little more for the highly rated X1 Carbon

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 specs Price: $1205

CPU: Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU

GPU: Iris Xe

RAM: 8GB

Storage: 256GB PCIe SSD

Display: 13.3-inch 1920 x 1200-pixel

Battery: 11:14

Size: 12 x 8.6 x 0.7 inches

Weight: 2.8 pounds

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 must feel like the spawn of an international superstar à la John David Washington Tracee Ellis Ross or Robin Thicke. In the same way everyone expects the aforementioned three to at the very least have a modicum of their parents’ talents the ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 is under immense pressure to offer some of the same “oomph” as its highly praised kin: the ThinkPad X1 Carbon.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the reigning king of business laptops with its spectacular keyboard epic battery runtime and ultraportable design but it’s pricey. That’s where the ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 comes in — it’s meant to cater to the “I want a ThinkPad X1 Carbon without needing to sell my soul for one” crowd.

The ThinkPad X13 borrows some impressive elements from its well-received forefather including that class-leading keyboard indefatigable internals and sweet-sounding speakers but as expected it fails to fill the X1 Carbon’s shoes.

You may be thinking “Well of course it won’t fill its shoes! It’s not supposed to.” You’re right; the X13 is meant to be a stripped down X1 Carbon capable of handling your productivity needs but it has one or two flagrant issues that makes me question whether it deserves a spot on our best business laptops list.

After all the ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 isn’t too far off in price from the X1 Carbon so you may be better off saving a few hundred bucks to get the real deal.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) price and configurations

My review unit is the cheapest configuration you can get. It has a starting price of $1205 and comes with a 2.4-GHz quad-core Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU Intel Iris Xe graphics 8GB of RAM a 256GB PCIe SSD a 13.3-inch 1920 x 1200-pixel display and Windows 10 Pro.

Opting to bump the storage to a 512GB SSD will cost you about $200 more ($1391).

If you prefer a model with a Core i7 CPU you’ll have to shell out $2003. Upgrades include a quad-core 3-GHz Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor with vPro 16GB of RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 design

The ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 looks similar to the star of the family the X1 Carbon but it’s not as refined. The most salient differences are its unattractive thick bezels that frame the matte display. And unlike the current-gen X1 Carbon which has speakers flanking the keyboard the X13 Gen 2’s speakers are housed at the top of the deck.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

The X13 still inherited some distinctive ThinkPad features such as the touchpad with dedicated left-and-right click buttons the cult-favorite Lenovo TrackPoint and the sturdy build quality. The ThinkPad X13 also obtained the X1 Carbon’s polished urbane vibes thanks to the chassis’ slate-gray hue. The X13 definitely has the same personality as the X1 Carbon in that it doesn’t like to attract too much attention. It’s the type to opt for subtle minimalistic fashion choices because it wants to be taken seriously.

The X13 features a Lenovo insignia on the bottom-right of the lid while the top-left is adorned with a diagonally stamped ThinkPad logo — the dot of the “i” illuminates in red when the laptop is on.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

The bottom of the ThinkPad X13 has four rubber feet to give the device some breathing room when it’s placed on a surface. There’s also a small square-shaped ventilation grill housed on the upper-left quadrant of the laptop's underside.

The ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 sports dimensions of 12 x 8.6 x 0.7 inches and weighs 2.8 pounds. It’s heavier than its rivals Dell Latitude 7320 2-in-1 (12.1 x 7.9 x 0.7 inches 2.5 pounds) and Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ (11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches 1.8 pounds) but lighter than the HP Envy 13 (12.1 x 7.7 x 0.7 inches 2.9 pounds).

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) ports

You don’t have to worry about getting tangled up in dongle hell with the ThinkPad X13. Lenovo offers a healthy mix of legacy and modern ports to meet your connectivity needs.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

On the left you’ll find two Thunderbolt 4 ports an Ethernet Extension port an HDMI 2.0 port a USB-A 3.2 Gen.1 port and a headset jack. The right side offers a Kensington lock slot  another USB-A 3.2 Gen.1 port and a SmartCard reader.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) display

Yawn! The only word I could come up with to describe the ThinkPad X13’s 13.3-inch 1920 x 1200 matte display is “basic.” There’s nothing special about it but it’s not a substandard panel either — it’s just OK. I could do without the unsightly thick bezels too.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

I watched the Prisoners of the Ghostland trailer and I was unmoved by the display’s so-so quality. With a little squinting I could make out the fine-gray hairs that populated Nicolas Cage’s beard as he wore a dismal expression in the face of grave danger. To see if I could spot subtler facial features I looked fixedly at one character who was draped in all white à la the Dukes of Hazzards’ Boss Hogg. Unfortunately his crow’s feet laugh lines and other features lacked distinction and sharpness on the ThinkPad X13’s display. The colors are also mediocre. In one scene there were women dressed in gorgeous formal kimonos but the display's colors didn’t have that pop to show off their striking designs.

The results from our display testing align with my anecdotal experience. The ThinkPad X13’s panel covers only 75% of the DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. The Envy 13 (80%) the Latitude 7320 (83%) and the Surface Pro 7+ (76%) are more vivid. The ThinkPad X13 couldn’t even beat the DCI-P3 color-gamut coverage of the average premium laptop (82%).

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

The ThinkPad X13’s display emanated an average of 330 nits of brightness . This is dimmer than the Envy 13 (361 nits) Surface Pro 7+ (358 nits) and the average premium laptop (394 nits) but brighter than the tragically lackluster Latitude 7320 (260 nits).

The ThinkPad X13 shares the same Delta-E color accuracy as the Envy 13 and the Latitude 7320 with a score of 0.29 (closer to 0 is better) but fell short of the category average (0.26). The Surface Pro 7+ is slightly more color accurate with a score of 0.24.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) keyboard and touchpad

I thought I’d use the ThinkPad X13’s keyboard to write a portion of this review — just to test it out — but the bouncy tactile clicky keys seduced my fingers to stick around for a while longer. I threw my main-driver laptop aside and continued using the ThinkPad X13’s ultra-comfortable keyboard for the entire work week. I love springy switches with satisfying feedback — and the ThinkPad X13’s keyboard provides just that.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

The atypical arrangement of the keys caught my attention. For example the PrtSc key usually located on the top function row is now one key away from the space bar. The arrow keys are tiny as well but these bizarre placements don’t faze me. Hell Lenovo could flip all the letters upside down remove all the Shift keys and place the touchpad on the bottom of the laptop and I’d still rave about the keyboard because it feels that good.

On the 10FastFingers.com typing test I reached 91 words per minute which is slightly faster than my 87-wpm average.

The little red nub takes me back! I had a ThinkPad during my college days. While I relished in the gratifying feeling of sinking my fingertip onto the TrackPoint and making the cursor go wild I never thought it was useful. This doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate the red nub though; I know fans love the TrackPoint because it allows them to control the cursor without moving their hand. Plus there’s something nostalgic and “iconic” about the striking-red TrackPoint especially for the Lenovo brand. Every time I look at it I can’t help but laugh at the inappropriate jokes my classmates would make about my keyboard’s “red nipple.”

Now let’s talk about the touchpad. I prefer touchpads with dedicated left and right buttons so I was giddy to see them nestled between the spacebar and the touchpad. The touchpad itself still embodies the modern buttonless clickpads that are prevalent today — there’s something for everyone I guess.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

The touchpad was silky-smooth to the touch allowing me to execute my favorite Windows 10 gestures such as pinch-to-zoom two-finger scrolling and three-finger swiping to change windows.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) audio

The ThinkPad X13’s Dolby Atmos speakers are nestled between the region that sits between the hinge and the function keys. It perfectly captured the melodic flow of Sleepy Hallow’s “2055” allowing me to enjoy the ear-soothing guitar riffs and the clear distinct vocals.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

Even as I pushed the volume to its peak I was impressed that there was virtually no distortion and the gritty tune filled my medium-sized testing room. The speakers didn’t need any tuning but there is a Dolby Atmos app that features presets: Dynamic Game Movie Music and Voice. Music is the default preset and the one to keep enabled as I learned after testing all five profiles on Lil Nas X’s “Industry Baby”. The Music delivered rich honeyed sounds of the bombastic tune straight to my ears.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) performance

How well can the ThinkPad X13 equipped with an Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU and 8GB of RAM handle your onslaught of tabs and RAM -heavy processes? Well we put the Lenovo laptop to the test by flooding it with 35 tabs on Google Chrome ; two of them ran Twitch streams. With all the chaos running in the background I wanted to check if the Lenovo laptop could keep up with my zippy typing as I fired up a new Google Doc — the ThinkPad X13 didn’t even break a sweat.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

Even on our synthetic benchmarks the ThinkPad X13 put in the work to avoid landing in last place as it faced off with its fierce competitors (which sport the same CPU).

The Geekbench 5.4 overall performance test revealed that the Lenovo hit 5203 outpacing the average premium laptop (4857) the Envy 13 (4930) and the Surface Pro 7+ (4825). However the Latitude 7320 beat the ThinkPad X13 with a score of 5292.

It took the 256GB PCIe SSD in the ThinkPad X13 one minute and 26 seconds to duplicate 25GB of multimedia files for a transfer rate of 310.5 megabytes per second. Compared to its rivals which also have 256GB SSDs the Lenovo only managed to beat the Latitude 7320 (192.1 MBps). It could not keep up with the Envy 13 (415.6 MBps) the Surface Pro 7+ (348.3 MBps) and the premium-laptop average (623.5 MBps).

The ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 finally climbed to the top on our Handbrake video-editing test. The Lenovo converted a 4K video to 1080p resolution in 13 minutes and 9 seconds. This is much faster than the times outputted by its slow-poke rivals: the Envy 13 (17:29) Latitude 7320 (17:16) and the snail-like Surface Pro 7+ (23:41).

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) graphics

The ThinkPad X13 comes with Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics  the same GPU packed inside the Envy 13 the Latitude 7320 and Surface Pro 7+. It’s ideal for running photo and video editing apps but steer clear of graphics-intensive gaming.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

On the 3DMark Fire Strike benchmark the ThinkPad X13 reached 4906 which pales in comparison to the average premium laptop (4969) and the Latitude 7320 (4227) but it crushed the Envy 13 (3709) and the Surface Pro 7+ (3215).

For the heck of it we tested how well the ThinkPad X13 could handle gaming with our Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm (1080p) benchmark. It reached 31 frames per second just ahead of our 30-fps playability threshold. That beats the average premium laptops (30 fps) the Envy 13 (18 fps) the Latitude 7320 (20 fps) and the Surface Pro 7+ (15 fps).

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) battery life

The ThinkPad X13 lasted 11 hours and 14 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test  which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits. This is pretty damn impressive but unfortunately for the Lenovo laptop’s ego its rivals’ battery runtimes are superb too.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

ThinkPad X13 outlasted the average premium laptop (10:49) and the Surface Pro 7+ (8:49) but could not keep up with the Envy 13 (11:15) and the Latitude 7320 (12:01).

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) webcam

Another ho-hum webcam. What else is new? Like many other built-in laptop cameras on the market the ThinkPad X13’s 720 webcam is far from impressive.

(Image credit: Future)

A selfie I snapped with the webcam was disappointing. A bouquet of flowers on an adjacent nightstand looked like indistinct blurry red blobs. The labels of nearby water bottles were fuzzy and difficult to discern. Colors were inconsistent; the camera captured my natural complexion quite well but the lilac wall behind me looked more off-white.

A business laptop deserves a webcam that can handle business — and well — this camera ain’t it. We recommend buying an external webcam for conference calls.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) heat

Don’t worry you can place the ThinkPad X13 on your lap without worrying about it singeing a hole through your jeans.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

After playing a 15-minute 1080p video the Lenovo laptop’s touchpad peaked at 84 degrees Fahrenheit on our heat test. The keyboard hovered at around 91 degrees. The underside (94 degrees) was the hottest region of the ThinkPad X13 and stopped short of breaching our 95-degree Fahrenheit comfort threshold.

Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (Gen 2) software and warranty

It’s a relief that the ThinkPad X13 isn’t sullied with too much bloatware . Other than Microsoft Solitaire Collection and Skype I couldn’t find any superfluous pre-installed apps on the system’s Windows 10 Pro OS. You’ll also find two Lenovo-branded apps: Commercial Vantage and Quick Clean.

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 review (Image credit: Future)

Commercial Vantage gives you a quick overview of your laptop (e.g. serial number product number and BIOS version). You can also check your warranty status disk space memory and system updates. There’s also a Wi-Fi security tab that employs an advanced cloud-based software service to protect your device from unsafe malicious wireless networks.

Quick Clean lets you temporarily disable your system’s inputs so you can give your laptop a deep physical cleaning which is useful when too many crumbs get into the crevices of your keyboard because you love snacking.

The ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 ships with a one-year warranty. See how the brand fared in our Tech support showdown and Best and worst brands special reports.

Bottom line

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 has an edge over its competitors; it serves up impressive overall performance and its video-transcoding speed gave its rivals whiplash. However I hesitate to recommend it because as of this writing the ThinkPad X1 Carbon with the same specs (Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM) is priced at $1392 at Lenovo . This is only $200 more than our X13 Gen 2 review unit.

You’d be better off shelling out a little more for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon which garnered a five-star rating and an Editor’s Choice badge. Plus the ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a fingerprint reader great quad speakers slim bezels a consistently working touchpad and nearly 16 hours of battery life — the ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 could never."

Flavors of Fairfield features a passport app to track your travels trying new restaurants. The city features a variety of cuisines from Dominican Dishes at Mofongo City to Vietnamese Flavors at Pho district Cincy.

“You can get everything from Nepalese food different Indian restaurants Colombian food all kinds of South American options all kinds of things you would not expect in Ohio let alone Fairfield Ohio” said Mark Borison a podcaster based at Jungle Jim’s International Market another place that attracts foodies to Fairfield.

If you check in at four restaurants you can head to the market and meet up with Borison who will give you a medal designed to look like a spork.

“I’ll also probably give you a snack” Borison said.

Eight or more restaurant check-ins will enter you to win the $1000 gift card and some other prizes.

His store has more than three times the items than there are residents in Fairfield a town of fewer than 50000 people.

“What’s so fun about this: there’s so many restaurants you can try in Fairfield you can expand your horizons and if you win the Jungle Jim’s gift card you don’t have to just go to the restaurants you can make those flavors at home now too” he said.

The direct local economic repercussions of such events are considered to be greater in low-income countries because these countries typically already have hotter climates which implies that ecosystems are closer to their biophysical limits and have less access to technology that can mitigate the consequences of extreme weather. Moreover most low-income countries have very high shares of agriculture in economic activity which is the most vulnerable sector to weather shocks (Nordhaus 2006 Dell et al. 2012 Noy 2012 Tol 2015 Cruz and Rossi-Hansberg 2021). Since poor countries have to bear the bulk of the climate change burden it is often argued that this acts as a disincentive for rich economies to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions (Althor et al. 2016).

However the rise in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events around the globe as well as crop diseases and pests due to climate change could also have an impact on the economic performance of countries that are not directly exposed to the extreme events through global agricultural production shortfalls and surges in food commodity prices. Specifically since global production of the most important crops is concentrated in a small number of major producing regions that are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions the IPCC projects greater risks of global food system disruptions and agricultural production shortfalls that trigger substantial rises in global food prices (IPCC 2019). Such food commodity market disruptions at the global level are not science fiction; extreme droughts in several major producing regions at the same time were for example the primary reason for the rise in the prices of the key staple food items in the second half of 2010 and summer of 2012 by 40% and 20% respectively which can be observed in Figure 1 (Barriopedro et al. 2011 De Winne and Peersman 2016). Studies conclude that an event that would have been called a 1-in-100 years extreme adverse global food production shock over the period 1951–2010 may become as frequent as 1-in-30 years before the middle of the century (Bailey et al. 2015).

Figure 1 Evolution of global real food commodity prices over time

Note: All prices are in US dollar and measured as 100 times the natural log of the index deflated by US CPI. The broad food commodity price index is a trade-weighted average of benchmark prices for cereals meat seafood vegetable oils sugar fruit vegetables and dairy products. Data from the IMF.

Economic consequences of global food commodity price shocks

In De Winne and Peersman (2021a) we examine the impact of disruptions in global food commodity markets on the economic activity of 75 advanced and developing countries. For each country we have estimated the effects of changes in global food commodity prices that were caused by harvest disruptions and by weather shocks that occurred in other regions of the world. The harvest disruptions are unanticipated shocks to the aggregate harvest volumes of the four most important staple food commodities: corn wheat rice and soybeans. The weather shocks are deviations of agricultural-weighted global weather conditions (i.e. a quadratic in average temperature as well as total precipitation weighted by grid-level agricultural output and crop calendars) from their historical averages and long-term trend. For each country we only look at shocks that occurred in other regions of the world to measure the macroeconomic effects via global food commodity markets rather than direct effects of extreme weather on local economic activity.

Figure 2 shows the average responses of economic activity in all 75 countries to a 10% increase in global food commodity prices caused by both types of shocks. The dynamic effects turn out to be very similar for both sources of food price shifts; that is real GDP reaches a maximum decline of 0.53% after six quarters. This impact is considerable since extreme weather has triggered several price shifts of more than 10% and up to 30% in the past. The results also suggest that the strong rise of global food commodity prices in recent periods (see Figure 1) could impede the post-covid recovery.

Figure 2 Dynamic responses to a 10% increase in global food commodity prices

Note: the price shift is at period 0 while all other determinants are kept constant. Horizon of the responses (x-axis) is quarterly. 68 and 95% confidence intervals. The first column isolates for each country price changes that are caused by unfavorable harvest disruptions in other regions of the world and the second column price changes caused by weather shocks in other regions of the world. Results are based on 75 advanced and developing countries covering the period 1970Q1-2016Q4. Source: De Winne and Peersman (2021a).

We further find that several indicators of (expected) global economic activity decline as a consequence of the food commodity market disruptions whereas consumer prices increase significantly. In related research De Winne and Peersman (2016) and Peersman (forthcoming) show for the US and euro area respectively that food commodity price surges have an impact on food retail prices through the food production chain but also trigger indirect inflationary effects via rising wages and exchange rate shifts. In addition households do not only reduce food consumption – that is there is even a much greater decline of durable consumption and investment. The latter is partly the consequence of the monetary policy response to stabilise the inflationary consequences. Overall the macroeconomic effects turn out to be a multiple of the maximum impact implied by the share of food commodities in the consumer price index and household consumption.

Differences between rich and poor countries

Figure 3 reveals that high- and middle-income countries are much more affected by global food commodity price shifts that are caused by harvest and/or weather shocks elsewhere. Real GDP in these two groups of countries declines by 0.52% and 0.91% respectively whereas the peak decline in low-income countries is only 0.19% and statistically insignificant.

Figure 3 Effects of global food commodity price increases in advanced versus poor countries

Note: Results for 10% price shifts caused by unfavourable harvest disruptions in other regions of the world. 68 and 95% confidence intervals. High-income countries are the top-tertile (top-25) of countries according to PPP-adjusted real GDP per capita over the period 2000-2015. Low-income countries are the bottom tertile (51-75) and middle-income countries are the remaining countries (26-50). Source: De Winne and Peersman (2021a).

The stronger effects in advanced economies are surprising since the share of food (commodities) in household expenditures is much lower than in low-income countries. Moreover since high-income countries typically have more effective government institutions it is less likely that food price increases trigger conflicts that are detrimental for economic activity such as food riots (De Winne and Peersman 2021b). Finally advanced countries have better developed financial markets to absorb income shocks.

It turns however out that these favourable characteristics are offset by a number of less advantageous features. First we find that the macroeconomic repercussions are weaker in countries that are net exporters of agricultural products which can be explained by a favourable terms of trade effect. In addition we document a more subdued decline of real GDP in countries that have higher shares of agriculture in economic activity which is likely the consequence of the fact that these countries are more isolated from changes in global prices because more households are self-sufficiency farmers and a lot of agricultural products are traded on local markets only due to higher transportation costs in rural areas. Finally we find weaker effects in countries that have lower shares of non-agricultural trade in GDP; that is countries that are less integrated with the rest of the world via trade are also less sensitive to the global economic downturn caused by the rise in food commodity prices.

The favourable characteristics which typically apply to low-income countries can explain the weaker overall effects in low-income countries. In particular once we control for these country characteristics in a panel regression we find that the decline of economic activity becomes smaller when income per capita is higher.

Conclusion

There will be more frequent and greater downturns in economic activity compared to a ‘no climate change’ scenario through increases in global food commodity prices that are the consequence of extreme weather events in major agricultural production regions such as droughts and heatwaves. In contrast to common perception (e.g. Financial Times 2021 Espitia et al. 2020) the macroeconomic repercussions of increases in global food prices are greater in advanced economies than in low-income countries. This suggests that the consequences of climate change on advanced countries may be greater than previously thought. This also implies that we need a more nuanced debate on the welfare effects of higher food prices as earlier argued by Headey (2011) and Hertel and Rosch (2011).

Finally swings in global food prices appear to be important for economic activity in many countries. The strong rise of global food commodity prices since the outbreak of COVID-19 could thus seriously impede the recovery.

The purpose of the summit was to hold a dialogue on key issues for advancing social justice via student development and support in higher education.



The focus flowed from the recommendations of the Fourth Global Summit held in Santiago in 2018. The previous IASAS global summits were held in Washington DC in 2012 Rome in 2014 and Cape Town in 2016.



That summit highlighted four SDGs as the primary focus of work with students: education gender equality reduced inequalities and climate action. The conversations confirmed that the UN’s framework for global sustainable social justice is a lingua franca for advancing a better life for all.



The Toronto summit opened with a compelling address framing higher education as a critical avenue that advances the SDGs across regions by Professor Margaret Biggs who served as president of the Canadian International Development Agency and is now the Matthews Fellow in Global Public Policy at Queen’s University chair of the board of governors at the International Development Research Centre and chair of World University Service of Canada.



The SDGs according to Biggs are “premised on indigenous voices given momentum by the UN which generated this global framework for peace and prosperity for all”. The SDGs offer a lingua franca that transcends political cycles and socio-cultural borders and promotes regional collaboration to tackle the kinds of conditions that impair peace and prosperity.



The summit kicked off with regional hubs facilitated virtually at different times to extract what regions do how they can be more impactful and what support they need to advance the SDGs in their regions.



Regions countries and universities are differently ‘tuned in’ to the SDGs some relying on rankings as the driver some on social justice goals and yet others are lagging behind.



Student affairs and services support for the SDGs



There were clear examples through conference sessions in which student affairs and services had supported institutions in making the SDGs a priority.



The conference papers illustrated that student learning about the SDGs took place through structuring student organisations and activities linked to the SDGs leadership education community service and outreach with internal and external partners.



Hong Kong University Science and Technology (HKUST) maps learning opportunities against the SDGs and organises advocacy campaigns to raise awareness of the SDGs connecting students to the ‘real world’.



HKUST and Centro Escolar University in the Philippines strengthen awareness of the SDGs by taking a deep dive each academic year honing in on specific SDGs. This year for student affairs and services at Centro Escolar University the focus has been on mental health planning for sustainable cities and quality education.



Similarly participants noted that environmental climate change and sustainability goals are being implemented campus-wide in many institutions but not always in ways that are connected to SDGs.



It emerged that universities and student affairs and services can be bolder to help connect students to the SDGs and assist students in developing the kind of competency and agency needed to realise the SDGs within their current lives as well as their lives when they leave university.



For some participants the summit was a wake-up call acknowledging that the SDGs were the global framework to tackle many of the local issues impacting on their students and communities.



A student voice



A cross-cutting theme was student preoccupation with global challenges facing humanity and their deep concern about finding solutions.



Four students as part of a panel shared the difference they were making in creating organisations and companies to meet the needs of their local communities.



Students highlighted that on the one hand they seek to make a difference to their peers while on campus and while at university but they also emphasised that students need to become agents for change beyond their university careers.



Participants in the summit developed a position paper that identified enablers to achieving goals set out in the UN’s Agenda 2030:



• Aligning institutional and student affairs and services strategies and goals explicitly with the SDGs.



• Aligning student affairs and services work around the SDGs with institutional strategies and goals.



• Aligning student affairs and services work explicitly with academic faculty and research agendas.



• Emphasising the dual lens: thinking globally and acting locally recognising our global and local impact and responsibility.



• Building partnerships and collaborations with communities networks organisations and partnerships – like local sustainable development and solution networks – to synergise around SDGs.



• Linkages with other universities and campuses play an important part in regional and local advancement.



• Interdisciplinarity and innovation in terms of design and implementation of programmes plays a critical role.



• Documenting and sharing successes creates new synergies with universities locally nationally and internationally.



These commitments by student affairs and services associations from across the globe will be reviewed and renewed at the global association meeting to be held in November this year at which 24 associations will come together to provide updates from their regions on how they have implemented some of the commitments.



The summit concluded with the acknowledgment that broader awareness was necessary to achieve Agenda 2030. For many the summit was a first time to take a bird’s-eye world view on advancing social justice as a globally shared agenda. More examples and intentionality on the SDGs are necessary to move student support and development towards Agenda 2030.



Plans are for the sixth summit to be held in Ireland in 2022 in partnership with University College Cork and Student Affairs Ireland. It will focus on the SDGs and graduate attributes.



The discussion around the importance of the SDGs highlighted the need to expand the higher education sector and student affairs and services not only making higher education more equitably accessible but also expanding the reach and depth of the sector’s impact.



Through discussion it became clear that more universities need to take on the SDGs as a key part of their deliverables and student affairs and services is ideally placed – within and beyond higher education institutions – to facilitate the development of students as agents for change so that the SDGs can be realised as outlined by Agenda 2030. The Canadian Association of College and University Student Services hosted 140 student affairs and services experts from around the world at the University of Toronto to discuss how to improve awareness of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) among students and universities.The thought leaders were from 24 professional associations and organisations across 28 countries and six regions.

The SDGs offer a that transcends political cycles and socio-cultural borders and promotes regional collaboration to tackle the kinds of conditions that impair peace and prosperity.The summit kicked off with regional hubs facilitated virtually at different times to extract what regions do how they can be more impactful and what support they need to advance the SDGs in their regions.Regions countries and universities are differently ‘tuned in’ to the SDGs some relying on rankings as the driver some on social justice goals and yet others are lagging behind.There were clear examples through conference sessions in which student affairs and services had supported institutions in making the SDGs a priority.The conference papers illustrated that student learning about the SDGs took place through structuring student organisations and activities linked to the SDGs leadership education community service and outreach with internal and external partners.Hong Kong University Science and Technology (HKUST) maps learning opportunities against the SDGs and organises advocacy campaigns to raise awareness of the SDGs connecting students to the ‘real world’.HKUST and Centro Escolar University in the Philippines strengthen awareness of the SDGs by taking a deep dive each academic year honing in on specific SDGs. This year for student affairs and services at Centro Escolar University the focus has been on mental health planning for sustainable cities and quality education.Similarly participants noted that environmental climate change and sustainability goals are being implemented campus-wide in many institutions but not always in ways that are connected to SDGs.It emerged that universities and student affairs and services can be bolder to help connect students to the SDGs and assist students in developing the kind of competency and agency needed to realise the SDGs within their current lives as well as their lives when they leave university.For some participants the summit was a wake-up call acknowledging that the SDGs were the global framework to tackle many of the local issues impacting on their students and communities.A cross-cutting theme was student preoccupation with global challenges facing humanity and their deep concern about finding solutions.Four students as part of a panel shared the difference they were making in creating organisations and companies to meet the needs of their local communities.Students highlighted that on the one hand they seek to make a difference to their peers while on campus and while at university but they also emphasised that students need to become agents for change beyond their university careers.Participants in the summit developed a position paper that identified enablers to achieving goals set out in the UN’s Agenda 2030:• Aligning institutional and student affairs and services strategies and goals explicitly with the SDGs.• Aligning student affairs and services work around the SDGs with institutional strategies and goals.• Aligning student affairs and services work explicitly with academic faculty and research agendas.• Emphasising the dual lens: thinking globally and acting locally recognising our global and local impact and responsibility.• Building partnerships and collaborations with communities networks organisations and partnerships – like local sustainable development and solution networks – to synergise around SDGs.• Linkages with other universities and campuses play an important part in regional and local advancement.• Interdisciplinarity and innovation in terms of design and implementation of programmes plays a critical role.• Documenting and sharing successes creates new synergies with universities locally nationally and internationally.These commitments by student affairs and services associations from across the globe will be reviewed and renewed at the global association meeting to be held in November this year at which 24 associations will come together to provide updates from their regions on how they have implemented some of the commitments.The summit concluded with the acknowledgment that broader awareness was necessary to achieve Agenda 2030. For many the summit was a first time to take a bird’s-eye world view on advancing social justice as a globally shared agenda. More examples and intentionality on the SDGs are necessary to move student support and development towards Agenda 2030.Plans are for the sixth summit to be held in Ireland in 2022 in partnership with University College Cork and Student Affairs Ireland. It will focus on the SDGs and graduate attributes.The discussion around the importance of the SDGs highlighted the need to expand the higher education sector and student affairs and services not only making higher education more equitably accessible but also expanding the reach and depth of the sector’s impact.Through discussion it became clear that more universities need to take on the SDGs as a key part of their deliverables and student affairs and services is ideally placed – within and beyond higher education institutions – to facilitate the development of students as agents for change so that the SDGs can be realised as outlined by Agenda 2030.

Just hearing that sentence can put some of us beach lovers into a tailspin.

Fall is actually the perfect time to visit some awesome wheelchair accessible destinations that are complete with a plethora of things to do and fall foliage to set the scene just right. So grab your pumpkin spice latte because here are five accessible destinations that you must visit this fall.

Burlington VT

Burlington is just south of the Canadian border and is the largest city in Vermont. It sits on the eastern shoreline of Lake Champlain which divides Vermont from New York. This accessible city boasts many eclectic boutiques local shops and too many restaurants to count.

But what really makes this the perfect fall destination are the many apple orchards. Who can think of fall without dreaming of a nice warm cup of apple cider? Certainly not me! Here at Shelburne Orchards you can stay in your vehicle and drive to the apple trees. Once there you can pick your own apples. You will have several options of bag sizes to purchase and fill your bag yourself. There is also a little shop on site with the most delicious apple cider donuts that you can imagine fresh cider and apples already picked for you.

Also in Burlington you will find the world's first public universally accessible community treehouse. You can walk/roll along the slightly elevated ramp all the way until you go inside the treehouse. Here you can view the shoreline of Lake Champlain and the views are simply amazing. You can see all the fall colors from there while being amongst the treetops.

While you are in Vermont enjoying the sights and the fall foliage get active with Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports. They have custom hand cycles that are oversized adaptive mountain bikes. These will allow you to be able to get outside and enjoy fall while getting a workout all at the same time.

Marquette MI

Marquette is the largest city in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula) of Michigan and is such a cute quaint town along Lake Superior. You will be able to enjoy delicious dining unique shopping and a plethora of outdoor adventures.

You cannot miss the fall viewing sight from Thomas Rock Scenic Overlook. This is a 1-mile-long hard packed trail that leads you through the woods to an amazing viewpoint of Lake Superior. The trail is wheelchair accessible and gets a bit steep in a few spots but I had no trouble at all in my powered wheelchair. Along the trail there is also interpretive signage explaining the plants trees and fantastic views that are before you.

After viewing the changing of the leaves enjoy a spectacular viewing of the sunset at Presque Isle Park. This is a 323-acre public park that can be enjoyed from a paved park loop that carries you along 2.2 miles. This oval shaped peninsula reaches out into Lake Superior. It is home to a breathtaking photo op of the Michigan sunset at Sunset Point.

If you really want to explore the fall colors then take a leap on over to the 47-mile paved hiking and biking path called the Iron Ore Heritage Trail. This pathway is easily wheelchair accessible and runs along several former railroads that were built to carry the iron ore from the mines to Lake Superior harbor. Trust me this is a long trail so make sure if you are in a powered chair that your battery is fully charged so that you can see as much as possible.

Adirondack Mountains NY

The Adirondack Mountain Region is absolutely gorgeous year-round but let's face it the colors of the fall foliage in this area are simply stunning. To make the most of your viewing pleasure you can fly into Albany and rent a fully wheelchair accessible van from Mobility Works. This will allow you to see the views at your own pace up close and personal through the scenic windy roads.

For your first full day here head on over to The Wild Center in Tupper Lake NY. This 115-acre experience is the perfect way to connect with nature and is a natural history museum like no other. The most unique thing that I love about this extraordinary area is the Wild Walk. It is a fully wheelchair accessible trail of bridges that leads you to the treetops of the Adirondacks. The view from the Wild Walk is breathtaking and to be here in this spot in the fall is even more reason to plan your trip today!

We can't talk about enjoying fall in the Adirondacks without mentioning International Paper John Dillon Park. This is a fully accessible camping and fishing area complete with accessible trails lean-to's and restrooms. As you roll along the accessible hiking trails you can smell the campfires amongst the lean-to's and get in touch with nature.

Blue Ridge Mountains

The Blue Ridge Mountains have one of the longest fall color seasons in the world. And what better way to see the colors than via an accessible train ride on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway?! Starting at the historic depot in downtown Blue Ridge GA this is a 4-hour 26 mile round trip journey along the Toccoa River and winds through the North Georgia countryside.

The wheelchair accessible train car has an electric lift that brings you right onto an open-air train car. From here you can see the views of all the fall colors of the Blue Ridge Mountains without even having to leave your seat. After a one-hour trip to the quiet little towns of McCaysville GA and Copperhill TN which share the state line you can get out and shop around for a two-hour layover. While here you can shop in unique shops eat ice cream or grab a quick bite to eat before boarding the train again. Once back on the train you will then return through the one hour viewing journey of the scenic forest.

Another great reason to visit the Blue Ridge Mountains in the fall is the Biltmore Estate. Named America's largest home the Biltmore Estate is located in Asheville North Carolina. It was once owned by Edith and George Vanderbilt and today this luxurious home is open to visitors so that they can enjoy this 8000-acre estate. Here you will also find a winery and gardens that are jaw dropping in size and grandeur. The first and second floors of the home are wheelchair accessible while the third floor and basement are not. But the Biltmore Estate has made sure that everyone can see it all by offering a video of the rooms that are unable to be accessed. You certainly won't roll away from here without seeing it all. Another bonus is that the parking lots offer ADA shuttle service to the front door.

Great Smoky Mountains

Another one of the great fall foliage viewing areas is the Great Smoky Mountains. This mountain range rises along the North Carolina and Tennessee border in the southeastern United States.

The very highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains is Clingman's Dome. This peak is at a height of 6643 feet and from here you can see more than 100 miles of fall foliage on a clear day. There is a fully paved but steep trail that is a half mile in length to reach Clingman's Dome. Another bonus of this spectacular viewing point is that it is free to enter!

Another way to emerge yourself into the vibrance of the colors of the Great Smoky Mountains is to roll on Sugarlands Valley Nature Trail. This trail is fully paved flat and completely wheelchair accessible. It is an easy roll through the trees beside a babbling river and is located near Gatlinburg TN. I can hear the water trickling over the rocks now and smell the nice crisp fall air just by thinking about it.

While you are in this area you do not want to miss Cades Cove as well. Cades Cove is a 4000-acre valley located near Townsend TN in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. You can drive throughout the cove on a paved road though a loop route of fields wildlife and preserved homesteads. And if you keep your eyes open you may even sight an occasional bear!

According to IQVIA a drug market research firm the size of the shingles vaccine market in the second quarter stood at 9.2 billion won ($7.8 million) down 59.1 percent from 22.6 billion won in the same period of last year. Cumulative sales in the first half-year also declined 42.2 percent to 20.1 billion won.

Currently two shingles vaccines are available in Korea MSD's Zostavax and SK Bioscience's Skyzoster.

The shingles vaccine market has shrunk considerably during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The shingles vaccine market contraction was a turnaround from a few years ago when the market saw rapid growth after the launch of Skyzoster ended the market monopoly of Zostavax. As the Skyzoster gradually increased its influence the market size expanded to 27.9 billion won in the fourth quarter of 2019.

However the successful shingles vaccine market has been on a rollercoaster ride since the Covid-19 hit the world about one-and-a-half years ago.

Sales in the first quarter of last year when the market began to feel the impact of Covid-19 halved to 12.2 billion won. While the market showed signs of recovery by recording 22.6 billion won in the second quarter of last year it fell back to 20.3 billion won in the third quarter and 17.3 billion won in the fourth quarter.

This year the decline has become steeper and the two products have slumped to the lowest level since they formed a competitive structure.

Industry experts said the slump of the shingles vaccine market was due to its greater sensitivity to external factors such as the prevalence of infectious diseases than chronic disease treatments. They also presumed that the inoculation of Covid-19 vaccines developed by global pharmaceutical companies has also played a role in decreasing the use of other vaccines.

The sales of Zostavax in the second quarter totaled 5.4 billion won down 57.9 percent from a year ago. Its cumulative sales in the first half were 11.9 billion won down 40.8 percent.

Skyzoster’s sales also plunged 60.8 percent to 3.8 billion won over the period. The sales figure hit the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017 when it made the market debut. Cumulative sales in the first half also dropped 44.2 percent to 8.2 billion won.

Korea's shingles vaccine market may need to brace up for further changes as they may soon face fiercer competition from GSK that plans to launch its shingles vaccine Shingrix which boasts far higher efficacy than existing products.

According to industry insiders GSK applied for Shingrix's sales approval to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in January and is waiting for the results of its review.

A GSK official acknowledged the company had made the application while not elaborating on its timing.

Industry insiders said that if GSK starts selling its vaccine in Korea the shingles market will undergo a more drastic change as competition will intensify amid dwindling demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To harvest a sturgeon during the hook and line season anglers must have a valid fishing license and purchase either an inland or boundary water sturgeon harvest tag.

The minimum length limit for a lake sturgeon harvest is 60 inches.

If a Wisconsin angler catches a lake sturgeon they wish to harvest they must immediately validate their tag. Any harvested sturgeon must be registered at a designated registration station no later than 6 p.m. the day after they caught the fish.

Michigan anglers are required to register a lake sturgeon harvest within 24 hours. Anglers must report their harvest online at www.michigan.gov/registerfish by calling 888-636-7778 or in person at any Department of Natural Resources Customer Service Center during normal state business hours with advanced notice

Based on surveys conducted this year Wisconsin fisheries biologists are predicting a strong overall hook and line lake sturgeon season. While anglers fishing the Menominee River are likely to encounter a limited number of 60-inch lake sturgeon they should enjoy good catch-and-release action.

On other inland waters in Wisconsin anglers should expect to encounter larger fish in 2021 and years to come.

Anglers should look for tags near the dorsal fin on lake sturgeon. If a tag is located anglers should submit the date of catch location and tag number color and material composition (i.e. metal or plastic) to the DNR. This tag information will be used to help monitor the movement and growth of lake sturgeon aiding in future species management.

When fishing on Yellow Lake in Burnett County anglers should be on the lookout for yellow dangler tags with a five-digit number on the dorsal fin of lake sturgeon.

A cause of death was not immediately disclosed.

“Ron Bushy our beloved legendary drummer of Iron Butterfly has passed away peacefully with his wife Nancy by his side at 12:05am on August 29th at UCLA Santa Monica Hospital” the band said in a statement. “All three of his daughters were also with him. He was a real fighter … He will be deeply missed!”

Bushy was the only original member to appear on all six of the band’s albums beginning with 1968’s Heavy through 1975’s Sun and Steel. He continued performing with various incarnations of the band for decades following their commercial peak.

While the group released their debut album to some commercial success — though every member besides Bushy and singer Doug Ingle would leave the group following its completion — it was the follow-up released the same year that earned them rock immortality. The title track from In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida whose title was based on Bushy’s mishearing of “In the Garden of Eden” remains part of the rock canon; a bellwether of the genre’s more bombastic psychedelic side of the late 1960s.

“‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’ was written as a slow country ballad about one-and-a-half minutes long” Bushy told It’s Psychedelic Baby magazine last year. “I came home late one night and Doug [Ingle] had been drinking a whole gallon of Red Mountain wine. I asked him what he had done while he has been playing a slow ballad on his Vox keyboard. It was hard to understand him because he was so drunk … so I wrote it down on a napkin exactly how it sounded phonetically to me: ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.’ It was supposed to be ‘In the Garden of Eden.'”

As the song expanded the group would eventually enter Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead Long Island the following year in 1968 to record the track. “We set up our equipment and [engineer] Don [Caselle] says ‘Guys why don’t you just start playing and let me get some mic levels'” he told Vinyl Writer earlier this year. “We decided let’s do ‘Vida’ … we played the entire song without stopping. To make a long story short when we finished he said ‘Guys come into the control room.’ We listened to it and were blown away.”

Editor’s picks

A drastically edited version of the song became a radio hit helping the album go to Number Four on the Billboard 200 and becoming one of the biggest-selling albums of the year.

Bushy’s primal drumming would go on to influence many of his peers. “Ringo [Starr] and Paul [McCartney] came to see us at Royal Albert Hall” Bushy said last year. “Ringo took me out to dinner and drinks and said to me ‘I hope you don’t mind I stole a part of your drum solo’ in ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’ [for the Abbey Road track “The End.”] I told him not at all. ‘I took it as a compliment coming from you.'”

The oft-covered song — everyone from the Residents to Slayer to the Incredible Bongo Band released versions of it — remains a pop culture staple famously appearing in The Simpsons in 1995 and as sample fodder via the Bongo Band’s version for Nas’s 2004 song “Thief’s Theme” and 2006’s “Hip Hop Is Dead.”

Speaking to Vinyl Writer magazine earlier this year Bushy reveled in his individualistic style. “I am self-taught” he said. “I just play what I feel. I don’t read or write music. I am just me my style.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lc2FiaXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMva3VydC1icmFkbGV5LXdpbmFucy9hcnRpY2xlXzhmZTM5YWIyLTA4NDktMTFlYy1iNDFkLTFiYWZlZTgzMzQwZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kurt Bradley Winans | Obituaries | mesabitribune.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Fort Smith grew from 86209 to 89142 between 2010 and 2020 but lost its place as second-largest to Fayetteville according to decennial census results. Fayetteville's population according to the 2020 count is 93949.

While Fort Smith's growth is modest compared to other cities leaders and developers believe a more prominent sudden population jump is possible due to initiatives such as Arkansas Colleges of Health Education's health and wellness research center and fighter jets set to relocate at Ebbing Air National Guard Base.

The census every 10 years determines how federal money is appropriated to communities throughout the United States. These dollars can go to schools hospitals roads and public works according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

While the Fort Smith grew 3.4% it fell to third behind Fayetteville the southernmost large city in Northwest Arkansas and home to the University of Arkansas. Northwest Arkansas is home to Walmart Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport -- three of the country's largest companies.

Fort Smith's county Sebastian didn't grow as much as other parts of the state either. Sebastian County grew 1.6% while Benton and Washington counties in Northwest Arkansas grew 28.5% and 21.1%. In central Arkansas Saline County grew 15.2% while Craighead County in the northeast part of the state grew 15.3% data shows. Saline County is part of the greater Little Rock area while Craighead County holds Jonesboro home of Arkansas State University.

Mayor George McGill said he puts an asterisk next to the city's 2020 census because of how the social restrictions in place to prevent the spread of covid-19 might have affected the process. He believes Fort Smith's population should be closer to 95000.

""At this point what we're doing is just gather the information and do an honest assessment of what we should do moving forward"" McGill said.

Despite the drop to third some say the city's comparatively modest growth is cause for optimism. State Rep. Justin Boyd R-Fort Smith said the numbers show resilience from the 2012 closing of the city's Whirlpool plant. At its peak in 2005 the appliance plant employed 4500. It eliminated more than 1000 jobs with its closing.

In the past decade the city has added thousands of homes in the Chaffee Crossing area. Engineered material manufacturer Glatfelter opened one of its production plants in that area. And The Unexpected arts festival has helped renew interest in downtown Fort Smith.

""They've arrested their decline which is step one"" said Mervin Jebaraj director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas' Sam M. Walton College of Business.

Rod Coleman chairman of ERC Holdings noted the limited amount of land for development in the city could be partially responsible for the more modest growth. He said housing in Chaffee Crossing the fastest-growing part of town wasn't built until recent years.

Coleman also noted growth in nearby Greenwood just south of Fort Smith. The town grew from 8952 to 9516 in the last decade census data shows. All other towns of more than 1000 people in Sebastian and Crawford counties -- where Fort Smith and Van Buren are -- also gained population according to the census.

But within the city leaders and developers point to Arkansas Colleges of Health Education as a current driving factor for growth and development. The school broke ground in 2015 and now has a college of osteopathic medicine and offers a master's degree in biomedicine and occupational and physical therapy programs. It's set to have a health and wellness research program following a $32.3 million grant.

Leaders also point to the selection of Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Fort Smith as the preferred location for up to 36 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. The initiative is expected to bring more than 800 pilots support workers and dependants to the area according to military estimates.

McGill said ""things are just now starting to fall in place"" in Fort Smith that will drive population upward.

Fighter jets med school and Chaffee Crossing

Parker estimates 3900 rooftops have emerged in Chaffee Crossing since Colleges of Health Education was built. While Parker attributed this growth to his college others say the school isn't the only contributing factor.

Chaffee Crossing is the product of the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority working to develop more than 7000 acres of former Army land into east Fort Smith and Barling. Since 1997 the land has seen more than $2 billion in investments according to Redevelopment Authority Marketing Director Lorie Robertson.

Coleman who for 50 years has worked in housing in Fort Smith said consistently low interest rates on homes have allowed the city to steadily grow over the last decade. He said interest rates are even better after covid-19 due to an excess of cash in the lending market.

Coleman also said Chaffee Crossing ""in the last four or five years"" has afforded housing developers unused land to build homes. He also said people have moved from outside Fort Smith to Chaffee for jobs at ArcBest and Mars Petcare.

""The last year has been great growth"" Coleman said of Chaffee. ""There has not been anybody who hasn't been able to build something and put it on the ground that did not sell immediately almost.""

But Coleman also said the medical college has been a driving factor in the growth. The college in 2021 graduated its first class of 150 doctors Parker said. These numbers don't account for the colleges' other programs that push the total number of students to around 900.

""We intentionally underbuilt our student housing because we wanted the community to benefit from what we're creating"" Parker said.

Most of the students come from the school's ""service area"" of Arkansas Oklahoma western Tennessee southern Missouri and northern Louisiana. About a third are from other places in the United States Parker said.

Of the graduated class of doctors 10 of them are completing their residencies in Fort Smith Parker said. He estimated 83% of doctors stay where they complete their residencies. And each doctor accounts for four additional medical employees he said.

The college also has more than 180 employees. More than 80% of them moved from outside Fort Smith Parker said.

The medical colleges is also going to expand into the old Golden Living center where it will house its Research Institute Health and Wellness Center. The facility will facilitate biomedical research and more educational opportunities for students according to Susan Devero communications director for the colleges.

Once complete the facility will be filled with about 100 employees with Ph.D.s plus additional staff Parker said.

""There's not 100 Ph.D.s available in Fort Smith Arkansas"" Parker said. ""We've got to bring them in from the outside.""

Parker also said the employees themselves -- many of whom make more than $100000 per year -- have an impact on the population because of their expendable income. He said the money spent on activities like dining creates more business thus leading to more jobs in the area.

The selection of Ebbing as the preferred location for Foreign Military Sales and a F-35 training center is also expected to positively impact the area's population and economy. The base will house up to 36 F-16 and F-35 fighter jets for Singapore and Foreign Military Sales participants according to the U.S. Air Force. Foreign Military Sales allows the U.S. to sell defense equipment lend services and hold training exercises to a foreign country when the president determines it will strengthen world peace the Air Force states.

The initiative is estimated to bring 345 U.S. military personnel 180 Singapore military members and 300 dependents to the River Valley according to a Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce news release. Officials expect the initiative to have up to a $1 billion economic impact on the region.

""The next three years is going to be very very successful in the housing business out here just because of what we've heard and know about based on the jobs at the med school based on the Singapore mission"" Coleman said.

McGill who helped convince the Air Force and Singapore delegation to select the city as the location said be believes the people in charge of locating projects such as these trust the region will grow. He said the decisions to locate in Fort Smith is ""simply preparing for that.""

""What we're trying to do is make sure we're providing infrastructure for that kind of growth"" he said.

'Amenities amenities amenities'

While housing and economic wins give McGill hope for the future he said these alone aren't enough to keep growing the city.

McGill said amenities -- things for residents to do outside of work -- are decisive in whether people move to another area or stay where they are. The same is true for businesses that wish to attract and retain qualified employees said Propak CEO Steve Clark.

McGill said amenities in Northwest Arkansas -- just one hour north of Fort Smith -- were a draw for the Air Force and Singapore delegation to move planes to the city. The region touts amenities such as nightlife in Fayetteville Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville and the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers.

""If I'm taking my family to another town whether we have this this and this whether it's a skate park or trail system or whatever it may be it's going to weigh in to those decisions"" Clark said.

Residents and visitors have shown renewed interest in downtown Fort Smith from The Unexpected arts festival which Clark founded. Before covid-19 the festival annually brought a handful of nationally and internationally acclaimed muralists to the city for a week to paint their works on buildings throughout downtown.

In the last five years downtown has had venues including a coffee shop cigar lounge and skate park open to the public. The Bakery District a multipurpose gathering space with a coffee shop bookstore food truck and patio area has also opened. But the area also lost a brewery and music bar during covid-19 and a western wear store in spring 2021.

Clark gave a nod to Peacemaker Music Festival and Steel Horse Rally which combined bring more than 100000 people to the downtown area each year. He also said development on the city's riverfront will contribute to the attractiveness of the city -- the openings of the U.S. Marshals Museum and Community School of the Arts in that area are expected in 2022.

""In the world we live in now it's amenities amenities amenities"" McGill said. ""Quality of life is the attraction.""

While McGill expects people to move to Fort Smith for jobs he also expects the development of the riverfront and downtown will be a draw. He said people who move to Fort Smith for this reason will fill jobs city leaders wish to attract.

But Clark said the city still needs to accelerate its development of amenities. Some are on their way such as the renovation of the park at West End in downtown and of the barracks in Chaffee Crossing.

""There's a lot of other municipalities that are trying to woo the same employers and employees that we currently have and want in our town"" Clark said.

A positive outlook

When asked what he expects Fort Smith's population to do in the next 10 years Parker's answer was simple: ""It's going to do nothing but go up.""

One of the keys to this growth Jebaraj said is consistency in investments and improvements. Clark agrees -- he said the city won't continue to grow if its stakeholders don't continue to invest in good jobs and amenities.

Coleman predicts the city will witness the same growth in the next five years that it saw in the last decade.

Boyd said community leaders will continue to make the city ""the right place for businesses to grow"" and improve life in the city.

""I feel very positive about our community and our ability of people to live in Fort Smith and surrounding communities as well and look forward to seeing what the next decade has in store for our community for Fort Smith for our surrounding communities and the state of Arkansas"" said Boyd.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vaGFycmlzb25kYWlseS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9vbmVhbC1tY2tpbm5leS13ZWRkaW5nLDE1Njg4OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,O’Neal McKinney wedding,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://harrisondaily.com/stories/oneal-mckinney-wedding,156889 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vaGFycmlzb25kYWlseS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9vbmVhbC1tY2tpbm5leS13ZWRkaW5nLDE1Njg4OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2xhdGVzdGhhY2tpbmduZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L21pc2NvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb25zLWluLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1wb3dlci1hcHBzLWxlYWtlZC1taWxsaW9ucy1vZi1yZWNvcmRzLWZyb20tbXVsdGlwbGUtZmlybXMv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vbGF0ZXN0aGFja2luZ25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMjgvbWlzY29uZmlndXJhdGlvbnMtaW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBvd2VyLWFwcHMtbGVha2VkLW1pbGxpb25zLW9mLXJlY29yZHMtZnJvbS1tdWx0aXBsZS1maXJtcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Misconfigurations in Microsoft Power Apps Leaked Millions Of Records From Multiple Firms,"55 SHARES Share Tweet

Due to privacy blunders in Microsoft Power Apps many firms from different sectors leaked data online. These misconfigurations in Microsoft Power Apps allowed public access to millions of records including personal data.

Microsoft Power Apps Misconfigurations Leaked Data

Researchers from UpGuard found multiple data leak instances affecting numerous firms. Specifically they misconfigurations in Microsoft Power Apps that publicly exposed data from different organizations.

Power Apps is a graphical software from Microsoft’s Power Platform suite that helps write low-code custom business apps.

As elaborated in UpGuard’s blog post the cybersecurity issue existed in the OData (Open Data Protocol) API. OData retrieves data from Power Apps “lists” – the configurations fetching data from tables for display on portals. Due to misconfiguration in these APIs OData exposed records for anonymous public access.

Although this isn’t an unknown issue rather a predetermined feature about which Microsoft has already mentioned in its documents.

However it became a problem since enabling the permission required an extra step from the developers when enabling OData feed.

When a developer enables the OData feed on the “OData Feed” list settings tab they must also activate the “Enable Table Permissions” option on the “General” list settings tab unless they wish to make the OData feed public. This is due to all lists having table permissions disabled by default. Table permissions by default will in fact prevent anonymous data access but lists ignore these permissions and any custom table permissions unless the developer activates table permissions for the list.

Eventually this misconfiguration exposed personally identifiable information in 38 million records from 47 entities. Mentioning some of the names of affected firms UpGuard stated

UpGuard notified 47 entities of exposures involving personal information including governmental bodies like Indiana Maryland and New York City and private companies like American Airlines J.B. Hunt and Microsoft for a total of 38 million records across all portals.

Microsoft Addressed The Issue

After discovering the problem UpGuard notified the relevant organizations affected due to this breach. Also they reached out to Microsoft via its MSRC to report the same.

Eventually Microsoft addressed the matter by enabling the table permissions by default. Also they released the “Portal Checker” tool for Power Apps portals. This tool detects lists allowing anonymous access to let the users decide the future permissions. This together with the default permissions enabled would perhaps alleviate the probabilities of such misconfigurations in the future.",,,

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding that there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and that several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and that an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention that those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

When Pritzker dared demand a leadership change the mayor replied that he alone gets to choose the CTA president adding “If people want to be mayor they should run for it.”

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Sign-up bonuses can vary from card to card and some are more generous than others. But all told sign-up bonus credit cards work the same way. If you spend a certain amount of money on your new credit card within a preset time frame you'll get a lump sum of cash back or rewards points in exchange.

For example a given card may come with an offer of $200 cash back for spending $500 within three months of opening your account. Another card might offer $500 cash back for spending $3000 within that same time period.

The great thing about sign-up bonuses is that you might manage to meet your spending threshold easily scoring yourself extra money without breaking a sweat. In other cases you may need to plan and spend strategically to snag a sign-up bonus.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Say you normally spend $700 a month on your credit cards but you're aiming to score a $500 bonus for spending $3000 within three months. That's $900 more than what you'd usually spend. In that case you may want to bundle some upcoming purchases to score that bonus rather than spreading them out. For example buy some of your holiday gifts in advance or purchase a few furniture items at the same time rather than buying one item every few months.

But before you go chasing after that bonus it's important to read any sign-up bonus fine print. The reason? Some transactions don't count toward the spending requirement needed to score the cash back or extra points. The following items generally do not count toward sign-up bonuses.

1. Refunded purchases

If you buy an item using a credit card and return it that purchase won't count toward your spending minimum. Or to put it another way if you're thinking you'll just walk into a retailer rack up a large tab snag your bonus and then return everything after your bonus comes through you'll be out of luck. In fact in that situation your credit card company can take back your sign-up bonus even after it's been issued.

2. Cash advances

Some credit cards give you the option to get a cash advance when you need money. But if you're thinking that's an easy way to snag a sign-up bonus think again. Credit card cash advances aren't considered purchases. As such they don't count toward your spending threshold. They're also a very costly way to borrow because you might pay a higher interest rate on cash advances than you would for other purchases.

3. Balance transfers

Transferring a balance from one credit card to another could save you money if your new card comes with a lower interest rate. But just as cash advances aren't considered purchases the same holds true for balance transfers. So if you're planning to move forward with one you should know that it generally won't count toward your spending requirement.

Don't miss out on that bonus

Sign-up bonuses can put a lot of money in your pocket but it's important to understand the rules involved. Before you apply for any card with the intention of snagging a sign-up bonus find out about the requirements so there are no surprises.

And be careful when chasing sign-up bonuses in general. While they can be very rewarding they can also tempt you to spend money you otherwise wouldn't. And that's a good way to put yourself in a worse financial situation rather than a better one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215L3BvbGljeS9nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWotcC1tb3JnYW4tY2hhc2UtYW1vbmctMTAtbWVyY2hhbnQtYmFua2Vycy10by1tYW5hZ2UtbGljLWlwby9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTczMjU4Ny5jbXPSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZWNvbm9teS9wb2xpY3kvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1qLXAtbW9yZ2FuLWNoYXNlLWFtb25nLTEwLW1lcmNoYW50LWJhbmtlcnMtdG8tbWFuYWdlLWxpYy1pcG8vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NzMyNTg3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs J P Morgan Chase among 10 merchant bankers to manage LIC IPO,"

The government has shortlisted 10 merchant bankers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. J P Morgan Chase & Co and ICICI Securities  to manage the mega initial public offering (IPO) of the country's largest life insurer LIC. As many as 16 domestic and international firms had made presentations before the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) on August 26 to act as book running lead managers (BRLMs) for the IPO -- touted to be the biggest share sale in the country's history.""Goldman Sachs Group Inc JPMorgan Chase & Co ICICI Securities Ltd Kotak Mahindra Capital Co JM Financial Ltd Citigroup Inc and Nomura Holdings Inc are among the 10 BRLMs that have been shortlisted"" an official said.With the merchant bankers in place once the embedded valuation of LIC is arrived at the government will go ahead and file draft IPO papers with market regulator Sebi.Actuarial firm Milliman Advisors LLP India is working out the embedded value of LIC while Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors.The government aims to come out with the IPO and subsequent listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) on the bourses in the January-March quarter of 2022.The government is also mulling allowing foreign investors to pick up stakes in the country's largest insurer LIC. As per Sebi rules foreign portfolio investors (FPI) are permitted to buy shares in a public offer.However since the LIC Act has no provision for foreign investments there is a need to align the proposed LIC IPO with Sebi norms regarding foreign investor participation.The DIPAM on July 15 had invited applications for appointment of up to 10 merchant bankers for LIC IPO. The last date for bidding was August 5.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs last month cleared the initial public offering proposal of Life Insurance Corp of India.The ministerial panel known as the Alternative Mechanism on strategic disinvestment will now decide on the quantum of stake to be divested by the government.""The potential size of the IPO is expected to be far larger than any precedent in Indian markets"" the department had said.The listing of LIC will be crucial for the government in meeting its disinvestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 (April-March).So far this fiscal Rs 8368 crore has been mopped up through minority stake sales in PSU and sale of SUUTI stake in Axis Bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vZW50ZXJwcmlzZS9lbnRlcnByaXNlLXNvZnR3YXJlL25ld3MvZnJlc2h3b3Jrcy1maWxlcy1mb3ItYW4taXBvLWluLXRoZS11cy1sb29rcy10by1yYWlzZS0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NTcwNzkwMC5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmluL2VudGVycHJpc2UvZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1zb2Z0d2FyZS9uZXdzL2ZyZXNod29ya3MtZmlsZXMtZm9yLWFuLWlwby1pbi10aGUtdXMtbG9va3MtdG8tcmFpc2UtMTAwLW1pbGxpb24vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg1NzA3OTAwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freshworks files for an IPO in the US looks to raise $100 million,"Freshworks is seeking to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FRSH.

Chennai and California-based reported a revenue of $169 million in the first half of 2021.

Girish Mathrubootham-led software-as-a-service (SaaS) company Freshworks has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. The company is looking to raise $100 million the company’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission has revealed.The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley JP Morgan Chase & Co and Bank of America. Freshworks is seeking to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FRSH.Founded by Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy as Freshdesk in 2010 the company started its journey as a helpdesk software for customer support. It decided to rebrand itself to Freshworks in June 2017 to incorporate the company’s growing software suite.The company was founded in Chennai but moved to Silicon Valley a couple of years back as most of its customers were present in the US. The company is now based out of San Mateo in California yet it retains a substantial workforce in Tamil Nadu’s Chennai city.Freshworks has over 52500 customers across the globe and it reported a revenue of $169 million in the first half of 2021.

The analyst firm’s inaugural ZTNA New Wave assessed 15 vendors with at least $5 million annual ZTNA revenues and designated the above-mentioned five as “Leaders.” The next group “Strong Performers” includes Citrix Akamai Netskope and Google. And finally Forrester labeled Proofpoint Cisco Cloudflare Wandera Tencent Security and Juniper Networks “Contenders.” Cisco and Proofpoint while ranked didn’t participate.

Unlike its regular Forrester Wave report the New Wave evaluates emerging technologies. The analysts spent two hours with each vendor and ranked them against 10 criteria. They positioned the 15 on the wave chart based on ZTNA product and strategy. Forrester also reviewed the companies’ market presence.

Zscaler ZTNA

Zscaler has the largest ZTNA market presence according to Forrester and it is also the only vendor that doesn’t have any “needs improvement” areas on its scorecard. However it does say Zscaler must add support for server-initiated applications like VoIP.

“Zscaler has the greatest ZTNA mindshare among Forrester clients” the report says. “The vendor is enrolling organizations with tens of thousands and in some cases hundreds of thousands of users.”

ZTNA which reduces organizations’ attack surfaces by setting secure boundaries around applications and workloads became an increasingly attractive alternative to VPNs during the pandemic and resulting remote workforce. And as such it plays a major role in edge-cloud delivered security and networking capabilities or secure access service edge (SASE) — Forrester calls this “zero-trust edge.”

While Forrester’s latest report focuses on ZTNA Zscaler also ranks at the top of SASE leaderboards. The cybersecurity vendor has pulled several recent high-profile SASE and ZTNA partnerships with the likes of IBM and CrowdStrike and Verizon offers a managed SASE service that uses Zscaler’s ZTNA and secure web gateway.

Palo Alto Networks ZTNA

Palo Alto Networks’ ZTNA product Prisma Access received high marks for its strong combination of deployment options IDP integration and non-web apps. It can be self-hosted deployed as software-as-a-service or used in hybrid environments.

“The vendor’s support for authenticating and authorizing third parties is superior to other ZTNA solutions” Forrester wrote.

However Palo Alto Networks needs to improve its endpoint offering the scorecard says. “Customers say the mobile experience Prisma Access still needs improvement and they report some technical challenges with the endpoint software for desktops and laptops.”

In a blog post about the Forrester New Wave Palo Alto Networks SVP and GM Anand Oswal says ZTNA plays a crucial role in its — and any — SASE platform. “ZTNA offers organizations scalable remote access consistent identity-based access control and continuous trust assessment wherever data or users are” he wrote.

And on the vendor’s most recent earnings call earlier this month CEO Nikesh Arora said Palo Alto Networks nearly doubled its SASE customer count during the quarter to roughly 2500. Of those 25% were new customers.

AppGate ZTNA

AppGate a small Scandanavian network security startup is one of the few vendors evaluated in the ZTNA New Wave that doesn’t offer a full SASE stack. Forrester says while it offers “exceptional” integrations with services like IT service management and configuration management database it lags behind its competitors in inline security inspection.

“ZTNA solutions are usually inline in order to provide authentication and contextual authorization” the report says. “AppGate’s inline security inspection could be improved by adding more behavioral analytics and machine learning.”

VMware ZTNA

VMware on the other hand has superior inline security inspection via technologies including watermarking risk scoring and behavioral analytics Forrester says. Its ZTNA which is part of VMware’s larger SASE platform integrates well with its own endpoint and device security products as well as major third-party vendors the report adds.

However VMware needs to improve its legacy application support according to the New Wave. Companies with numerous non-web applications aren’t a good fit for VMware’s ZTNA until it improves its remote desktop capabilities.

Perimeter 81 ZTNA

The final ZTNA “Leader” Perimeter 81 is the youngest of the bunch. The 3-year-old startup which has raised $65 million to date for its ZTNA and SASE software focuses on cloud-delivered and managed SaaS deployments. Forester calls out Perimeter 81’s ability to handle non-web applications like VoIP as its major differentiator but says it still needs to add integration with Microsoft endpoint security and apply more inline security and analytics.

Perimeter 81’s ZTNA is a good fit for smaller enterprises that want to rapidly deploy ZTNA as a service the report says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was 91.

Ted Sarandos co-CEO and chief content officer at Netflix was among those who paid tribute. “He was the single biggest influence on my life and early career” he said. “I was fortunate enough to interview him when I was an aspiring journalist just out of high school. He was brave enough to put his fame and money on the line to speak out against injustice. Lost his sponsors (Kimberly Clark) for speaking out against U.S. military action in El Salvador which led CBS to cancel Lou Grant. He defined the activist celebrity and used his platform even if it came at a personal cost. He introduced me to great people in the years following and gave me sage advice and he was a great actor and champion of actors.”

Actor Josh Gad wrote on Twitter “I am heartbroken to say goodbye to our friend #EdAsner who graced #CentralParkTV as the voice of Bitsy’s brother Ambrose. He was a Legend a beautiful soul and a truly brilliant actor. Love you sir! We will miss down here but smiling that you are have fittingly gone Up.”

Cobra Kai showrunner Josh Heald reflected on having Asner on the series as Johnny Lawrence’s childhood friend Sid. “Getting to work with @TheOnlyEdAsner on @CobraKaiSeries made a surreal experience even deeper. What a sense of humor on that man. He was a Day 1 Cobra Kai for life. We will dearly miss our Sid.”

Maureen McCormic said she was “heartbroken” over the news of Asner’s passing tweeting “Rest In Peace my sweet kind and dear friend Ed. You made and will continue to make this world a better place. I love you and will miss you so very much.”

Yvette Nicole Brown shared a story of Niecy Nash’s about Asner on Twitter. “I will always remember the story ⁦ @NiecyNash told of his kindness to her when she was just starting out & how he then came to her #WalkOfFame Ceremony decades later.”

Katie Couric took to Instagram to pay tribute to Asner writing “RIP Ed Asner forever Lou Grant to me. Thank you for the laughs and for a life of intelligence and integrity.”

Keith Olbermann wrote of Asner on Twitter “We’ve lost one of the great humans. Ed Asner went from the over-the-top comedy of MTM to taking the SAME character and making him the centerpiece of an underrated drama of “Lou Grant.” I met him where else at a charity event. His life was charity.”

Rosanna Arquette paid respects to Asner on Twitter writing “what a truly good and honorable human you were” and thanked him for his service to the Screen Actors Guild. Asner served two terms as president from 1981-85 and sparred often with Charlton Heston a noted conservative who preceded him as head of the guild. He received the SAG Life Achievement Award in 2002.

Said Frances Fisher: “Ed Asner is a legacy SAG president a consummate award-winning actor a close friend and a dedicated unionist until the end who extolled his belief that our SAG-AFTRA Membership First has priority.”

Former M*A*S*H star Loretta Swit starred with Asner in a Roosevelt University (Chicago) production of An Evening With the Roosevelts in 2015. She played Eleanor to his Franklin. She remembered her co-star: “Oh God! He was the best there was. I am devastated. I loved him so much! He was the best of the best. It doesn’t get better than my dear friend. My beloved Franklin Roosevelt. I finite experience sharing a stage with this remarkable man.”

Another former M*A*S*H star Jamie Farr was currently working with Asner in a staged reading of Two Jews Talking that was to take place Sept. 2-4 at Flat Rock Playhouse in North Carolina. “Ed was a wonderful man and I had a long good friendship with him” Farr said. “I was looking forward to doing an upcoming reading with him of Two Jews Talking. We just had rehearsal last Tuesday. We are heartbroken heartsick and devastated by the news and send love to the family.”

Last month Ruta Lee appeared with Asner in a staged reading of Theatre 40’s Another Gin Game in Beverly Hills. “I am devastated by the news of our dear Ed’s passing but so honored that I got to work with him again just recently. He was a real trooper. His wild and wicked sense of humor made life more joyous for everyone who crossed his path.”

“Ed was a good friend” recalled Mike Farrell another former M*A*S*H star. “He was a loud sometimes brash always outspoken courageous champion of justice. A light went out in the universe at his passing. [My wife] Shelley [Fabares] and I will miss him dearly.”

Added Lucie Arnaz: “Ed was what we in the business like to refer to as ‘an actor’s actor.’ Both my husband Larry Luckinbill and I had enormous respect for him and his body of work. He was the real deal.”

Said voice actor Bob Bergen (the voice of Porky Pig): “I had the pleasure of first meeting Mr. Asner in the late ’70s as we were both invited to a mutual friend’s house to break the Yom Kippur fast. I was about 15 or so and we had an amazing conversation on the craft of acting the actor’s commitment and how ‘no’ is the most empowering word in an actor’s vocabulary. I got to work with him a few times on cartoons most memorably on Spider-Man: The Animated Series. Watching Asner play J. Jonah Jameson was a master class in acting. He happened to sound like Lou Grant but Asner brought layer and character that was pure Jameson. Although I got to work on the film Up we never had recording sessions together. But I was later able to get some chat time with him to discuss his charming performance in this film. A great life and career!”

Asner received three of his record seven Emmy Awards (in 1971 ’72 and ’75) for playing the producer of the WJM-TV evening news on CBS’ The Mary Tyler Moore Show then reeled in two more trophies (1978 ’80) after his out-of-work character was hired as city editor of the Los Angeles Tribune newspaper on CBS’ Lou Grant. Asner also received Emmys for his performances on two renowned ABC miniseries: 1976’s Rich Man Poor Man in which he played an embittered German immigrant and 1977’s Roots as the sea captain who brought Kunta Kinte to America.

He then attracted a new generation of fans when he voiced Carl Fredricksen a 78-year-old widower who ties thousands of balloons to his house to fulfill a dream of seeing South America in the Oscar best picture nominee Up (2009).

Only one responded: Ed Asner. “I don’t know you kid but here’s 500 bucks” said the note attached to the check. “Sounds like it’ll be a great film. I was an autoworker once.” R.I.P.

Wingstop is shaking up its C-suite promoting Michael Skipworth formerly CFO to president and chief operating officer. The fast-casual wing chain also elevated Alex Kaleida to the top finance post.

Skipworth who has been with the Dallas-based chain since December 2014 succeeds Mahesh Sadarangani as COO after he resigned to take a CEO position.

Kaleida who has had leadership roles at Wendy’s and Kraft Heinz Company joined Wingstop in 2019 as vice president of financial planning and analysis.

“I’m thrilled to provide amazing growth opportunities within our organization for both Michael and Alex Wingstop CEO Charlie Morrison said in a statement. “This enables us to promote from within which equates to amazing opportunities and continued growth for our Wingstop team members.”

Skipworth worked with Morrison in 2015 to take Wingstop public. And Kaleida has worked closely with Skipworth particularly in his most recent role as head of investor relations.

Wingstop which has 1415 U.S. restaurants has been a pandemic success story with same-store sales topping 30% during the height of the crisis. The chain has surpassed those strong sales during the first half of 2021.

Earlier this month Wingstop announced the restructuring of its technology leadership structure to include both digital and marketing functions. The new structure is designed to support one-to-one marketing to grow the chain’s digital business with the long-stated goal of digitizing 100% of its transactions.

The children 11-year-old Chris Kilburg-Leis and 12-year-old Dennis Hougas both of Allen Park found themselves in a quandary on a recent trip to pick up supplies for their lemonade stand.

They had the lemonade mix the cups and a pitcher.

The only thing missing was enough money to pay for it all.

Chris thought he was prepared after all he had his mother’s Kroger Shopper’s Card to take care of the bill.

That’s not actually how the Kroger card works but Chris didn’t know that — yet.

His mother Michelle Kilburg got quite the surprise when he called her from the checkout line asking for her Kroger card number so he could pay for his bill.

Kilburg said her son told her not to worry that he would pay her back the money — but that’s not why she was worried.

“When they left the house they were just going bike riding” his mother said. “I didn’t know they had that panned or I would have made sure they had enough money.”

She said she also would have taken the boys to Kroger herself but this was something they decided to do on their own.

While she was on the phone with Chris they were disconnected.

She said she just figured the boys would return home empty handed.

That didn’t quite happen.

Between the two of them the kids had about $10.

“We got all the stuff we needed and we were about $4 short” Chris said. “The man behind us asked the lady at the register how much we needed and she said $4. Then he said ‘I got you guys.’ We needed it.”

Dennis said they panicked a little when they realized they couldn’t use the Kroger card for payment and said had the man not come to their rescue they probably would have started putting things back.

“This really nice guy gave the cashier $20” Dennis said. “We really didn’t need that much. We gave him his change and thanked him.”

The boys were able to keep all of their shopping items and Dennis said they told him where the lemonade stand was going to be set up.

“He didn’t tell us his name or nothing” Dennis said. “I told him we would be allowed to give him a cup of free lemonade.”

Also earning a free cup of lemonade that day was the Kroger security guard who agreed to watch the kids’ bikes while they shopped.

The man who contributed to the supplies told the boys he would try to stop by the lemonade stand but they said he didn’t make it.

The stand was set up on Allen Road near Regina right near Chris’ house.

This actually was the third lemonade stand coordinated by the boys.

The first one was quite productive bringing in $120.

“I couldn’t believe they made that much” Kilburg said. “They felt like they were rich.”

It rained on their second outing but that didn’t discourage them. They still made $20 in about an hour.

Thanks to the random act of kindness shown to the boys at Kroger they were able to make $40.

Chris explained that he was saving money to contribute to a new BMX bike and Dennis was eyeing two new tires and new handlebar grips for his bike.

Both have been able to purchase the things they were working to save money toward and Kilburg said she is proud of their efforts.

Both boys recognized the generosity of the man and wished they could have had an opportunity to serve him a cup of their popular lemonade — on the house.

Chris just wanted another chance to express his gratitude and Dennis said he wanted to give the man a big hug.

Not only have the two friends become better business partners working out a plan to get the things that they wanted but they are now better shoppers as well.

They both now know flashing a Kroger card is not the same as presenting a debit or credit card.

Dennis was all giggles at the thought of what they did noting they won’t make that mistake again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtZ3JvY2VyeS1jaGFpbnMtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktcm90aXNzZXJpZS1jaGlja2VuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 4 Major Grocery Chains Are Facing Pressure Over Their Rotisserie Chickens,"The rotisserie chicken is a meal that makes dinner (and lunch) easier for tons of households. If yours is one of them one advocacy group wants you to know about four supermarket chains that are reportedly selling broiler chickens that aren't raised in the most favorable conditions—along with five others that have just made a crucial commitment to the raising of healthier chickens.

We all want to feed our families quality food. Ideally you'd probably like to achieve that while feeling confident that the product you're serving was raised in a way that's healthy and humane. This week the Humane League reached out to Eat This Not That! to share that on Monday Sprouts Farmers Market publicly adopted the Better Chicken Commitment to improve the treatment of chickens raised for meat in its supply chain after a reported two years of engagement with The Humane League and other organizations.

Sprouts joins four other major grocery chains that are ""making impressive progress on animal welfare"" the Humane League told Eat This Not That! in an email.

A representative for the organization also shared that four other well-known grocery chains haven't made that same commitment to chicken welfare as swiftly as some animal advocates would like. Keep reading to see which grocery chains are have successfully updated their better-chicken policies—and which are still said to be lagging—along with which of your favorite chicken products this affects.

5 Grocery Chains That Recently Made the Better Chicken Commitment

Sprouts Farmers Market

A rapidly growing supermarket chain Sprouts' Better Chicken Commitment announcement makes them a leader on animal welfare in the retail industry the Humane League said and ""will dramatically improve the lives of millions of chickens."" Sprouts' commitment provides that chickens they sell will be raised in surroundings similar to a natural environment won't be overly stocked (and therefore raised in tight physical conditions) and will be slaughtered according to humane industry standards.

In a press release the Humane League also listed the products at Sprouts that this will apply to: Sprouts-brand fresh chicken one-pan meals its full-service case and roasted deli chickens.

Sprouts Farmers Market was also recently ranked among the 10 best supermarkets in America.

Giant Eagle

Giant Eagle also recently made the Better Chicken Commitment to sell humanely raised chickens at its stores in Pennsylvania Ohio West Virginia Indiana and Maryland.

Giant Eagle has been taking other progressive steps for its customers according to Grocery Dive. Earlier this month they announced they'd become the first grocery chain to make in-store payment possible via PayPal and Venmo at their 474 Giant Eagle supermarkets and GetGo convenience stores.

Kroger

This month Kroger announced their adoption of an animal welfare position that includes freedom from hunger and thirst freedom from discomfort pain injury and disease freedom to express normal behavior in natural conditions and freedom from fear and distress.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Kroger's position as the largest grocery chain in America (by revenue) could make it a meaningful influencer in the shift toward healthier grocery store chickens.

Natural Grocers

Natural Grocers has a reported 150 stores in the majority of the U.S. Mountain States and the South. The chain recently stated that 90% of the chicken products they sell have already been raised according to Better Chicken Commitment standards and they're working with the remainder of their suppliers to ensure all standards are met by 2026.

Wegman's

The Humane League shares that they're waiting for this chain with over 100 stories in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S. to commit to meaningful changes in their supply chain.

Trader Joe's

Although Trader Joe's doesn't sell rotisserie chickens per se many TJ devotees love its ""spatchcock chicken"" for roasting at home.

However for this chain's cult following it may be disappointing to hear that Trader Joe's is among the grocery chains that reportedly has not declared a formal commitment to chicken welfare practices.

Albertsons

Now that Kroger has made the Better Chicken Commitment the Humane League says they're looking for Albertsons the second-biggest supermarket chain in the country with nearly 2300 stores to make the same pledge.

Gate-all-around or GAA transistors are a modified transistor structure where the gate contacts the channel from all sides and enables continued scaling. Such transistors are referred to as gate-all-around or GAA transistors and different variants have been proposed. — Lam Research Blog

Samsung Electronics' 3nm GAA process is considered ""less competitive"" to TSMC's 3nm FinFET technology when it comes to discussing costs and performance.

[FinFET is a] fin field-effect transistor is a multigate device a MOSFET built on a substrate where the gate is placed on two three or four sides of the channel or wrapped around the channel forming a double or even multi gate structure. — Wikipedia

Samsung was scheduled to start production by 2022 but might face additional delays if this report is accurate. TSMC is on schedule to start mass production of 3nm FinFET process technology as soon as the third quarter of 2022.

""N3 will be another performance and cost for our customers."" — CC Wei TSMC CEO during the company's recent quarterly earnings call

Intel and Apple have already started creating orders with TSMC for their 3nm FinFET technology while Samsung Electronics revealed the $205.5 billion capital expenditure program that will be in effect for the next three years. Samsung is planning to use those funds on chip technologies.

Samsung will rollout their first-gen 3nm GAA Early and second-gen 32 GAA Plus (GAE and GAP respectively) but their GAE production will not be able to start until as soon as 2023 because of the various problems they have experienced during development.

Samsung Electronics has mentioned prior to this new information that their 3nm GAE process will enter what they are calling ""risk production stage"" during the end of 2020 with mass production this year. Unfortunately the company is trailing behind TSMC developing advances in the chip technology when they lost contracts from Apple for their iPhone processors. TSMC is in a key position to being the first to release the 3nm process technology reports various market observers.

The institution’s medical school is set to grow partly in response to greater demand for young doctors and nurses in the city.

However a proposal to build more medical laboratories has come under scrutiny from a local elected official who has highlighted potential environmental and health concerns.

Paul Zimmerman a district councillor in Pok Fu Lam the neighbourhood where HKU is located told Times Higher Education that “generally we have a good working relationship with HKU Estates Office and [with them] adjusting their plans to community input. This project is an outlier.” About 800 residents have signed a petition urging the university to consider alternative sites.

Mr Zimmerman an environmentalist and head of an urban planning NGO sent an appeal to the Hong Kong Town Planning Board this month about what he described as “a laboratory complex on giant legs floating on a green belt site near Queen Mary” which is HKU’s main teaching hospital.

“Residents are deeply concerned over biosafety hazards” he says in his submission which requests “an assessment of the risks of leakage via aerosols drainage sewerage transport and people movement into the environment; and the risks of exposure for staff students patients commuters and local residents”.

“While proud of HKU’s contribution to the fights against SARS and Covid a rethink of the location is required” he said.

Ying-Shing Chan associate dean (development and infrastructure) at HKU’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine told THE that the site had been chosen “after due consideration taking a balance between meeting the needs for additional teaching and research facilities and minimising impacts to the environment”.

“HKU Med takes laboratory and biosafety as its first and foremost priority” Professor Chan said. “We maintain the highest international standards of safety and environmental protection with an established track record of successfully operating high-level microbiological containment laboratories without significant incident since the time of SARS-1 (2003).

“HKU Med will continue to adopt the most stringent measures to ensure the safety of our staff students and neighbours” he said adding that the institution’s facilities were internationally accredited and audited by overseas authorities.

The city’s two medical schools have been instrumental in the fight against Covid including in running vaccination clinics and in public outreach. HKU Med was one of the first to hold a press conference warning of the novel coronavirus in January 2020.

The effort has kept Hong Kong at nearly “zero Covid” with just over 200 related deaths.

Professor Chan said expanded facilities were needed if Hong Kong was to continue its good track record.

“Without such state-of-the-art research facilities Hong Kong could not have dealt with SARS avian flu and swine flu successfully in the past two decades” he said. “Expanding and upgrading our facilities will not only provide sturdy support to our ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic but also enable us to be better prepared for any public health crisis in the future.”

HKU is the only major university located on Hong Kong Island the urban centre of one of the world’s most densely populated cities. The other Hong Kong institutions with significant laboratory needs are in the relatively less crowded New Territories.

Mr Zimmerman’s submission suggests building the laboratories in the Lok Ma Chau Loop an area near mainland China and part of the government’s Greater Bay Area plan for a cross-border higher education and research hub.

Both the Oklahoma City Philharmonic and OKC Broadway — the local presenter of nationally touring Broadway shows — announced Friday that all ticketholders must show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to attend their performances.

The arts organizations join venues like Oklahoma City's Tower Theatre and Ponyboy and Tulsa's Mercury Lounge The Whittier Bar and Barkingham Palace which recently announced vaccine requirements.

Industry grappling with Delta variant

Still reeling from the coronavirus shutdowns of 2020 the live entertainment industry now is grappling with the highly contagious Delta variant which has sent the numbers of COVID infections hospitalizations and deaths soaring in recent weeks.

The New Orleans Jazz Fest canceled its 2021 edition and touring musicians like Oklahoma superstar Garth Brooks Stevie Nicks and Limp Bizkit have scrapped shows including the latter's planned Labor Day weekend performance at Rocklahoma.

With COVID cases primarily rising among the unvaccinated concert promotion giants Live Nation and AEG major festivals like Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza and a growing roster of music stars have announced plans to require proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to attend their events.

Jason Isbell played Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom shortly after instituting his vaccination requirement in early August. The Grammy Award winner has an Oklahoma City show coming up Oct. 10 at The Criterion.

After canceling some dates Michael Buble who has a long-delayed OKC concert slated for Sept. 19 at the Paycom Center (formerly Chesapeake Energy Arena) announced a vaccination rule for his upcoming events Aug. 26. And Dave Matthews Band booked to perform Oct. 15-16 at Choctaw Casino & Resort in Durant declared on Aug. 12 that ticketholders for all announced dates must provide proof of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours prior to entry.

Tyler said a growing number of acts are instituting the requirements at their performances.

""Considering the vast majority of everybody was going towards this model we just thought it would be easier … to get this out there get it in front of and message it (to patrons) answer the questions and move forward with a consistent structure"" Tyler said.

OKC Philharmonic taking measures

Civic Center Foundation Executive Director Elizabeth Gray said masks continue to be required at all times inside the Civic Center Music Hall regardless of a person's vaccination status.

But COVID-19 vaccination and testing policies differ by presenter she said. The Civic Center is keeping a running list of requirements for upcoming shows at www.okcciviccenter.com/health.

Leaders of some OKC arts organizations told The Oklahoman they are still developing COVID policies for their upcoming Civic Center seasons.

The Oklahoma City Philharmonic is launching the local 2021-22 performing arts season in the Civic Center Sept. 11 with the opening concert of its Classics series.

Beginning Sept. 11 and until further notice the OKC Philharmonic will require patrons to provide proof of full vaccination with either a physical vaccination card a picture of a vaccination card or a digital vaccination record along with photo ID.

For unvaccinated people ages 6 and older or those who prefer not to share their vaccination status patrons can instead provide proof of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of entering the venue.

OKC Philharmonic season subscribers with a vaccination card will be required to show it at the first concert in their series and will be issued a pass that will allow them to enter the venue for the orchestra's events without the need to show their card each time.

Subscribers also may submit a copy of their vaccination card and photo ID (with date of birth covered) ahead of time to the box office via email or U.S. Mail prior to the first concert and a verification card will be mailed to them before the first concert.

Echoing the Civic Center policy the philharmonic also will keep requiring masks.

OKC following Broadway's lead

In July New York's Broadway theaters announced that they would require vaccinations for their audience members and OKC Broadway is following their lead in bringing touring musicals to the Civic Center.

Along with requiring masks OKC Broadway — a partnership of the Civic Center Foundation and New York City-based Nederlander Organization — will require all patrons to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

""Fully vaccinated"" means the performance must be at least 14 days after a ticketholder's final vaccine dose. To enter the theater they must bring a photo ID and proof of vaccination in the form of a physical vaccination card or a picture of their card.

Guests who are younger than 12 or need accommodations for medical reasons or for religious beliefs must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to entering the venue.

""We must do this to ensure the continued existence of top-tier live entertainment for years to come"" said Gray who is also OKC Broadway's general manager in a letter to subscribers announcing the new rules.

Preserving capacity is key

Although cutting crowd capacity to allow for social distancing was an acceptable short-term measure prior to the vaccine rollout Tyler said live entertainment venues tours and presenters must be able to be operate at full capacity to stay in business.

On Aug. 19 Tower Theatre and Ponyboy management announced that all guests would be required to provide proof of vaccination — a physical card or photo of a vaccination card along with photo ID — or proof of negative COVID test results from within 72 hours of an event to enter the venues.

Plus all children younger than 12 — who are not yet approved for the COVID vaccine — will be required to wear a mask at all times. The rules go into effect Sept. 8.

Since the pandemic has become so politicized Tyler said venue staffers braced themselves for a barrage of negative reactions when revealing the new rules.

""Not surprising we got a bunch of comments. … But generally speaking we felt especially early on the response was overwhelmingly positive — or that the positive voices in the response were willing to come and fight the negativity for us"" he said.

Most Recent Employer and Job Title: C3 Presents (subsidiary of Live Nation) Business Development and Project Manager

What makes Austin such a great place to earn an MBA? I moved to Austin in 2018 when I landed a role with C3 Presents where I led strategic growth and new projects across the company’s festival division. I can confidently say that Austin lives up to its motto of ‘Live Music Capital of the World’. With nightly concerts SXSW and my C3 team’s homegrown ACL Festival there’s truly never a dull moment. But Austin’s thriving music scene isn’t the only thing I’ve come to love about this city. Austin offers a unique mix of southern hospitality progressive ideology and its own dash of “weird”. The tacos and hill country hangs can’t be beat. As home to some of the top companies in the nation and a thriving tech hub Austin is a verified petri dish for MBA students seeking both experiential development and post-MBA work placements.

Aside from your classmates and location what was the key part of Texas McCombs’ MBA programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? Outside of the unmatched Austin location and down-to-earth student body what attracted me to the Texas McCombs MBA program was its incredible reputation as a bastion of support and innovation within the community. McCombs’ “Human Centered Future Focused” mission is far more than a platitude it is a reality that I experienced first-hand as I got to know the program. As I was deciding to apply I spoke with dozens of students who were not only willing but eager to give me advice and encouragement on the process. It was clear that this support would extend lifelong with McCombs’ vast and proud alumni network. On top of its people-first culture I also witnessed McCombs’ enterprising spirit. As an intimate program situated in one of the largest research universities of the world McCombs is an incubator of talent and new ideas. Just look to the numbers — McCombs boasts 6000 venture-backed founders with over $5.8 billion raised and 4600 alumni in venture capital or private equity.

What course club or activity excites you the most at Texas McCombs? Entrepreneurship is deeply ingrained at McCombs and it’s one of the aspects of the program that most attracted me. I’m especially looking forward to participating in the Texas Venture Labs (TVL) Practicum an experience that pairs students from across UT’s various Master’s and Ph.D. programs with local Austin startups for a semester-long hands-on consulting project. It’s a rare opportunity to work alongside other entrepreneurial students in law engineering and natural sciences programs while also being side-by-side with company founders to solve a meaningful problem.

The Austin startup ecosystem is on fire fueled by what seems to be a weekly influx of new founders and established VCs flowing into the city. TVL offers a unique peek into this world with the ability to network receive funding guidance and apply MBA coursework — market validation competitive analysis price modeling and more — in a real-world setting.

I was very lucky to work for TVL’s Executive Director Mellie Price in my pre-MBA internship (albeit on another project) and was so inspired by her commitment to Austin’s forward-thinking founders. I hope to match her energy and dedication in my contribution to the TVL Practicum!

Describe your biggest accomplishment in your career so far: My proudest professional moment occurred when our once three-person startup was acquired by the world’s second largest live entertainment company AEG Presents. While attending undergrad at Tulane in New Orleans I helped found a concert festival and event production startup. We dove headfirst into a trial by fire in the zany world of concert promotion and taught ourselves the business. We built up to promoting and producing 150+ events per year ranging up to 40K attendance as well as ownership of a large-scale festival and venue supporting hundreds of staff and vendors. After six years we were acquired by AEG Presents and became the company’s 16th regional office. It was rewarding to see our hard work pay off — and to finally have access to the financial and resource support we needed to continue growing our dreams and supporting our people.

How did COVID-19 change your perspective on your career and your life in general? I’ve been fortunate to have not had a close friend or family member suffer from COVID-19 and I’m very thankful for that. At the same time the pandemic has had a substantial and altering impact on my life since March of 2020. My industry shut down completely — revenues for my company (Live Nation) were down over 95% and the live entertainment industry at large experienced a crisis of shuttered venues and mass layoffs. Being out of work and with our lifeblood (music) depleted my entire support group was in emotional disarray. I had built up a large share of my “sense of self” through my career and dedication to live music so the shutdown sparked an acute feeling of identity loss and sadness over my lack of agency to turn things around.

Despite these struggles I made an active choice to look for the silver lining and trust in the marvel of human adaptability. I decided to detour from a successful career in a niche industry in order to better my skill set and gain new experiences with the hopes of making even greater impacts in my future. I committed to pursuing higher education through an MBA. I dedicated my time to consult for a non-profit supporting local musicians. I reignited my passion for entrepreneurialism by helping to launch an early-stage impact investment firm. In many ways the pandemic both drained and invigorated me. I will always look back at COVID-19 as a transformative moment in my life and I’ll be proud of myself for the way that I adapted and persisted with optimism despite my circumstances.

What led you to pursue an MBA at this point and what do you hope to do after graduation? I charted my early career around my passions for music but what I discovered through the process was an equally matched passion for business and for launching and growing new ideas. I thrive when I’m working across diverse functions and teams to pilot complex ventures — people don’t often recognize the nuanced and high-stakes nature of large festivals! But my experience was industry limited. This is what led me to pursue an MBA. I want to extend my passions beyond the event experience and make an impact on a larger scale.

What other MBA programs did you apply to? Only McCombs!

What advice would you give to help potential applicants gain admission into Texas McCombs’ MBA program? My top piece of advice is to be genuine. Take the time to reflect on your unique experience and how it has shaped your strengths goals and values. Truly understand why McCombs is the right place for you by doing your research and talking to students and alumni. Be your authentic self own your story and show your enthusiasm. Hook ‘em!

This weekend marks the special day in August 1991 when a courageous Freddie gave his boyfriend an unexpectedly delightful surprise. The star's health had worsened through the year and he rarely left his bed but he made a special effort one sunny summery afternoon at his beloved home One Garden Lodge West Kensington. Despite his increasing frailty he even took the trouble to style his hair and select a lovely outfit. It is a fitting way to remember a star who was so full of life right until the very end.

Freddie always said he didn't care how people remembered him: ""It's up to them. When I'm dead who cares? I don't."" But he would not have wanted to be remembered diminished pale and frail as he appeared at the 1990 BRITS. Of course his legend and legacy have lived in as one of the most dynamic colourful and talented stars of all time and his indomitable spirit shines through in these final pictures on him smiling in the sunshine. It seems perfect that he also has one of his beloved and faithful feline companions standing at his side. Freddie's end was unbearably tragic but he was surrounded by love at all times.

The pictures are also an echo of one of the earliest pictures of Freddie at home in his much more modest Holland Park garden in 1975. In his memoirs Hutton describes the moment: ""That summer Freddie posed for a camera for the very last time - mine. ""It happened like this. I was out in the garden photographing some of the flowers in full bloom and Freddie walked towards me. I trained the lens on - he wanted to move back a bit so it wasn't a close-up. Then he posed while I took four pictures and he managed a smile for each."" DON'T MISS

For Paul it was when he listened to Aaron ‘T-Bone’ Walker

At 18 Paul Pond had his future all mapped out. The former chorister from a respectable middle-class family was at Jesuit College studying English and aspiring to become a poet – until the fateful day he heard the record that changed his life.

“I’d done one term at Oxford and came home to Plymouth – my father was in the navy and was stationed there” Paul 79 tells me. “I discovered a shop called Pete Russell’s Hot Record Store and I’d go in and listen to music for hours at a time. One Saturday Pete said ‘You like the blues what do you think of this?’…” It was T-Bone Blues by Aaron ‘T-Bone’ Walker the brilliant black American guitarist credited with inventing electric blues. “It was wonderful” recalls Paul misty-eyed with nostalgia. “Blues with an electric guitar and socking great hefty backbeats and trumpets and saxophones doing stabs… it was so powerful. It was the opposite of the music I heard at home. My parents liked classics and light classics and Ivor Novello.

The face of a poet turned musician

“This was very direct and openly emotional – just what you want as a teenager. That was the day I decided what I’d do for the rest of my life.” The world lost a poet and gained Paul Jones.

Blues wasn’t the first music to turn Portsmouth-born Paul’s head. “My mother played the piano very well and my father played the violin but the first music that gave me goose-bumps was jazz” he recalls. “I was 14 and listening to King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band playing songs like Mabel’s Dream. It was stunning. I can still hum it and if I do I get goose-bumps even now.” 19-year-old Paul began hitchhiking to The Ealing Jazz Club in West London — the birthplace of the British blues scene — after his guitarist chum Brian Jones told him about Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated who played every Saturday. “It was small yet kind of cavernous with a lot of small spaces inside” he says. “I remember the condensation from sweat and breath. It wasn’t ventilated at all. It caused problems for drummers because the drum heads would sag. “Brian lived in Cheltenham and I was back in Oxford working as a travelling salesman. He’d stay at my flat some weekends and we’d find a party to gate-crash or a gig.”

Paul formed a band called Thunder Odin’s Big Secret – “the name inspired by Texan guitarist Lightning Hopkins who recorded with a drummer called Thunder. Thunder and lightning gave us Odin.” (Thor surely?) Paul’s gifted guitarist was getting married and his beloved ordered him to stop gigging so Paul asked Brian to join. “He said ‘I don’t want to be in a band unless I’m the leader…’. Shortly after in March 1962 Brian called me and said ‘I’m starting a band and taking it seriously; I’m going to get very rich and very famous – do you want to be my singer?’. “I said no because I had a job I’d auditioned to be in the Adelphi dance band which was full of jazz musicians who couldn’t make a living playing jazz.

If he had only listened to his friend... Brian Jones already as a Rolling Stone

“I didn’t think Brian’s band would make money. I thought it was a pipe-dream.” A smart call. Who knows what became of the obscure combo Brian formed with some no-marks called Jagger Richards Wyman and Watts (R.I.P)?

Paul made an impact in Ealing though. “I’d always be near the front looking expectantly at the bandleader who’d call me or Mick Jagger up to sing…” South African keyboardist Manfred Mann was putting a band together and Paul got a call saying ""We need a shouter”... Manfred Mann & The Manfreds formed in 1962 becoming simply Manfred Mann soon after. They had their first hit in ’64 with their third single 5-4-3-2-1 – written as the theme tune for ITV’s Ready Steady Go. “We were overnight successes with years of experience.” Do Wah Diddy topped the charts here and in the USA but American success eluded them. “We toured in early 1965 but didn’t set the world alight. I don’t think we were with the right impresario. But at least I made friends with {pop duo} Peter & Gordon.”

The band performing on Ready Steady Go!

Touring with Manfred Mann wasn’t exactly Rock’n’roll Babylon. “It wasn’t a crazy group. Even our humour consisted of in-joke catchphrases. “The wildest it got was when we toured Australia in 1965. We got there to find Roy Orbison and the Rolling Stones already on tour. The fans screamed – that was the thing – and threw toys on stage. We encouraged the girls to go barmy. The security got more and more cross. Eventually they switched the power off. We thought great we can go and see the Stones…”

I didn’t think Brian’s band would make money. I thought it was a pipe-dream Paul Jones

Another Australian tour with The Who and the Small Faces was too much for Paul. “It was really crazy. I thought there’s got to be something more sensible a grown man could do for a living.” Jones quit in 1965 but had to stay on for nine months. “They wouldn’t let me go! Lawsuits were mentioned but when they calmed down they asked me to stay until they found a replacement” – who was Mike d’Abo. He never said goodbye to Mann. Instead for a laugh the band convinced him their driver was drunk. “The last I saw of Manfred was him running behind the van shouting ‘You’ll all be killed!’.” It took years for fans to stop calling the singer Manfred…

Paul who had secretly married novelist Sheila MacLeod in 1963 had a couple of solo hits but found a second successful career as a stage and screen actor – appearing in The Sweeney and Space: 1999 and opposite Jean Shrimpton in 1967 cult film Privilege.

Trending

A theatre director had asked him to do two one-act plays and he got the bug. Conduct Unbecoming ran for a year here and then in New York where he relocated before starring in jazz opera Escalator Over The Hill with Jack Bruce and Linda Ronstadt. “I enjoyed acting but I started to miss live music. Back home as soon as the curtain came down I’d find a pub where there was a band playing. I was desperately missing the blues.” In 1979 he formed the Blues Band and later joined the Manfreds (minus the Mann himself who’d formed Earth Band).

A lot has changed since Paul's Manfred Mann days – but gigs are still his thing

Paul has two grown-up sons from his first marriage and is married to actress Fiona Hendley-Jones.

In view of the growing belligerence by China that has been conducting invasion drills every now and then Taiwan is planning to buy additional US-made F-16 fighter jets and has earmarked $1.44B for this acquisition.

In addition to this the US recently exhibited its prized possession the F-22 Raptor at the Singapore Airshow although the stealth fighter jet is not for sale. All this indicates Washington’s bid to showcase its fighter jets equipped with advanced technology in the Asian market and send a clear message to China.

It’s not just Taiwan major Asian powers such as Japan and India are also acquiring American military aircraft in big numbers to counter an expansionist China.

Taiwan – Biggest Fleet Of F-16 Jets In Asia

Taiwan’s never-ending confrontation with China has increased the demand for American weapons including fighter jets in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has thrown its support behind the self-governing island which China claims as its territory.

Washington which does not officially recognize the island’s sovereignty has been strongly opposing the alleged Chinese military aggression in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea on the pretext of promoting freedom of navigation.

Under provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act the US is required to provide weapons of a defensive nature to Taiwan. Since 2010 Washington has announced more than $23 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including the most advanced F-16s.

The US had in 2019 approved the sale of 66 Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 70 fighter jets to Taipei for an estimated $8 billion. With this the number of Taiwan’s ‘Fighting Flacons’ will increase to 200 the largest fleet o F-16 fighter jets in Asia.

Developed by American aerospace giants General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin the fast and agile fourth-generation F-16 combat-proven multi-role fighter jets are considered the most successful cost-effective fighters in the world. There are approximately 3000 such fighters operational in around 25 countries according to an earlier report by The EurAsian Times.

The Biden administration also approved a potential $750 million deal earlier this month which includes the sale of 40 new M109 self-propelled howitzers and almost 1700 kits to convert projectiles into more precise GPS-guided munitions according to Bloomberg.

Japan – Biggest Fleet Of F-35s

Lockheed secured a mega-deal to sell its most advanced F-35 stealth jets to Japan. Last year the United States approved a planned purchase of 105 F-35 joint strike fighters drawing Japan one step closer to be the biggest foreign customer of the fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

The approved package includes 63 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing aircraft and 42 F-35 short takeoff and landing variants.

Japan will be the second-largest operator of the joint strike fighter after the United States and just ahead of the UK. Soon Japan will become the fourth largest user of the F-35B variant capable of short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). The US Marine Corps the UK Royal Air Force and the Italian Navy currently use the F-35B.

Japan and China have contested claims over a group of uninhabited Senkaku (Diaoyu in Chinese) islands that fall in the East China Sea. Tokyo has also indicated its military support for Taiwan in the event of a full-scale conflict with China.

Nitin J Ticku a strategic analyst and a senior journalist with the EurAsian Times states that the biggest fleet of F-16 and F-35 stealth jets outside the US would be based in Asia. The US’ most advanced F-22 Raptors have also been deployed in Asia at the US military base in Guam.

This clearly indicates that after the Middle East and Afghanistan the Indo-Pacific region could be the hub of next global confrontation.

India’s P-8I Aircraft – Biggest Fleet After The US

India another major power in Asia is also on a weapons-buying spree in view of a protracted border conflict with China.

New Delhi has signed several defense deals with Washington in the past few years including an agreement for 22 AH-64E Apache helicopters and 17 CH-47F(I) Chinook heavy-lift helicopters — both manufactured by the defense and aerospace giant Boeing.

India is also increasing its fleet of Boeing P-8I Neptune maritime multi-mission aircraft (MMA). The P-8I is the Indian-specific variant of the P-8A Poseidon flown by the US Navy and international customers.

The P-8I differs slightly from the P-8A in that it is equipped with an aft-facing radar (that operates independently of the forward-facing Raytheon AN/APY-10 surface search sensor) providing full-hemisphere coverage and an aerial target-tracking capability.

The Indian Navy currently has 10 P-8I spy planes including the two that were delivered last year as part of its additional order for four aircraft which it had placed in 2016.

The Indian Navy-operated aircraft was also deployed in Ladakh as a surveillance platform during border tensions with China. The move was intended at building synergy between the three services of Indian armed forces while keeping a hawk-eye on China.

“This proposed sale of an additional six P-8I aircraft will allow the Indian Navy to expand its maritime surveillance aircraft capability for the next 30 years” the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said at the time of the approval in April.

The Indian Navy is expected to operate the biggest fleet of submarine-hunting P-8 aircraft outside the United States.

Recently the Indian Navy received two of the 24 MH-60 Romeo anti-submarine helicopters it ordered. The first batch is expected to land in the country next year. In 2018 the Navy got approval to pursue the acquisition of 24 Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters. The contract was finally sealed in February 2020 during President Trump’s visit to India.

The $2.6 billion deal includes helicopters communication systems weapons systems eight anti-surface Hellfire missiles which can be used to hit ships MK 54 lightweight torpedoes 50 cannons and precision rocket systems.

Ticku says – the US defense industry has got a massive boost due to the perceived threat of China. Earlier it was the USSR later it was the threat of terrorists in the Middle East and elsewhere then for Saudi’s UAE and Israel it was the Iranian threat and now the China threat factor is driving the arms sales in Asia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwgFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvYXVndXN0LzEwNjI0LXNlYS10cmlhbHMtd2l0aC1taXNzaWxlLWZpcmluZy1mb3ItZnJhbmstZS1wZXRlcnNlbi1qci1kZGctMTIxLWFybGVpZ2gtYnVya2UtY2xhc3MtZmxpZ2h0LWlpYS1kZXN0cm95ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sea trials with missile firing for Frank E.

The USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG-121) is an Arleigh Burke-class Flight IIA guided missile destroyer built for the United States Navy. The contract for the construction of the ship was first announced in a press release from Huntington Ingalls Industries on March 30 2016. The keel of the ship was laid on 21 February 2017. She was launched on July 13 2018. and was christened on October 6 2018.



The Arleigh Burke is a class of guided missile destroyers (DDG) in service with the United States Navy built around the Aegis Combat System an American integrated naval weapons system developed by the Missile and Surface Radar Division of RCA and now produced by Lockheed Martin. The Flight IIA Arleigh Burke ship has several new features including two hangars for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopters and a new longer 5-inch/62-caliber (127 mm) Mark 45 Mod 4 naval gun.



Huntington Ingalls has delivered 32 destroyers to the Navy and currently has four more under construction including Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123) Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125) Ted Stevens (DDG 128) and Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129).

Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are highly capable multi-mission ships and can conduct a variety of operations from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection — all in support of the United States military strategy. The guided missile destroyers are capable of simultaneously fighting air surface and subsurface battles. The ship contains a myriad of offensive and defensive weapons designed to support maritime defense well into the 21st century.



The USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. is powered by four General Electric LM2500 gas turbines developing 100000 shp. She can reach a top speed of 31 knots (57 km/h). The ship is armed with one 5 inches (127 mm)/54 caliber Mk 45 naval gun 25 mm Mk 38 automatic cannons four .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapon System) two Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes for Mk 46 torpedo 96-cell Mk 41 VLS (Vertical Launching System) able to launch RIM-66M medium-range surface-to-air missiles BGM-109 Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC anti-submarine missiles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZmVkZXJhbC1jb250cmFjdG9ycy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFlcm9zcGFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Federal Contractors | Technology,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/federal-contractors-technology-aerospace/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZmVkZXJhbC1jb250cmFjdG9ycy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFlcm9zcGFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3MvdXNhZi1zLWNvbWJhdC10YWxvbi1paS1yZWNlaXZlZC1sYXN0LXBkbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USAF's Combat Talon II received last PDM,"USAF's Combat Talon II received last PDM

As Combat Talon IIs are currently being phased out and start gradually arriving at the Arizona Boneyard the last Lockheed MC-130H received Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex at Robins AFB (GA).

On 20 August 2021 MC-130H 87-0023 (construction number 382-5091) departed Robins to its home station at Hurlburt Field (FL) to fly its last term with the 15th Special Operations Squadron/1st Special Operations Wing.

Going back in time the Combat Talon II had a bad start. Initially the programme started in the early 1980s. Having survived many political and technical issues eventually the first fully operational MC-130H (87-0024) was received by the 8th SOS on 29 June 1991.

In October 1991 almost thirty years ago the official acceptance ceremony for the Talon II was held at Hurlburt. Over the years 26 MC-130Hs were used by the USAF and Lockheed (this includes two YMC-130H prototypes).

At this moment the MC-130J Commando II model is taking over the MC-130H mission. It is expected that the MC-130J PDM process will start in fiscal year 2023.

In the video the police officer—whose badge is illegible due to his distance from the camera—insists to the teen’s father that the home improvement store has issued a trespass warning against him and he therefore can no longer enter the store. The video was filmed by the boy’s mother @mrsweirdomckinney.

She wrote that her son had been riding his bike in the area with some friends and that they had come into the store to purchase a beverage. It’s not clear when she and his father came to the store to figure out what was happening. In a follow-up video she asks someone who she claims is a manager if there were any issues with her son at the store to which the manager replies “no.”

The video is captioned “I guess it’s against the law for teen black kids to [come] to Lowe’s according to this cop. he constantly harasses my 14 yr old for nothing but I tell my son to never argue with adults call your parents and that’s what he did. I should not fear my sons life every time he leaves home but I do.”

Some commenters expressed frustration with the situation saying that people browsing in a store is nothing new and taking issue with the way the police officer in the video phrased his objection to the poster’s son being in the store saying that teens shouldn’t be in a store because they “won’t buy anything.”

One commenter wrote that they send their son out to the store without a parent for multiple reasons.

“I’ve sent my son to several stores without me due to multiple reasons.” they wrote. “Let this happen to my son please.”

Others shared the view that the boy had been rightfully issued a trespass warning siding with the police officer.

“If they have been previously warned not to be on the premises they can be arrested for Criminal Trespass” one commenter wrote. “Officer was 100 correct.”

The Daily Dot has reached out to both Lowe’s and @mrsweirdomckinney about the videos.

It’s one that organizers of the project would like people to step right up and experience.

That new feature is an analemnatic sundial or a vertical human sundial. An individual can stand on the month of the year which is laid out on marked concrete pad and then if the sun is out their shadow then tells them the time.

“We call it ‘The Beginning of Time’ and we have a visual that explains the history of sundials and how to use this particular one” said Suanne Huffman who serves as the secretary for Friends of Marion Parks and helped move the project forward. The project started about four years ago.

If you go What: Lowe Park Kress Family Memorial Sundial Dedication When: 3:30 p.m. Wednesday Sept. 1 Where: Lowe Park Trail 4500 10th St. Marion

Friends of Marion Parks has partnered with Marion Parks and Recreation Department to complete the project. They believe it may be a one-of-a-kind feature in Eastern Iowa if not the whole state and are excited about the ways that families might interact and learn from it.

“Kids can learn about Roman numerals time and history” said Huffman noting that they created several informational panels that were installed near the sundial so those who are interested can learn more.

The Marion Parks Department is excited to have yet another unique amenity in the park for residents and visitors alike to enjoy.

“Together we are providing something that is not typical for many parks. It’s appealing and really interactive and we like how much it ties in with our art trail and inclusive playground” said Seth Staashelm director of Parks & Recreation for the City of Marion. “We want people to come out and bring their family and go around the trail to see all that is new to interact with.”

He added “We are grateful to the Friends of the Park group because they are such a strong group and they have done so much in our parks. And we’re looking at other things in the future as they are an ambitious group.”

The sundial has been created in memory of Charlie and Pat Kress residents of Marion and longtime community volunteers. Huffman said the project started as a memorial for Charlie when he died and his wife Pat was still on the board. Friends of Marion Parks along with the family wanted a way to honor all the ways Charlie and Pat Kress gave back to the larger Marion community and the “time” they dedicated over the years.

“They were two really great people who gave a lot to this community and this is a lovely way to remember them” said Huffman.

A dedication ceremony set for Wednesday will bring their sons back to the area to celebrate the Kress Family Memorial Sundial. Current Mayor Nick AbouAssaly and former Mayor Vic Klopfenstein among others are both slated to speak. The public is welcome to attend.

James Lowe is one of the newest ambassador Tackle your Feelings campaign an initiative set up by Rugby Players Ireland Zurich and the Z Zurich Foundation to invite Post primary schools to take part in the 2021/2022 Tackle Your Feelings Schools mental wellbeing programme as part of the #ImTakingControl campaign.

The programme is designed to instil a positive proactive approach to mental health and wellbeing among young people reducing stigma and encouraging the development of positive wellbeing habits which they can bring throughout their school career and into adulthood.

The Tackle Your Feelings Schools Programme is a classroom based teacher led life skills development programme which enables students to build healthy habits and personal coping strategies as well as kindness and understanding when it comes to mental health and wellbeing.

In a press release announcing the campaigns newest ambassadors Lowe revealed his own personal reasons for getting behind the programme.

“I’m delighted to support this year’s Tackle Your Feelings Schools programme. As Someone who had to sometimes miss school during my teenage years due to being diagnosed with a rare form of Arthritis I found myself feeling low for long periods of time as I was missing my friends and sport. Having something like the Tackle Your Feelings Schools Programme would have really helped me to cope so I believe it will be extremely useful in supporting students across Ireland as they return to school this year.”

The 2021/22 programme includes an 8-lesson schedule covering awareness emotions wellbeing characteristics and self-care. Recent research commissioned by Zurich & Rugby Players Ireland and conducted by iReach with 1000 parents across the island of Ireland in August 2021. Among many shocking figures it revealed:

42% of parents in Munster agree their children’s interpersonal skills have suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

39% of parents in Munster think that their children would be more open to discussing mental health with their friends if they have downloaded the Tackle Your Feelings App and completed the TYF School programme.

58% of parents in Munster agree that seeing role models like rugby players take control of their mental health inspires their children to do the same.

Also named as an ambassador to the programme is Ireland Women’s Captain and Munster Rugby Player Ciara Griffin. As a teacher herself Griffin outlined the importance of a programme like TYF. Griffin explode that a programme such as this will equip students with the tools to demonstrate the importance in maintaining their mental health as well as help them develop positive techniques to handle any challenges they face and to build effective habits as they grow into adults.

Since the campaigns launch in 2016 Tackle Your Feelings has impacted the lives of people from all over the world with campaign content being viewed well over 23 million times. TYF has undoubtedly motivated people to be more proactive when it comes to looking after their mental wellbeing and has raised significant awareness around the importance of looking after of your mental health.

TYF has also reached international audiences and has inspired similar campaigns across the globe including; The English Rugby Players’ Association (RPA) ‘Lift the Weight’ campaign New Zealand Rugby’s ‘HeadFirst’ campaign and Tackle Your Feelings Australia a collaboration between Zurich Australia the AFLPA and AFLCA.

As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL9IBkAFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS91cy1uZXdzL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLWJ1bGx5LWthdGhlcmluZS1hc3BsdW5kaHMtbmV3LWluLWxhd3MtaGF2ZS05NW0taGlzdG9yeS1vZi1leHBsb2l0aW5nLXVuZG9jdW1lbnRlZC13b3JrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire bully Katherine Asplundh's new in-laws have $95M history of exploiting undocumented workers: ruling,"Pennsylvania’s billionaire Asplundh family were dragged into a bullying scandal after their son’s new wife tried to force another woman to give up her Instagram handle — and now it has emerged they were once fined $95 million for hiring undocumented workers.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh politely refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

The Blueprint board made up of all 12 city and county commissioners approved $10 million for major renovations to FAMU's football stadium in 2020. At the time the stadium was in such disrepair it was unclear whether home games would be played there in the 2021 season.

Last year FAMU asked Blueprint for $15 million more for Bragg improvements. The board in February denied the university's request for immediate funding but voted to explore the use of economic development funds rather than infrastructure dollars for the project.

Robinson in a Monday letter to Leon County Commissioner Carolyn Cummings who chairs the Blueprint board thanked the agency for the $10 million and consideration of the additional $15 million.

""However at this time we are withdrawing our request for additional assistance from the Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency for Bragg Memorial Stadium"" Robinson wrote in the letter obtained by the Democrat. ""We look forward to continuing to work with you the Blueprint Board of Directors and Blueprint staff in other ways going forward.""

The letter was dated two days after FAMU's spring graduation ceremony and surprise announcement of the purported nine-figure stock contribution from Gregory Gerami CEO of Batterson Farms Corp a little-known hemp company based in Austin Texas. The gift would have been the biggest ever for FAMU or any historically Black college or university.

But on Thursday FAMU put Gerami's donation on hold amid mounting questions about it. Gerami has a history of philanthropic overtures to other universities including Coastal Carolina University and the University of Texas at Austin that never materialized according to reporting by the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

It's unclear whether FAMU's decision to backtrack on its most recent Blueprint request was directly related to Gerami's would-be donation. The gift agreement between Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust stipulated that at least $100 million would go toward FAMU athletics.

A FAMU spokesperson was not available for comment on late Thursday on whether the now-paused donation would prompt the university to reconsider its abandoned request for $15 million in Blueprint funds.

THE PROBLEM OF human trafficking in hotels has been ongoing for years but the nature of the crime and how it is perpetrated has changed. To keep up industry associations and companies must change their approach to the problem.

AAHOA recently updated its Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking (BEST) Inhospitable to Human Trafficking training program to better prepare its members. In July Marriott International announced similar updates to its training program with the goal of training all of its on-property employees to recognize and respond to potential indicators of human trafficking at hotels by 2025.

Originally launched with the Washington Hospitality Association in 2012 AAHOA’s BEST program in its current online version was launched in 2016 to provide insight on unconscious bias and behavior-based indicators of trafficking for hotel employees to recognize and prevent incidents in their hotels. Upgrades to the program take into account changes in the way hotels do business because of the COVID-19 pandemic such as the reduced direct contact with guests. It also includes more visual representation of boys and men throughout the course videos because they can also be victims of trafficking.

“Since its launch the BEST Inhospitable to Human Trafficking Training Sponsored by AAHOA has provided vital awareness consultation and training to AAHOA members and their staffs” said Vinay Patel AAHOA’s chairman. “Because the environment around human trafficking is always changing and evolving especially in light of the pandemic it’s important that hoteliers stay up to date on how best to spot the signs and prevent human trafficking.”

Feedback from members and partners in the program went into the changes that have been made said Dr. Mar Brettmann BEST CEO and executive director.

“The new content highlights diverse narratives and real-life scenarios to help lodging employees learn how to identify potential trafficking cases” he said. “We are excited for AAHOA Members to take what they learn from the updated course back to their establishments and help end human trafficking.”

A printable toolkit also is now available to supplement the online training course which includes indicator lists by lodging function and resource cards for potential trafficking victims. Hotel managers can post the resource cards or have them available in areas that staff frequent such as a break room.

“The effort to prevent and end human trafficking remains a huge initiative for AAHOA and this latest program update goes a long way to ensure that the training is effective and up to date and reflects the current landscape of human trafficking prevention in hospitality” said Ken Greene AAHOA Interim president and CEO. “We’ve done a great job being leaders in the industry with lawmakers with other stakeholders and with our members and owners to make sure we’re doing our part to end human trafficking in the most effective and best way possible.”

Marriott’s upgrades to its training program also compensates for the surge in contactless check-in technology and other pandemic related changes. It includes scenario-based modules a mobile-friendly design and increased guidance on how to respond to potential situations of human trafficking with input from survivors of human trafficking.

“As an industry that cares deeply about human rights and the horrible crime of human trafficking we have a real responsibility to address this issue in a meaningful way” said Anthony Capuano Marriott’s CEO. “The updated training empowers a global workforce that stands ready to recognize and respond to human trafficking and allows our company to live up to our core values.”

The company partnered with human trafficking prevention organizations ECPAT-USA and the Polaris Project on the program as well as the American Hotel and Lodging Association Foundation to make it widely available in early 2022.

“Half a million hotel associates [from other companies] have already completed the existing e-learning program since we made it available in 2020 and the new information and innovative features of this updated training will facilitate an even greater impact” said Lori Cohen CEO of ECPAT-USA. “Awareness of and training on these issues are essential for members of the hotel and hospitality industry and we are so grateful to leaders in the private sector like Marriott for their long-term collaboration on this issue.”

“We have already been able to train half a million hotel workers since the original training was launched for free in 2020 and these new trainings will continue to help us get closer to our goal of training every hotel employee” said Chip Rogers AHLA’s president & CEO.

For its updated training Marriott included storyboards and scenarios drawn from calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the U.S. operated by Polaris.

“This training goes beyond general awareness of signs to equip hotel workers with the tools to respond to trafficking situations in ways that are appropriate nuanced helpful and most importantly survivor-centered. By designing interactive scenario-based exercises and updating guidance for managerial staff around how to interact with potential victims and survivors of human trafficking our hope is that this training enables hotel workers to become a valuable resource for trafficking victims around the world” said Catherine Chen CEO of Polaris.

Human trafficking also was a subject of conversation at the 2021 AAHOA Convention & Trade Show.

“One of the overlooked tragedies of this pandemic is the uptick in incidences of human trafficking” said Biran Patel now past chairman during a general session. “I’m proud that AAHOA continues to step up to end the scourge on communities and save lives. Many of you completed the free training online through our website.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcHJvcGVydGllcy9tYXJyaW90dC1zd2luZ3Mtb3Blbi1kb29ycy1vZi1sYXRlc3QtbGlmZXN0eWxlLWhvdGVsLWluLWl6bWlyLXR1cmtledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott swings open doors of latest lifestyle hotel in Izmir Turkey,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/properties/marriott-swings-open-doors-of-latest-lifestyle-hotel-in-izmir-turkey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcHJvcGVydGllcy9tYXJyaW90dC1zd2luZ3Mtb3Blbi1kb29ycy1vZi1sYXRlc3QtbGlmZXN0eWxlLWhvdGVsLWluLWl6bWlyLXR1cmtledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFtc2V5cXViZWluLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvNjAtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9wZW5pbmdzLWFyb3VuZC10aGUtZ2xvYmUtZm9yLWZhbGwtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,60 New Hotel Openings Around The World For Fall 2021,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2021/08/29/60-new-hotel-openings-around-the-globe-for-fall-2021/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmFtc2V5cXViZWluLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvNjAtbmV3LWhvdGVsLW9wZW5pbmdzLWFyb3VuZC10aGUtZ2xvYmUtZm9yLWZhbGwtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3dlc3Rpbi1jb3N0YS1uYXZhcmluby1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luxury in Greece's next coastal hot spot: The Westin Resort Costa Navarino,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

♪ Mamma Mia here we go again ... ♪

As a kid I listened to all 18 songs from the ""Mamma Mia"" soundtrack on repeat in the back of my aunt's Toyota Sienna on every road trip. I would stare out the window wistfully dreaming about visiting Greece one day.

You can only imagine my exhilaration when ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" came out 10 years later during my junior year of college — a feel-good reunion featuring returning cast members and the joy of new stars tied together with stunning cinematography.

This summer I finally booked a flight to Greece and lived out my Mamma Mia dreams. For a part of my vacation I booked two nights at The Westin Resort in Costa Navarino a gorgeous property located in the Peloponnese region of mainland Greece.

Booking

Costa Navarino is home to not one but two five-star resorts that are both a part of Marriott Bonvoy's portfolio. Sitting on 321 acres of land you have The Romanos a Luxury Collection Resort dominating the right side while The Westin sits on the left. Although I don't play golf there's also an impressive golf course that attracts professional and casual players from all over the world.

The Westin Costa Navarino is a Category 6 property. If you're interested in booking on points you can expect the following rates thanks to Marriott's award chart: 40000 points for off-peak 50000 points for standard and 60000 points for peak dates.

Since I booked last minute I couldn't find award availability and had to book with cash. My two-night stay ran me a total of 809 euros — roughly $904. This property isn't cheap but as a five-star resort these rates were to be expected.

However if you're able to book your stay with an off-peak points redemption or with an up to 85000-point Marriott free night certificate at hotels participating in the Marriott Bonvoy program (certain hotels have resort fees)(offered each year after your card renewal month of the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card) this could be a compelling way to save a significant amount of cash.

Location

When you think of Greece you may think of the touristy islands of Mykonos and Santorini. While visiting some Greek islands should still be on your hit list Costa Navarino is arguably just as beautiful. Plus it feels less commercialized than some of those more popular spots.

Located on the mainland of Greece the resort is about a three-hour drive from Athens International Airport (ATH).

Alternatively you can fly into Kalamata International Airport (KLX) which services just a few flights per day. If you choose to fly into KLX — as I did — you're only a 50-minute drive from the resort.

The week of my reservation the concierge at The Westin reached out and provided a list of rates for chauffeur service from the airport. It was quite pricey starting at 135 euros from KLX and 460 euros from ATH. Thankfully we had a car and didn't need airport transfers.

Costa Navarino is in a secluded area in Southern Greece with not much else around it. The resort property is sprawling and heavily secured with multiple guards as you reach the check-in area who confirm your reservation on the list numerous times.

Check-in

After you pass the security checkpoints you'll finally approach the roundabout that leads to the entrance.

The Westin is one of Marriott's premium hotel brands with a focus on innovation wellness and revitalizing amenities that ""ensure you leave feeling better than when you arrived.""

And that's the immediate vibe I got as I entered the hotel lobby. It felt open airy and luxurious. There were only a couple of other guests around during our afternoon check-in time at 3 p.m.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy) 0 1

COVID-19 protocols were strictly followed — check-in desks have plexiglass dividers and all employees were masked up. However for fully vaccinated individuals mask-wearing is optional in the lobby area (though the resort requires you to wear them indoors throughout most of the property).

While I have no elite status with Marriott (I'm usually a Hyatt girl) the receptionist still thanked me for being part of the Bonvoy program.

She also encouraged me to download the free Costa Navarino app — telling of just how large the property is. You'll find a resort map on the app and the ability to make reservations at the restaurants on site (which is highly encouraged). Unfortunately the app was glitchy and would make me log in every time I opened it but I still appreciated this extra amenity. It definitely helped me navigate my way around the resort which felt like the size of a small college campus.

Overall check-in was quick and easy; she went over my reservation details (two nights in a deluxe guest room with a king bed and a balcony with a garden view) and helped put my credit card on file so that any dining or activities could easily be charged to my room so I wouldn't have to carry my card around.

Room

The resort property felt overwhelmingly large when I first arrived and I admit that I spent a good 10 minutes searching for my room. There were seating areas and restaurants all around but I couldn't find where the rooms were.

I eventually found the outdoor hallways that led to all the rooms — mine was room 4509.

The room was a bit warm when I walked in but the resort does have air conditioning. It didn't take long for the room to cool down significantly.

It was quite spacious — with a king bed seating area and desk. It matched the rest of the resort's aesthetic: neutral tones with wood and stone fixtures.

A couple of waters were on the bedside table and housekeeping was excellent about restocking them every day.

There's a flatscreen television and a Nespresso machine (with plenty of Nespresso pods) sitting squarely in front of the bed.

You'll find the minifridge is underneath the TV cabinets.

The bathroom had a double vanity sink an alcove bathtub and a sliding glass door for the toilet and shower. You can find mini shampoo conditioner and body wash on the sink and in the shower. There were plenty of fresh towels under the sink and two bathrobes — one hanging in the bathroom and the other hanging in the hallway closet.

From the bathtub there's a sliding wood panel that offers a view into the room and the balcony.

I absolutely adored the balcony and was impressed that all rooms — from standard guest rooms to the exquisite suites — come with balcony access.

My ""garden view"" room overlooked dozens of olive trees and the main pool. There's a mosquito net that drops down if you choose to leave your doors open at night to let fresh air in to keep out any pesky creatures.

On the balcony you'll find a small table with seating for two and a small layout couch. Wood barriers give you privacy from your next-door neighbors without making the space feel closed in or cramped.

As a whole I loved the room. Each room incorporates outdoor space (you can even book a room with your own private infinity pool). Everything was spic and span and extra kudos to housekeeping for being on top of it.

Food and beverage

It's hard to capture just how large the resort is but there are more than 10 restaurants on the resort property. There are all types of cuisines to choose from. You have Souvlakerie a traditional Greek spot (where I got these divine gyros pictured below) but also plenty of upscale restaurants to choose from with dishes from all over the world.

After scarfing down those gyros I visited the beach. There's a beachside restaurant and bar but you can order drinks from your beach chair. You can check out my terrific piña colada topped with shaved coconut and a slice of pineapple below which set me back 20 euros ($23.50)

For dinner I visited Da Luigi an Italian restaurant that offered a fixed-price menu of 35 euros per person ($41). You get a choice of an appetizer pizza entree and dessert. I found this to be a great deal — most of the à la carte entrees were well over 25 euros ($29) alone.

Everything was delicious from the burrata salad with fresh cherry tomatoes to the margarita pizza. I was a huge fan.

Breakfast is included in the room rate open from 7 to 11 a.m. every morning. I stopped by right at the tail end of breakfast.

This isn't your average hotel breakfast buffet. It's more like a dining hall with fresh upscale selections. Masks were required in the breakfast area (regardless of vaccination status) and it felt safe despite the crowd.

You can choose from a wide variety of hot bar foods fruits pastries and yogurt as well as plenty of made-to-order breakfast items if you're looking for an omelet or fried egg to start your day.

After my late breakfast I was stuffed until it was time for dinner. I ate at Nargile an upscale Lebanese restaurant. The hummus pita and chicken skewers were exactly what I was craving that evening.

If you're looking for more traditional Greek food there are also a few Greek restaurants at the resort. While I'm sure it was delicious the food seemed pretty pricey and I found the Greek food options off-property delicious at only a fraction of the cost.

Overall the food and drink were delicious but expensive for Greece. On top of the room rates know that you'll drop a pretty penny for food and drinks at the resort. However the all-around-the-world eateries felt well worth it.

Amenities

Although I was only at The Westin for a couple of days I met some other guests who make it a tradition to stay there for weeks on end every year. I can't blame them — there was truly so much to do and enjoy.

I first checked out the hotel gym. The equipment was all physically distanced and the employees allowed no more than six guests at a time to use the indoor gym. Outdoors you'll find a few stationary bikes a squat rack bench press and more.

If you like tennis there are a whopping 16 tennis courts on the resort property. There was a place where you could rent out equipment for free.

There are also four giant pools at the resort. The main pool is an infinity pool with a swim-up bar.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy) 0 1

There's even a kid-friendly pool with a great water slide. I wanted to try the water slide (I was a huge fan of waterparks growing up) but sadly there was an age limit of 12 years old.

The most beautiful pool on the resort property was actually on The Romanos side which you can still access as a guest at The Westin. It wraps around a restaurant and I enjoyed coming here at night to soak my feet and stargaze.

Truthfully I didn't have much time to enjoy the hotel pools during the day. Why spend your time at the pool when you have a gorgeous Greek beach waiting for you at the bottom of the resort? Even the walk down is stunning.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Stella Shon/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

If there's one word to describe the beach it's peaceful. You can see the mountains in the distance and it's hard to beat the clear Mediterranean water. There were plenty of beach chairs to get in some much-needed R&R.

After getting plenty of time in the sun during the day there are tons of resort activities that continue into the evening.

On the Costa Navarino app you can see a daily itinerary of the activities hosted by the resort. Some are free (like the magic show morning yoga or pilates classes) and some require advance reservations and come with high price tags. For example I was interested in the olive oil tasting but it cost a whopping 200 euros ($236) and was already sold out by the time I arrived.

If you want a massage or facial you can also make a reservation at the Anazoe spa.

The resort also offers an assortment of water activities you can book if that's more your style. There are plenty of kayaks to rent or you could even arrange a sunset yacht. With the short amount of time I had I chose to enjoy the sunset from the hotel restaurant with a glass of assyrtiko — a fruity white wine.

Overall impression

The Westin Costa Navarino is a lovely resort that's fit for all ages. Families have plenty of activities available for children but solo adults will still find plenty of space for peaceful relaxation. I was perfectly content sitting in a beach chair for most of my stay.

If you're looking for a luxury Greek vacation The Westin delivers. I definitely recommend booking (at least) a few nights here. And those who are looking for an even higher level of opulence should check out the resort that shares the property The Romanos.

Just don't forget to venture off the property to appreciate all of Greece's natural beauty too."

Gift cards provide convenience and are considered more thoughtful than cash but many of us are leaving that free money unspent.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- When we get money as a gift we put it in our wallet or bank account. But get the same amount of money via a gift card and there's a good chance it is thrown in a drawer and forgotten. And even if the cards are remembered they may still not be used.

Melissa Gialdini showed 7 On Your Side her unused gift cards -- there were a lot of therm.

""I have 50 gift cards that just hang out"" she said. ""I have a special pouch that they even go in that stays in my glove box because that way I always have it and I still never get it out or use the gift cards.""

RELATED: Mastercard is getting rid of its credit cards' magnetic stripes

Gialdini is not alone. A new study shows just how many of us get gift cards but don't use them.

Senior industry analyst for Bankrate.com Ted Rossman says ""We found in our survey that 51% of US adults have at least one unused gift card or store credit or voucher and the average amount is $116 a person so this is real money.""

Rossman says it is in part a perception problem: ""If we find 20 bucks in an old jacket pocket we're excited about it and we put it to good use I don't think we always have the same feeling about gift cards and we probably should.""

Gift Card Girlfriend Shelley Hunter of GiftCards.com says the problem sometimes starts with the gift card giver. ""A gift card should be a gift not a coupon. So if I am giving you a gift card to a really nice restaurant then I need to make sure there's enough money on that gift card for you to spend it at the restaurant"" she advises.

Gialdini's mom gave her a lot of those cards. She makes sure they feel and even look like a gift. So 7 On Your Side's Michael Finney asked her ""Perhaps in the future you should buy her physical gifts?""

""I thought this would be a better idea but I'm thinking it's not. I mean I even put the gift cards in a box I wrapped them"" Pattie Bowling says. ""I mean I go to a lot of trouble to putting gifts under the tree to make the gift cards feel like they're bigger. Yes I'm thinking -- yeah no not anymore.""

One final thought. The stores get more money if you use the cards. Bankrate.com's Rossman says complex accounting rules often don't let retailers put the money on the books until the card is used. And if it is not used the government often takes a cut.

Hunter and Rossman both say keep the cards where they are handy next to your computer or in your wallet next to your credit cards but perhaps in the glovebox is not a good choice.

The capital was raised over two rounds this year led by media-focused venture firm North Base Media.

Other investors included Go-Ventures Gojek’s corporate venture arm; East Ventures; Summit Media; Genesia Ventures; Hustle Fund; and Z Venture Capital the corporate venture arm of Z Holdings which is owned by SoftBank Group and Naver Corporation.

Vietcetera was founded in 2016 by Hao Tran and Guy Truong and now claims an audience of 20 million users per month.

The company said it would no longer allow “explicit sexual content” in the future before reversing the policy unexpectedly the next week.

Sex workers had built OnlyFans into a multibillion-dollar subscription platform and after the news many have explained why the proposed change was such a betrayal. They helped make the company valuable and in return it nearly kicked them out.

Less immediately clear however was OnlyFans’ rationale. Early reports speculated that a new set of Mastercard rules were responsible for the change. A later Financial Times interview placed the blame on banks. While we might never know exactly what happened at OnlyFans its decision — and reversal — shines a light on the complicated and fraught world of paying for porn online.

WHAT IS ONLYFANS?

OnlyFans is a UK-based online subscription platform that was founded in 2016. Users can “follow” creators and get access to exclusive content paying with a monthly fee or one-time tip while OnlyFans takes a 20 percent cut of the funds. While the app is general-purpose OnlyFans has proven particularly useful for sex workers who want to sell pictures and videos or hold personal chats with clients. It’s exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic currently reporting 1.5 million content creators 150 million registered users and $5 billion paid annually to creators.

WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING WITH ONLYFANS AND SEXUAL CONTENT?

Late last week OnlyFans announced that it would ban content that posted advertised or referred to “sexually explicit content.” It would allow nudity but not real or simulated sexual activity or a variety of other conduct. The change was set to take place on October 1st leaving many OnlyFans sex workers scrambling for alternatives.

Then OnlyFans reversed course. On Wednesday it declared that it had “secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community.” It suspended its plans for the new policy and as of this writing there’s no indication it will reimplement the ban.

WHY DID ONLYFANS PLAN TO BAN PORN?

The short answer according to OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely was “banks” — which Stokely said wouldn’t work with OnlyFans because of its reputation as a porn platform. But that answer followed a heated discussion about the complicated world of paying for sex work online.

Payment processing can be opaque and costly for all kinds of web platforms but adult sites particularly struggle at nearly every step of the financial chain. That’s on top of problems that individual sex workers face with banks and payment processors which might ban them with little recourse even for non-sex-related transactions.

Mike Stabile director of public affairs at the adult industry group Free Speech Coalition explains that launching a platform requires establishing a direct relationship with a bank or using a payment processor that accepts adult industry clients. In turn banks and processing gateways need to comply with rules set by Mastercard and Visa. (American Express doesn’t support digital adult content at all.) “At every point there’s a potential where someone is not going to want to work with you because you’re adult content” says Stabile.

Beyond the policies of any one specific institution these issues all contribute to an environment where losing support from any partner can be risky for a company like OnlyFans.

WHY DON’T FINANCIAL COMPANIES WANT TO WORK WITH ADULT SITES?

Part of the problem is an unusually high risk of disputed charges — from customers who make a purchase but deny it out of embarrassment for instance and try to get their money back. Stabile says there’s also a ripple effect where financial companies worry about violating Visa and Mastercard’s adult content rules and may act even more conservatively overshooting the mark of the actual policies.

These issues are nearly as old as online porn payments but they’ve been exacerbated by a recent effort to cut off revenue to adult services. As longtime sex work reporter Melissa Gira Grant has documented religious organizations like Exodus Cry and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (formerly Morality in Media) have pushed regulators and companies to crack down on major adult platforms. While they’ve framed this fight as an anti-trafficking movement and pointed out real instances of abuse they target sexual content as a whole even that made voluntarily by independent sex workers.

Anti-porn activists scored a major victory when Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to Pornhub — the video site run by adult services juggernaut MindGeek — following a New York Times report pointing to nonconsensual pornography and videos of children on the site. In April Mastercard introduced new rules for all adult services requiring them to verify performers’ ages and their consent to have content posted. The rules are set to take effect in October.

The OnlyFans and Pornhub conflicts take place against a long-running online legal crackdown on sex work. OnlyFans became popular in the wake of FOSTA-SESTA the law that removed substantial legal protections for sex workers and the platforms that host them. After it announced its ban writer and porn performer Stoya detailed years of political decisions and social factors that helped set the stage as well as sex workers’ ongoing efforts to organize against them.

IS ONLYFANS IN THE SAME POSITION AS PORNHUB?

OnlyFans and Pornhub share one big similarity: they’re major adult content providers that are receiving a lot of outside scrutiny. Around OnlyFans’ announcement the BBC published a report that OnlyFans was giving popular accounts extra leeway when they posted illegal content. And in March Forensic News published a report alleging that OnlyFans’ majority owner Leonid Radvinsky could be linked with money laundering operations directly highlighting banks that had flagged suspicious activity around Radvinsky.

Stokely suggested that banks had been spooked by negative reporting on OnlyFans. “Banks read the same media as everyone else” he said.

But the two services otherwise work very differently. Pornhub is a huge streaming portal full of content that’s historically gotten limited vetting along the lines of YouTube. (It introduced new verification rules after the Visa and Mastercard ban.) OnlyFans is more like Patreon: a monetization platform connecting users with specific creators.

In some ways OnlyFans’ subscription system is part of a direct backlash against Pornhub’s free distribution model which has drawn harsh criticism from sex workers for hosting pirated and nonconsensually posted content. Like many creator platforms OnlyFans has huge disparities in income — but some users can earn big payouts by cultivating a direct feedback loop between OnlyFans and social media.

WHAT DO MASTERCARD’S RULES MEAN FOR ONLYFANS-STYLE SUBSCRIPTION SITES?

The new rules place more responsibility on platforms to check creators’ identities and documentation. “It’s something that we can do but it’s also time-consuming and expensive” says Kat Revenga vice president of subscription service FanCentro. Revenga says the new rules require maintaining extra records and as FanCentro has tested age verification tools like facial age estimation it’s had to balance them with privacy concerns.

But to some extent these sites are simply building out an existing system. “We never allowed people to upload content if they weren’t verified — and we verify age we verify that their ID is not fake we verify it’s them in the ID” says Dominic Ford creator of the platform JustForFans. “We were already doing that.”

For its part OnlyFans has denied the planned changes were related to Mastercard’s policies. “We’re already fully compliant with the new MasterCard rules so that had no bearing on the decision” Stokely told the Financial Times.

WEBSITES OBVIOUSLY SOLD PORN BEFORE ONLYFANS. WHY CAN’T IT WORK WITH WHATEVER PAYMENT COMPANIES THEY USE?

OnlyFans hasn’t outlined exactly which companies it works with. But Stabile says it appears to have built more mainstream banking relationships than many adult companies. The platform has so far avoided being pigeonholed as exclusively a sex-related platform frequently highlighting its creators in other industries and launching a fully safe-for-work mobile app.

If OnlyFans isn’t being treated like an adult company that probably saves it a massive amount of money. Partly because of the risks mentioned above companies that focus on sex typically face much higher fees than generic platforms. “Anybody that we touch charges us because we work in adult [services]” says Ford — from JustForFans’ payment processors to its payroll services. “There’s absolutely no comparison.”

Lower rates could help OnlyFans pass more money to creators. Ford says JustForFans which recently dropped its commission from 30 to 20 percent has struggled to support the kind of rates it wants to offer thanks to fees. But it means sex workers also have to weigh the risk that OnlyFans might abandon them like it almost did last week. “They’ve never wanted to be a porn site” says Ford. “At what point do you as a sex worker say this site does not want me — let me go to a site that does?”

COULD PLATFORMS BYPASS ALL THESE PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY?

Some porn platforms accept cryptocurrency or help sex workers sell NFTs. But right now Visa and Mastercard remain indispensable. Lots of users don’t hold cryptocurrency and aren’t going to acquire it specifically to spend on a subscription site especially when there’s the chance of holding it until it appreciates. To reach even a fraction of OnlyFans’ size you simply have to accommodate non-crypto users.

“For the immediate time we don’t have a choice. We can try to work with these institutions or we can lose the ability to process payments” says Revenga. JustForFans users can choose to bypass payment processing fees by using cryptocurrency but Ford says it’s not a popular option: since its launch in 2018 its entire crypto-based earnings equal about one day’s worth of traditional payments.

NOW THAT ONLYFANS REVERSED ITS PLANS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Even if nothing explicitly changed OnlyFans has probably shaken some users’ faith in the service. JustForFans FanCentro and other competitors like ManyVids both saw a huge jump in signups after the ban was announced although it’s too early to say if those users and creators will stick around. But it’s tough for creators to leave a platform where they’ve built their fan base especially when they face the added challenge of selling adult content.

Meanwhile OnlyFans may still eventually have to decide between serving adult content creators and keeping its mainstream status — and even if it won this round banks still hold a lot of the cards. “Given the cost of losing a bank you have to do what they say” says Stabile. “If you’re making $300 million [a month] and that’s what you’re fundraising on and that’s going to be cut in half because you’re going to lose the mainstream bank that processes with you that’s going to affect everything.”

There are currently two non-stop routes between Canada and Italy connecting Rome Fiumicino with Toronto four times a week and Montreal. Given the absence in ITA's plans with connections to Canada the Star Alliance carrier hopes to intercept the bulk of passenger traffic that prefers direct connections to stopovers.

Connections between Italy and Canada are particularly busy in the summer season but also during the rest of the year due to the large community of Italian-Canadians right in the Toronto area. Overall traffic between Canada and Milan totaled 160267 round-trip passengers in 2019 with Toronto-Milan the largest city pair representing 61% of the market.

Also in the company's intentions is the desire to reactivate connections with Venice and the other flight from Malpensa to Toronto. The route between Toronto and Milan was launched in June 2014 becoming the only non-stop service from Canada to the Lombard provincial capital. The defunct airline Air Italy also operated YYZ-MXP service in 2019 but the last Air Canada and Air Italy flights on the route took place in October of that year."

Dating apps have been operating on the same model for years: Users throw in a handful of pictures and fill out a bio. For the most part people look at those profiles and swipe left to deny or right to express interest. If two people swipe right they match and could end up on a date.

But now that's changing.

The pandemic has caused a level of disruption that's allowed companies to consider what the future of dating apps without mindless swiping might look like.

Look to Bumble  for example which has a ""Night In"" trivia option. The feature lets users set up a virtual trivia date if they match with someone. It also allows users to send matches voice memos a feature that went viral on TikTok earlier this year.

And Tinder Match Group 's largest dating app has ""Swipe Night"" a live interactive dating feature where singles follow a storyline together. During a set period of time people try to figure out who committed the made-up crime.

Adrian is a new varsity program in DII Men's College rugby in the Great Lakes Conference. Coached by Benny Mateialona the young program met the Wolverines in basically a scrimmage preseason game. But it was a full-on contest and Adrian with many of their overseas players still waiting for visas traveled to Ann Arbor with only 20 players.

""We needed guys to play for a full 80 minutes"" said Mateialona.

Adrian ran out to a 12-0 first-half lead with tries from Alexander Tautua'a and Michael Pakofe both forwards and products of Menko Atherton (Calif.) and Kahuku HS (Hawaii). Sophomore Sam Williams fullback converted on try.

As the game wore on Michigan started to put things together and scored two tries in the second half both unconverted to make it 12-10. Adrian was plagued somewhat with handling errors with the heat making the ball sweaty and difficult to control.

""The players such with it and the leadership group really took control of how we wanted to play even under pressure"" said Mateialona. Captain Nicholas Andiarena was crucial in this aspect. That leadership helped Adrian hold on to win 12-10.

The victory is huge for the program. The winning of the first game of the program's history is already making news around the college and add to that the fact that no Adrian sports team has ever beaten Michigan before. While it's easy to get carried away with a preseason game this game remains evidence that while young Adrian has some rugby chops. It wasn't perfect but it was a good start.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaTI0Ny5jb20vdHJpYXRobG9uLW5ld3MvZWxpdGUvY29sbGlucy1jdXAtcmVzdWx0cy0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collins Cup results 2021: Team Europe claim Samorin glory,"The inaugural Collins Cup took place in Samorin Slovakia on Saturday August 28 2021 and when the results were totted up it was Team Europe who claimed the ultimate glory.

Daniela Ryf vs Taylor Knibb vs Teresa Adam

An astonishing start to the first ever Collins Cup with 23-year-old American Knibb claiming a full six-point haul by simply destroying the GOAT herself Daniela Ryf as well as Teresa Adam.

Knibb fresh from a fine second at IRONMAN 70.3 Boulder after her recent Olympic exploits in Tokyo came out of the water 1:18 ahead of Ryf but eyes were then well and truly opened as she blitzed her opponents on the bike (a road bike to be exact) as well. Her terrific 1:52:16 split was more than seven minutes faster than Daniela.

Knibb continued to surge even further clear on the run eventually finishing more than 16 (SIXTEEN) minutes clear of Ryf with Adam just under 23 minutes off the pace in third.

It later transpired that Ryf had woken on raceday feeling unwell but despite that this was some performance from Knibb to get the unheralded USA team off to an unexpectedly perfect start.

Lucy Charles-Barclay vs Katie Zaferes vs Paula Findlay

Charles-Barclay as expected notched a victory for Europe as she convincingly dealt with American Olympian Zaferes and last year’s PTO 2020 Championship winner Paula Findlay.

Zaferes was right with Lucy throughout the swim and led early on the bike after taking the advantage during T1. But Charles-Barclay passed her about 15km in and it was a lead the British star never relinquished. Lucy poured it on in the closing stages to maximise her points haul.

Findlay made a concerted effort to try to claim second from Zaferes in the closing stages but could not bridge the gap.

Anne Haug vs Jackie Hering vs Jeanni Metzler

A superb performance from Hering to provide another victory for Team USA as it really outperformed expectations in the early going.

Haug recovered somewhat from an average swim and mechanical problems on the bike but she could not get the finishing margin down to under two minutes to deny Hering a bonus half-point.

Holly Lawrence vs Skye Moench vs Ellie Salthouse

The eagerly-awaited showdown between Lawrence and Salthouse (remember ‘karma is a b**ch’ anybody?) delivered in style until a disastrous crash late in the bike leg for Lawrence.

Holly hit the deck right in front of her Australian rival and despite bouncing up to continue with blood streaming from her arm mechanical damage resulted in a ton of lost time which destroyed her chances of continuing the epic battle.

It was a major disappointment not just for Holly but also for the global TV audience who had been treated to an incredible spectacle as the pair powered through the waters of the Danube literally side by side during the swim.

Lawrence was able at least to keep Salthouse’s winning margin down to under six minutes denying the Australian another bonus.

Matthews was another European Captain’s Pick to come good in justifying her selection with an impressive success in the final women’s race of the day.

Kat came out of the water just under two minutes back from leader McCauley and the pair then produced almost identical bike splits.

Matthews though produced a blistering run of 1:04:56 to overhaul the American and come home more than five minutes in front.

Jan Frodeno vs Sam Long vs Sam Appleton

While Ryf’s expected victory was ruined by illness Frodeno did what the script said he would but it wasn’t a complete stroll for the best long-distance racer around.

Appleton stuck doggedly to his task coming out of the water just 24 seconds behind Frodeno and then bettering the German’s bike split by three seconds.

Frodeno though really showed his dominance on the run surging clear to win by more than four minutes. Appleton was good enough to hold off Sam Long for second – reversing the placings from their recent meeting in Boulder.

Iden has already shown off his middle-distance credentials on more than one occasion – notably that IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship win in 2019 and then the PTO 2020 Championship success last December.

The Norwegian was again super-impressive here coming home more than seven minutes in front of late replacement Collin Chartier – who stepped in for Rudy Von Berg at the 11th hour.

It was a 58:05 run which separated Iden from his rivals in the end as he surged clear on the final leg to register a comprehensive victory.

Just six days out from finishing second at IRONMAN Copenhagen Sanders showed that there are indeed ‘No Limits’ as he claimed victory over old rival Kienle to give Team Internationals their second win of the day.

The Canadian produced an excellent swim to come out of the water just three seconds behind Starykowicz with Kienle more than a minute further back.

Sanders and Starykowicz were again pretty much neck and neck on the bike (despite the former hitting the deck at one stage) before Lionel finally took control on the run to come home just over a minute clear of the American.

On Day 1 of Steelers rookie minicamp at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side McCormick worked primarily at right guard a position he barely played while with the Jackrabbits.

Though it remains to be seen if that’s his spot moving forward McCormick is ready for anything when it comes to the Steelers and whatever his role may be.

“I’m ready for whatever they throw at me” McCormick said to reporters on Day 1 of rookie minicamp according to video via Aaron Becker on Twitter. “I just wanna help the organization in any way that I can.”

They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at the next level.” pic.twitter.com/4oZmz22TpB — Aaron Becker (@Aaron_M_Becker) May 10 2024

That’s largely been McCormick’s mindset since the Steelers drafted him in the fourth round at No. 119 overall.

Though he was primarily a left guard in college McCormick worked out for the Steelers as a center prior to the draft. Now he is getting work at right guard initially in the Black and Gold.

Snaps by position at SDSU for Mason McCormick per PFF Left guard = 3378 👀 Right guard = 19 Center = 15#Steelers #NFL — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) April 27 2024

Having 3378 snaps at left guard seems like it would make for a difficult transition for McCormick to flip sides but that isn’t the case.

“At South Dakota State they prepared me for everything” McCormick said. “They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at this level.”

It’s certainly going to help McCormick early on.

When the Steelers drafted him it made some sense that he could be the longtime answer at left or right guard with Isaac Seumalo turning 31 and James Daniels entering the final year of his contract as well as backup interior offensive lineman Nate Herbig entering the final year of his contract too.

McCormick’s versatility whether it’s at left guard center or right guard will be key. That should set him up for success long-term and will give Steelers offensive line coach Pat Meyer the ability to simply get the best five linemen on the field at once regardless of true position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtaWNlLWNyZWFtLXJpZ2h0LXRvLXJlcGFpctIBTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vaGFyZC10ZWNoL21jZG9uYWxkcy1pY2UtY3JlYW0tcmlnaHQtdG8tcmVwYWlyP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fighting for the right to repair McDonald’s ice cream machines,"Update 9/9/21 9:00 AM ET:

The Wall Street Journal reported on September 1 that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent letters to McDonald’s franchisees this summer asking questions about ice cream machines including how often they the franchisees are allowed to work on them.

The letter explicitly notes that this “preliminary investigation” doesn’t mean the FTC has evidence of wrongdoing and it’s not clear whether the Kytch’s lawsuit has any connection — Kytch and Taylor both deny being contacted by the agency.

The FTC voted in July to start developing policies that supported consumers’ right to repair their own possessions. It also said it would be investigating companies with potentially unlawful repair restrictions.

Now it seems the right to repair McDonald’s ice cream machines is on the agency’s radar — even if McDonald’s seems to be in denial.

“Nothing is more important to us than delivering on our high standards for food quality and safety which is why we work with fully vetted partners that can reliably provide safe solutions at scale” it said in a statement. “McDonald’s has no reason to believe we are the focus of an FTC investigation.”

A judge just issued a victory to a startup that makes it easier for fast food franchise owners to repair McDonald’s ice cream machines — but the soft-serve saga isn’t over yet.

The background

More than 90% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants feature an $18000 ice cream machine made by food-equipment manufacturer Taylor (others have a machine made by a company in Italy but the long wait for parts is generally a deterrent).

These machines are advanced as far as ice cream-making devices go. Not only do they have the unique ability to produce both soft serve and milkshakes they need to be disassembled and cleaned just once every two weeks instead of daily like most other machines.

McDonald’s ice cream machines are also temperamental — they break so often that someone built a website just to track which ones are down at a given time (11% are out of commission at the time of writing). Heck even McDonald’s has joked about the machines breaking on its official Twitter account.

“It’s a huge money maker to have a customer that’s unable to make fundamental changes to their own equipment.” Jeremy O’Sullivan

About 85% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are franchises which means they’re independently owned and operated — someone is paying McDonald’s a fee to sell its products under its brand name.

When one of McDonald’s ice cream machines breaks these franchise owners have to contact a Taylor distributor to send out a certified technician. That technician then enters a not-so-secret code that unlocks a menu revealing diagnostic information about the machine and the meaning of any error codes.

Because McDonald’s ice cream machines break so regularly franchisees often spend thousands of dollars on service contracts with Taylor distributors every year — and Taylor gets a cut of those profits.

“It’s a huge money maker to have a customer that’s purposefully intentionally blind and unable to make very fundamental changes to their own equipment” Jeremy O’Sullivan co-founder of foodtech startup Kytch told Wired in April.

The Kytch solution

In May 2019 Kytch began selling a small gadget that hacks into this previously inaccessible data — owners just have to install it on their Taylor ice cream machine (a reportedly simple process that requires 20 minutes and a screwdriver) and connect it to WiFi.

The device (called a Kytch) will then monitor the machine 24/7 providing real-time information via the startup’s website. It even offers troubleshooting advice when something goes wrong giving franchisees an opportunity to repair the machines themselves.

“It’s almost scary to think about having … soft-serve units without these devices.” CJ Timoney

Kytch requires a $20 monthly subscription and a $250 activation fee — and soon after its launch fast food franchise owners were raving about the gadget.

“After not having it it’s almost scary to think about having shake machines without these or soft-serve units without these devices” CJ Timoney who owns eight Burger King franchises told Business Insider in February 2020.

The pushback

Everything was going great for Kytch until November 2020 when McDonald’s sent all of its franchisees an email warning them that installing a Kytch voided the warranty on their ice cream machines.

The email also claimed according to Wired’s detailed report that a Kytch “creates a potential very serious safety risk for the crew or technician attempting to clean or repair the machine” and could cause “serious human injury.”

“Kytch has only made the shake machine better more reliable with less downtime.” Jeremy O’Sullivan

The final line of the email was written in italics and bold: “McDonald’s strongly recommends that you remove the Kytch device from all machines and discontinue use.”

Another email from McDonald’s arrived the next day announcing the “Taylor Shake Sundae Connectivity” — a device that replicates many of Kytch’s features.

The lawsuit

Over the next few months hundreds of franchisees canceled their Kytch subscription plans and it became impossible for the company to find new customers.

In May Kytch filed a lawsuit against Taylor alleging that the company obtained one of its devices illegally — franchisees are forbidden from sharing them with third parties — and then told McDonald’s they were dangerous despite a lack of evidence.

“This false claim has been extremely damaging to our company and our customers” O’Sullivan had told Business Insider prior to filing the lawsuit. “Kytch has only made the shake machine better more reliable with less downtime.”

“The manufacturers like to pretend they have the best answers for fixing equipment. That’s nonsense.” Nathan Proctor

On July 30 a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Taylor and told it to give back any Kytch devices it had obtained. That fulfills one of Kytch’s requests in the lawsuit — the other is for Taylor to pay it a to-be-determined amount of money in damages.

“These guys did a really effective job at frightening off all of our customers and investors so we’re hoping the public will support our case in the name of justice right to repair and humanity” O’Sullivan told Motherboard.

“We still have some diehard customers sticking with us” he continued “though few in comparison to what we once had before McDonald’s and Taylor called our product dangerous.”

The bigger picture

The saga of McDonald’s ice cream machines is just one example of the broader right-to-repair movement which argues that consumers should have the ability to repair purchases themselves or at least decide who to turn to for help.

This is standard for many types of purchases — when you own a car there’s nothing to stop you from fixing a brake problem yourself or taking the vehicle to your favorite auto mechanic — but many companies keep the info and parts needed for repairs to themselves.

Nobody can force them to share that information but many companies go further with terms of service or warranty restrictions that require customers to use their proprietary repair service. Even if you have the know-how and ability to repair it you might not risk it.

“The manufacturers like to pretend they have the best answers if not the only answer for fixing equipment” Nathan Proctor Director of the U.S. PIRG’s Campaign for the Right to Repair told Freethink. “That’s nonsense.”

Giving people the ability to repair their own property — like Kytch does for owners of McDonald’s ice cream machines — can save them money but that’s just one benefit according to Proctor.

“Sometimes it means innovations that improve the product like in the case of Kytch” he explained. “We can’t let manufacturers squash all that innovation because they don’t feel like competing.”

For now all Kytch can do is hope a judge agrees with the allegations in its lawsuit.

“Kytch is just a small piece of the broader right-to-repair movement” Kytch co-founder Melissa Nelson told Motherboard. “But our case makes clear that it’s past time to end shady business practices that create hundreds of millions of dollars of unnecessary repair fees from ‘certified’ technicians.”

Jessica Nelson feasted her eyes on the bulging bovine in another car in the drive-thru lane — and instantly hit record.

“I thought it was fake at first” Nelson told the Associated Press. “Who puts a cow in a Buick? Then its whole head moved.

“I just took the video of it because I was blown away there was a cow in the back of a Buick!”

The footage posted Sunday by Fox News shows the gray Buick waiting in line Friday to get to the fast-food chain’s drive-thru window when the curious calf is caught rearing its head out of the back seat.

“There’s a whole ass cow in the back of that car!!!” Nelson wrote on the post.

She said the cow’s owners saw her video on social media and reached out to her to explain the livestock sighting.

They told her they had just purchased the animal and two others who were also crammed into the back seat at a nearby auction — when they decided to grab a burger.

McDonald's pulled milkshakes from its menus across UK restaurants this week citing supply chain issues. The week before popular restaurant chain Nando's said it would temporarily close 50 stores because it couldn't get hold of its main ingredient peri-peri chicken. And in July German confectionary giant Haribo said it was struggling to get its sweets to shops in the UK.

These are just three examples of retailers and foodservice companies hit by supply chain issues. Similar issues are common across the US too but experts say that the UK is dealing with unique challenges thanks to a massive truck driver shortage.

This shortage partly fueled by the pandemic and partly by the UK leaving the EU could lead to long delays and ultimately price increases for customers experts say.

According to the Road Haulage Association (RHA) the UK is currently short 100000 trucker drivers. Pre-Pandemic there would have been around 600000 drivers in total.

While a lack of truck drivers predated the pandemic the situation has only become worse.

Drivers that had come over from mainland Europe went home during the pandemic and never returned. New immigration rules in the wake of Brexit also made it harder for these workers to come and go — tax changes also impacted self-employed drivers.

The pandemic and ongoing lockdown also meant that many would-be drivers were unable to join the industry because they couldn't take the proper driving tests.

It's the perfect storm.

""This means the available pool of drivers are getting booked up extremely quickly and prices are naturally starting to increase"" Alex Hersham cofounder and CEO of Zencargo a UK-based logistics company said in an email to Insider.

To combat this the UK government temporarily eased restrictions on the number of hours drivers can work. It's also testing extra-long trucks that can deliver more goods at one time and so require fewer trips and fewer drivers.

Retailers themselves are also getting creative in how they attract workers to drive their delivery vans.

Grocery giant Tesco is offering £1000 ($1168) bonuses to drivers who join before September 30. John Lewis said it would raise its lorry driver salaries by up to £5000 ($5843) to keep them motivated.

But experts say these trucker shortages are likely to lead to long delays across the entire retail sector and consumers could see prices creep up.

""Consumers could potentially face weeks of delays when ordering products online whether it be furniture cosmetics clothes or bicycles with a number of haulers already running out of capacity for the whole of August"" Hersham said.

He added: ""We've all seen footage on the news of empty supermarket shelves ... but we're already seeing this spread from supermarkets to other retailers and if businesses don't start planning they could wind up in a similar situation.""

Ramsey Baghdadi an analyst at GlobalData told Insider that retailers and foodservice providers should start to invest in tech that increase supply chain visibility such as blockchain to prepare.

""These technologies will help staff to be informed about the product delivery in real-time. This will allow companies to plan ahead of shortages due to increased traceability and avoid customer distrust"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS93aXNjb25zaW4tbWNkb25hbGRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy1zaG9ja2VkLWJ5LWNvdy1pbi1kcml2ZS10aHJ10gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3dpc2NvbnNpbi1tY2RvbmFsZHMtY3VzdG9tZXJzLXNob2NrZWQtYnktY293LWluLWRyaXZlLXRocnUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wisconsin McDonald's customers shocked by cow in drive-thru,"Hopefully this order didn’t include any burgers.

The drive-thru at McDonald’s offers customers a great option for getting their food without having to leave their car. This is especially useful for situations when a customer isn’t able to enter the dining room.

For example a customer traveling with a cow in their car can’t just walk the cow into the restaurant to order some food.

A bizarre video filmed in Marshfield Wis. shows a car waiting at a McDonald’s drive-thru that has a cow sitting in the backseat. In the footage which was uploaded to Facebook the animal is clearly visible watching the outside world through the window.

It’s unclear from the footage if the cow is fully grown yet or not although several commenters pointed out that it is likely still a calf because a full-grown cow likely wouldn’t fit in the back of a normal car.

Jessica Nelson filmed the video while waiting further back in the drive-thru line. She captioned the footage ""A whole freaking cow! Tell me you live in Wisconsin without telling me you live in Wisconsin.""

One commenter who has experience with cows wrote ""We had to haul our calves in the car or truck back in the day! We'd take out the back seat and put in empty feed bags... then the calves.""

The McDonald’s PS5 controller featured the company’s famous Golden Arches logo on the touchpad a yellow D-Pad and face buttons along with a picture of some fries and what appears to be a Big Mac Burger on the handles of the DualSense pad.

Unfortunately it appears that McDonald’s didn’t get permission from Sony before creating the custom controller and has blocked McDonald’s from giving away any of the garish-looking pads during its ‘Stream Week’ event.

In a statement to Press Start McDonald’s Australia said: “Unfortunately McDonald’s stream week has been postponed and won’t be going ahead this Sunday. We are unable to confirm a new date for the proposed event at this time. We will have some great prizing [sic] including Macca’s 50th Birthday Hoodies and 50 channel subscriptions for each streamer to give away. We will be in contact with the new timing as soon as we have it confirmed.

“Sony PlayStation has not authorised the use of its controller in promotional materials related to the proposed Stream Week event and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. McDonald’s stream week has been postponed and Sony PlayStation controllers will not be included in the giveaway.”

Analysis: Sony’s stance isn’t a surprise

While it may seem like Sony is playing the role of the party pooper by blocking McDonald’s PS5 controller from being given away it isn’t really surprising. We’ve seen Sony protect its intellectual property in the past as the company has previously blocked the sale of PS5 faceplates from being manufactured. However that didn’t stop custom skin maker dbrand from creating and releasing their own PS5 Darkplates which let you turn the white PS5 into a fetching looking black model.

It seems rather shortsighted if McDonald’s Australia who will be all too aware of the legalities involved in making such a move didn’t reach out to Sony to strike up an agreement for its custom PS5 DualSense controller to be given away before making an announcement. Any partnership or branding for such events usually has to be agreed by both parties so while it might be easy to be frustrated with Sony McDonald’s Australia should also shoulder some of the blame.

Currently the PS5 DualSense only has three variations available: you can purchase it in Original White Cosmic Red and Midnight Black. We’re sure to see more color options and unique designs in the future but as it stands the McDonald’s PS5 controller won’t be one of them."

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzI4LzMtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtbWFrZS15b3UtcmljaC1vbmUtZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks That Could Make You Rich One Day,"These three companies have what it takes to grow your investment dollars over the long term.

It's not something most investors realize but investing in the right stocks can make you wealthy over time. The key is to have the discipline to stay the course even if businesses within your portfolio surprise you with the occasional negative earnings report. I'd argue that if you own a bunch of great companies more often than not they tend to surprise you.

Here are three stocks that if held over many years could easily multiply your wealth.

1. Facebook

Facebook (META -0.09%) occupies a dominant position within the social media space. Its ownership of chat service WhatsApp and picture- and video-sharing site Instagram have only helped the company expand its reach into different customer demographic segments. Since the founding of the company in 2004 by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and its subsequent listing in 2012 the social media giant's share price has risen nearly 10-fold.

The company is still chalking up impressive numbers as evidenced by its fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings report. Total revenue jumped by 56% year over year to $29.1 billion while operating income more than doubled year over year to $12.4 billion. This was driven by increases in the number of ads delivered as well as a jump in the average price per ad. Net income surged from $5.2 billion to $10.4 billion.

Daily and monthly active users also continue to climb. The former statistic has increased from 1.6 billion two years ago to 1.9 billion while the latter has risen from 2.4 billion to 2.9 billion over the same period. Facebook however isn't content with just advertising revenue -- it has also spent a considerable amount of money on virtual reality (VR).

There's a solid reason for doing so. The company plans to eventually launch the ""metaverse"" a virtual world where people can interact with one another using VR gear. The launch of Horizon Workrooms is the first step toward that reality as colleagues can ""meet"" in a virtual conference room similar to having a physical meeting.

It's still early days but the metaverse promises to deliver a whole new social media experience for users. The eventual formation of this metaverse promises to offer many more opportunities for Facebook to monetize thereby generating additional streams of revenue for the company.

2. PayPal

There's probably no better company to represent the online payment sector than PayPal (PYPL -2.06%). PayPal helps to connect customers and merchants and makes it much easier to transact online. The company not only allows secure digital transactions to take place but also provides a digital wallet (Venmo) where users can store money and cryptocurrencies. The pandemic had accelerated the growth of the company allowing it to report its strongest year on record in 2020.

This growth has carried into 2021. Net revenue grew by 19% year over year for the second quarter led by 40% year-over-year growth in total payment volume. A total of 11.4 million net new active accounts were added bringing total active accounts to 403 million.

PayPal is not resting on its laurels though. The company is coming up with new initiatives to boost its business further with a ""Buy Now Pay Later"" (BNPL) service just launched in Australia. This BNPL solution comes with no fees and is available at millions of online stores where the ""PayPal"" button pops up. So far around 425000 unique merchants and close to 4.2 million customers have signed on.

And in yet another boost for the cryptocurrency market PayPal has launched a new service whereby its customers in the U.K. can buy hold and sell four types of cryptocurrency the first expansion of this service outside of the U.S.

3. DocuSign

In line with the growth of the digital economy more and more agreements are also being signed digitally. This is good news for DocuSign (DOCU 1.20%). For its fiscal 2022 first quarter ended April 30 total revenue climbed by 58% year over year to $469 million of which $452 million was subscription revenue.

DocuSign's total customers have grown nearly three-fold from 373000 in the fiscal year 2018 to 988000 as of the end of the quarter. Of these enterprise customers have more than tripled during the same period from 43000 to 136000 reflecting the strong uptake for the company's services.

More importantly customers with an annual contract value of more than $300000 have grown to 673 while the net dollar retention rate stands at 125%. These numbers point to not just increased adoption but also customer stickiness as they continue to spend more using DocuSign's platform.

The company has continued to enhance its product suite with new features such as data visualization tools and improved data verification. Such additions should help it to continue attracting new and existing customers and enable it to continue growing its subscription revenue.

Positioned for further growth

These three companies enjoy multiple tailwinds that will allow them to grow their revenue and net income for many more years. The pandemic acted as a catalyst to accelerate their business growth and this momentum should enable them to continue doing well. You'll be doing yourself a great favor by holding on to these winners over the long-term to enjoy steady share price gains in tandem with the growth of the business. By steadily adding on shares of these companies along the way you can let your money compound and one day even be rich.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLW1hcmluZS1raWxsZWQtYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tYmxhc3Qtd2FzLW5ld2x5d2VkLXd5b21pbmctMjAyMS0wOC0yNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anger grief for family members of 13 U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-marine-killed-afghanistan-blast-was-newlywed-wyoming-2021-08-27/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLW1hcmluZS1raWxsZWQtYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tYmxhc3Qtd2FzLW5ld2x5d2VkLXd5b21pbmctMjAyMS0wOC0yNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9pbmp1cmVkLXN3aXNzLWNvd3MtZ2V0LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmlkZS1hbHBpbmUtcGFzdHVyZXMtMjAyMS0wOC0yNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Injured Swiss cows get helicopter ride from Alpine pastures,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/injured-swiss-cows-get-helicopter-ride-alpine-pastures-2021-08-27/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9pbmp1cmVkLXN3aXNzLWNvd3MtZ2V0LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcmlkZS1hbHBpbmUtcGFzdHVyZXMtMjAyMS0wOC0yNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

A 22-20 win would be the result for New England on Sunday night.

Here’s a glimpse through what went into it as the NFL’s 53-man roster deadline looms.

Last look under center

Through the initial August exhibitions Cam Newton started and played a total of five series. In the finale the incumbent Patriots quarterback started and stayed in for two. A 2-of-5 passing line was accrued.

Newton who returned from his Covid-19 protocol-related absence on Thursday threw for 10 yards. A dart to a diving Jakobi Meyers in the flat would be the first attempt. The next drive a third-and-7 became an interception intended for the wide receiver deep down the seam. The well-placed ball into tight coverage was one that Giants linebacker Blake Martinez ripped away.

Mac Jones entered New England’s huddle at the 11:20 mark in the second quarter. The No. 15 overall pick out of Alabama was flagged for delay of game moments later. But Jones went 10-of-14 through the air for 156 yards versus New York. He found wideout Kristian Wilkerson on a dig route for 21 yards and tight end Devin Asiasi for 19 yards on a drag into space. Jones then hit receiver Isaiah Zuber for a touchdown from 17 yards away to begin the third frame. The pair nearly combined for another next time out on a fade. Jones was sacked on four occasions. Brian Hoyer grabbed his helmet in the fourth quarter.

Beginning the post-Michel Patriots backfield

New England’s running back room went forward after Sony Michel joined the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for capital in the sixth round of the 2022 draft and the fourth round of the 2023 draft. The Georgia product had led the team in rushing in each of his first two campaigns before taking on a complementary part last campaign next to Damien Harris.

Rookie Rhamondre Stevenson now has the green light to take on that part. The former Cerritos Falcon and Oklahoma Sooner continued to drive through it Sunday evening gaining 23 yards on five carries 17 yards on two catches and a chance on kickoff returns. Downhill size paired with jump-cutting footwork Stevenson plunged in for a touchdown in the third quarter. He previously scored four touchdowns through wins versus the Washington Football Team and Philadelphia Eagles.

Brandon Bolden was not in uniform on Sunday. But captain James White made an appearance. And so did J.J. Taylor who served as a 5-foot-6 185-pound spark plug with 76 yards on the ground and 13 yards through the air. The 2020 undrafted arrival from Arizona touched the football 11 times on offense even catching a pass on the same play he chipped Giants defensive lineman Leonard Williams off his cleats. Taylor got a long look at punt returner over reigning All-Pro Gunner Olszewski as well.

Offensive tackle’s third-year roster run

Once the Big 12 Co-Offensive Lineman of the Year at West Virginia Yodny Cajuste missed the entirety of two NFL seasons after landing in the third round back in 2019. And on his way back from stints on the non-football injury list and injured reserve he entered organized team activities as a 25-year-old roster longshot. The outlook has shifted since then.

In the second quarter against New York Cajuste subbed in when New England made the quarterback switch. He did so in place of starting left tackle Isaiah Wynn on a line comprised of Alex Redmond James Ferentz Ted Karras and Justin Herron. Cajuste later helped pave the way to a 19-7 lead as a run-blocker.

“To see him work through this — you know the guy’s really worked so hard — it’s inspiring to see” Patriots center and captain David Andrews told reporters earlier in the week.

Uche at a different frame rate

Some linebackers move at a different frame rate on the screen. All pixels point toward the second pick in the 2020 Patriots draft class being one of them.

Josh Uche notched a sack in the summer finale on the first drive beating Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas to take down signal-caller Daniel Jones. It went for a loss of six and forced a punt. And it kept the trend going for a hybrid who found the backfield as a one-year Michigan starter and did the same in a limited rookie sample.

Pro Football Focus charted Uche for three hurries through his first two games of the preseason. Those hurries transpired over 17 snaps in pass rush. More were added on Sunday. There’s a place on the field for speed. Even in the company of March signings Matthew Judon and Kyle Van Noy the Patriots appear set to find it more so off the edges than off the ball. Uche would be on the field for a pocket-collapsing sack split between inside linebacker Ja’Whaun Bentley and defensive end Deatrich Wise Jr. And in the second quarter he’d also be in the face of New York’s quarterback to force an interception down at the goal line.

In the secondary after the Wade trade

New England acquired rookie cornerback Shaun Wade from the Baltimore Ravens four days prior to the preseason finale in exchange for a 2022 seventh-rounder and a 2023 fifth-rounder. His debut in East Rutherford began on special teams. It continued before intermission on defense. And on the outside where press-man technique gave way to an incompletion down the right sideline. Wade played the remainder. He was the nearest Patriot on a 43-yard touchdown catch by wideout Damion Willis with eight seconds left.

Wade had fallen to pick No. 160 overall in the spring after returning to Ohio State as a redshirt junior last fall. Abdominal surgery turf toe and challenges moving away from a slot role were among the factors. But his stay with the Buckeyes concluded as a consensus All-American and the Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year.

The Patriots started J.C. Jackson D’Angelo Ross Jalen Mills Adrian Phillips and Devin McCourty in the secondary versus the Giants. As the page turned to the second unit Joejuan Williams Justin Bethel Adrian Colbert and Michael Jackson Sr. all joined Ross. The practice squad alum proceeded to intercept an errant pass in the end zone while playing safety. It’s an area to monitor with the active roster reducing from 80 by 4 p.m. ET Tuesday. Stephon Gilmore remains on physically unable to perform and neither Jonathan Jones nor Myles Bryant were in uniform.

Nordin Folk share New England’s kicking operation

Strong to scattered performances from rookie free agent Quinn Nordin were seen through two weeks of field goals and extra points. But the third week of the preseason brought a 48-yarder in the second quarter and a 37-yarder in the fourth quarter for the Wolverine.

Nordin finished 2-of-3 on field goals after a 54-yarder sailed left with under a minute to go. He made his lone extra point in a timeshare.

Veteran kicker Nick Folk got the first field goal converting from 41 yards out. The 2007 Pro Bowler re-signed with New England in March on a one-year contract featuring $1.225 million guaranteed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtqZXRzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2pldHMtZWFnbGVzLTMtdGFrZWF3YXlzLWhhaWwtbWFyeS1maW5pc2gtcHV0cy1hLWJvdy1vbi0yMDIxLXByZXNlYXNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets-Eagles 3 Takeaways | Hail Mary Finish Puts a Bow on 2021 Preseason,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9nYW1lL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTMyNjYxNi9wYXRyaW90cy1naWFudHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patriots 22-20 Giants (Aug 29 2021) Final Score,"2024 NFL draft: Best rookie team fits perfect landing spots

This Monster Ball is a high-end affair.

MGM Resorts International is tapping into Lady Gaga’s high ticket demand with “Back in the Haus” five VIP offers that pairs suites with premium show tickets. These upscale packages are expected to be offered to the public as early as Monday timed to Gaga’s nine “Jazz & Piano” shows at Park Theater from Oct. 14-31.

The most lavish option “I Want Your Everything” runs $10619 for four guests ($2655 apiece) with suite options at Aria Bellagio and Park MGM. The offer includes four VIP banquet seats for the show three nights in the Penthouse Suite including a $500 food-and-beverage credit and $250 spa credit among other amenities.

That package marks the highest VIP price point for a residency show ever at MGM Resorts. The offer surpasses Bruno Mars’ “24 Karat Gold” offer set for his return in July.

The VIP offers categorized by Gaga references and lyrics. The terms surfaced over the weekend through an internal memo which is planned to be emailed to about 3 million guests. Information about the entire lineup is available on the company’s website at mgmresorts.com.

After “Everything” the other Gaga packages include:

— “Little Monsters.” Four VIP tickets two king or queen rooms for four guests over three nights $400 F&B credit $7838 ($1959 per guest).

— “Bad Romance Great View.” Two VIP floor-center tickets premium suite at Aria or Bellagio or a queen room with a Strip view at Park MGM over three nights $200 F&B credit $3249 ($1624 per guest).

— “Gaga Oh La La.” Two floor tickets VIP check-in at Park MGM with a $200 food credit $2249 ($1124 per person).

— “Your Room Her Haus.” Two lower-bowl tickets VIP check-in $100 F&B credit $1919 ($959).

As previously announced entry to all Lady Gaga shows requires either a proof of being fully vaccinated for COVID-19 (in line with CDC guidelines) or a proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of attending. The proof must be provided through the Clear mobile app or other verification method approved by MGM Resorts. Those directives too are on the company website.

Pet sounds

Gregory Popovich hosts the only production show in Las Vegas that co-stars house pets. The veteran Strip headliner who uses upward of 30 pets in his show at V Theater at Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood has premiered “Popovich: Road To Hollywood” this month at Art Houz Theaters in downtown Las Vegas.

We remember some 20 years ago talking to Popovich at Carousel Bar during his days at Circus Circus Midway. He has since taken on his own show suitable for all ages in V Theater’s 2:30 p.m. slot.

Trained in the Moscow Circus and an alum of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus Popovich would seem a fine addition to a Cirque du Soleil spectacle. He was offered such a role just before signing on at Circus Circus but declined the Cirque option.

Popovich was working with Ringling for two years as Cirque was developing “Mystere” at Treasure Island and also touring “Saltimbanco” internationally. Popovich is also a world-class juggler and acrobatic comic something that caught the eye of Cirque founder Guy Laliberte.

“Guy had an idea for a new act with some physical comedy” Popovich said just before the film’s premiere last Monday. “But Cirque is a big structure a big company where you can’t improvise. They give you a very nice idea nice costume music but no change for five years.”

Popovich instead took an opportunity to bring an innovated show with trained shelter animals to Circus Circus. Toiling for a few dozen folks in the no-cover circus performances might not have been as prominent as working a Cirque production. But Popovich says he was fulfilled artistically.

“They said ‘As long as you don’t ask for extra money you can do what you want’ ” Popovich said. “I felt freedom there I could practice and develop my act as much as I want.”

Popovich thus left an offer to travel the world with “Saltimanco” and also potentially perform in “Mystere” on the Strip.

“I said ‘Guy I like your imagination and I like your show but I am going to Circus Circus’ ” Popovich said. “I then had my dream to work in Las Vegas.”

MCHP,Microchip Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2FkZGEuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvZmVhdHVyZXMvd2hhdC1zbWFydC1iYWxsLWNyaWNrZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is the smart cricket ball? Explained,"Cricket technology’s journey is a mixed bag. It brings advancement in data analysis but is also a devil’s advocate in on-field decisions. The smart cricket ball promises to bring real-time data in cricket matches but it remains to be seen how it measures in the sport’s tumultuous relationship with technology.

The Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) which consists of hawkeye and ultra-edge has had its fair share of controversies with the umpire’s call being a central issue. But the introduction of the smart ball set to register more data points than the radar or ball-tracking technology used in DRS could revolutionise analysis and critical decisions during cricket matches.

What is a smart cricket ball?

The smart cricket ball is a Kookaburra ball that has an electronic chip embedded in it. It is developed by Australian company Sportcor which is chaired by former Australian bowler Michael Kasprowicz.

The sensors in the microchip which is present in the innermost layer of the ball transmits information from the moment it is bowled to the point it comes in contact with the wicket-keeper fielder or the boundary line.

The chip inside the Smart Ball will transmit information such as the bowling speed and revolutions of the ball after it is bowled by a bowler.

The smart cricket ball measures the speed and revolutions of the ball the moment the bowler releases the ball and just before it hits the pitch. It also logs the speed of the ball after hitting the pitch.

The information can be viewed by any device (mobile/laptop) by a special application.

How is the smart cricket ball made?

The smart cricket ball has the microchip wired into a round socket and then fitted into the quilt of the ball - a small spherical object the size of a quail’s egg made of rubber and cork.

Then as it is with the manufacturing process of a regular cricket ball the microchip will have layers of leather and rubber wrapped over it assembled and stitched.

What are the challenges for the smart cricket ball?

The first challenge for the smart cricket ball - currently in its testing phase - is its longevity during the course of play. The battery of the microchip is said to last eight hours which should be enough unless the day’s play is extended.

The next hurdle for the Smart Ball is the durability of the microchip when the batsmen are continuously pounding the ball through an innings.

Another problem with the Smart Ball is the pricing considering the cost of developing the microchip.

While the concept of a cricket ball with brains seems appealing to the cricket audience its sustainability in the sport could determine its fate in the long run.

But it turns out even that technicality has a technicality. Microsoft is now threatening to withhold Windows Updates from your copy of Windows 11 — potentially even security updates — if you take that route.

We’re not sure why the company didn’t mention it in our original briefing but Microsoft has since told The Verge that unsupported PCs won’t be entitled to receive Windows Updates and that even security and driver updates may be withheld.

CYA or genuine threat?

It’s quite possible this is just a cover-your-ass measure on Microsoft’s part. It’s hard to imagine that Microsoft wouldn’t issue critical security patches when we’ve often seen the company extend support and offer the occasional free patch even after it’s shelved an operating system for good. If I were in Microsoft’s shoes I might just want to discourage people from thinking I was offering a warranty and technical support for every possible PC configuration under the sun to avoid potential legal headaches down the road. Better to underpromise and overdeliver.

But it’s also possible Microsoft genuinely does mean to withhold patches at some point in the future — potentially even at launch. Microsoft declined to clarify things further at this time which suggests the company’s perfectly happy for us to assume this is a genuine threat.

It’s not just security updates at stake by the way: If you’re unwilling or unable to replace your older-than-Intel 8th-Gen-CPU Windows 11 could theoretically be an operating system where you go back to the days of manually downloading driver updates for all your hardware something I haven’t needed to think about for years. Windows 10 wowed me from day one by seamlessly working with my aging laptop so it’d suck if that’s not the case anymore. (Admittedly the generic drivers that ship with Windows are often good enough.)

Feature updates are probably less of a big deal: if you’re the kind of person who would install a Windows 11 ISO on your computer to begin with you can probably download a newer ISO the next time there’s a major Windows update that you want and do an in-place-install. I just reformatted my machine with the Windows 10 2H21 ISO and I barely had any patching to do afterwards. But I suppose Microsoft could change its mind about system requirements for future ISOs too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjd29ybGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMzk1MDYyL21pY3Jvc29mdC1iYWNrcy1kb3duLW9sZGVyLXBjcy13aWxsLWJlLWFibGUtdG8tcnVuLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft backs down: Older PCs will be able to run Windows 11 unofficially,"Microsoft said Friday that the company is relenting somewhat on its minimum requirements for Windows 11 allowing enthusiasts that understand the risks to download and upgrade Windows 11 on older unsupported hardware. Exact details remain murky however due to conflicting reports and the lack of an official Microsoft statement.

Users who choose to download a standalone Windows 11 ISO file (as explained in how to upgrade to the Windows 11 beta) will be permitted to run Windows 11 even if the PC doesn’t technically qualify for the OS upgrade. Reports by ZDNet The Verge Windows Central and Thurrott.com all included unsourced attributions from Microsoft spokespeople that say users will be able to run Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. Some of the publications implied that there will be a set of minimum hardware requirements that Microsoft will enforce while others simply ignored them.

Update: After publication Microsoft PR responded to PCWorld with details about what is needed to run Windows 11 and a big gotcha—unsupported PCs won’t receive updates via Windows Update. Check out that story for full hardware compatibility details.

But what requirements? Here’s what each publication had to say. The murkiest detail appears to be whether TPM hardware will be required to run Windows 11 on an unsupported PC. Update: It is in varying ways. Again the linked story above has full details.

The Verge: “But for those happy to install Windows manually the actual minimum Windows 11 specs mean that CPU generations don’t matter as long as you have a 64-bit 1GHz processor with two or more cores 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.”

Thurrott.com: “Behind the scenes Microsoft will allow enthusiasts who wish to upgrade non-compliant older PCs to Windows 11 to do so. These upgrades will not be officially supported but those who wish to manually upgrade a PC to Windows 11 either by keeping it in the Windows Insider Program or by manually creating Windows 11 install media with the Media Creation Tool will be allowed to do so.”

ZDNet: “But if you have TPM 1.2 enabled 64 GB minimum of storage 4 GB of RAM and a dual-core CPU minimum you will be able to proceed with the installation of Windows 11 though you’ll be notified that your upgraded device will be in an unsupported state.”

Windows Central: ”The only requirements that will be checked during a manual upgrade or install are whether or not the PC has TPM 1.2 enabled 64GB minimum storage 4GB RAM and a dual-core CPU.”

For its part Microsoft still seems to be saying that Windows 11 will require a minimum set of hardware requirements most of which haven’t changed. “We have concluded that the compatible 64-bit processors selected 4GB of memory 64GB of storage UEFI secure boot graphics requirements and TPM 2.0 are the right minimum system requirements to deliver on the principles we established to best support you” a blog authored by “the Windows Team” said Friday.

To be clear Microsoft’s blog post did not publicly state that users would be able to download and install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. PCWorld asked Microsoft representatives for comment and we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.

PC Health Check is back

Formally it appears that Windows 11 still includes a list of minimum hardware specifications. But it’s still unclear whether an “unsupported” Windows 11 PC requires a minimum hardware specification and what that hardware requirement actually is. Remember one of the key issues surrounding Windows 11’s hardware requirements was the need for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and what version of the TPM that required. The reports published today with details from Microsoft spokespeople were split on whether TPM will be needed to run Windows 11 on unsupported PCs as noted above.

Microsoft did however expand the list of supported CPUs to include several Intel chips: Intel Core X-series the Xeon W-series and the Intel Core 7820HQ which features in the Microsoft Surface Studio 2. (Technically the Surface Studio 2 is among “select devices that shipped with modern drivers based on Declarative Componentized Hardware Support Apps (DCH) design principles.”) Microsoft also said that its had carefully analyzed the first generation of AMD Zen processors and concluded that it would not be adding any of those processors to the approved list.

Finally Microsoft said that it would be releasing an updated version of the PC Health Check app that it had pulled earlier. The new app (shown at the top of this article) includes “more complete and improved messaging on eligibility and links to relevant support articles that include potential remediation steps.” Of course the PC Health Check app means little if enthusiasts can still install a standalone Windows 11 ISO file on hardware that the PC Health Check app would seem to reject.

We know that those users who own older PCs should be able to run Windows 11 eventually. But did Microsoft really clear up any of the issues surrounding Windows 11 on Friday? We’d say no. It certainly could have by spelling out the details in an official statement. But by releasing information privately to four publications—each of which reported the issue slightly differently—Microsoft simply confused the Windows 11 issue even further.

But with so many caveats the Surface Duo is not a phone/tablet anyone in their right mind would recommend as a main device.

If however you're really into the cloud gaming aspect of Xbox Game Pass the Surface Duo is one of the best phones for that. The reason being that in games with touch controls enabled the second screen can act as a touchpad turning the Surface Duo into a Nintendo DS-like gadget.

There are just two problems. The first being that it requires actually using a Surface Duo in any capacity (any amount of money is too much for this thing) and the second being that not all games that work on the Android version of Game Pass support touch controls. Many still require an external controller something I think Microsoft should have improved by this point. You're therefore left in a worse spot than if you just used a controller.

I used the Surface Duo as my exclusive Game Pass device for a couple of weeks — I couldn't wait to go back to a regular phone. Here are my thoughts.

Using the Surface Duo for Game Pass

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

I like to play Game Pass games on my phone mostly Maneater and NieR: Automata. The latter works with the Surface Duo's secondary screen setup as do several others like Hades. But you're nonetheless limited notably in shooters like Halo: The Master Chief Collection Destiny 2 and even Halo 5.

Even if those were supported I think I'd have trouble adjusting to touch controls in those fast-paced moments. The benefit of a physical medium like a controller or keyboard is the tactile response to input. There's no such thing on the touch controls for Game Pass games.

It also doesn't help that the layout on the Surface Duo's second screen is different for each game. Hopping between NieR: Automata and Hades for example required re-learning the whole control scheme. It baffled me that Microsoft has not instituted a universal input layout for Game Pass on Android. It's downright disappointing.

At the end of the couple of weeks I spent with the Surface Duo I was itching to go back to a traditional smartphone with a controller. Part of that had to do with the tactility thing but also for ergonomics — holding the Surface Duo like a DS and reaching for the buttons can be quite tiring if you're even able to hit them all.

The problems with the Surface Duo

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As cool as this whole dual-screen thing is it doesn't take away from the fact that the Microsoft Surface Duo just sucks at almost everything a phone/tablet should do.

Hell it doesn't even have Android 11 yet and Android 12 is right around the corner. This is a botched attempt by Microsoft to get into the Android space after the failure that was Windows Phone. I know some of you fans of Microsoft's dead mobile OS might hate me for that but I used it and it was never good. I digress.

But some might argue that the Surface Duo is meant to be more of a tablet than a phone and I'd agree. But when you look at something like the Galaxy Z Fold 3 which is both a phone and a tablet you start to wonder where in the world the Surface Duo fits in. The Fold 3 is far more pocketable than than Microsoft's device too.

The Surface Duo has little going in its favor. From underwhelming performance to no 5G and a bad camera it fails to make a case for itself. It still has glitches and oddities so long after its release and it was far too expensive when it launched.

Outlook: Wait for Surface Duo 2?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

I don't think anyone should buy a smartphone or tablet for one purpose only — that's just an poor use of money for most people. As it stands right now the Surface Duo is a one trick pony offering the best Game Pass experience for the titles that support touch controls.

But if you spring for something like the Razer Kishi you can turn the best Android phones into powerful Game Pass devices. They'll also be better at most other tasks too like being phones.

I think the Surface Duo is neat and I appreciate Microsoft trying something new. But novelty alone does not make a good device and the Surface Duo is far from a good device.

While the relationship between the deaths and the shots is currently unclear the health ministry will swiftly conduct the investigations together with external experts health minister Norihisa Tamura said during an NHK program on Sunday.

""(The) investigation is still ongoing but we will quickly disclose what we find out"" Tamura said. ""We would like the experts to examine under what circumstances the deaths occurred and whether there were any causal relations"" with the vaccine he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWNfMi1wZW9wbGUtZGllLWphcGFuLWFmdGVyLW1vZGVybmEtc2hvdHMtdGFpbnRlZC1iYXRjaC82MjEwMDg0Lmh0bWzSAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWNfMi1wZW9wbGUtZGllLWphcGFuLWFmdGVyLW1vZGVybmEtc2hvdHMtdGFpbnRlZC1iYXRjaC82MjEwMDg0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 People Die in Japan After Moderna Shots From Tainted Batch,"Japan's health ministry said Saturday that two people in their 30s have died days after receiving their second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine shot.



Officials say the shots used came from supplies that were suspended Thursday following the discovery of contaminants. The ministry said the cause of the deaths which occurred earlier this month is under investigation.



The Japanese government and Moderna had said earlier that no issues had been identified with the suspended vaccine and the suspension was a precautionary measure.



In India authorities reported more than 46700 new coronavirus infections the highest number of cases in nearly two months a surge that occurred after a festival in the southern state of Kerala.



Total COVID-19 cases in the country rose to nearly 32.7 million and deaths increased by 500 in the 24-hour period prior to Saturday afternoon to 437370 according to Indian government data.



India has the world’s second largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths after the U.S.



More than 10 million vaccine doses were administered in 24 hours prior to Saturday afternoon a record that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a ""momentous feat.""



In the United State officials in charge of handling the COVID-19 pandemic say that half of adolescents ages 12 to 17 have received at least their first dose of a vaccine.



Speaking to reporters at a Friday briefing White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said “We have now hit a major milestone. This is critical progress as millions of kids head back to school.”



Zients said that teenagers are being vaccinated at a faster pace than other age groups.



Among the larger American population 61% or nearly 203 million people have received at least one shot of coronavirus vaccine. Vaccines are not yet authorized for children under 12.

Speaking Friday at a Senate hearing on the 2022 budget Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said hospitalizations have increased with a rising toll of COVID-19 among children.



She said that in order to protect children until they meet eligibility criteria to be vaccinated adults around them should be vaccinated “to effectively shield them.”

Walensky said surges and outbreaks have occurred in places that are not implementing CDC guidelines for schools to protect children from the transmission of the coronavirus.



Meanwhile a new report published in the medical journal The Lancet says the symptoms that linger after a person has survived the coronavirus are little understood by the medical community.



The report says the syndrome known as “long haul COVID-19” must be studied and understood in order to launch an appropriate response for what the journal calls “a modern medical challenge of the first order.”



The Lancet article said recovery can take more than a year. The lingering symptoms include “persistent fatigue breathlessness brain fog and depression.”



The report says finding answers to the mystery of long haul COVID-19 “while providing compassionate and multidisciplinary care will require the full breadth of scientific and medical ingenuity.”



Elsewhere in the world New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Friday the government will ease its nationwide COVID-19 lockdown while the nation’s largest city Auckland the epicenter of the latest outbreak will remain closed for two more weeks.

At a news briefing Ardern said that beginning August 31 most of the country will move to a level-three shut down which allows businesses to fill online orders and do takeout services. Bars and restaurants remain closed except for takeaways.



Ardern said Auckland will remain under alert level 4 which requires all schools offices and all businesses to be closed with only essential services operational. Before this latest lockdown the nation’s last stay-at-home orders were lifted in March.



The government took the measures to stop the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. New Zealand’s health service reported 70 new cases on Friday bringing the total number of infections during this outbreak which began this month to 347.



New Zealand has been a global leader in effectively controlling the spread of COVID-19.

According to the ministry the two men aged 30 and 38 died within days of receiving the second injection on August 22 and 15 respectively and no foreign matter was found in either of the vials of vaccine used on the two men the Xinhua news agency reported.

It remains unknown whether there is a causal relationship between the vaccination and their deaths the ministry said adding that neither of them had an underlying medical condition or a history of allergic reactions.

Japan's health ministry said Thursday that foreign substances have been found in 39 unused vials at eight vaccination sites in five prefectures. The same day about 1.63 million doses that came from the same production line of a Spanish factory were suspended to use as a precaution.

However more than 500000 shots have already been administered from the potentially contaminated batches said Taro Kono the Japanese minister in charge of the vaccination effort.

Although the foreign substances had been confirmed since August 16 the Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. which is in charge of the sale and distribution of the Moderna vaccine in Japan waited until Wednesday to report the problem to the ministry.

Moderna and Takeda said in a joint statement Saturday that they were working with the health ministry to investigate the two deaths.

The two companies said that at this time they did not find any evidence that these deaths were caused by the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

He will serve on the board’s science and technology committee.

Zaks 56 has been serving as Moderna’s CMO since 2015. He announced his departure from the company earlier this year and will continue to serve as a special advisor to Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel until September.

He was replaced by former Johnson & Johnson executive Dr. Paul Burton.

Zak’s salary will be the same as other non-executive directors as declared to the US Securities and Exchange Committee in April 2020.

The Israeli scientist who graduated from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev still has family in Israel including his elderly mother who lives in Ra’anana.

He played a strategic role in securing Israel’s original contract with Moderna for two million vaccine doses which it later expanded to six million after the company applied for emergency use authorization from the US Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency which it subsequently received. In April Israel purchased another 17 million doses from the company.

Zaks told The Jerusalem Post last year before Moderna had completed its clinical trials “The pressure is coming from within” and that he took the success or failure of the vaccine personally.

“We are all affected by it” he said. “I take this responsibility deeply and personally.”

On Wednesday Moderna announced that it had applied for full FDA approval."

DG ECHO and the Canadian Government contributed to replenishing the DREF for this operation. On behalf of the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) the IFRC would like to extend gratitude to all for their generous contributions.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

Senegal experienced heavy rainfall during the rainy season of 2020 exceeding the average amounts usually experienced during that period. In early September 2020 all regions of Senegal recorded excess rainfall compared to the normal ranging from 100mm to 1900 mm depending on the geographic area. The regions of Dakar and Thiès recorded 800 mm of rainfall mainly in the suburbs and the department of Dakar as well as several departments of Thiès causing flooding and the displacement of more than 3300 people. The Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) teams conducted field assessments that revealed a critical situation for 16798 affected people (5879 men and 10919 women). Following the announcement of the Ministry of the Interior declaring the triggering of the ORSEC Plan disaster relief efforts were initiated by the state services local authorities and other actors including the Red Cross but the scale of the disaster far exceeded the resources mobilized.

Based on the needs and capacity of the SRCS to respond to the situation the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) through the Sahel Country Cluster Delegation launched a DREF Operation on 12 September 2020 for CHF 331410 to address the urgent needs of 8100 people or 900 households most affected by the floods in the following targeted regions: Dakar region (departments of Dakar Guediawaye Pikine and Rufisque) and Thies Region ( department of Dakar). The operation was initially to take four months. However in January 2021 the National Society requested a two-month no cost timeframe extension which was granted. This was as a result of the implementation of cash related activities which was delayed due to the delay in signing the agreement with the Financial Service Provider (FSP). Additional information is available in the DREF Operation Update.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90dmFuZHNob3diaXovMTU5NzQ0MjEvc2FpcmEta2hhbi1odXNiYW5kLXN0ZXZlLWh5ZGUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3R2YW5kc2hvd2Jpei8xNTk3NDQyMS9zYWlyYS1raGFuLWh1c2JhbmQtc3RldmUtaHlkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is Saira Khan’s husband Steve Hyde?...,"ALL set to appear in the newest series of Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins Saira Khan can count on her husband Steve's support.

Morgan Stanley forecasts space industry to reach $1 trillion by 2040



This article is the first in a series of stories highlighting the emergence of the private space industry in which companies are helping the sector take a major leap. ― ED



By Kim Hyun-bin



The competition in the global space industry is heating up with billionaire moguls making dramatic moves to spearhead the advancement of commercial space travel.



The commercialization of the space industry by the private sector is gaining momentum quickly resulting in renewed interest in the public sector as well contrary to major space projects in the past which were led and run by governments only.



The recent voyages into space of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) have attracted much public attention to the billionaires' hopes to commercialize space travel.



The industry has the potential for exponential growth in diverse sectors including faster world travel via space orbiting hotels the establishment of bases on the moon and the colonization of other planets in the future.







The current leader of the pack is SpaceX founded by Elon Musk in 2002 which aims to reduce space transportation costs and enable the colonization of Mars by 2050. The company is focused on long-distance space travel and has developed the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles rocket engines and Starlink communications satellites in part to speed up its efforts in this area.



As a private company SpaceX has is the first to fund a liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit the first to reuse an orbital rocket and the first to send private astronauts into orbit and to the International Space Station (ISS).



Musk has expressed his interest in developing the SpaceX Starship system which includes a family of spacecraft ground support infrastructure and a super-heavy booster that can lift 150 tons of orbital payload and up to 100 people all of which is fully reusable solving what Musk says is an ""insanely hard problem.""



SpaceX will be ready to launch its Starship with the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket in a few weeks and plans to send four civilians to visit the ISS for a couple of days by the first half of 2022.



According to Morgan Stanley these efforts to develop reusable rockets will become a major turning point in boosting future developments in the industry.



""We think of reusable rockets as an elevator to low Earth orbit (LEO)"" Adam Jonas a Morgan Stanley equity analyst said in the company's report. ""Just as further innovation in elevator construction was required before today's skyscrapers could dot the skyline so too will opportunities in space mature because of access and falling launch costs.""



Blue Origin founded by former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is also speeding up development to commercialize space travel through reusable rockets. Unlike SpaceX which aims for the colonization of Mars Bezos aims to colonize the Moon.



On July 20 Bezos and his brother Mark 82-year-old aviation pioneer Wally Funk and an 18-year-old Dutch student named Oliver Daemen experienced suborbital space for four minutes while another flight is scheduled to take place on Aug. 26.



Virgin Group founder Richard Branson established Virgin Galactic in 2004. The company differs from SpaceX and Blue Origin in that it uses an airplane-like rocket ship to travel to space. Virgin Group is the umbrella company that many of Richard Branson's Virgin-branded ventures are under.



The company's suborbital spacecraft is air-launched beneath a carrier airplane called ""White Knight Two"" which ignites 15km in the air to reach 90km above sea level so as to experience microgravity for a few minutes before gliding back to base. The company is charging $450000 per flight but plans to reduce the price to $40000 within 10 years in order to commercialize space travel.



Private companies have also been developing space technologies for manned landings on the moon as well as airplane-borne rocket launchers that could place small satellites into orbit at far lower costs and with greater responsiveness than ground-based systems.

""We can't entirely dismiss the risks including the Delta variant supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures—particularly wages. But we expect corporate America's efficiency and the strength of the reopening to continue to power earnings ahead and lead to additional gains for stocks over the rest of 2021"" Ryan Detrick chief market strategist for LPL Financial said in a note to clients on Monday. Stocks appeared to get another boost last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Friday that bond tapering could start this year but the central bank is in no rush to hike interest rates. Based on statements from other Fed officials a tapering announcement could come as soon as the Fed's Sept. 21-22 meeting. Powell said the central bank has ""much ground to cover"" to reach its other goal of maximum employment."

In response some Wall Street players now are offering exchange traded funds (ETFs) that exclude left-wing companies taking a page from the activist playbook that created investment programs to boycott enterprises deemed environmentally unfriendly.

A pair of investment programs that launched in the last year — the American Conservative Values ETF and the 2ndVote Advisers ETF — are led by directors who seek companies that have not launched ad campaigns or issued bulletins that they think prioritize liberal politics more than profits.

In the process the ETFs seek to influence not only the behavior of investors but also of company directors.

“I sometimes say this real slow when talking to professional economists but we believe the companies that focus on their profits will be better investments than those that focus on social justice” said Andy Puzder a director of 2ndVote Advisers.

On Friday the American Conservative Values ETF said it had dumped shares in several companies that have recently embraced critical race theory in seminars and training according to investigative reports by Christopher Rufo a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

“Recent actions by Bank of America Corp. Lowe’s Co. Inc. American Express Co. and Nasdaq Inc. have caused considerable concern and outrage among politically conservative investors” the American Conservative Values said in a statement adding that it would encourage investors to boycott those companies.

William Flaig CEO of the American Conservative Values ETF said reports of left-wing-mandated training at those companies required the fund to dump shares during one of its rebalancing periods.

“In light of news that these companies have instituted employee training based on critical race theory which teaches that America is an inherently racist and evil country we cannot in good faith continue investments into these with our investors’ money” Mr. Flaig said.

Similarly focused investment vehicles have existed for some time such as Ave Maria Mutual Funds which seeks to direct investor money to companies that hold true to Roman Catholic values.

The new stock portfolios seek to combat not only what company directors may say or do but also what increasingly powerful asset managers may direct a company to do.

So far the 2ndVote Advisers’ Life Fund and its ESG Neutral Fund are beating the S&P 500 year-to-date average with the latter returning 27.1% in 2021 according to the fund. (ESG is shorthand invented by leftist investors for judging a company’s “environmental social and corporate governance.”)

The American Conservative Values ETF meanwhile is “seeking to boycott ownership of companies that are most hostile to conservative values” Mr. Flaig said.

Since its inception in November the American Conservative Values ETF has seen returns of 38.57% according to its prospectus.

At the moment the heaviest weighted stocks in 2ndVote Advisers’ ESG Neutral Fund are Fortune 500 companies like agribusiness Mosaic Co. Brighthouse Financial annuities and travel tech firm Sabre.

Some Silicon Valley stocks also may be included as their returns have been too soaring for investors to ignore even if the conservative managers bristle at censorship by Twitter or Facebook.

“FAANG [Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and Google] can’t be ignored” Mr. Flaig said.

There is no purity in the process of weeding out left-wing firms the directors of the funds told The Washington Times noting that companies are not all liberal or all conservative and fund managers have to maintain some flexibility.

“Recall that many of our holdings are liberal companies there is only so much advocacy we can do and still confidently deliver predictable large-cap returns” Mr. Flaig said.

Recent corporate activity seems to shrink the available pool of conservative investments. Stories of Verizon Raytheon and others mandating critical race theory seminars for executives and staff reflect a commitment to a leftist outlook the directors said.

“Coke Delta Disney Nike Blackrock” said Mr. Flaig rattling off a list of flagship American brands that have established left-wing policies in recent months. “You can see there a suppression of First Amendment rights and a hostility to conservative values.”

Dan Grant CEO of 2ndVote Advisers said it takes a kind of aggressive posturing against conservative ideas to land a company on the fund’s “no-buy” list.

2ndVote Advisers derives its name from the idea of what people do with their money represents their second choice after the one they make in voting as well as expresses support for the Second Amendment.

The ETF weighs six factors to rank companies from 1 (most liberal) to 5 (most conservative). Not one company among the thousands tested has scored a 5 across the board and the highest overall scores were a handful of 4s.

Nearly three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 1500 — 73% — graded out with a score of 1 or 2 and 27% earned a 3 according to Mr. Grant.

Ratings are subject to change as the American Conservative Values ETF’s Friday announcement showed.

“We try to stay on top of the news cycle” Mr. Flaig said.

However he noted that the news cycle could be misleading. Statements from company executives do not automatically earn a disinvestment because often such statements amount to something of a PR stunt and a closer look at the company’s balance sheet and bottom line might reflect less political posturing Mr. Flaig said.

Last week U.S. authorities announced an investigation into Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm which regulators in the Biden administration believe used ESG statements as publicity more than investment guidelines.

Even Tariq Fancy who invented the ESG concept while running “sustainable investing” at the BlackRock investment management company has acknowledged that actually running a company along “green” lines as opposed to just talking about doing so are two completely different things.

“In truth sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype PR spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community” Mr. Fancy wrote in a USA Today op-ed in March.

All that language has proved profitable for asset managers however as millions have poured into ESG funds which doubled in 2020.

The divide between what a company says and what it does may strike ESG supporters and regulators examining Deutsche Bank as a drawback but for the conservative funds managers it is a plus. Even Mr. Fancy noted that “to advance real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.”

Managers at 2ndVote Advisers and American Conservative Values say that investors like BlackRock have been able to boost liberal politics more than profits in some companies via the huge positions they have acquired in those firms.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink isn’t shy about this. In a recent letter to investors he noted BlackRock’s commitment to having companies it backs “carbon neutral” by 2050 a goal he acknowledged would require a “transformation” of the U.S. economy as it is wrenched away from cheap reliable energy sources.

“Transform the U.S. economy?” American Conservative Values’ Mr. Puzder said. “Larry Fink has a radical environmental agenda but who the hell elected Larry Fink to transform the U.S. economy?”

Investors voting large blocs of shares have reshaped corporate boardrooms but what the new conservative-based funds seek to do is reimpose balance according to Mr. Grant.

“If you treat everybody fairly you’ll score just fine” he said of 2ndVote’s investing metrics. “The question we ask is Is a company actively trying to restrict what the right is doing? What we don’t want is investment in companies that declare ‘We’re not being neutral; we are opposed to half the country.’”

“If you’re fair if you’re not prohibiting free speech or only matching employee donations to liberally approved charities or retaliating against employees who exercise their rights then there’s no problem” Mr. Grant said. “If you treat everybody fairly you’ll score just fine.”

Celebrity chef Chantel Dartnall is living the dream in a French fairy-tale castle soon to be the new Restaurant Mosaic.

Chef Chantel Dartnall is no stranger to South Africa’s culinary world having received multiple international awards for her inspiring art with food at the renowned Restaurant Mosaic at The Orient which closed its doors on 28 March.

She has since moved to France with her family and they have bought a château which will soon be home to the new Restaurant Mosaic. The project which she says may take up to five years is certainly an extensive one but also one that will be worth writing home about.

In May the much-loved South African chef took to Instagram sharing her love for a freshly baked French baguette from her favourite Boulangerie.

“It is wonderful to be back” she said.

Soon after that she shared a post of her at a French market saying she is already experimenting again.

Early in June the celebrity chef shared a photo of a 1196 Château des Tesnières captioning it: “This is where our story will continue and our new chapter will start…”

The family have recently met with the creative team including architects interior designers and contractors who will be joining them on their château journey.

Since her return to France Dartnall has been experimenting and cooking up a storm in her new home’s kitchen.

Think of a decadent French classic of sautéed wild mushrooms caramelised lamb brains and sweet mustard sauce. Or pan-fried sole with wild asparagus and a delicate fine herb beurre blanc served with a 2018 Meursault from Thierry et Pascale Matrot.

First 3 numbers will be the same [gateway should end with 1]

For the rest enter any number between 1 to 255.

You may also make use of Google DNS which values 8.8.8.8 and DNS 2 which you can set to 8.8.4.4.

Reset the Smartphone Network to Fix Wi-Fi Limited Connectivity

The last of all methods you can try is to reset the network of your smartphone. It will take the setup back to the initial state when the internet setting was first introduced to the device after you put the SIM card in it.

Academic research shows that a very simple sort of the market by a profitability metric known as return on equity (ROE) has delivered strong long-term returns. The return spread between the highest and lowest ROE companies has been approximately 4% a year going back almost 60 years.

Looking over more recent history we see over the last 15 years that high-ROE stocks have even expanded their lead over low and negative ROE stocks. But over the last year there has been a large “junk rally” taking place with the market propelled by firms with negative ROE or the lowest ROE.

WisdomTree believes fundamentals are going to start to matter again as we get later into the bull market cycle and have a return to the longer-term trends of profitability and ROE driving performance.

WisdomTree launched a family of quality Indexes in 2013 that shifts the weight to high-ROE stocks—as well as stocks with low leverage and positive expected earnings growth trends. It manages valuations of this basket by incorporating a rebalancing process back to dividends and the underlying cash flows once a year.

The following table shows the weight to the various ROE quintiles across the U.S. developed international and global ex-U.S. quality Indexes.

While the U.S. market sees more than 75% of its weight in the two highest ROE quintiles—a full 24 points higher than the S&P 500—the international versions of the strategy see 87% and 94% of their weight allocated to the top two quintiles essentially doubling the weight of the international MSCI benchmarks. International stocks have a reputation of being cheaper than U.S. markets for good reason. That is because they tend to have lower profitability and lower growth prospects. The MSCI EAFE Index for instance has an ROE of just 8.8% while the S&P 500 has 15.6% ROE.

Yet when you employ a quality discipline in these foreign markets you can get ROEs at significant premiums even to U.S. markets while retaining a valuation discount. Overall we believe that there is an opportunity in the current quality market that should not be overlooked. Markets may have dislocated from longer-term quality trends over the past year but we think they’ll restore their preference for higher-quality companies soon.

AUSTRALIA

The Australian Catholic Superannuation and NGS Super have scuppered their plans for a merger after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) expressed disapproval for tie-ups between small funds.

Apra deputy chair Helen Rowell had said in May that funds with less than A$30 billion assets under management were uncompetitive and that small funds should merge with larger ones.

The merger of NGS and Australian Catholic would have created a A$23 billion fund. The funds cited regulatory and commercial environmental changes as reasons for the cancelled merger.

An NGS spokesperson also said the Your Future Your Super reforms had also contributed to the decision.

Two-fifths of superannuation funds are likely to fail the Your Future Your Super performance test due to high fees and lacklustre returns an analysis by Super Consumers Australia has found.

Its findings were based on a sample of 42 super funds’ member outcomes assessments which supers are required to publish.

Every fund gave itself a passing grade but the consumer body found that the assessments were difficult to find on 69% of the funds’ websites that 69% of funds made up their own target investment return metric and 48% identified ways to improve the quality of their products.

Apra will release the results of the MySuper performance test on Tuesday revealing the country’s worst-performing funds.

MALAYSIA

Malaysia’s Employees Provident Fund (EPF) could see net withdrawals this year as Covid-19-related special withdrawals have already reached RM84 billion – more than the RM78.4 billion in gross contributions received by the provident fund for the whole of 2020.

However EPF chief strategy officer Nurhisham Hussein told reporters on Aug 6 that even though the fund anticipated an outflow of RM117 billion from Covid-19-related allowances in 2020 and 2021 the fund did not expect returns to members to be affected.

Nurhisham reportedly said the impact of the withdrawals was the need to carry more cash but the amount was marginal in relation to the fund’s portfolio returns.

EPF hit its highest quarterly returns in 17 quarters in Q1 after reporting RM19.29 billion gross investment income (RM19.24 billion net).

Here’s a few options...,"Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (VGS/ASX) This one buys you a slice of 1505 companies worldwide (excluding Australian companies) of which about 68 per cent are US-based including Apple Microsoft Amazon Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. In technical terms the fund seeks to emulate the returns of the MSCI World ex-Australia Index. MSCI is a US finance and analytics company (formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International) which makes indexes to track things. VGS comes with an annual management fee of 0.18 per cent which is higher than ETFs that track the ASX 200 Index (0.07 to 0.13 per cent) but low compared to actively managed ETFs. “It’s a wonderful relatively low-cost way to get access to the rest of the developed world’s stock markets including the US Canada UK Japan France and Switzerland” says Scott Phillips chief investment officer at The Motley Fool.

“In one fell swoop you have effective part-ownership in companies such as Tesla Nestle Sony AstraZeneca and about 1500 others; high-quality businesses that are worth owning in their own right while also providing industry geographic and currency diversification.” SPDR S&P World ex-Australia ETF (WXOZ/ASX) This provides you with exposure to more than 1500 of the biggest global companies. It is managed by State Street Global Advisors and seeks to replicate the returns of a benchmark called the S&P Developed ex-Australia Large-MidCap (AUD) Index which represents about 85 per cent of the total market capitalisation of global developed markets. It comes with a slightly higher management fee of 0.3 per cent.

iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO/ASX) This tracks the companies in the S&P Global 100 index which the BlackRock website describes as the “100 multinational blue-chip companies of major importance in global equity markets”. iShares is owned by BlackRock the largest indexed fund issuer in the world. It has a higher management fee at 0.4 per cent but despite this is the preferred global shares ETF of Stockspot founder Chris Brycki who invests his clients’ money into it plus an emerging markets ETF to get full international exposure. Brycki says IOO’s performance over the past five to six years has beaten that of broader indexed international shares ETFs. Why? Because larger companies (particularly in the US) have tended to outperform.

“In an environment where small caps do better then some of these more broad-based ones will do better” he says. For exposure to a wider range of emerging economies such as China and India Brycki says an IOO investment can be complemented with an emerging markets ETF such as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF and Vanguard’s Emerging Markets Shares Index Fund. It is worth noting that no international shares pay you “franked” dividends like Aussie shares. However that must be weighed against the benefits of diversification. Brycki also notes that dividends have become a less important source of total returns in recent years – both here and abroad. It is also worth noting that the three ETFs I have described – VGS WXOZ and IOO – are all unhedged against currency moves. That means your investment returns will be impacted by movements in the Australian dollar relative to other currencies. However that is not necessarily such a bad thing explains Morningstar’s Matt Wilkinson.

“Unhedged will likely cushion returns over the long term because the AUD/USD often move in the same direction to global growth” he says. All three ETFs are also Australian domiciled meaning you only have to deal with the Australian tax system when investing. Loading If you don’t mind some extra paperwork and exposing yourself to the US tax system you can also invest in some ultra-low-cost US-domiciled ETFs listed on our exchange. For example you could buy ASX-listed iShares S&P 500 ETF AUD (IVV/ASX) which tracks the benchmark S&P 500 Index for an ultra-low management fee of just 0.04 per cent. You could add in exposure to the rest of the world by also buying the Vanguard All-World ex-US Shares Index ETF AUD (VEU/ASX) which tracks the MSCI All World ex-US Index for a management fee of just 0.09 per cent. The good news is that in 2018 IVV changed to be solely domiciled in Australia meaning no US tax paperwork. However buying into VEU will require you to fill in a ”W-8BEN” tax form for the US Internal Revenue Service every three years*.",,,

Investors have come to expect outstanding growth from the chipmaker quarter after quarter due to the tailwinds in the video gaming and data center markets its two largest segments.

The good part is that the company didn't disappoint when it released its fiscal 2022 second-quarter results recently. Nvidia crushed Wall Street's expectations. It reported robust growth in revenue and earnings and set forth solid guidance that exceeded analysts' estimates. The company's Q2 revenue shot up 68% year over year to a record $6.51 billion while adjusted earnings surged 89% to $1.04 per share.

Nvidia expects $6.8 billion in revenue this quarter which would translate into a 44% year-over-year increase. However don't be surprised to see Nvidia exceed expectations once again thanks to favorable business conditions and the company's dominant position in the video gaming and data center markets which could help the stock deliver more upside over the long run.

Let's look at the reasons why Nvidia can sustain its high pace of growth in the long run and why it remains a solid bet for anyone looking to add a top growth stock to their portfolio.

Nvidia's two biggest businesses are built for long-term growth

Nvidia's outstanding performance last quarter was driven by an 85% year-over-year increase in the company's gaming revenue which came in at a record $3.06 billion. The segment produced 47% of Nvidia's total revenue in part because of the ""exceptionally strong"" demand for its Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs).

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the earnings conference call that GPU demand continues to outpace supply. This is impressive considering that graphics cards based on the Ampere GPUs have been on sale for over a year now. More importantly Nvidia noted that only 20% of its installed base has upgraded to an RTX series card. So the majority of Nvidia customers are still using cards running on older architectures such as Pascal which was introduced over five years ago.

So the upgrade cycle that Nvidia's Ampere GPUs have triggered is set to continue especially considering that more games now have features like ray tracing which can only be experienced on RTX series cards. Additionally the growing population of video gamers is also turning out to be a tailwind for Nvidia's gaming business.

The company highlighted that the number of PC gamers has increased by 20% in the past year on the popular game distribution platform Steam. Statista forecast that the number of PC gamers is expected to jump from an estimated 1.75 billion last year to nearly 1.86 billion in 2024. Not surprisingly the high-end PC gaming hardware market is expected to grow at an annual pace of more than 20% through 2024 according to Jon Peddie Research.

Nvidia can win big from this secular growth of the PC gaming hardware market. For instance GPU sales are expected to jump to $54 billion in 2025 from $23.6 billion in 2020 and Nvidia controlled 80% of this space in the first quarter of 2021. All of this indicates that the healthy growth of its gaming business is here to stay for a long time to come.

Meanwhile the data center segment turned in another quarter of outstanding growth with revenue increasing 35% year over year to $2.4 billion. It accounted for 36% of the top line. The business's strong growth was driven by the increasing adoption of its data center chips by hyperscale and cloud computing customers. Those chips have been deployed by the likes of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet's Google.

Nvidia is witnessing growth across diverse niches of the data center market including artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing. The company's inference-related revenue more than doubled year over year thanks to the new A30 GPUs which are four times more powerful than the previous-generation T4 chips.

Additionally Nvidia's GPUs are helping companies deploy AI for real-world use cases. What's more the company says that it is winning share in the data center accelerator market as customers are ""shifting from CPUs to GPUs driven by the stringent performance latency and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workloads.""

Nvidia's data center supremacy can also be judged from the fact that its chips power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers including eight of the top 10. Also 70% of all the new supercomputer systems used Nvidia's chips according to the company's estimates. This dominant position bodes well for Nvidia as the AI chip market is expected to clock 45% annual growth through 2025 according to a third-party estimate.

Nvidia's two major businesses which accounted for 83% of its revenue last quarter have healthy prospects that should help sustain its growth. However additional catalysts are coming into play that investors need to know about.

Don't miss this growth driver

Nvidia's automotive business turned on the heat in fiscal Q2 rising 37% year over year to $152 million. This was impressive considering that the automotive business had lost momentum in recent quarters. However Nvidia is now witnessing an uptick in this space because its winning designs are now moving into the production phase. Management said that its automotive designs could ""drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years.""

As it turns out Nvidia is sitting on $8 billion worth of automotive designs that it expects to translate into revenue over the next six years. Given that the company's automotive design win pipeline swelled with new partnerships last quarter it could generate stronger revenue from this segment in the coming years.So Nvidia could soon count on another growth driver that could accelerate its already strong pace of growth. That's why investors who haven't bought this tech stock yet should consider going long before it flies higher thanks to the multiple catalysts it is sitting on.

However a different type of robot is already available quietly roaming offices around the globe and automating redundant tasks most of us humans despise. These software-based bots known as RPA (robotic process automation) are one of the fastest-growing technologies around at the moment. And according to tech researcher Gartner UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is the leader in this industry. Where will this top robotics stock be in five years?

A brief intro to software bots

When I say ""robots"" perhaps your mind conjures up images of human-like companions like the one Tesla is building. However RPAs are removed from any physical form or ""body"" and confined to a computer or network. That doesn't necessarily reduce the usefulness of this form of robot though.

RPAs offered by platforms like UiPath possess some key functionality. They are trainable meaning a developer can embed code that ""teaches"" them to perform a task. They also integrate with other pieces of software for example a Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Word doc or some other business tool. They also need to be easily deployable allowing a worker (including those with little to no software coding expertise) or developer to set them loose on a defined job. Some platforms like UiPath use advanced machine learning techniques to make them better at more advanced tasks.

All sorts of office work can be handled by RPAs like data entry filling out forms number crunching and voice transcription and translation to name just a few. Think of RPAs as virtual office assistants that dwell on your computer or device.

RPAs could be really important to the economy

Some might immediately fear that just as technology has automated away certain laborer jobs technology is coming for thought workers (or white collar workers) next. Perhaps to a certain extent it is.

As with all technological advancements we will have to endure a transition period in which displaced systems and those that were assigned to work with them find new places in the economy. But something interesting has happened in the wake of the pandemic: Many businesses are reporting worker shortages oftentimes for positions requiring highly redundant work.

Debate is still raging as to the cause. Some cite extended unemployment benefits as a reason but I think a flood of self-employment -- hastened by online software firms like Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) Fiverr (NYSE: FVRR) and Wix.com (NASDAQ: WIX) that make it easier than ever to start your own business -- are a big reason why. As proof I cite research from the U.S. Census Bureau that shows a massive spike in monthly new business starts numbering in the tens of thousands every month since last spring.

Long story short now that workers possess new employment options like never before I don't foresee a labor shortage in some areas of the economy getting better anytime soon. RPA platforms like UiPath could become an increasingly important ""hiring agency"" for many organizations helping them automate those undesirable jobs no one wants so they and their employees can focus on higher-order critical thinking work.

UiPath for the ultra-long-term?

As mentioned already UiPath has been named as the leader in RPAs and when it made its public debut early in 2021 it got a valuation to match that leadership. Unfortunately even a stellar first-ever earnings report as a public concern hasn't prevented a 7% slide from that IPO price. Nevertheless as of this writing UiPath is still valued at a market cap of $32 billion -- a whopping 37 times expected full-year 2021 revenue.

At this juncture the steep price tag makes UiPath an investment suitable only for those with ultra-long outlooks -- five years perhaps more. Granted this is a fast-expanding business. Q1 revenue was up 65% from a year ago. However the company's current outlook for 47% full-year 2021 sales growth implies a slowdown is in order.

Not that anything near 47% annual growth is anything to balk at but in the next few years there will be some notable competition in the RPA space. The omnipresent software giant Microsoft has its own RPA platform for example. Given its massive scale and enviable ability to distribute its own digital tools (even if they aren't always best-in-class) the cloud computing giant is a noteworthy rival. The same Gartner report that named UiPath the current leader also shows Automation Anywhere as a top contender as well. The firm is private right now but it could be considering an IPO. A myriad of other software peers have RPA offerings as well.

But let's not take too much away from UiPath's future prospects. RPA is already a sizable behind-the-scenes market worth billions in spending every year and it's rapidly expanding. After its go-public offering UiPath finished April 2021 with $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents and no debt. Bolstering its sales channels and innovating new uses for its software bots will no doubt be top priorities when choosing where to deploy all that capital. RPA is in its nascent stage of development and UiPath's early lead won't be easy to replicate.

Personally I'm in no hurry to buy UiPath shares right this minute (I often wait for one or two earnings reports before dipping my toe in the water on fresh IPO stocks). However RPA and related automation-enabling software could be a really big deal in five years-time. (Sorry Tesla your humanoid robot will have its day later on). There's more than a decent chance UiPath holds onto its lead and is a much bigger business then than it is right at the moment. At the very least keep tabs on this emerging software technologist.

In response some Wall Street players now are offering exchange traded funds (ETFs) that exclude left-wing companies taking a page from the activist playbook that created investment programs to boycott enterprises deemed environmentally unfriendly.

A pair of investment programs that launched in the last year — the American Conservative Values ETF and the 2ndVote Advisers ETF — are led by directors who seek companies that have not launched ad campaigns or issued bulletins that they think prioritize liberal politics more than profits.

In the process the ETFs seek to influence not only the behavior of investors but also of company directors.

“I sometimes say this real slow when talking to professional economists but we believe the companies that focus on their profits will be better investments than those that focus on social justice” said Andy Puzder a director of 2ndVote Advisers.

On Friday the American Conservative Values ETF said it had dumped shares in several companies that have recently embraced critical race theory in seminars and training according to investigative reports by Christopher Rufo a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

“Recent actions by Bank of America Corp. Lowe’s Co. Inc. American Express Co. and Nasdaq Inc. have caused considerable concern and outrage among politically conservative investors” the American Conservative Values said in a statement adding that it would encourage investors to boycott those companies.

William Flaig CEO of the American Conservative Values ETF said reports of left-wing-mandated training at those companies required the fund to dump shares during one of its rebalancing periods.

“In light of news that these companies have instituted employee training based on critical race theory which teaches that America is an inherently racist and evil country we cannot in good faith continue investments into these with our investors’ money” Mr. Flaig said.

Similarly focused investment vehicles have existed for some time such as Ave Maria Mutual Funds which seeks to direct investor money to companies that hold true to Roman Catholic values.

The new stock portfolios seek to combat not only what company directors may say or do but also what increasingly powerful asset managers may direct a company to do.

So far the 2ndVote Advisers’ Life Fund and its ESG Neutral Fund are beating the S&P 500 year-to-date average with the latter returning 27.1% in 2021 according to the fund. (ESG is shorthand invented by leftist investors for judging a company’s “environmental social and corporate governance.”)

The American Conservative Values ETF meanwhile is “seeking to boycott ownership of companies that are most hostile to conservative values” Mr. Flaig said.

Since its inception in November the American Conservative Values ETF has seen returns of 38.57% according to its prospectus.

At the moment the heaviest weighted stocks in 2ndVote Advisers’ ESG Neutral Fund are Fortune 500 companies like agribusiness Mosaic Co. Brighthouse Financial annuities and travel tech firm Sabre.

Some Silicon Valley stocks also may be included as their returns have been too soaring for investors to ignore even if the conservative managers bristle at censorship by Twitter or Facebook.

“FAANG [Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and Google] can’t be ignored” Mr. Flaig said.

There is no purity in the process of weeding out left-wing firms the directors of the funds told The Washington Times noting that companies are not all liberal or all conservative and fund managers have to maintain some flexibility.

“Recall that many of our holdings are liberal companies there is only so much advocacy we can do and still confidently deliver predictable large-cap returns” Mr. Flaig said.

Recent corporate activity seems to shrink the available pool of conservative investments. Stories of Verizon Raytheon and others mandating critical race theory seminars for executives and staff reflect a commitment to a leftist outlook the directors said.

“Coke Delta Disney Nike Blackrock” said Mr. Flaig rattling off a list of flagship American brands that have established left-wing policies in recent months. “You can see there a suppression of First Amendment rights and a hostility to conservative values.”

Dan Grant CEO of 2ndVote Advisers said it takes a kind of aggressive posturing against conservative ideas to land a company on the fund’s “no-buy” list.

2ndVote Advisers derives its name from the idea of what people do with their money represents their second choice after the one they make in voting as well as expresses support for the Second Amendment.

The ETF weighs six factors to rank companies from 1 (most liberal) to 5 (most conservative). Not one company among the thousands tested has scored a 5 across the board and the highest overall scores were a handful of 4s.

Nearly three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 1500 — 73% — graded out with a score of 1 or 2 and 27% earned a 3 according to Mr. Grant.

Ratings are subject to change as the American Conservative Values ETF’s Friday announcement showed.

“We try to stay on top of the news cycle” Mr. Flaig said.

However he noted that the news cycle could be misleading. Statements from company executives do not automatically earn a disinvestment because often such statements amount to something of a PR stunt and a closer look at the company’s balance sheet and bottom line might reflect less political posturing Mr. Flaig said.

Last week U.S. authorities announced an investigation into Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm which regulators in the Biden administration believe used ESG statements as publicity more than investment guidelines.

Even Tariq Fancy who invented the ESG concept while running “sustainable investing” at the BlackRock investment management company has acknowledged that actually running a company along “green” lines as opposed to just talking about doing so are two completely different things.

“In truth sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype PR spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community” Mr. Fancy wrote in a USA Today op-ed in March.

All that language has proved profitable for asset managers however as millions have poured into ESG funds which doubled in 2020.

The divide between what a company says and what it does may strike ESG supporters and regulators examining Deutsche Bank as a drawback but for the conservative funds managers it is a plus. Even Mr. Fancy noted that “to advance real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.”

Managers at 2ndVote Advisers and American Conservative Values say that investors like BlackRock have been able to boost liberal politics more than profits in some companies via the huge positions they have acquired in those firms.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink isn’t shy about this. In a recent letter to investors he noted BlackRock’s commitment to having companies it backs “carbon neutral” by 2050 a goal he acknowledged would require a “transformation” of the U.S. economy as it is wrenched away from cheap reliable energy sources.

“Transform the U.S. economy?” American Conservative Values’ Mr. Puzder said. “Larry Fink has a radical environmental agenda but who the hell elected Larry Fink to transform the U.S. economy?”

Investors voting large blocs of shares have reshaped corporate boardrooms but what the new conservative-based funds seek to do is reimpose balance according to Mr. Grant.

“If you treat everybody fairly you’ll score just fine” he said of 2ndVote’s investing metrics. “The question we ask is Is a company actively trying to restrict what the right is doing? What we don’t want is investment in companies that declare ‘We’re not being neutral; we are opposed to half the country.’”

“If you’re fair if you’re not prohibiting free speech or only matching employee donations to liberally approved charities or retaliating against employees who exercise their rights then there’s no problem” Mr. Grant said. “If you treat everybody fairly you’ll score just fine.”

The “present pandemic situation” was cited as the reason for this major and important decision.

The notice issued by the University’s Registrar Debasis Das said: “In view of the present pandemic situation the university has waived off all fees…. It is not required for the students to pay fees for collecting the mark sheets/grade sheets of different semester examinations.”

The offer of waiver of fees will be applicable to all courses except the self-financed ones. Further it will be valid for all postgraduate students and the students of the undergraduate courses run directly by the university according to Das.

Among the undergraduate courses offered by the University on its campuses are courses in home science engineering and law. The University’s B.Tech student studying in the first semester is expected to pay Rs.5472 and this includes a monthly tuition fee of Rs.500 and a monthly laboratory fee of Rs.100.

The University Vice-Chancellor talking to the media said: “Amid the pandemic family members of students have lost jobs or suffered pay cuts and this has caused severe financial constraints. We want to support students as much as possible during these trying times.”

Meanwhile the Jadavpur University with the aim of helping the student community during the Coronavirus crisis too has made some concessions. The institution has been offering a 25 per cent concession on tuition fees and a 50 per cent discount on laboratory fees.

The tuition fee of the postgraduate course in journalism and mass communication a self-financed course has been reduced from Rs.40000 to Rs.26000 after students had told the authorities of the financial hardships they are facing due to the Coronavirus second wave.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MLex senior correspondent Michael Acton points out the new complaint which arrived Friday night from lawyers appointed to represent consumers (that’s us) in a potential class-action lawsuit that joins the states and Epic Games in accusing Google of abusing its monopoly power and of anti-competitive behavior.

Perhaps most telling is a mention that popular subscription services like Spotify Netflix and Tinder have tried to find ways around Google Play Billing and that 30 percent cut. This is no secret as the direct collection of credit card info by Netflix and Spotify reportedly resulted in Google posting a “clarification” explaining that Play Store apps must use Google’s billing system and giving them a year to change. In this filing the lawyers accuse Google of offering Netflix a “significantly reduced revenue share” with the apparent intention of squashing its desire to use an alternative payments system.

Related The App Store is too big to change

In a statement to The Verge a Google spokeswoman says “All developers are subject to the same policies as all other developers including the payments policy. We’ve long had programs in place that support developers with enhanced resources and investments. These programs are a sign of healthy competition between operating systems and app stores and benefit developers.” Whether that’s a sign of healthy competition is arguable as Google’s efforts largely match those from Apple including cutting the commission on subscriptions by half after a year. However it does go further in offering a 15 percent cut to developers on their first $1 million in revenue.

Google’s standard 30 percent commission is still a major target as the suit cites internal Google figures suggesting the break-even level for revenue sharing is actually about six percent. The complaint quotes Google internal communications that admit setting the “arbitrary fee” at 30 percent has “[n]o rationale other than copying Apple.”

And as far as competition the lawyers cite Google estimates that say even a major player like Samsung could only manage $100 million in revenue for 2019 while the Play Store raked in around $4 billion just from Samsung phones. At the same time Reuters reports that an unsealed filing in the state AGs antitrust case against Google reveals the Play Store brought in $11.2 billion in total in 2019 with $8.5 billion in gross profit and $7 billion in operating income.

Google’s response to the state AGs in June said the Play Store “provides more openness and choice than others” and that on Android “you can choose to download the app from a rival app store or directly from a developer’s website.” However this filing pokes holes in that argument as well pointing out that Google’s OEM agreements with phone manufacturers interfere with making other app stores as easy to access as the Play Store which they must include on a device’s home screen to pre-load Google apps like Gmail and Google Maps.

Image: MLexCONSOLIDATED FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT CASE NO. 3:20-CV-05761-JD - 53

In a timely call-out it cites the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement that forbids developers from using information about customers that they get from the Play Store like email addresses to reach them directly. You can read the relevant section below.

4.9 You will not engage in any activity with Google Play including making Your Products available via Google Play that interferes with disrupts damages or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices servers networks or other properties or services of any third party including but not limited to Google or any Authorized Provider. You may not use user information obtained via Google Play to sell or distribute Products outside of Google Play.

That makes it “impossible for developers to directly reach customers to offer alternatives to Google Play Store” according to the suit. Allowing developers to use information from the App Store to contact customers with emails including information about alternative payment options is one of the small concessions Apple made in its proposed class action settlement earlier this week. However companies like Spotify and Epic say that doesn’t go nearly far enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmFycnljb2xsaW5zLzIwMjEvMDgvMjgvd2hhdC15b3VyLW5ldGZsaXgtZGF0YS1yZXZlYWxzLWFib3V0LXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Your Netflix Data Reveals About You,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/08/28/what-your-netflix-data-reveals-about-you/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmFycnljb2xsaW5zLzIwMjEvMDgvMjgvd2hhdC15b3VyLW5ldGZsaXgtZGF0YS1yZXZlYWxzLWFib3V0LXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvbWFuaWZlc3QtZ2V0cy1hLXNlY29uZC1saWZlLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtd2l0aC1mb3VydGgtc2Vhc29uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Manifest' Gets a Second Life on Netflix With Fourth Season,"Photo: NBC

Netflix made the announcement on Saturday for 828 Day an unofficial holiday for Manifest fans celebrating Flight 828 on August 28. The news comes as a Change.org petition to save the show has surpassed 95000 signatures.

""Since its premiere on Netflix in June Manifest has proven very popular with our members"" Bela Bajaria Netflix Head of Global TV said in a statement. ""Jeff Rake and his team have crafted a beguiling mystery that has viewers around the world on the edge of their seats and believing again in second chances and we're thrilled that they will bring fans some closure with this final super-sized season.""

Manifest stars Melissa Roxburgh Josh Dallas Athena Karkanis J. R. Ramirez Luna Blaise Jack Messina Parveen Kaur Matt Long and Holly Taylor to name a few.

Dallas celebrated the renewal with a message to fans on Instagram.

""'Its all connected.' #manifest flies again on @netflix… because of YOU! #manifesters are a force of nature"" he wrote. ""Can not wait to bring you the rest of this story! ✈️ ""

NBC previously opted not to renew the show for a fourth season even though Rake sold them the series with a six-season plan mapped out according to Deadline.

On behalf of the cast the crew the writers directors and producers thank you to Netflix to Warner Bros. and of course to the fans. You did this.”

The announcement was made at 8:28 a.m. PST on Saturday a play on the show’s fateful Flight 828.

The order marks a remarkable turnaround for the series which aired three seasons on NBC and then was canceled by the network in May. Warner Bros. tried shopping the show but initially to no avail. But the ongoing popularity of earlier seasons on Netflix combined with an active fan campaign on social media helped keep the show alive and a deal was eventually struck.

“Since its premiere on Netflix in June Manifest has proven very popular with our members” said Bela Bajaria Netflix head of global TV. “Jeff Rake and his team have crafted a beguiling mystery that has viewers around the world on the edge of their seats and believing again in second chances and we’re thrilled that they will bring fans some closure with this final super-sized season.”

The deal also includes season three of the series coming to Netflix as well.

Insiders note however that while the new order is called one season for production purposes the episodes might not all be released at the same time — so they might be split into multiple release periods while technically being called one season. Previous seasons ranged from 13 to 16 episodes.

Manifest is about a plane that mysteriously lands years after takeoff and its passengers return to a world that has moved on without them. It stars Melissa Roxburgh Josh Dallas and Athena Karkanis."

Words cannot express how heartbroken we are with this news and we will miss Max tremendously. We are struggling to come to grips with this personal tragedy and prefer to grieve with close family and friends.

Maxton was an awesome young man who was well liked in the community as evidenced by the outpouring of condolences from teachers coaches employers family and friends. He was always proud of being part of a state champion wrestling team and state playoff final four football team two years in a row but he was most proud to be a Navy Corpsman and a ‘devil doc’ for the Marines.

His final words to his mother over FaceTime when he was telling her goodbye was after she told him to be safe were ‘don’t worry mom my guys got me. They won’t let anything happen to me.’ Today she realized that they all just went together.”

Soviak leaves behind 12 brothers and sisters who “are all hurting terribly.”

“As we mourn the loss of our son we also mourn for the loss of the Marines and Soldier who were killed and pray for the speedy recovery of all of those wounded in Afghanistan. As you can imagine this is a very difficult time for our family and we respectfully request that you honor our privacy.”

Australia has won a rare silver medal in Paralympic table tennis thanks to a one-armed naturalised Chinese champion who lost his upper limb in bizarre circumstances.

Ma Lin has emerged as one of Australia’s brightest stars in Tokyo because of his brilliant performances with the paddle and his incredible tale of survival that has endeared him to his new homeland.

Virtually unknown in Australian sporting circles despite being one of the best para table tennis players in the world Ma Lin lost his right arm when he was just five years old when it was bitten off by a brown bear at a zoo in China.

He now calls Australia home and has delivered a medal at his first big international competition after going down to Belgian Laurens Devos in the Class 9 individual men’s final at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

Australia has only ever won two gold medals in Paralympic table tennis – one each in 1964 and 1984 – but still has a great chance with three other Aussies through to gold medal matches in Tokyo.

When he moved to Australia after the 2016 Rio Paralympics Ma Lin brought two of his closest Chinese friends – Yang Qian and Lei Lina – who also happen to be international stars of the sport.

Yang Qian takes on Brazil’s Bruna Alexandre in Class 10 on Monday immediately after Lei Lina faces her former Chinese teammate Guiyan Xiong in Category 9.

And there’s more.

Sam von Einem – who ended Australia’s 32 year drought when he won a silver medal in Rio in 2016 is through to Sunday’s C11 men’s final where he will take on Hungarian world No. 1 Peter Palos.

The South Australian made it through to the gold medal decider after an astonishing comeback against Florian Van Acker the Belgian who beat him in five sets in the Rio final.

Von Einem had lost all of his previous eight matches against van Acker and seemed to be staring at another defeat after dropping the first two sets only to storm back and win the next three.

“I‘m over the moon. To get over van Acker was something that I had been trying to do for so long and now that I’ve done it it’s unbelievable” he said.

“After those two first games I just thought that I had to reset and take one point at the time. I think I did it really well the match finally started to come my way and I got away with the win.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3RoZS1ibG9jay0yMDIxLWVwaXNvZGUtMTMtcmVjYXAtY2hlYXRpbmctc2NhbmRhbC1lcnVwdHMtYXMtbG92ZS1pc2xhbmQtdHdpbnMtd2luLWZvci1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLW1hc3Rlci1iZWRyb29tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Block 2021 episode 13 recap: Cheating scandal erupts as Love Island twins win for controversial master bedroom ...,"Twins Josh and Luke’s first Block room win has been marred by explosive allegations the duo was getting inside help.

Soon after the Love Island stars took the top prize for controversial master bedroom and walk-in wardrobe a furious Ronnie told producers that the brothers had been given a leg-up in the competition.

“Josh and Luke won. I guess it helps to cheat. I mean it helps to know the full schedule of what rooms are coming up and they know when the challenges are coming up” he ranted as Georgia shook her head in disgust.

“That’s a fact. They’ve known since day one.”

It wasn’t the first time the boys’ tactics have raised eyebrows. The arrival of Luke’s fiancé Olivia on the work site also had Ronnie seeing red.

Luke denied his lady love was there to give him extra styling help but the cameras don’t lie and she was soon steering all his furnishing choices proudly exclaiming “sometimes you just need a woman’s touch!”

“If the twins win that Chanel handbag because of the way they styled their room I’m calling a body corporate meeting and I will call bullshit because your fiancé styled your room” Ronnie said.

The boys surreptitious styling assistance didn’t go unnoticed by Mitch and Mark either. Their eyebrows were raised by the twins suddenly improved decor choices.

The Block veterans came a close second to the twins’ room with their small yet impeccably dressed room.

“To me this feels a little tight for a master but it’s a good room and I think they have absolutely made the most of the proportions they are working with” judge Neale Whitaker said of Mitch and Mark’s soft green room.

Mitch was particularly thrilled to hear that Neale wanted him to give him some bed making lessons. High praise when only hours earlier Mitch was sent spiralling into a shopping frenzy by Mark underwhelmed reaction to his monochrome bedding choices.

Within a flash Mitch had returned with an armful of fluffy tan and white pillows to lift the bed from blah to one they hoped would make Neale green with envy.

Green was certainly the colour of the day with Ronnie and Georgia as well as Kirsty and Jesse opting for a similar shade — with varying degrees of success.

Ronnie’ and Georgia’s green feature wall and bedhead was certainly a hit with the judges as were those towering ceilings that have had foreman Keith singing their praises all week.

In a rare display of contrition Keith had also agreed that Georgia was right to be smoking mad no-one had told her the fireplace was needed to hold up the ceiling.

To rectify the problem Keith and Dan agreed to split the cost of having an engineer install a support beam into the roof itself thus alleviating the need for an unsightly post in their living area.

And those high ceilings certainly were a showstopping feature of their house if the judges’ reactions were anything to go by.

“There are moments when wow is not enough. I wish there was something more like OMFG” Neale exclaimed upon catching sight of their soaring ceiling.

“To have gigantic proportions is one thing but to know what to do with it …” Neale added to schoolboy giggles from Darren Palmer who quickly realised the double entendre of saying such a thing in the bedroom of all places.

“What are you two?” Shaynna Blaze admonished of their Benny Hill banter.

Their delight soon turned to dismay when they caught sight of Ronnie and Georgia’s cramped wardrobe which Shaynna felt was “planning gone wrong” to have servicing such a vast bedroom.

Shaynna was equally unimpressed with the wardrobes over at Tanya and Vito’s place (which she said jarred with the colour scheme of the bedroom) and Kirsty and Jesse’s offering which — like Ronnie and Georgia’s design — was too tight for a high-end home.

She saved her highest praise for Luke and Josh’s wardrobe saying it felt like “coming home.” Interestingly despite Keith’s grave warnings all week that they’d be penalised by the judges for their low ceilings the only thing the judges noticed on that score was the impressive skylights.

If anything they felt Josh and Luke had made the best use of space – even though it had come at the expense of having a second car space.

If the judges’ reactions are anything to go by it seems the boys are now in pole position to bag that Chanel purse offered for the best wardrobe styling.

Of course that could well be thanks to them having a secret weapon up their sleeve in the shape of Luke’s fiancé. Little do they know Ronnie is on the case and he is NOT happy.

“Max was a wonderful son who loved his family his community and was proud to serve in the U.S. Navy” his family said in a statement. “He was excited about the opportunities the Navy would offer him and planned to make the Navy a career. We are incredibly proud of his service to our country.

Words cannot express how heartbroken we are with this news and we will miss Max tremendously. We are struggling to come to grips with this personal tragedy and prefer to grieve with close family and friends.

Maxton was an awesome young man who was well liked in the community as evidenced by the outpouring of condolences from teachers coaches employers family and friends. He was always proud of being part of a state champion wrestling team and state playoff final four football team two years in a row but he was most proud to be a Navy Corpsman and a ‘devil doc’ for the Marines.

His final words to his mother over FaceTime when he was telling her goodbye was after she told him to be safe were ‘don’t worry mom my guys got me. They won’t let anything happen to me.’ Today she realized that they all just went together.”

Soviak leaves behind 12 brothers and sisters who “are all hurting terribly.”

“As we mourn the loss of our son we also mourn for the loss of the Marines and Soldier who were killed and pray for the speedy recovery of all of those wounded in Afghanistan. As you can imagine this is a very difficult time for our family and we respectfully request that you honor our privacy.”

Australia has won a rare silver medal in Paralympic table tennis thanks to a one-armed naturalised Chinese champion who lost his upper limb in bizarre circumstances.

Ma Lin has emerged as one of Australia’s brightest stars in Tokyo because of his brilliant performances with the paddle and his incredible tale of survival that has endeared him to his new homeland.

Virtually unknown in Australian sporting circles despite being one of the best para table tennis players in the world Ma Lin lost his right arm when he was just five years old when it was bitten off by a brown bear at a zoo in China.

He now calls Australia home and has delivered a medal at his first big international competition after going down to Belgian Laurens Devos in the Class 9 individual men’s final at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

Australia has only ever won two gold medals in Paralympic table tennis – one each in 1964 and 1984 – but still has a great chance with three other Aussies through to gold medal matches in Tokyo.

When he moved to Australia after the 2016 Rio Paralympics Ma Lin brought two of his closest Chinese friends – Yang Qian and Lei Lina – who also happen to be international stars of the sport.

Yang Qian takes on Brazil’s Bruna Alexandre in Class 10 on Monday immediately after Lei Lina faces her former Chinese teammate Guiyan Xiong in Category 9.

And there’s more.

Sam von Einem – who ended Australia’s 32 year drought when he won a silver medal in Rio in 2016 is through to Sunday’s C11 men’s final where he will take on Hungarian world No. 1 Peter Palos.

The South Australian made it through to the gold medal decider after an astonishing comeback against Florian Van Acker the Belgian who beat him in five sets in the Rio final.

Von Einem had lost all of his previous eight matches against van Acker and seemed to be staring at another defeat after dropping the first two sets only to storm back and win the next three.

“I‘m over the moon. To get over van Acker was something that I had been trying to do for so long and now that I’ve done it it’s unbelievable” he said.

“After those two first games I just thought that I had to reset and take one point at the time. I think I did it really well the match finally started to come my way and I got away with the win.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3RoZS1ibG9jay0yMDIxLWVwaXNvZGUtMTMtcmVjYXAtY2hlYXRpbmctc2NhbmRhbC1lcnVwdHMtYXMtbG92ZS1pc2xhbmQtdHdpbnMtd2luLWZvci1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLW1hc3Rlci1iZWRyb29tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Block 2021 episode 13 recap: Cheating scandal erupts as Love Island twins win for controversial master bedroom ...,"Twins Josh and Luke’s first Block room win has been marred by explosive allegations the duo was getting inside help.

Soon after the Love Island stars took the top prize for controversial master bedroom and walk-in wardrobe a furious Ronnie told producers that the brothers had been given a leg-up in the competition.

‘Insane’ mansion boasts epic garage and nightclub

“Josh and Luke won. I guess it helps to cheat. I mean it helps to know the full schedule of what rooms are coming up and they know when the challenges are coming up” he ranted as Georgia shook her head in disgust.

“That’s a fact. They’ve known since day one.”

It wasn’t the first time the boys’ tactics have raised eyebrows. The arrival of Luke’s fiancé Olivia on the work site also had Ronnie seeing red.

Luke denied his lady love was there to give him extra styling help but the cameras don’t lie and she was soon steering all his furnishing choices proudly exclaiming “sometimes you just need a woman’s touch!”

“If the twins win that Chanel handbag because of the way they styled their room I’m calling a body corporate meeting and I will call bullshit because your fiancé styled your room” Ronnie said.

The boys surreptitious styling assistance didn’t go unnoticed by Mitch and Mark either. Their eyebrows were raised by the twins suddenly improved decor choices.

The Block veterans came a close second to the twins’ room with their small yet impeccably dressed room.

“To me this feels a little tight for a master but it’s a good room and I think they have absolutely made the most of the proportions they are working with” judge Neale Whitaker said of Mitch and Mark’s soft green room.

Mitch was particularly thrilled to hear that Neale wanted him to give him some bed making lessons. High praise when only hours earlier Mitch was sent spiralling into a shopping frenzy by Mark underwhelmed reaction to his monochrome bedding choices.

Within a flash Mitch had returned with an armful of fluffy tan and white pillows to lift the bed from blah to one they hoped would make Neale green with envy.

Green was certainly the colour of the day with Ronnie and Georgia as well as Kirsty and Jesse opting for a similar shade — with varying degrees of success.

Ronnie’ and Georgia’s green feature wall and bedhead was certainly a hit with the judges as were those towering ceilings that have had foreman Keith singing their praises all week.

In a rare display of contrition Keith had also agreed that Georgia was right to be smoking mad no-one had told her the fireplace was needed to hold up the ceiling.

To rectify the problem Keith and Dan agreed to split the cost of having an engineer install a support beam into the roof itself thus alleviating the need for an unsightly post in their living area.

And those high ceilings certainly were a showstopping feature of their house if the judges’ reactions were anything to go by.

“There are moments when wow is not enough. I wish there was something more like OMFG” Neale exclaimed upon catching sight of their soaring ceiling.

“To have gigantic proportions is one thing but to know what to do with it …” Neale added to schoolboy giggles from Darren Palmer who quickly realised the double entendre of saying such a thing in the bedroom of all places.

“What are you two?” Shaynna Blaze admonished of their Benny Hill banter.

Their delight soon turned to dismay when they caught sight of Ronnie and Georgia’s cramped wardrobe which Shaynna felt was “planning gone wrong” to have servicing such a vast bedroom.

Shaynna was equally unimpressed with the wardrobes over at Tanya and Vito’s place (which she said jarred with the colour scheme of the bedroom) and Kirsty and Jesse’s offering which — like Ronnie and Georgia’s design — was too tight for a high-end home.

She saved her highest praise for Luke and Josh’s wardrobe saying it felt like “coming home.” Interestingly despite Keith’s grave warnings all week that they’d be penalised by the judges for their low ceilings the only thing the judges noticed on that score was the impressive skylights.

If anything they felt Josh and Luke had made the best use of space – even though it had come at the expense of having a second car space.

If the judges’ reactions are anything to go by it seems the boys are now in pole position to bag that Chanel purse offered for the best wardrobe styling.

Of course that could well be thanks to them having a secret weapon up their sleeve in the shape of Luke’s fiancé. Little do they know Ronnie is on the case and he is NOT happy.

Though the Plus was ahead of its time when it was released — and frankly still looks quite technical today — Nike Sportswear loves to modernize its classic silhouettes so the Air Max Plus has appeared with a brand-new set of hi-vis reflective details.

Officially dubbed “Black/University Red” the most notable thing about this Air Max Plus is that its signature overlays usually composed of TPE are printed directly onto the upper and coated in hi-vis reflective material. This enables the top half’s base layer to have a one-piece mesh construction and make sure its signature detail shines as brightly as possible.

Apart from this daring dash of reflective regalia this Air Max Plus also boasts small red-trimmed swooshes plus red rope laces with their own flecks of reflective material. Large red stripes that run down the tongue reading “Tuned” on the right foot and “Air” on the left foot. Final pops of detail are supplied by branded badges on the tongue and heel leather mudguards and heel overlays jet black plastic toe caps and black midsoles with tonal Air units.

This hi-vis Nike Air Max Plus is available at Nike Great Brittan now and is priced at £155 GBP (approximately $212 USD). A US release may follow in the coming weeks.

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.

For years now Nike has been reminding us to “Have A Nike Day.” Paired with a Swoosh-emblazoned smiley the slogan has become a big part of the brand’s line-up inspiring many a notable release. And after a very brief hiatus we can expect the theme to return by way of this kid’s Air Force 1.

Though clad primarily in white leather the colorway does well to set itself apart from the “Triple White” GR. The Swoosh and heel tab for example display black cracked leathers matching tonally the lining and tongue. The laces in heavier contrast sport a vivid yellow shade that complements well the counter’s gilded trio of smileys. Finally to round out the entire shoe the tooling is completely made of gum.

Grab a close-up look below via official images. Hopefully we’ll see pairs hit Nike.com and select retailers soon… possibly in sizes outside of PS as well.

See the Junior Geek of the Month archive for more.

Orion Razat is a busy kid.

The newly turned 12-year-old is already an accomplished author who is working on his second book. He’s also an entrepreneur animator public speaker designer and dreamer.

Add Junior Geek of the Month to the list too as the seventh grader has notched that honor for August presented by Northern Trust in recognition of talented young scholars innovators creators and entrepreneurs in the Pacific Northwest.

A jokester in class with a love for science technology engineering and math Orion was inspired by a teacher to combine the two.

“The teacher didn’t exactly like me telling jokes during class” Orion said. “They understood that it was for a good intention so they told me to maybe write all my funny and silly ideas in a book. And then that could be shared at a dedicated time during class.”

The idea turned into a published book called “101 STEM Jokes” a mix of geeky STEM-related puns fun facts and activities for kids.

“I didn’t exactly see that coming” Orion said of becoming a published author selling his book on Amazon.

Orion’s mother Imani Razat said the love for writing and drawing started at a young age when Orion was already developing a knack for storytelling. She gave him blank books from the art store which he filled with narratives about his imaginary friends. He began to bring his homemade books to school to share during “rug time.” In kindergarten he declared himself an author she said.

Orion’s parents encouraged him to animate his imaginations and to share them on YouTube. He learned Adobe After Effects and started a “production company” called Rocketshipsquid. Under the same handle on Instagram Orion just unveiled a new T-shirt design that combines his love of chemistry and ice cream.

Orion’s journey to becoming an author has landed him in various publications including Parent Map STEM Spark blog Red Tricycle and The Week Jr. His animation has been projected at Seattle’s Museum of Museums and he was a winner in the University of Washington’s 2020 Neuroscience for Kids poetry contest.

Orion lived in New York City before his family moved to Seattle four years ago. His dad Kaza Razat works in artificial intelligence and is creating a startup and chatbot geared toward health and wellness. His mom is in school at Johns Hopkins University studying communications.

Orion has a keen interest in transit and city planning. He likes to build in “Minecraft” and “Roblox.”

“It’s a nice way to spend your time creating something instead of just mindlessly staring at videos and dudes dancing on YouTube” Orion said.

During homeschooling lessons with his mom he uses the design program Sketch to make his own custom transit maps making up communities and imagining who has access to transportation and green spaces. Building equitable cities is important as part of his lessons.

And now he’s onto book No. 2.

“I don’t want to spoil too much but it’s like a science fiction novel” he said before giving up a bit more on the project. “The basic premise is that this kid sees a sick whale on the news and he tries to help it. And then he makes a device that allows him to communicate with the whale. The entire world has its eyes on him and the tech he created and then the whale ends up speaking for the oceans at the U.N.”

Orion said the book takes place in the future and will feature robots and high speed trains among other things. He hopes to collaborate with activists and marine biologists to promote the book and its environmental message.

His own outlook for the planet is a mix of excitement and reservation. He thinks the future could be a really big leap for humanity in terms of technology but at the same time 2020 was “crazy enough” he said and the next 20 years could be crazier.

He doesn’t know yet what he wants to be when he grows up but he already understands how he can help.

“I kind of just want to have a lasting impact on how people view climate change and plastic in the oceans” Orion said. “I feel like this book might raise some awareness make some sort of change I hope.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vaW5zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vd2hhdHMtb25lLXRvbnktZmluYXVzLWxlc3NvbnMtZml2ZS1wdXR0L9IBRWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vaW5zdHJ1Y3Rpb24vd2hhdHMtb25lLXRvbnktZmluYXVzLWxlc3NvbnMtZml2ZS1wdXR0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s one of Tony Finau’s favorite lessons?

Tony Finau before Monday had gone five years and 142 tournaments since his first and only victory. And for most if not all of those five years and 142 tournaments he was asked the same question and for most if not all of those five years and 142 tournaments he gave some variation of the same classy answer.

Like this after one of his more painful also-rans a loss in a playoff at the Genesis Invitational in February:

Question: “Obviously you shot a tremendous round today so it’s not like you threw anything away but at what point do you get tired of all of these top-10s and runners-up that keep accumulating even those are positive things?”

Answer: “Yeah it’s bittersweet to be in this position again but I mean I never get tired of playing good golf and that’s what I tell myself every week. It’s like sports is about winning I’ve said that many times. I grew up trying to win every tournament I play every tournament I play; nothing’s changed. But I know at the end of the day you’re going to lose a lot more times than you’re going to win on the PGA Tour. Unfortunately for me that’s come really close in the last few years. But I always challenge myself to play good golf and that’s all I try to do. I’m not a quitter; I’m not someone that’s going to fade away into the sunset because I can’t win in these situations. I had another great shot today. I don’t know what else I can say other than I enjoy playing good golf and one of these days it will happen for me and hopefully turn into kind of a domino effect.”

On and on the exchanges would go. Until it didn’t when on Monday his drought ended with his victory at the Northern Trust. Still it makes one wonder just how Finau answered time and time again.

He had an answer for that too on Wednesday ahead of this week’s BMW Championship.

Question: “Was there ever a moment in terms of learning how to lose with class? Was there ever a teaching moment as a kid?”

Answer: It came on — a five-putt.

“I was playing a high school match my freshman year” Finau said. “I had on the very last hole if I two-putted this hole I would have got into a playoff to win the individual medalist as a freshman which was a big deal playing against this senior in high school.

“I lag it up there from about 40 feet lag it up to about five feet. I go on to lip that one out and then I go to tap it in because I was really frustrated that I had now missed the playoff. I missed that out. I went to tap in — so I ended up five-putting the last green and stomping my feet around the hole just like acting like a child.

“My dad didn’t say a word to me and my dad was my teacher and my hero. But he didn’t say a word to me when I left. I was grumpy. I got into the car. I was really really upset. But just from that silence I understood what that meant to him that that was not how he raised me. That’s not what champions do. That’s not how you act on a golf course. He actually didn’t say anything to me but I was so disappointed in myself that I knew — I said that’s never going to happen again.

“I didn’t want my actions to portray me as a person that is a brat. I’m not that way. That’s not who I am. So that was a teaching moment for me; I was not ever going to do that ever again. Not only was I mad about missing the short putt for potentially winning a tournament but I’m going to deal with my losses take it on the chin and deal with it with class.

“That was a big — again I was a freshman in high school so as you would expect maybe that’s how I should have acted but I felt like I was better than that and my parents taught me better than that.”

Finau two days and one tournament since his second victory sounded much the same as he had for five years and 142 tournaments.

I desperately wanted to find another college football play from today’s slate for this column. Alas it didn’t happen.

My only play on the first day of college football will be my previously placed wager on Nebraska -7 against Illinois. Instead of forcing another pick — UTEP -10 would have been the choice but the double digits just put it a smidge out of reach — I’ll look ahead to Thursday’s slate to find something else.

It’s a long season and action for action’s sake is an approach that will torpedo a bankroll. I can’t have that here especially not after a winless showing last week.

The weekend wagers’ bottom line is still flush however and hopefully football can only help pad it more. Happy football season.

Read below for the weekly five picks spread across five sports. Records are attached individually by sport with the cumulative at the bottom of the page. The monetary figure is calculated by the assumption of a bettor placing a $100 wager on each pick. Any picks outside of the column will be linked and included in the record total. Odds are the best currently available in Las Vegas at publication time.

Golf (17-10 $984.94): Tony Finau -115 vs. Webb Simpson head-to-head in third round of BMW Championship (Circa Sports)

Finau has started slow this week following his breakthrough win at The Northern Trust in the second tournament of the PGA Tour playoffs on Monday but he won't stay down for long. Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills Md. where the BMW is being played is too suited for his strengths. It's awarded bombers off the tee all week and Finau is too good in that area to not take advantage. This would usually be a fair price on this matchup but not in this case. Simpson is more iron-driven a skillset not as correlated with success this week. They both sit at 5-under through Friday's action but Finau who's currently first in the FedEx points standings is more likely to climb the leaderboard and claim a top position going into next week's Tour Championship.

MLB (8-8 $23.85): Miami Marlins +105 vs. Cincinnati Reds (Circa)

It feels like I’ve stubbornly bet the Marlins a handful of times in this space but I can’t stop now. Not with this price. Yes the Reds are hot and the better overall team but not enough to make up for the fact that they’re starting Vladimir Gutierrez against the Marlins’ Sandy Alcantara. The latter is a far better pitcher enough so that the Marlins should be a short favorite in this spot instead of a short underdog. Despite my continued confidence Miami seems destined to finish with one of the worst records in the league but I still refuse to believe it’s actually one of the worst teams in the league. Their Pythagorean expected record is seven wins above their current 53-75 so maybe the Marlins are due for a bit of positive regression.

NASCAR (17-18 $4.12): Joey Logano -110 head-to-head vs. Ryan Blaney in Coke Zero Sugar 400 (Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook)

There’s nothing harder in auto sports than trying to profit off of superspeedway races like this weekend’s Cup contest in Daytona given that a handful of crashes are likely to wipe away a large portion of the field. But a few drivers have mastered the craft of restrictor-plate racing with Logano chief among them. Logano was all set to win the season-opening race at Daytona before a crash on the last lap led to Michael McDowell becoming a surprise champion. In all likelihood he’s going to be right there again. And even if he’s not it seems quite possible that a prospective wreck involving him could also swallow up his teammate Blaney. Team Penske traditionally runs up front eschewing strategy to wait back and avoid the big collisions and therefore putting them at risk to have multiple cars taken out in the event of a “big one.” Blaney has performed well on superspeedways in his own right but Logano has been better this season and deserves to be more than a pick’em in the matchup.

UFC (14-15 -$84.07): Alessio Di Chirico by TKO/KO or submission +175 vs. Abdul Razak Alhassan (Boyd Sports)

Steam has pushed Di Chirico from a moderate to a big favorite over Alhassan as one of Italy’s best fighters opened as low as -150 but now sits as high as -260 and the move makes sense. But the exotics on him to finish haven’t shifted accordingly. At least not at some books. Di Chirico has both knockout and submission ability and in the smaller cage at the UFC’s Apex facility Alhassan will have less room to stay away from him. Alhassan has only been stopped once in his fighting career but he arguably hasn’t fought anyone of Di Chirico’s caliber. Di Chirico has lost three of four but he’s been facing the highest reaches of the middleweight division. This is a chance to buy low on the dangerous veteran one that’s no longer available on the traditional moneyline.

College football (0-0 $0): Appalachian State -10 vs. East Carolina (Circa Sports)

This spread has inched down throughout the summer to now get within bettable territory at a key number. The Mountaineers present mismatches in multiple spots on the field for the Pirates and should prevail by at least two touchdowns in this neutral-site game next Thursday in Charlotte. Appalachian State had one of the nation’s best defenses and run games last year neither of which East Carolina is prepared to handle. The Mountaineers attack with a steady stream of running backs checking in keeping themselves fresh and building an advantage against overmatched opponents. They beat seven of their 12 opponents last year by double digits and this season should start similarly.

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd291bGQtbG9uZy1yYW5nZS1zdGVhbHRoLWJvbWJlcnMtaGF2ZS1icm91Z2h0LW5hemktZ2VybWFueS1iYWNrLWJyaW5rLTE5MjcxOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would Long-Range Stealth Bombers Have Brought Nazi Germany Back From the Brink?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Maximizing speed and range not stealth was the primary motivation behind the bat-shaped jet plane.

Northrop Grumman revealed this year it is developing a second flying wing stealth bomber the B-21 Raider to succeed its B-2 Spirit. However it was a pair of German brothers in the service of Nazi Germany that developed the first jet-powered flying wing—which has been dubbed debatably “Hitler’s stealth fighter.”

But maximizing speed and range not stealth was the primary motivation behind the bat-shaped jet plane.

Walter Horten was an ace fighter pilot in the German Luftwaffe having scored seven kills flying as wingman of the legendary Adolf Galland during the Battle of Britain. His brother Reimar was an airplane designer lacking a formal aeronautical education. In their youth the pair had designed a series of innovative tail-less manned gliders.

In 1943 Luftwaffe chief Herman Goering laid out the so-called 3x1000 specification for a plane that could fly one thousand kilometers an hour carrying one thousand kilograms of bombs with fuel enough to travel one thousand kilometers and back—while still retaining a third of the fuel supply for use in combat. Such an airplane could strike targets in Britain while outrunning any fighters sent to intercept it.

Clearly the new turbojet engines Germany had developed would be required for an airplane to attain such high speeds. But jet engines burned through their fuel very quickly making raids on more distant targets impossible. The Horten brothers’ idea was to use a flying wing design—a tail-less plane so aerodynamically clean it generated almost no drag at all. Such an airframe would require less engine power to attain higher speeds and therefore consume less fuel.

Flying wing designs were not an entirely new idea and had been used before in both gliders and powered aircraft. During World War II Northrop developed its own high-performing XB-35 flying wing bomber for the U.S. military though it failed to enter mass production. Despite the aerodynamic advantages the lack of a tail tended to make fly wing aircraft prone to uncontrolled yaws and stalls.

The Horten brothers were given the go-ahead to pursue the concept in August 1943. They first built an unpowered glider known as the H.IX V1. The V1 had long thin swept wings made of plywood in order to save weight. These “bell-shaped” wings compensated for yawing problem. Lacking a rudder or ailerons the H.IX relied upon “elevons” (combinations of ailerons and elevators) and two sets of spoilers for control. The elevons could be moved differentially to induce roll or together in the same direction to change pitch while the spoilers were used to induce yaw.

Following successful tests of the V1 glider at Oranienberg on March 1944 the subsequent V2 prototype was mounted with two Jumo 004B turbojet engines nestled to either side of a cockpit pod made of welded steel tubing. It also featured a primitive ejection seat and a drogue chute deployed while landing while redesigned tricycle landing gear was installed to enable the plane to carry heavier loads.

The first test flight occurred on February 2 1945. The manta-shaped jet exhibited smooth handling and good stall resistance. The prototype even reportedly beat an Me 262 jet fighter equipped with the same Jumo 004 engines in a mock dogfight.

But the testing process was cut short on February 18 when one of the V2’s jet engines caught fire and stopped mid-flight. Test pilot Erwin Ziller performed a number of turns and dives in an effort to restart the engine before apparently passing out from the fumes and spiraling his plane into the ground mortally wounding him.

Regardless Goering had already approved the production of forty flying wings to be undertaken by the Gotha company which mostly produced trainers and military gliders during World War II. The production planes were designated Ho 229s or Go 229s.

Because of the Ho 229’s great speed—it was believed the production version would be able to attain 975 kilometer per hours—it was repurposed to serve as a fighter with a planned armament of two heavy Mark 103 thirty-millimeter cannons. Construction of four new prototypes—numbered V3 throuh V6— was initiated two of which would have been two-seat night fighters.

However the Ho 229 never made it off the ground. When American troops of VIII Corps rolled into the factory at Friedrichroda Germany in April 1945 they found just the cockpit sections of the prototypes in various stages of development. A single pair of corresponding wings was found 75 miles away. The most complete of the four the V3 prototype was shipped back to the United States for study along with the wings and can today be seen under restoration at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the United States Air and Space Museum in Chantilly Virginia.

The Hortens were reassigned to draft specifications for a flying wing jet bomber with range enough to deliver an atom bomb to the east coast of the United States. Their resulting schematics for the Horten H.XVIII “Amerika Bomber” flying wing were never realized except arguably in the film Captain America.

Was the Ho 229 a stealth fighter?

One word you haven’t seen in this history so far is “stealth”—and that’s because there isn’t any documentation from the 1940s supporting the notion that the flying wing was intended to be a stealth aircraft. And yet the Hortens had stumbled upon the fact that a flying wing design lends itself to the sort of reduced radar cross-section ideal for a stealth plane.

Reimer Horten moved to Argentina after the war and in 1950 wrote an article for the Revista Nacional de Aeronautica arguing that wooden aircraft would absorb radar waves. Thirty years later as the theory behind stealth aircraft became more widely known Reimer wrote that he had intentionally sought to make the Horten flying wing into a stealth plane claiming that he had even constructed the airframe using a special radar absorbent mixture of carbon sawdust and wood glue without notifying his superiors. Two tests were undertaken to determine the presence of the carbon dust one of which supported his claim and the other that didn’t. In general historians are skeptical that stealth was a design goal from the outset.

In 2008 Northrop Grumman teamed up with the National Geographic channel to reconstruct a mockup of the Ho 229 which they tested for radar reflection and then pitted against a simulation of the British Chain Home radar network. Their findings were less than overwhelming—the flying wings would have been detected at a distance 80 percent that of a standard German Bf. 109 fighter.

The Northrop testers stressed that combined with the Ho 229’s much greater speed this modest improvement would have given defending fighters too little time to react effectively.

But of course the flying wing’s main feature was always supposed to be its speed which could have exceeded the maximum speed of the best Allied fighters of the time by as much as 33 percent. Detection time would not have mattered greatly if it could outrun everything sent to intercept it. Furthermore stealth would have had little usefulness in the fighter role the Ho 229 would actually have assumed as the Allied daylight fighters ranging over Germany did not benefit from radars of their own.

The Ho 229 might have been a formidable adversary over the skies of World War II but in truth the plane was far from ready for mass production by the war’s end. While it seems a stretch to claim that the Ho 229 was intended to be a stealth aircraft there’s little doubt that it pioneered design features that continue to see use in low-observable aircraft today.

SpaceX also sent 8000kg of other supplies and a human-sized robotic arm.

A SpaceX shipment of ants avocados and a human-sized robotic arm rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday.

The delivery — due to arrive Monday — is the company’s 23rd for NASA in just under a decade.

A recycled Falcon rocket blasted into the predawn sky from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. After hoisting the Dragon capsule the first-stage booster landed upright on SpaceX’s newest ocean platform named “A Shortfall of Gravitas.” SpaceX founder Elon Musk continued his tradition of naming the booster-recovery vessels in tribute to the late science fiction writer Iain Banks and his Culture series.

The Dragon is carrying more than 4800 pounds (2170 kilograms) of supplies and experiments and fresh food including avocados lemons and even ice cream for the space station’s seven astronauts.

The Girl Scouts are sending up ants brine shrimp and plants as test subjects while University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists are flying up seeds from mouse-ear cress a small flowering weed used in genetic research. Samples of concrete solar cells and other materials also will be subjected to weightlessness.

A Japanese start-up company’s experimental robotic arm meanwhile will attempt to screw items together in its orbital debut and perform other mundane chores normally done by astronauts.

The first tests will be done inside the space station. Future models of Gitai Inc.'s robot will venture out into the vacuum of space to practice satellite and other repair jobs said chief technology officer Toyotaka Kozuki.

As early as 2025 a squad of these arms could help build lunar bases and mine the moon for precious resources he added.

SpaceX had to leave some experiments behind because of delays resulting from COVID-19.

It was the second launch attempt; Saturday’s try was foiled by stormy weather.

“Through their wisdom and perseverance they joined together to form the James Madison Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2217 here in Orange Virginia” current Post Commander Al Dulaney notes. “Their lives are a testimony to their bravery and are the foundation of Post 2217 all these years. It is our duty to carry that tradition forward.”

With that charge in mind the nearly four dozen current members of the post on Brick Church Road are hosting a 90th anniversary open house celebration from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 4.

“To those 28 men 90 years later we dedicate this day” Dulaney writes in a history of the post. “They served their country proudly and returned home to be with their families and start new lives. They attended college started businesses … became barbers carpenters farmers newspaper men postmasters … worked for the highway department and the Montpelier estate … we dedicate this day to their memory family and descendants.”

At the same time the open house is an opportunity for the longstanding post to share its ongoing contributions to the community and perhaps recruit additional members.

Those unfamiliar with the post might not notice it right away. The current building is the organization’s second structure and tucked behind Abundant Life Christian Church opposite the Orange County Airport. The original post building was a brick-faced Quonset hut which remains inside the adjacent church.

Abundant Life minister the Rev. Dwane Pugh said he and the church family had been praying about finding a building for the nascent church and first had gotten the old Pizza Shanty building on Route 20 across from the airport.

“That wasn’t really big enough for a church” he said. “But I was driving down Route 20 and God told me to ‘go right right now’ and I turned up by D & J and found commander Lewis Byram mowing grass at his house and he said he was praying about what to do with the post’s Quonset hut.”

While the original post members met in the hut for years they later constructed the block building that has since served as the meeting room. The hut was rented out for gatherings and functions but increasingly had become the site of unfavorable behavior Pugh noted.

He said the post members were looking for a tenant that would more accurately share its mission in the community.

“They felt like we fit with their desire of helping others in the community” Pugh said and the church agreed to purchase the building and post property in 2002 with the organization retaining life rights to the current post building.

Ultimately church members renovated the Quonset hut and constructed Sunday school classrooms and offices around it it’s rounded roof only visible through a couple of access doors in upstairs closets.

Consequently he noted the post’s legacy of service lives on in both church missions and post programs.

Dulaney and Sr. Vice Commander Joe Parra report that Post 2217 awards two annual scholarships supports the Orange County High School JROTC contributes to the Orange Volunteer Fire Company Rikki’s Refuge Hospice of the Piedmont the Boys & Girls Club of Orange the Orange County Sheriff’s Office National Child Safety Program the Virginia Veterans Service Foundation and the VFW National Home for Children.

It also sponsors local Voice of Democracy and Patriots Pen competitions and continues to work toward the creation of an Orange County veterans memorial.

Parra said the August and September meetings are some of the most popular ones as the veterans decide how their fundraising will be distributed. Most of the organization’s contributions are raised through the sale of the popular “buddy poppies” and donations from individuals and organizations.

Dulaney and Parra said they hope the upcoming open house will both introduce the post to the community and remind others they’re still working to support veterans their families and Orange County.

“We’re a community service” Dulaney says. “We haven’t done a good job of publicizing what we do or that we’re here.”

He also said the group fights the stigma that “we’re a bunch of old men sitting around drinking beer. That’s not us.”

“That’s part of why we’re trying to get the word out” Parra added noting the group also will be part of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce Street Festival on Sept. 11 which will honor local heroes including veterans.

“We’re trying to draw in some of the younger generation — those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan” Parra noted.

“Our average age is about 59” Dulaney added. “If we don’t have enough members we can’t do a good job and we want to do a good job.”

“They fought on the battlefield for America and to make it better and then came home to do the same thing” Pugh said. “They still want to do that. They just need people to help make the community better.”

The Sept. 4 open house will begin at 11 a.m. with an introduction from post communications officer Pete Ewing followed by comments from VFW District 13 Commander Deadra Miller. Navy diver Kirk Davis will be the guest speaker and Ewing will read the names of the organization’s charter members.

Much of the program will be conducted outside in the pavilion behind the post and the church. It will include food drink games and activities as well as displays and information on membership history the veterans memorial and more. The address is 19105 Brick Church Road Orange.

The post meets the second Thursday of each month at 7 p.m. For more information contact Dulaney at (804) 205-7408 or cdrpost2217@vfwva.org.

Here's What You Need to Know: The program was ended due to cost and aerodynamic stability problems.

(This article appeared earlier in 2020.)

Earlier this year the United States Air Force announced that it would cut the fleet of its Global Hawk spy drones likely as it was opting to adopt the stealthy RQ-180 a stealthy flying-wing surveillance drone that reportedly entered service back in 2017. The service has never officially acknowledged the existence of the Northrop Grumman-produced RQ-180 which is believed to have first flown in 2010 and which may have been deployed near China last month.

However while a few details are known about the flying wing platform it isn’t the first stealth drone employed by the Air Force.

A DarkStar is Born

Nearly twenty-five years ago the RQ-3 DarkStar took its first flight but a year later the first prototype crashed during its second flight and not in the “going down in a blaze of glory” kind of way. It was more of a suggestion that the bugs had to be worked on the highly-advanced stealthy reconnaissance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA).

Developed under the Advanced Airborne Reconnaissance System (AARS) program the RQ-3 was designed to operate in high-threat environments the aircraft incorporated stealth aircraft technology that could allow it operate within highly defended airspace.

That was in contrast to the RQ-4 Global Hawk which could only operate in airspace where the United States essentially had air supremacy.

A second prototype was constructed and took part in a total of five flights beginning in mid-1998 before the program was cancelled a year later just prior to an airworthiness test flight.

An Autonomous Spy Plane

The DarkStar was also notable in that it was a fully autonomous platform that could take off fly to its target operate its sensors transmit information return and land without any human intervention.

By utilizing digital links to transmit sensor images DarkStar could also provide timely information across the globe—and if needed ground station operators could still take control of the RPA from anywhere in the world using satellite links. It had a reported 575 mile range and a flight time of eight hours.

More Wing Less Star

Unlike the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) developed at the time the DarkStar is noted for its disc-like fuselage which was well-contoured and quite squat in its general profile. It featured straight-wing appendages with a wingspan of sixty-nine feet in length and a height of three feet six inches.

Weighing a beefy 8500 pounds the RQ-3 DarkStar was powered by a Williams-Rolls FJ44-1A engine that offered a takeoff thrust of 1900 pounds. It provided a cruising speed of 288 mph and a service ceiling of 45000 feet.

A total of four were built including the first prototype that crashed. The program was ended because of the cost but also due to aerodynamic stability problems. While a unique autonomous drone the DarkStar could be a testament of the unmanned systems to come rather than a failure.

All three of the surviving prototypes are now housed in various aviation museums including the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio; and the Museum of Flight in Seattle; while the fourth prototype which never flew is currently held in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. but is not currently on display.

Although NRG Stadium won’t be as packed or as rocking for the third preseason game as it would be for a playoff game the exhibition contest with the Bucs does mark a return to the real normal as the Texans’ home venue won’t operate at reduced capacity as it did throughout the 2020 season.

“I feel like it’s been two years since we had a crowd in here” safety Justin Reid said. “So it’s going to be a really sick experience to have the fans back in the crowd and be able to feed off the energy that they bring to the home field.”

Offensive coordinator Tim Kelly noted that he wants the players to give maximum effort in front of the home crowd.

“First and foremost want to see our guys come out there and play hard” Kelly said. “It’s going to be good to come out and play in front of our home fans and go out there and execute and really just let the offense work for them.”

Of course playing hard at NRG Stadium means getting the finer details exact which is key as the Texans have to cut their 80-man roster down to 53 men by 3:00 p.m. on Aug. 31.

Said Kelly: “In the preseason it’s a little bit different than the regular season obviously so we want to make sure our guys are able to come out here execute play fast and go out and make plays.”

Texans fans are hopeful they will get to see the defense generate more takeaways as Houston led the NFL coming into the third week of preseason with seven turnovers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbmRzdGF0ZW55LmNvbS9wb3dlci1saXN0cy8yMDIxLzA4L25ldy15b3JrLXN0YXRlLXRvcC01MC1sb2JieWlzdHMtMjAyMS8xODQ4MzQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York State Top 50 Lobbyists 2021,"1.

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTQwMDAtbG92ZWxhY2UtZ3B1cy1jb3VsZC10dXJuLXVwLWVhcmxpZXItdGhhbi1leHBlY3RlZC1pbi0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 4000 'Lovelace' GPUs could turn up earlier than expected in 2022,"Nvidia’s next-gen graphics cards purportedly codenamed Lovelace might be here earlier than expected in 2022 and could be built by TSMC on a 5nm process or so the latest rumor reckons.

This comes from well-known hardware leaker Kopite7kimi on Twitter who replied to a comment about the incoming GPUs arriving late in 2022 if they are actually on TSMC 5nm (and being expensive too).

of course TSMC N5August 26 2021

As Wccftech which spotted this tweet points out the leaker had previously said that what will presumably be RTX 4000 graphics cards would be built on a 5nm process but the assumption was that Nvidia could stick with Samsung for making Lovelace chips. Now Kopite7kimi has clarified that it’ll purportedly be TSMC and this backs up what we’ve heard in recent times from another leaker – namely Greymon.

Greymon has theorized that Lovelace GPUs could be made on TSMC 5nm or maybe even an enhanced 5nm process (‘N5P’) which would offer an even better performance leap from Ampere.

Analysis: Fingers crossed for an earlier release – but what about those prices?

Remember these are pretty airy rumors at this stage but the fact that more than one source is now saying TSMC 5nm does suggest that maybe this is the route Nvidia will indeed take. It’s also possible that only certain models of RTX 4000 cards will be made at TSMC and other chips could be manufactured at Samsung.

Whatever the case it’s good to hear that Kopite7kimi believes that we won’t be waiting until late 2022 and that the next-gen graphics cards could arrive a bit earlier in the year. Particularly as previously Greymon seemed to quite firmly assert that these cards wouldn’t pitch up until the close of 2022 at best.

Fingers crossed that we could see RTX 4000 cards sooner than expected perhaps although it wouldn’t be a surprise if these new models were seriously pricey as the original tweet Kopite7kimi replied to suggested.

That’s very much the direction that the GPU industry has been headed of course but hopefully the extra pressure that stock shortages have been putting on pushing prices upwards will ease as we get to a better place in terms of component supply throughout 2022.

That said another recent rumor indicated that graphics cards could get more expensive at the beginning of next year interestingly with this theoretically being driven by TSMC upping its prices (responding to the huge demand for its chips). Which if it pans out would be an argument for Nvidia not switching to TSMC you would think – or perhaps only using it for certain models like maybe the cutting-edge flagship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LW52aWRpYS1pcy1hLXRvcC1ncm93dGgtc3RvY2stdG8tYnV5LXJpZ2h0LW5vdy0yMDIxLTA4LTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nvidia Is a Top Growth Stock to Buy Right Now,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has delivered impressive returns to investors so far this year thanks to a string of terrific quarterly results that have established the graphics specialist as a top tech play. Investors have come to expect outstanding growth from the chipmaker quarter after quarter due to the tailwinds in the video gaming and data center markets its two largest segments.

The good part is that the company didn't disappoint when it released its fiscal 2022 second-quarter results recently. Nvidia crushed Wall Street's expectations. It reported robust growth in revenue and earnings and set forth solid guidance that exceeded analysts' estimates. The company's Q2 revenue shot up 68% year over year to a record $6.51 billion while adjusted earnings surged 89% to $1.04 per share.

Nvidia expects $6.8 billion in revenue this quarter which would translate into a 44% year-over-year increase. However don't be surprised to see Nvidia exceed expectations once again thanks to favorable business conditions and the company's dominant position in the video gaming and data center markets which could help the stock deliver more upside over the long run.

Let's look at the reasons why Nvidia can sustain its high pace of growth in the long run and why it remains a solid bet for anyone looking to add a top growth stock to their portfolio.

Nvidia's two biggest businesses are built for long-term growth

Nvidia's outstanding performance last quarter was driven by an 85% year-over-year increase in the company's gaming revenue which came in at a record $3.06 billion. The segment produced 47% of Nvidia's total revenue in part because of the ""exceptionally strong"" demand for its Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs).

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the earnings conference call that GPU demand continues to outpace supply. This is impressive considering that graphics cards based on the Ampere GPUs have been on sale for over a year now. More importantly Nvidia noted that only 20% of its installed base has upgraded to an RTX series card. So the majority of Nvidia customers are still using cards running on older architectures such as Pascal which was introduced over five years ago.

So the upgrade cycle that Nvidia's Ampere GPUs have triggered is set to continue especially considering that more games now have features like ray tracing which can only be experienced on RTX series cards. Additionally the growing population of video gamers is also turning out to be a tailwind for Nvidia's gaming business.

The company highlighted that the number of PC gamers has increased by 20% in the past year on the popular game distribution platform Steam. Statista forecast that the number of PC gamers is expected to jump from an estimated 1.75 billion last year to nearly 1.86 billion in 2024. Not surprisingly the high-end PC gaming hardware market is expected to grow at an annual pace of more than 20% through 2024 according to Jon Peddie Research.

Nvidia can win big from this secular growth of the PC gaming hardware market. For instance GPU sales are expected to jump to $54 billion in 2025 from $23.6 billion in 2020 and Nvidia controlled 80% of this space in the first quarter of 2021. All of this indicates that the healthy growth of its gaming business is here to stay for a long time to come.

Meanwhile the data center segment turned in another quarter of outstanding growth with revenue increasing 35% year over year to $2.4 billion. It accounted for 36% of the top line. The business's strong growth was driven by the increasing adoption of its data center chips by hyperscale and cloud computing customers. Those chips have been deployed by the likes of Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet's Google.

Nvidia is witnessing growth across diverse niches of the data center market including artificial intelligence (AI) inferencing. The company's inference-related revenue more than doubled year over year thanks to the new A30 GPUs which are four times more powerful than the previous-generation T4 chips.

Additionally Nvidia's GPUs are helping companies deploy AI for real-world use cases. What's more the company says that it is winning share in the data center accelerator market as customers are ""shifting from CPUs to GPUs driven by the stringent performance latency and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workloads.""

Nvidia's data center supremacy can also be judged from the fact that its chips power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers including eight of the top 10. Also 70% of all the new supercomputer systems used Nvidia's chips according to the company's estimates. This dominant position bodes well for Nvidia as the AI chip market is expected to clock 45% annual growth through 2025 according to a third-party estimate.

Nvidia's two major businesses which accounted for 83% of its revenue last quarter have healthy prospects that should help sustain its growth. However additional catalysts are coming into play that investors need to know about.

Don't miss this growth driver

Nvidia's automotive business turned on the heat in fiscal Q2 rising 37% year over year to $152 million. This was impressive considering that the automotive business had lost momentum in recent quarters. However Nvidia is now witnessing an uptick in this space because its winning designs are now moving into the production phase. Management said that its automotive designs could ""drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years.""

As it turns out Nvidia is sitting on $8 billion worth of automotive designs that it expects to translate into revenue over the next six years. Given that the company's automotive design win pipeline swelled with new partnerships last quarter it could generate stronger revenue from this segment in the coming years.So Nvidia could soon count on another growth driver that could accelerate its already strong pace of growth. That's why investors who haven't bought this tech stock yet should consider going long before it flies higher thanks to the multiple catalysts it is sitting on.

The brand new architecture will be built on TSMC's 5nm process. This is massive news if true - and let's talk about that for a second. Kopite has leaked pretty much all the details of the Turing and Ampere architectures and has historically been extremely accurate. That said as always with leaks and before multiple confirmations a grain of salt never hurt anyone.

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will ""come out a little bit earlier"" according to industry insider

Kopite had already previously confirmed that the Ada Lovelace architecture would be built on the 5nm process but it was assumed that this would be a Samsung node. NVIDIA had made the (correct) decision to transition to Samsung for foundry services because it had (accurately) forecasted the demand that would be hitting TSMC. Having to share resources with Apple and AMD was a gamble and NVIDIA's decision to go with Samsung appears to have been mostly validated.

of course TSMC N5 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26 2021

Yet if this leak is correct then NVIDIA is going back to TSMC for their 5nm process - and likely means at least one flagship GPU series will be produced at TSMC - which is business that Samsung Foundries just lost out on. Even if they build the high end chips on TSMC and keep the low end at Samsung (which is where the volume usually lies) it is still interesting because it means that Jensen has lost faith in Samsung's ability to keep pace with the bleeding edge nodes.

Ada Lovelace will come out a little bit earlier. Keep patient. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26 2021

Kopite has also stated that Ada Lovelace GPU will be arriving sooner than expected although since they have not confirmed the timeline in the first place we still don't have a concrete date. Rumors have put the arrival of Ada Lovelace GPUs between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 so if Kopite is expecting NVIDIA to push back the production and commence mass production a bit early the Q2 2022 timeframe might be the one to keep in mind going forward.

Recap on NVIDIA ADA GPU architecture

In many ways Ada Lovelace can be thought of as the world's first computer enthusiast. She is the first person to have realized that the Analytical Engine proposed by Charles Babbage had applications beyond pure calculation and also published what is thought to be the first algorithm (becoming the first computer programmer) intended to be carried by such a machine. This was almost half a century before Alan Turing would finish their work and invent the general-purpose computer during the world war.

NVIDIA has been known to base its architectures on prominent physicists mathematicians and scientists and Ada Lovelace is no different. Videocardz actually managed to find a major hint in NVIDIA's own merchandise store that appears to confirm this rumor about Lovelace architecture being the next generation of GPUs from the company. If you look at the heroes showcased during GTC's 2018 keynote you find not only Ada Lovelace but what are potentially all future architectural codenames from NVIDIA. Jensen might have sneakily left the entire future roadmap (as far as codenames go) in the GTC'18 keynote.

The NVIDIA AD102 ""ADA GPU"" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change) provided by Kopite. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. The only way this is even possible is because NVIDIA is apparently building this on the 5nm process which has significant die area and power reduction. Interestingly if you assume a clock speed of 1.75 GHz you can also get the peak single-precision performance of the ADA 102 GPU: 64 TFLOPs.

According to Kopite the ADA architecture will feature a much bigger L2 Cache (both Turing and Ampere have 6 MB of cache) which means this might be a major architectural revision (as Turing was to Pascal and Pascal was to Fermi/Kepler) instead of just the usual process shrink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFmaW5hbmNpYWwuY29tL3Rlc2xhcy1tdXNrLXNpZ25hbHMtY29uY2Vybi1vdmVyLW52aWRpYS1kZWFsLWZvci11ay1jaGlwbWFrZXItdGVsZWdyYXBo0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXNpYWZpbmFuY2lhbC5jb20vdGVzbGFzLW11c2stc2lnbmFscy1jb25jZXJuLW92ZXItbnZpZGlhLWRlYWwtZm9yLXVrLWNoaXBtYWtlci10ZWxlZ3JhcGgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Musk Signals Concern Over Nvidia Deal for UK Chipmaker – Telegraph,"Multinationals that use a large amount of computer chips are reported to have objected to Nvidia’s plan to take over UK chip designer Arm which is being assessed by regulators at home and abroad

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has signaled competition concerns over Nvidia Corp’s planned purchase of British chip designer Arm the Telegraph reported on Saturday citing multiple sources.

E-commerce giant Amazon and smartphone maker Samsung Electronics have also lodged opposition to the deal with US authorities the newspaper reported.

Earlier this year the US Federal Trade Commission opened an in-depth probe into the takeover. The probe findings are expected in the coming weeks the newspaper said.

Tesla Amazon Samsung and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Nvidia is likely to seek European Union anti-monopoly approval for the $54 billion purchase of Arm early next month with regulators expected to launch a full-scale investigation after a preliminary review people familiar with the matter have said.

Arm which was founded in 1991 is a supplier of chip architecture and its main business is to develop new technologies then license these to major chip giants around the world for patent fees.

Most of the world’s mobile phones and tablets are said to use technology developed by Arm and major companies such as Apple Samsung Qualcomm and MediaTek have business cooperation with the UK firm.

Arm said last September it had nearly 90% of the mobile processor market and a healthy share in the field of autonomous vehicles. The company was taken over by SoftBank in 2016 for $32 billion.

Nvidia has offered to pay $21.5 billion worth of its shares and $12 billion in cash for the British company including $2 billion paid immediately upon signing of the contract.

The two companies said in a joint statement that SoftBank may also receive an additional $5 billion in cash or stock. And if Arm’s future performance reaches a specific target $1.5 billion worth of Nvidia stock that will be paid to Arm employees.

In an effort to dispel any concern about the deal Nvidia founder Huang Renxun was quoted as saying: “Arm’s headquarters will continue to be located in Cambridge. We will expand and build world-class AI research facilities in this excellent place to support healthcare life sciences robotics autonomous vehicles and other fields of development. And in order to attract researchers and scientists from the UK and around the world for groundbreaking work Nvidia will build the most advanced AI supercomputer powered by Arm CPU.”

China Finance reported at the time of Nvidia’s offer in September 2020 the acquisition may damage Britain’s “technical sovereignty”. It claimed that if Nvidia acquires Arm it would be equivalent to handing over relevant intellectual property rights to a US company and this may plunge Arm into the increasingly fierce “technical conflict” between China and the United States.

That may sound great on paper but honestly I’m hoping these rumours are fake.

The Super card range – which debuted with the Turing 20-series cards last generation – is made up of specced-up versions of pre-existing graphics cards with boosted video memory bandwidth and additional CUDA cores allowing users to gain a performance boost without spending substantially more.

They proved to be pretty popular with the Turing generation so I’m not surprised to see Nvidia reusing this tactic for its Ampere cards. However I don’t think that launching a new Nvidia RTX 3090 Super graphics card makes much sense right now.

The Nvidia RTX 3090 is currently the most powerful GeForce graphics card you can buy but I’d argue that the performance gains you get compared to the Nvidia RTX 3080 card do not justify the hefty price jump.

The retail price of the Founders Edition RTX 3080 is £649 while the RTX 3090 is priced at a whopping £1399 – that’s double the price. But since the RTX 3080 can already handle AAA games with a plus 60fps performance there are very few people who would need anything more powerful.

Of course the RTX 3090 is really a Titan in disguise so it’s more beneficial to content creators than gamers. Yet I still find it strange that Nvidia is rumoured to be working on a Super variant for the graphics card that needs a performance boost the least.

It’s not just the price you need to be worried about either. The real kick in the teeth is that (according to Twitter leaker Greymon55) the RTX 3090 Super could have a graphics card power that exceeds 400W. That’s a hefty jump from the graphics power of both the RTX 3090 (350w) and RTX 3080 (320W) potentially requiring you to upgrade your PSU and even accept a costly hike for your electricity bill.

It’s also impossible to ignore the GPU shortage right now. It’s incredibly difficult to find a high-end graphics card that hasn’t had its price inflated. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has suggested the GPU shortage could last through the majority of 2022.

It feels like a bit of a slap in the face to PC gamers for Nvidia to keep launching ultra-expensive graphics cards when its current crop of cards are constantly out of stock. I appreciate that Nvidia will want to launch its Super range before it moves onto the 40 Series generation in 2022 but couldn’t it just stick with the RTX 3060 Super RTX 3070 Super and RTX 3080 Super cards instead?

Of course it may turn out those RTX 3090 Super rumours are fake as we’ve only got tenuous Twitter rumours to go by right now. But if Nvidia does end up launching the souped-up graphics card I bet it’s going to be greeted with more eye rolls than jubilation.

A farmer's daughter Kavati Mamatha who hails from historical Khilashapur village in Jangaon district scripted her success by making it to a reputed IT company with a CTC of Rs 20 lakh per annum.



Mamatha last of the four siblings born to Kavati Rajaiah-Yadamma couple is now pursuing her post-graduation in the Sumathi Reddy Institute of Technology (SRIT) for Women. Grabbing Validation Engineer job in the NXP Semiconductors Pune an IT major that provides end-to-end solutions for Wireless LAN and Bluetooth connectivity is no easy task by any means especially for a girl whose family's financial background is not so encouraging. Mamatha knows it well that her father a farmer is the only breadwinner in her family although all her elder siblings graduated. Mamatha attributes her success to her faculty and the ambience provided by her college management.

""Thanks to my faculty who always focus on foundational concepts which are vital in students' success. The recruitment process started with a written test that included technical and non technical questions. After being shortlisted in the written test I had gone through four more rounds of interviews. While the first three were technical the final round was HR"" Mamatha told The Hans India.

Mamatha who aspires to become a scientist at the ISRO said that she got a huge support and guidance from the faculty that finally landed her in a lucrative job.

Kavati Rajaiah who is on cloud 9 after his daughter Mamatha's success profusely thanked the SR Educational Society A Varada Reddy for providing state-of-art facilities in the college to the students besides constantly encouraging them. ""Since the establishment of our institution in 2009 we always strived hard to provide top class facilities to the students. As a result 90 per cent of our students have got placements in reputed MNCs."" said A Varada Reddy Chairman.

""Our curriculum includes a progressive plan right from the first year in both education and training for campus placements. Our institution is in first place in university academic results."" said Dr Rajasri Reddy Principal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

WHEATLAND MO. (Aug. 28 2021) – One new track champion was crowned with three others adding to their Lucas Oil Speedway title resumes Saturday night.

Dillon McCowan nailed down his first Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified crown on Rempfer Memorial Season Championship Night Presented by Bill Roberts Chevrolet-Buick.

McCowan a 17-year-old from Urbana not only won the season title but also captured the feature with a late pass for third feature victory of season in the Big Adventure RV Weekly Racing Series.

Meanwhile Kris Jackson celebrated his sixth Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mod championship Cole Henson repeated his ULMA Late Model points title and David Hendrix earned the O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars title.

Other feature winners on Saturday night were Andy Bryant (Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mods) Larry Ferris (ULMA Late Models) and Scotty Allen (O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars).

McCowan doubles up with title feature win: McCowan won the championship in style passing Jason Pursley for the lead with four laps remaining and going on to celebrate his third feature victory of the season in addition to the points title.

“It hasn’t sunk in just yet. It’s a lot bigger than just me” McCowan said in victory lane. “It’s everybody behind the scenes who helped me get here. It’s been fun this year.”

The ultra-consistent McCowan had 13 top-five finishes in his first full season of driving a USRA Modified.

Pursley started on the front row and grabbed the lead at the drop of the green with Kyle Thompson moving into second on lap two. But on a lap-13 restart Thompson’s car seemed to stall and McCowan sailed past him and into second.

Three laps later McCowan made the pass for the lead using the low line out of turn four. He never looked back from there going on to win by 2.1 seconds over Pursley – who also finished runner-up in the points chase unofficially 65 behind.

“It was an awesome race” McCowan said. “We kept getting stuck on the bottom on those restarts and I didn’t know if it was going to work out. Then they went single-file and I thought ‘man I don’t know if I can get it done.

“I don’t know what happened to Kyle. It looked like he may have lost power but we started gaining on Jason and it worked out in our favor tonight.”

Lucas Gibbs finished third with Kevin Blackburn fourth and Thompson was fifth.

Bryant wins B-Mod feature and Jackson earns championship: Andy Bryant grabbed an early lead and checked out on the field en route to the Ozark Golf Cars USRA B-Mod feature victory. Meanwhile Lebanon’s Kris Jackson clinched his sixth season championship without even making it into the feature starting field.

Bryant of Fort Scott Kansas beat Ryan Gillmore by 1.2 seconds for his second feature victory of the season.

Bryant took the lead on lap three and opened a five-second command before a lap-15 caution bunched the field setting up a five-lap sprint to the finish. Just one lap was completed before another caution but in that time Gillmore moved around John Potter and into second.

Despite challenges by Gillmore from the inside groove Bryant was able to hold on for the win. Shawn Whitman was third with JC Morton fourth and Potter coming home in fifth.

“Those restarts I was getting pretty tired of them” Bryant said. “The long green-flag run we had I knew I had a pretty good distance. We got the car home in one piece and the track was pretty good tonight for the most part from what I could see.”

Jackson took an unconventional final-night road to his sixth track championship. After struggling in his heat race Jackson had to run a B Main and his car was wounded in two separate accidents not of his making before a single lap could be completed.

Jackson pulled into the pits returned a lap down and wound up ninth leaving him out of the feature field. Fortunately for Jackson his 77-point lead at the beginning of the night gave him enough of a cushion to hold on for another championship. He also won titles in 2012 2013 2014 2019 and 2020.

“Luckily we had a strong enough year that tonight didn’t matter” said Jackson who had seven feature wins during the season. “It’s one of those things. This is racing. This is our form of gambling and it didn’t go very well for me tonight. If it could go wrong it went wrong.

“We’re gonna take it. We’re lucky enough to still win the points. I’m pretty proud of my whole team for this.”

Jackson unofficially wound up 35 points in front of Morton.

ULMA Late Model win to Ferris as Henson repeats title: Larry Ferris continued his late-season roll winning the ULMA Late Model feature for the second straight week. Ferris of Nevada passed Henson with three laps remaining and held off the season champ by sixth-tenths of a second.

“I had a good run on him on that caution and I think I would have got him” said Ferris who slipped past Henson coming out of turn four to complete lap 17 – one lap after making a pass that didn’t stick due to a caution flag.

“We ended up getting him after the caution. I just wanted to make sure I didn’t touch him” Ferris said. “He’s a great friend of mine. We had a good race and I didn’t want to mess his points deal up.”

Henson began the night 35 points in front of Fennewald and removed all mystery about the championship battle by leading the first 16 laps and never letting Fennewald around him. The Russellville driver ended Fennewald’s championship streak at three last season.

“I’ll tell you what it’s incredible” said Henson who also leads the Lucas Cattle Company ULMA national points. “We came into the year and were not gonna run for points but the consistency was there. We won two races down here and we were there so we said ‘let’s go battle for it.

“It’s awesome to be back up here again. I can’t thank my car owner Rob Schlup enough. Without him I wouldn’t be standing up here tonight.

“I’m so happy to see Larry Ferris get the win. He drove a heck of a race. I drove as hard as I could and he drove a little harder and got me. But that’s awesome.”

Including his three feature wins Henson had 11 top-five feature finishes in 12 events this season.

Allen earns USRA Stock Cars win Hendrix the championship: Scotty Allen picked up his fourth O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars feature win of the season and David Hendrix brought home the season championship.

Allen of Urbana took over the lead from Burl Woods on lap three making a pass coming out of turn four. He held it the rest of the way fighting off a mid-race challenge from Ed Griggs as the top two were side by side for several laps.

Allen was able to start building his lead getting it to 1.5 seconds by lap 15 and extended it to a final margin of 2.9 seconds over Griggs. Robert White finished third with Woods fourth and Hendrix fifth.

“There’s an awful lot of good Stock Cars coming now every week” Allen said. “It’s an awesome class. I’m a life-long Modified guy. Everybody knows it. I don’t if this is a retirement home for me or what but I really like it. These guys are tough. It’s a lot of fun.”

Waynesville’s Hendrix meanwhile celebrated the track championship in the division’s initial season. Hendrix had won two previous track championships in the Street Stock class.

Hendrix won three early season features and used consistency to built an insurmountable points lead entering championship night.

“That’s pretty cool” Hendrix said of becoming the first Stock Cars track champ. “We’re having a blast in this class. We’ve been struggling a little bit the last half of the year. We’ve had the dirt gremlins after us I guess you’d say.

“We’ve had like 20 top-fives (overall). It’s been an awesome year. I wish we’d have had more wins to go with but we’re having fun and that’s what it’s supposed to be about.”

If Old Dominion alumna Mary Maniscalco-Theberge had listened to a negative classmate during her surgical training she probably never would have climbed the military's career ladder to become the first female Chief of Surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C. In this role she oversees 13 services and 500 staff members.

Now a colonel in the U.S. Army Maniscalco-Theberge is used to being a trailblazer in areas typically dominated by men. During her days at Old Dominion she was a leader among men and women joining the Army ROTC during her second semester and serving as the first female Army ROTC battalion commander during her senior year.

Following her graduation from Old Dominion she entered Eastern Virginia Medical School. Initially positive that she did not want to be a surgeon soon after beginning her surgical rotation she realized it was what she was meant to do.

Maniscalco-Therberge's surgical skills have been honed though a trauma fellowship at the Washington Hospital Center and a surgical critical care fellowship at Walter Reed. She has received the Meritorious Service Medal on four occasions the Army Commendation Medal three times the Army Achievement Medal three times and the Order of Military Medical Merit.

“I had my fingers crossed that there was a good turnout” said Nathaniel Hart owner of Gallery 304 which he plans to open in downtown Morgantown. “I was kind of nervous for it.”

The event hosted by Gallery 304 featured more than 30 vendors from around the state and surrounding region. Katie Peric owner of Rag and Bone Vintage in Pittsburgh was among those vendors.

For Peric Harley-Davidson shirts are among her favorite to collect and sell.

“I’ve got a lot of vintage Levi’s vintage women’s clothes a lot of hats and a lot of purses” she said. “T-shirts are my main seller though.”

Peric remembers thrifting with her mother and grandmother when she was young which is what first got her interested in vintage clothing. When she got to college she got more invested in the style and began adding more items to her own closet.

It didn’t take long for her friends to become interested in her clothing finds. She said some even asked to buy her thrifted clothing.

Braden Griffin owner of Griffin Vintage traveled from Charleston to sell his vintage finds at the festival. Griffin said the best part about being a part of the festival is getting to see new faces and old friends within the thrifting community.

“There’s not a lot of places to go for vintage besides Goodwill and maybe a couple shops here and there” he said. “I feel like coming to an event is just fun.”

Hannah Bledsoe a West Virginia University student said she went to the festival to pick up some new items and enjoy a day off with her friends.

“We like vintage things” Bledsoe said. “It was free and it was something to do.”

Max Ostrow a Morgantown resident bought three T-shirts to add to his collection. While he said he enjoys shopping and seeing what each vendor has to offer he was also excited to see this type of event in the Morgantown area.

“I think it’s really cool that this happens in Morgantown because it’s a sense of community for everybody” he said. “It’s nice to see everybody get together and have fun.”

Hart said getting the event together was a long time in the making as it was something he had been hoping to do since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Seeing it all come together and watching people enjoy the event made it all worthwhile. After seeing the turnout and interest in the festival Hart said he is looking forward to hosting more events in the future.

Gallery 304 is set to open at the end of September on High Street. For more information visit instagram.com/gallery304shop."

Apart from designing and manufacturing its own chips the company also makes chips for other brands such as Google IBM Nvidia and Qualcomm. To fabricate those complicated chips the South Korean firm has multiple state-of-the-art chip factories around the world including in China South Korea and the US. Ever wondered how big they are and how they look?

Well the company has published a couple of videos that show its semiconductor chip campuses across South Korea through a bird's eye view. The videos were shot using drones and they give you an idea of the massive scale at which Samsung operates.

The first video takes us through five Samsung semiconductor campuses: Hwaseong Campus Giheung Campus Pyeongtaek Campus Onyang Campus and Cheonan Campus. The Hwaseong Campus is the home to Samsung's chip R&D and manufacturing facilities. There's an iconic A-shaped bridge that connects two buildings and signifies the collaboration between various teams. It also has three high-rise DSR towers that have 29 floors above the ground and four floors underground. Over 15000 employees work here.

The Gihueng Campus is where Samsung Electronics first started making chips. The company successfully developed 64kb DRAM in 1983 six months after its VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) business was established. It consists of Line 1 Samsung's first memory chip fabrication line. The Pyeongtaek Campus is the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturing complex. This is where chips are made using the cutting-edge EUV process. We can see that the company is actively expanding its campus and the construction work is ongoing.

The Onyang Campus is situated in the hills and is responsible for the final stage of semiconductor manufacturing. It covers the development of semiconductor packaging production testing and shipping of the end product. It is surrounded by lush green fields and hills. The Cheonan Campus is the future of chips where next-generation packaging technology is developed.

The second video footage is shot using a racing drone complete with impressive feats in the air. We can see that all campuses shown in these videos have large buildings big parks and wide roads.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2gvcXVhbGl0eS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycy1jaGlwcy1qYXBhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low-quality semiconductor chips likely circulating in Japanese market,"Low-quality semiconductors such as imitations of major manufacturers' products are likely circulating widely across Japan a survey by a testing firm has indicated raising concern over an increase of defective items using such components amid a global chip shortage.

The semiconductor market has become the lifeline of most of the emerging technologies we see today.

Being a pre-requisite for every endeavor related to memory chips semiconductor powers the budding smart technology that will pave the new era of smart connectivity.

Semiconductors possess the unique ability to act as either an insulator or a conductor depending on several environmental factors. Light temperature pressure electric currents and even electric fields can cause a considerable change in a semiconductor’s properties. This also helps in determines the conductivity of a semiconductor device that is pivotal to modern based technology.

Solar cells integrated circuits transistors and many other computing materials would cease to exist if not for the presence of semiconductor material. Therefore semiconductor materials have deeply embedded themselves in the computing and electronic product supply chain.

Due to the above-stated reasons it becomes imperative to explore some of the Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022 to prepare the industry beforehand.

Some of the Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022 are as follows:

Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022

Semiconductor Supply Chain and Key Players

Making to the Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022 is the most hyped controversy of the decade the semiconductor market has seen a major shift in the supply value chain since the emergence of the US-China Trade wars that have shifted the paradigm of many sectors.

China has prided itself to be the biggest manufacturing hub of Asia’s biggest semiconductor market for many years. But due to the recent strife between the two superpowers the supply chain of the semiconductor market has shifted to other avenues.

Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics have emerged as the largest foundries of the market that contribute over 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market.

TSMC has come up as the top manufacturer of chips having 10 nanometres and Samsung trails behind that is leading the memory chip market.

Nvidia (NVDA) Qualcomm Broadcom AMD are among the well-known U.S. fabless companies that specialize in chip design.

Other countries like Japan and South Korean companies manufacture the majority of wafers. Thus coming up as one of the Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022.

Pursuing Liquid Cooling Possibilities

Another Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022 can be given to the cooling techniques in semiconductor chips. We must have noticed that their smartphones become slightly warm when they charge or are used for a long period. Fortunately this warmth or heating rarely reaches dangerous levels. This happens largely due to thermal management techniques that are deployed by several semiconductor design experts.

Multichip packaging is one such related trend. As in this type of packaging several chips are packed into a relatively small area due to which heat management becomes an even more challenging task to achieve.

Using microchannel cold plates in a semiconductor design is one of the main options to combat this issue as they distribute the coolant evenly across warm surfaces.

Another such option is still in the testing zone as scientists have claimed to develop a new chip design incorporating both a transistor and microfluidic cooling system into it. Thus makes securing its position in Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022.

Industrial IoT (IIoT)

One such Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022 can be attributed to Industrial IoT services we will encounter during the semiconductor chip manufacturing sites.

Semiconductors act as the backbone for enabling emerging IoT technologies as the IoT revolution has increased the demand for semiconductor chips.

Using a well-constructed strategy IIoT can cause a significant increase in the production value of semiconductor chips. And can result in the production chain growth surging at a tremendous rate therefore getting a place in Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022.

Use of AR and VR for Remote Training

Pandemic has made traveling a tedious task to achieve as many types of air restrictions have been imposed on air travel leading to many delays in the working of business operations. But since work needs to be done regardless semiconductor manufacturing facilities have to keep the fab running to supply the products to the hands of consumers.

This requires regular maintenance of equipment and parts to be upgraded and serviced to keep them operating in top order. All this requires trained personnel who might not be available due to these travel restrictions and this is where the use of AR and VR comes into existence.

Though AR cannot replace the expertise of having someone on-site to address these issues physically AR allows on-site support engineers to help other working personnel with tips and tricks to solve minor issues so that the unit can keep working. This secures a place for another Top Trends in Semiconductor Market in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbXJvbmxpbmUub3JnLzIwMjEvMDgvMjgvY2hpcC13YXJzLW9yLXRoZS1jcmlzaXMtb2YtbGF0ZS1jYXBpdGFsaXNtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip wars or the crisis of late capitalism?,"WITH the U.S. imposing technology sanctions on China the world’s electronics industry is facing turbulent times. After the sanctions Huawei has slipped from its number one slot as a mobile phone supplier (2nd quarter 2020) to number seven currently. Commenting on this slide the Huawei chairman has said that right now Huawei’s battle is for survival. On that count Huawei is not only surviving but doing pretty well. It is still the world leader in the telecom equipment market with a hefty 31 per cent share twice that of its nearest competitors Nokia and Ericsson and profits of nearly $50 billion in the first six months of 2021. But will it be able to retain its market position without China catching up in chip manufacturing and design technologies?

It is not the Chinese companies alone that are facing tough times. With growing chip wars between the U.S. and China the global supply chain for electronic chips has been affected and chip shortages have emerged. Semiconductor chips enter almost every product from our lowly household equipment—microwave ovens and toasters—to the most advanced products in the industry. The car industry’s biggest bottleneck today is this chip shortage which has badly hit their production. If the chip wars continue the crisis of a chip shortage can affect other industries as well.

Is the crisis of the semiconductor industry a precursor to the fragmentation of the global supply chains? Will it lead to warring blocks with the U.S. at one pole and China at the other? With this fragility of the supply chain are we seeing the end of globalisation as a paradigm?

Chip making and the electronics industry is one of the most capital and research and development (R&D) intensive industries. No other industry has this characteristic. Power or steel plants are capital intensive; pharmaceuticals are R&D intensive. But not both. A little-known Dutch company ASML that produces the lithographic machines for chip manufacture has a market capitalisation more than that of Volkswagen the world’s largest car manufacturer! This is due to the R&D costs that go into their machines: ASML is the only equipment maker that can deliver the machines that the most advanced chips require. A new fabrication facility to make the new generation of chips today cost $20 billion more than that of an aircraft carrier; or a nuclear plant. Only two fabricators TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung are capable of producing the most advanced chips that the industry uses.

The U.S. and China are in competition in areas such as artificial intelligence computers mobile networks and phones. The basic building block of all of these technologies is semiconductor chips. The more circuity we can pack into a chip the more its computing power. The bulk of the market still consisting of older fabricators using 180 nm to 28 nm level technologies. Only two per cent of the chips the most advanced chips are below 10 nm (<10 nm) level. The only fabricators that can make such chips are TSMC and Samsung the world’s largest fabricators. While SMIC of China the third-largest chip fabricator in the world is also at 14 nm level it has only recently moved from 28 nm to 14 nm. With Chinese government support it is investing in production lines that can go below 14nm. Intel once the world leader in chip manufacture is stuck at the 14 nm level though it also has plans for developing the next generation of chips.

The U.S. has chosen the electronics/semiconductor industry as a battleground for its geostrategic competition with China. It believes that here it has a significant technology lead and a major market share. China is a late entrant and though has a comparable market share is still dependent on certain core technologies that the U.S. and its allies—the European Union Japan and South Korea—control. That is why the U.S. has chosen Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) two major Chinese players as targets for its sanctions.

The U.S. is following up its sanctions on Huawei and SMIC with a plan to bar China from technologies it calls “foundational technologies” under its 2018 Export Reform Control Act. The argument that the U.S. is building is a simple one: “ we are ahead of China in certain critical technologies required for advanced chip manufacture; all we have to do to maintain our lead is to deny China access to these technologies; that will ensure that our lead for the future and ensure the dominance of the US.”

At first sight it might appear that chips should be considered as foundational technologies and the target of U.S. sanctions. This is what the U.S. did when it barred Huawei from buying the latest 7 nm scale chips from Taiwan’s TSMC the world’s largest chip fabricator.

The SMIC then tried to set up its fabrication line for 7nm chips and needed to import from the Dutch company ASML Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machines each costing around 120-150 million dollars. Though the EUV machines are from the Netherlands it uses software developed in its U.S. subsidiary and therefore has under the U.S. sanctions regime.

The U.S. sanctions mean that ASML cannot sell the EUV lithography machines to China though it can sell other lithographic machines for lower-end chip production keeping China out of the high-end <10 nm technology and therefore a generation or two behind the market leaders.

This brings us to what is a foundational technology. Clearly chips though the key driver of electronics is not as foundational as the machines that produce these chips. If we want to be at the cutting edge of technology we have to master not only the technology of chip production but also the technology that produces the machines that run the production lines. That is why ASML’s lithography machines are the bottleneck for China.

What then drives the advances in key technologies of the machines and chip production? As Marxists know it is the knowledge that drives the productive forces in this case the advances in chip design. This knowledge is captured in the software design tools and of the lithography machines. They are both highly knowledge-intensive and require people with very specialised skills.

The U.S. and its universities are still the major source of knowledge development the key to the advances in this sector. But here is its long-term problem. The research programs of U.S. universities are mostly staffed with foreign students the bulk of them from China India and other developing countries. A large number of them stay back in the U.S. and provide the human power required for the advances in knowledge that the U.S. has today.

If Chinese students and researchers are not welcome in the U.S. this source of knowledge development is going to weaken. Unfortunately countries like India have not made the investments in high-quality education and research laboratories to provide a substitute for the stream of Chinese students that enter the U.S. universities. On the other hand China has invested heavily in its universities and research institutions overtaking the U.S. in producing a larger number of PhDs in science and technology. It is also building a strong pipeline of innovations from the universities/research institutions to the industry.

The fear of the U.S. semiconductor industry is that China is the biggest market for the U.S. for its chip design software. The U.S. companies also design high-end chips which are then manufactured in Taiwan. In the short run the U.S. sanctions will certainly damage the Chinese in advanced chip production and the production of electronics devices based on such chips. But it will also mean that the U.S. companies will lose a significant part of their revenues that it now receives from the Chinese market for its sale of design tools. It also means a loss of revenue for advanced chips that the U.S. companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia design and then manufacture in Taiwan’s TSMC.

For the high-tech U.S. companies the loss of this income means less money for R&D and the slow erosion of its position as the global knowledge hub. If the U.S. companies lose the Chinese market and therefore a significant part of their revenues their ability to compete in the future will be seriously impaired. They may gain in the short run as they are doing with Huawei losing its number one spot in smartphones but in the long term the loss of revenues will mean less ability to produce the knowledge that gives the U.S. its edge in technology. Less money in research means an eventual loss of leadership because unlike other countries the U.S. increasingly does not produce the chips or the machines but the knowledge that goes into both.

In a series of submissions to the U.S. department of commerce the U.S. semiconductor industry has argued that the U.S. companies de-linking from the Chinese market will mean a huge loss of revenue and eventually giving up the U.S. leadership in electronics. Already the U.S. sanctions have led the Chinese companies to take out U.S.-designed components from their product lines. Sanctions therefore have not only hit Huawei and other Chinese suppliers but they have also hit the U.S. companies who were their suppliers.

How long will China take to erase the lead that the U.S. and its allies have in semiconductor technologies? Analysis Mason a leading consulting company says in its May 21 report that China will be able to attain self-sufficiency in semiconductors in three-four years. The Boston Consulting Group and Semiconductor Industry Association have modelled the impact of breaking up the global supply chain of China and the U.S. delinking their supply chain and markets. It predicts that with such a policy the U.S. would still lose its leadership to China. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association’s submission to the U.S. department of commerce the only way that the U.S. can preserve its lead is if it allows exports to China—except in the military sector—and uses its profits from these sales to develop the new generation of technologies. Of course along with hefty subsidies from the U.S. government!

Where is India in semiconductor manufacturing? India missed the semiconductor manufacturing bus when it decided not to rebuild the Semiconductor Complex in Mohali after it was destroyed in a fire in 1989. Its policymakers decided that India should leverage its strength in software and systems and not worry about manufacturing chips. Vinnie Mehta formerly the executive director of Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) had said to Mint ten years back “A nation without silicon (technology) is like a person without a heart.” That heart is still missing in the Indian technology ecosystem.

If the U.S. wants to be a world leader it has to match China in investing in knowledge generation for future technology. Why then is the U.S. taking the sanctions route? Sanctions are simpler to implement; building a society that values knowledge is much more difficult. This is the crisis of late capitalism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjbGljay5pbi9jaGlwLXdhci1jYW4tdXMtcmVhbGx5LWdhaW4tY2hpbmFzLXBhaW7SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2xpY2suaW4vY2hpcC13YXItY2FuLXVzLXJlYWxseS1nYWluLWNoaW5hcy1wYWluP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip War: Can US Really Gain from China's Pain?,"With the US imposing technology sanctions on China the world's electronics industry is facing turbulent times.

It is still the world leader in the telecom equipment market with a hefty 31% share twice that of its nearest competitors Nokia and Ericsson and profits of nearly $50 billion in the first six months of 2021. But will it retain its market position without China catching up in chip manufacturing and design technologies?

It is not the Chinese companies alone that face tough times. With growing chip wars between the US and China the global supply chain for electronic chips has been affected and chip shortages have emerged. Semiconductor chips enter almost every product from our lowly household equipment—microwave ovens and toasters—to the most advanced products in the industry. The car industry's biggest bottleneck today is chip shortages which have badly hit production. If the chip wars continue the chip shortage crisis can affect other industries.

Is the crisis of the semiconductor industry the precursor to the fragmentation of global supply chains? Will it lead to warring blocks with the US at one pole and China at the other? With this fragility of the supply chain are we seeing the end of globalisation as a paradigm?

Chip making and the electronics industry are the most capital and research and development (R&D) intensive industries. No other industry has this characteristic. Power or steel plants are capital intensive; pharmaceuticals are R&D intensive. But not both. A little known Dutch company ASML which produces the lithographic machines to manufacture chips is worth more than Volkswagen the world's largest car manufacturer! It is due to the R&D costs that go into their machines: ASML is the only equipment maker that can deliver the machines that the most advanced chips require. Today a new fabrication facility to make the new generation of chips costs $20 billion more than an aircraft carrier or nuclear plant facility. Only two fabricators TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung can produce the most advanced chips that the industry uses.

The US and China compete in areas such as artificial intelligence computers mobile networks and phones. The basic building block of all of these technologies is the semiconductor chip. The more circuity we can pack into a chip the more its computing power. The bulk of the market still consists of older fabricators that use 180 nm to 28 nm level technologies. Only 2% of chips--the most advanced chips--are below the 10 nm level. The only fabricators that can make such chips are TSMC and Samsung the world's largest fabricators. While SMIC of China the third-largest chip fabricator is also at the 14 nm level it only recently moved from 28 nm to 14 nm. With Chinese government support it is investing in production lines that can go below 14 nm. Intel once the world leader in chip manufacturing is stuck at the 14 nm level though it also has plans to develop the next generation of chips.

The US has chosen the electronics/semiconductor industry as a battleground for its geostrategic competition with China. It believes it has a significant technology lead and major market share here. China is a late entrant and though it has comparable market share it is still dependent on certain core technologies that the US and its allies—the European Union Japan and South Korea—control. That is why the US has chosen Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) two major Chinese players as its primary targets for sanctions. The US has put 250 Chinese companies on the entities list that will require special licenses to import equipment or components though it is not a blanket bar.

The US is following up its sanctions on Huawei and SMIC with a plan to bar China from what it calls ""foundational technologies"" under its 2018 Export Reform Control Act. The argument the US is building is a simple one: we are ahead of China in certain critical technologies required for advanced chip manufacture; all we have to do to maintain our lead is deny China access to these technologies; that will ensure we lead in the future and US dominance.

John Verwey an analyst who runs a website on semiconductor technology discusses what a foundational technology is in the electronics industry. At first sight it might appear that chips should be considered foundational technologies and targets of US sanctions. It is what the US did when it barred Huawei from buying the latest 7 nm scale chips from Taiwan's TSMC the biggest chip fabricator.

The SMIC then tried to set up a fabrication line for 7nm chips and needed to import Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machines from the Dutch company ASML. Each machine costs around US$ 120-150 million. Though the EUV machines are from the Netherlands they use software developed in their US subsidiary and therefore is under the US sanctions regime.

The US sanctions mean that ASML cannot sell the EUV lithography machines to China although it can sell other lithographic machines for lower-end chip production keeping China out of the high-end <10 nm technology and therefore a generation or two behind the market leaders.

It brings us to what is a foundational technology. Clearly though chips are key drivers of electronics they are not as foundational as the machines that produce them. To be at the cutting edge of technology we have to master not only chip production technology but also the technology to produce the machines that run the production lines. That is why ASML's lithography machines are the bottleneck for China.

What then drives the advances in key technologies of these machines and chip production? As Marxists know it is knowledge that drives productive forces which in this case is the advances in chip design. This knowledge is captured in the software design tools and lithography machines. They are both highly knowledge-intensive and require people with very specialised skills.

The US and its universities are still the major source of knowledge development which is key to advancing this sector. But here is its long-term problem. The research programs of US universities are mostly staffed with foreign students the bulk of them from China India and other developing countries. A large number of them stay back in the US and provide the human power required for the advances in knowledge that the US has today.

If Chinese students and researchers are not welcome in the US this source of knowledge development will weaken. Unfortunately countries like India have not invested in high-quality education and research laboratories to substitute for the stream of Chinese students entering US universities. China has invested heavily in universities and research institutions overtaking the US to produce many more PhDs in science and technology. It is also building a solid pipeline of innovations from the universities and research institutions to the industry.

In terms of the US semiconductor industry China is the biggest market for the US for its chip designs and design software. The US companies also design high-end chips which get manufactured in Taiwan and China. The US sanctions will undoubtedly damage China in advanced chip production and electronic devices based on them in the short run. But it will also mean that the US companies will lose a significant part of revenues from the Chinese market for sales of design tools. It also means a loss of revenue for advanced chips that the US companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia design and then manufacture in Taiwan's TSMC.

For US high-tech companies the loss of this income means less money for R&D and the slow erosion of its position as the global knowledge hub. If the US companies lose the Chinese market and therefore a significant part of their revenues it will seriously impair their ability to compete in the future. They may gain in the short run as they are with Huawei losing its number one spot in smartphones but in the long term the loss of revenues will lower its ability to produce the knowledge that gives it its edge in technology. Less money in research means an eventual loss of leadership because unlike other countries the US increasingly does not produce the chips or the machines but the knowledge that goes into both.

In a series of submissions to the US Department of Commerce the US semiconductor industry has argued that the US companies delinking from the Chinese market will mean a significant revenue loss and eventually the US will give up its leadership in electronics. Already the US sanctions have led the Chinese companies to take out US-designed components from their product lines. Sanctions therefore have not only hit Huawei and other Chinese suppliers but also their US suppliers.

How long will China take to erase the lead of the US and its allies in semiconductor technologies? Analysis Mason a leading consulting company says in its May 21 Report that China will attain self-sufficiency in semiconductors in 3-4 years. The Boston Consulting Group and Semiconductor IndustryAssociation have modelled the impact of breaking up the global supply chain of China and the US delinking their supply chain and markets. It predicts that with such a policy the US would still lose its leadership to China. According to a Semiconductor Industry Association submission to the US Department of Commerce the only way the US can preserve its lead is if it allows exports to China—except in the military sector—and uses the profits to develop the new generation of technologies. Of course along with hefty subsidies from the US government!

Where is India in semiconductor manufacturing? India missed the semiconductor bus when it decided not to rebuild the Semiconductor Complex in Mohali that got destroyed in a fire in 1989. Its policymakers decided that India should leverage its strength in software and systems and not worry about manufacturing chips. Vinnie Mehta formerly the Director of Executive Director of Manufacturers' Association for Information Technology (MAIT) told the Mint newspaper ten years back ""A nation without silicon [technology] is like a person without a heart."" That heart is still missing in India's technology ecosystem.

If the US wants to be a world leader it must match China in investing in knowledge generation for future technologies. So why is the US taking the sanctions route? Sanctions are simpler to implement. Building a society that values knowledge is much more difficult. That is the crisis of late capitalism"

The analyst firm’s inaugural ZTNA New Wave assessed 15 vendors with at least $5 million annual ZTNA revenues and designated the above-mentioned five as “Leaders.” The next group “Strong Performers” includes Citrix Akamai Netskope and Google. And finally Forrester labeled Proofpoint Cisco Cloudflare Wandera Tencent Security and Juniper Networks “Contenders.” Cisco and Proofpoint while ranked didn’t participate.

Unlike its regular Forrester Wave report the New Wave evaluates emerging technologies. The analysts spent two hours with each vendor and ranked them against 10 criteria. They positioned the 15 on the wave chart based on ZTNA product and strategy. Forrester also reviewed the companies’ market presence.

Zscaler ZTNA

Zscaler has the largest ZTNA market presence according to Forrester and it is also the only vendor that doesn’t have any “needs improvement” areas on its scorecard. However it does say Zscaler must add support for server-initiated applications like VoIP.

“Zscaler has the greatest ZTNA mindshare among Forrester clients” the report says. “The vendor is enrolling organizations with tens of thousands and in some cases hundreds of thousands of users.”

ZTNA which reduces organizations’ attack surfaces by setting secure boundaries around applications and workloads became an increasingly attractive alternative to VPNs during the pandemic and resulting remote workforce. And as such it plays a major role in edge-cloud delivered security and networking capabilities or secure access service edge (SASE) — Forrester calls this “zero-trust edge.”

While Forrester’s latest report focuses on ZTNA Zscaler also ranks at the top of SASE leaderboards. The cybersecurity vendor has pulled several recent high-profile SASE and ZTNA partnerships with the likes of IBM and CrowdStrike and Verizon offers a managed SASE service that uses Zscaler’s ZTNA and secure web gateway.

Palo Alto Networks ZTNA

Palo Alto Networks’ ZTNA product Prisma Access received high marks for its strong combination of deployment options IDP integration and non-web apps. It can be self-hosted deployed as software-as-a-service or used in hybrid environments.

“The vendor’s support for authenticating and authorizing third parties is superior to other ZTNA solutions” Forrester wrote.

However Palo Alto Networks needs to improve its endpoint offering the scorecard says. “Customers say the mobile experience Prisma Access still needs improvement and they report some technical challenges with the endpoint software for desktops and laptops.”

In a blog post about the Forrester New Wave Palo Alto Networks SVP and GM Anand Oswal says ZTNA plays a crucial role in its — and any — SASE platform. “ZTNA offers organizations scalable remote access consistent identity-based access control and continuous trust assessment wherever data or users are” he wrote.

And on the vendor’s most recent earnings call earlier this month CEO Nikesh Arora said Palo Alto Networks nearly doubled its SASE customer count during the quarter to roughly 2500. Of those 25% were new customers.

AppGate ZTNA

AppGate a small Scandanavian network security startup is one of the few vendors evaluated in the ZTNA New Wave that doesn’t offer a full SASE stack. Forrester says while it offers “exceptional” integrations with services like IT service management and configuration management database it lags behind its competitors in inline security inspection.

“ZTNA solutions are usually inline in order to provide authentication and contextual authorization” the report says. “AppGate’s inline security inspection could be improved by adding more behavioral analytics and machine learning.”

VMware ZTNA

VMware on the other hand has superior inline security inspection via technologies including watermarking risk scoring and behavioral analytics Forrester says. Its ZTNA which is part of VMware’s larger SASE platform integrates well with its own endpoint and device security products as well as major third-party vendors the report adds.

However VMware needs to improve its legacy application support according to the New Wave. Companies with numerous non-web applications aren’t a good fit for VMware’s ZTNA until it improves its remote desktop capabilities.

Perimeter 81 ZTNA

The final ZTNA “Leader” Perimeter 81 is the youngest of the bunch. The 3-year-old startup which has raised $65 million to date for its ZTNA and SASE software focuses on cloud-delivered and managed SaaS deployments. Forester calls out Perimeter 81’s ability to handle non-web applications like VoIP as its major differentiator but says it still needs to add integration with Microsoft endpoint security and apply more inline security and analytics.

Perimeter 81’s ZTNA is a good fit for smaller enterprises that want to rapidly deploy ZTNA as a service the report says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVjb3JkLm1lZGlhL2Jhbmdrb2stYWlyLWNvbmZpcm1zLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1waWktbGVhay1hZnRlci1yYW5zb213YXJlLWF0dGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bangkok Air confirms passenger PII leak after ransomware attack,"Bangkok Airways the second oldest and the third biggest airline company in Thailand has admitted last week that hackers stole passenger information during a security breach following a ransomware attack.

The airline confirmed the breach in a press release last Thursday a day after a ransomware gang known as LockBit posted a message on its dark web portal threatening the company to leak data if it didn't pay a hefty ransom demand.

The LockBit gang gave the airline five days to pay the ransom but published the entire 200+ GB of stolen data on Saturday after it became clear that Bangkok Air was not interested in negotiations and decided to disclose the breach on its own terms.

While most of the stolen information appears to be business-related documents the Thai airline said the hackers also managed to steal files that contained personally identifiable data for some of its passengers.

The airline cited an ongoing investigation and couldn't say how many passengers were impacted.

Per the airline some of the personal data that may have been included in the stolen files included data fields such as passenger name family name nationality gender phone number email address contact information passport information historical travel information partial credit card information and special meal information.

Bangkok Airways said it notified local law enforcement of the breach and is now warning customers that some of the stolen data might be weaponized against them through unsolicited calls or emails.

The airline said the attackers might even try to pass as its employee and contact passengers to inquire or request about financial or card-related data.

""The company (Bangkok Airways) will not be contacting any customers asking for credit card details and any such requests"" the airline warned. ""In case of such event occurs passengers should take legal actions.""

LockBit the ransomware gang behind the Bangkok Air intrusion is one of today's busiest ransomware operations after rival gangs such as REvil DarkSide and Avaddon called it quits this summer.

Earlier this month the Australian Cyber Security Centre warned about an increase of attacks from this gang targeting Australian companies. Security firms like Palo Alto Networks Trend Micro and Symantec also published reports on this gang after seeing a surge in activity from its operators.",,,,,,,,,

It is the first installment in a planned trilogy starring Dhanush director Ameer Samuthirakani Daniel Balaji Kishore and Pawan in the primary roles. The blockbuster movie was backed by A. Subaskaran's Lyca Productions and Dhanush's Wunderbar Films with Vetrimaaran's Grass Root Film Company.

Actor Simbu was the first choice for the lead role Anbu but the film re-materialized in May 2015 with a new cast featuring Dhanush as the lead. After the success of the first part the sequel 'Vada Chennai: Rise of Anbu' was expected to go on the floors. But the trilogy plan was minimised as duology reportedly. Even then the second part didn't commence due to financial reasons.

Later Vetri Maaran has revealed in an interview that he is planning to make a prequel web series to the franchise on Netflix. Vetri said that the prequel series titled 'Rajan Vagaiyara' will focus on the life of Rajan character played by director Ameer in the origin film. Now the latest speculation is that actor Ken Karunas has been roped in Rajan Vagaiyara to reprise the Rajan role in 15-24 age portions. Kollywood media sources read that Ken Karunas is taking up special training sessions to fit in the character in Rajan Vagaiyara. He had already starred as Dhanush's son Chidambaram in Vetri Maaran's direction in 'Asuran'. This is the second collaboration of the actor-director duo. On the work front Vetri is busy with the post-production works of ‘Viduthalai’ featuring Soori and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXZkaXNjb3Vyc2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8xNzA5MTgzLWFtZXJpY2FuLXZhbmRhbC1jcmVhdG9ycy1saW5lLXVwLW5leHQtY29tZWR5LXNlcmllcy1hdC1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1c9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXZkaXNjb3Vyc2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8xNzA5MTgzLWFtZXJpY2FuLXZhbmRhbC1jcmVhdG9ycy1saW5lLXVwLW5leHQtY29tZWR5LXNlcmllcy1hdC1wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'American Vandal' creators line up next comedy series at Paramount Plus,"Streaming giant Paramount Plus has ordered 'Players' esports series from 'American Vandal' creators.

Industry grappling with Delta variant

Still reeling from the coronavirus shutdowns of 2020 the live entertainment industry now is grappling with the highly contagious Delta variant which has sent the numbers of COVID infections hospitalizations and deaths soaring in recent weeks.

The New Orleans Jazz Fest canceled its 2021 edition and touring musicians like Oklahoma superstar Garth Brooks Stevie Nicks and Limp Bizkit have scrapped shows including the latter's planned Labor Day weekend performance at Rocklahoma.

With COVID cases primarily rising among the unvaccinated concert promotion giants Live Nation and AEG major festivals like Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza and a growing roster of music stars have announced plans to require proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to attend their events.

Jason Isbell played Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom shortly after instituting his vaccination requirement in early August. The Grammy Award winner has an Oklahoma City show coming up Oct. 10 at The Criterion.

After canceling some dates Michael Buble who has a long-delayed OKC concert slated for Sept. 19 at the Paycom Center (formerly Chesapeake Energy Arena) announced a vaccination rule for his upcoming events Aug. 26. And Dave Matthews Band booked to perform Oct. 15-16 at Choctaw Casino & Resort in Durant declared on Aug. 12 that ticketholders for all announced dates must provide proof of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours prior to entry.

Tyler said a growing number of acts are instituting the requirements at their performances.

""Considering the vast majority of everybody was going towards this model we just thought it would be easier … to get this out there get it in front of and message it (to patrons) answer the questions and move forward with a consistent structure"" Tyler said.

OKC Philharmonic taking measures

Civic Center Foundation Executive Director Elizabeth Gray said masks continue to be required at all times inside the Civic Center Music Hall regardless of a person's vaccination status.

But COVID-19 vaccination and testing policies differ by presenter she said. The Civic Center is keeping a running list of requirements for upcoming shows at www.okcciviccenter.com/health.

Leaders of some OKC arts organizations told The Oklahoman they are still developing COVID policies for their upcoming Civic Center seasons.

The Oklahoma City Philharmonic is launching the local 2021-22 performing arts season in the Civic Center Sept. 11 with the opening concert of its Classics series.

Beginning Sept. 11 and until further notice the OKC Philharmonic will require patrons to provide proof of full vaccination with either a physical vaccination card a picture of a vaccination card or a digital vaccination record along with photo ID.

For unvaccinated people ages 6 and older or those who prefer not to share their vaccination status patrons can instead provide proof of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of entering the venue.

OKC Philharmonic season subscribers with a vaccination card will be required to show it at the first concert in their series and will be issued a pass that will allow them to enter the venue for the orchestra's events without the need to show their card each time.

Subscribers also may submit a copy of their vaccination card and photo ID (with date of birth covered) ahead of time to the box office via email or U.S. Mail prior to the first concert and a verification card will be mailed to them before the first concert.

Echoing the Civic Center policy the philharmonic also will keep requiring masks.

OKC following Broadway's lead

In July New York's Broadway theaters announced that they would require vaccinations for their audience members and OKC Broadway is following their lead in bringing touring musicals to the Civic Center.

Along with requiring masks OKC Broadway — a partnership of the Civic Center Foundation and New York City-based Nederlander Organization — will require all patrons to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

""Fully vaccinated"" means the performance must be at least 14 days after a ticketholder's final vaccine dose. To enter the theater they must bring a photo ID and proof of vaccination in the form of a physical vaccination card or a picture of their card.

Guests who are younger than 12 or need accommodations for medical reasons or for religious beliefs must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to entering the venue.

""We must do this to ensure the continued existence of top-tier live entertainment for years to come"" said Gray who is also OKC Broadway's general manager in a letter to subscribers announcing the new rules.

Preserving capacity is key

Although cutting crowd capacity to allow for social distancing was an acceptable short-term measure prior to the vaccine rollout Tyler said live entertainment venues tours and presenters must be able to be operate at full capacity to stay in business.

On Aug. 19 Tower Theatre and Ponyboy management announced that all guests would be required to provide proof of vaccination — a physical card or photo of a vaccination card along with photo ID — or proof of negative COVID test results from within 72 hours of an event to enter the venues.

Plus all children younger than 12 — who are not yet approved for the COVID vaccine — will be required to wear a mask at all times. The rules go into effect Sept. 8.

Since the pandemic has become so politicized Tyler said venue staffers braced themselves for a barrage of negative reactions when revealing the new rules.

""Not surprising we got a bunch of comments. … But generally speaking we felt especially early on the response was overwhelmingly positive — or that the positive voices in the response were willing to come and fight the negativity for us"" he said.

""We ran a very very very preliminary report over the first weekend … and anecdotally it was pretty much 2 to 1 on sales vs. refunds""",,,,,,,,,,,,

That is something both he and his co-creators Jawed Karim and Steve Chen made sure to tell every new recruit. They promised them nothing beyond “one heck of a ride.”

The trio along with their small group of employees initially worked from Hurley’s garage at his then-home in Menlo Park California.

As their platform continued to grow YouTube officially incorporated and moved into an office.

Hurley who graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania served as YouTube’s first CEO. When the company was acquired by Google in 2006 for $1.65 billion he remained in that position.

In the sale Hurley received 694087 shares along with another 41232 in a trust. At the time the value of the shares was $345 million.

Hurley left Google in 2011. He started AVOS Systems with Chen which later became Hurley’s company MixBit.

Today he is also an investor and the co-founder of GreenPark Sports a digital sports company that dubs itself as “the first mobile proving ground for sports fans.”

It's not something most investors realize but investing in the right stocks can make you wealthy over time. The key is to have the discipline to stay the course even if businesses within your portfolio surprise you with the occasional negative earnings report. I'd argue that if you own a bunch of great companies more often than not they tend to surprise you.

Here are three stocks that if held over many years could easily multiply your wealth.

1. Facebook

Facebook (META -0.03%) occupies a dominant position within the social media space. Its ownership of chat service WhatsApp and picture- and video-sharing site Instagram have only helped the company expand its reach into different customer demographic segments. Since the founding of the company in 2004 by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and its subsequent listing in 2012 the social media giant's share price has risen nearly 10-fold.

The company is still chalking up impressive numbers as evidenced by its fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings report. Total revenue jumped by 56% year over year to $29.1 billion while operating income more than doubled year over year to $12.4 billion. This was driven by increases in the number of ads delivered as well as a jump in the average price per ad. Net income surged from $5.2 billion to $10.4 billion.

Daily and monthly active users also continue to climb. The former statistic has increased from 1.6 billion two years ago to 1.9 billion while the latter has risen from 2.4 billion to 2.9 billion over the same period. Facebook however isn't content with just advertising revenue -- it has also spent a considerable amount of money on virtual reality (VR).

There's a solid reason for doing so. The company plans to eventually launch the ""metaverse"" a virtual world where people can interact with one another using VR gear. The launch of Horizon Workrooms is the first step toward that reality as colleagues can ""meet"" in a virtual conference room similar to having a physical meeting.

It's still early days but the metaverse promises to deliver a whole new social media experience for users. The eventual formation of this metaverse promises to offer many more opportunities for Facebook to monetize thereby generating additional streams of revenue for the company.

2. PayPal

There's probably no better company to represent the online payment sector than PayPal (PYPL -2.12%). PayPal helps to connect customers and merchants and makes it much easier to transact online. The company not only allows secure digital transactions to take place but also provides a digital wallet (Venmo) where users can store money and cryptocurrencies. The pandemic had accelerated the growth of the company allowing it to report its strongest year on record in 2020.

This growth has carried into 2021. Net revenue grew by 19% year over year for the second quarter led by 40% year-over-year growth in total payment volume. A total of 11.4 million net new active accounts were added bringing total active accounts to 403 million.

PayPal is not resting on its laurels though. The company is coming up with new initiatives to boost its business further with a ""Buy Now Pay Later"" (BNPL) service just launched in Australia. This BNPL solution comes with no fees and is available at millions of online stores where the ""PayPal"" button pops up. So far around 425000 unique merchants and close to 4.2 million customers have signed on.

And in yet another boost for the cryptocurrency market PayPal has launched a new service whereby its customers in the U.K. can buy hold and sell four types of cryptocurrency the first expansion of this service outside of the U.S.

3. DocuSign

In line with the growth of the digital economy more and more agreements are also being signed digitally. This is good news for DocuSign (DOCU 1.12%). For its fiscal 2022 first quarter ended April 30 total revenue climbed by 58% year over year to $469 million of which $452 million was subscription revenue.

DocuSign's total customers have grown nearly three-fold from 373000 in the fiscal year 2018 to 988000 as of the end of the quarter. Of these enterprise customers have more than tripled during the same period from 43000 to 136000 reflecting the strong uptake for the company's services.

More importantly customers with an annual contract value of more than $300000 have grown to 673 while the net dollar retention rate stands at 125%. These numbers point to not just increased adoption but also customer stickiness as they continue to spend more using DocuSign's platform.

The company has continued to enhance its product suite with new features such as data visualization tools and improved data verification. Such additions should help it to continue attracting new and existing customers and enable it to continue growing its subscription revenue.

Positioned for further growth

These three companies enjoy multiple tailwinds that will allow them to grow their revenue and net income for many more years. The pandemic acted as a catalyst to accelerate their business growth and this momentum should enable them to continue doing well. You'll be doing yourself a great favor by holding on to these winners over the long-term to enjoy steady share price gains in tandem with the growth of the business. By steadily adding on shares of these companies along the way you can let your money compound and one day even be rich.",,,,,,

D’Aguiar Brothers Ltd. Wieting and Richter’s (W&R’s) Cold Storage and Ice Depot and the Rahaman Soda Factory deployed a wide range of traditional and innovative tactics. This installment introduces some of the advertising from the mid-1940s to the late-1970s when a severe foreign exchange crisis crippled the Guyanese economy.

Most of the advertising used by Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola in British Guiana between the end of World War II and the 1960s was initially developed for the U.S. market. As the examples from the British Guianese newspapers of that era show Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola’s newspaper advertisements were dominated by images of Caucasian women and men in comfortable post-World War II U.S. middle-class contexts. This represented the privileging of Caucasian norms of attractiveness modernity progress leisure and sophistication. When African American faces started to represent the Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola brands in the United States because of the civil rights struggle and efforts to increase market share those changes were also evident in the advertising and marketing materials sent to the colony.

In addition to using newspaper advertisements both brands included point-of-sale posters in their merchandising. Signs and posters were displayed inside and outside cake shops groceries and rum shops which had replaced the “bub” shops as the primary deliverers of sweet drinks for on-site or take-home consumption. During the early 1960s a popular Coca-Cola poster in retail establishments in Georgetown portrayed African Americans in a positive light. A family unit comprising a seemingly contented mom dad and son was shown relaxing in a comfortable setting enjoying sumptuous sandwiches and showing their “good taste” by drinking Coca-Cola. Hitherto the dominant images of African Americans in U.S. consumer advertising were demeaning and dehumanizing caricatures and stereotypes such as sambos golliwogs mammies Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.

The African American struggle for civil rights in the United States was coterminous with Guyana’s anti-colonial struggle. What happened to Black people in the United States was of interest to Black people in British Guiana. In the early 1950s two important sources of information about the experiences including the achievements and suffering of Black folks in the United States were Ebony and Jet magazines. As was the case in the United States readership was high in BG and copies were kept and shared.

Starting in the 1950s Pepsi-Cola which was founded in North Carolina began to target the African American market by placing advertisements in Ebony and Jet. As was the case with the Coca-Cola poster the Pepsi-Cola advertisements in Ebony and Jet featured family units with a seemingly contented mom dad and their daughters relaxing in comfortable settings and being “sociable” with a Pepsi. The impact of these Pepsi advertisements on Guyanese consumer preferences for Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not yet known. Was PepsiCo aware of the potential to influence the tastes of Black people in the Americas when it started advertising in Ebony and Jet? One of the pioneering African American models in U.S. print advertising during this early period was North Carolina-born Sarah Lou Harris. She made the cover of Jet and Ebony magazines on many occasions. She was probably the first African American woman to be featured in a national advertising campaign in the United States. We will meet Sara Lou Harris again.

Unlike the situation with Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola there do not seem to be any Red Spot advertisements produced by North American corporate headquarters. The Red Spot newspaper advertisements were produced by Guyanese advertising agencies including Guyenterprise which was founded by Vic Insanally and Clairmonte Taitt in 1966. Vic Insanally recently reflected on his company’s Red Spot account and the history of advertising in Guyana. He indicated that during the 1950s and 1960s advertising was dominated by two agencies: Bookers’ Carib Advertising and Ace Advertising operated by Vivian Lee. He stated “The foreign firms Lonsdale Hands and Advertising & Publicity (Niall Willis) came with Independence.”

In addition the state-operated Design & Graphics agency managed the extensive advertising and promotion requirements of the new nation state. The workers in these advertising agencies including the copywriters graphic artists photographers and campaign designers were among the most creative individuals in the country. They helped the recently independent nation to nurture a post-colonial identity. From this sector came many of our contemporary beliefs attitudes and behaviors related to being Guyanese.

Working on the Red Spot account was exciting for Guyenterprise. It provided an opportunity to be novel distinctive and cost-effective. The agency’s designs were distinctive. Its body of work is a good representation of post-colonial Guyanese graphic arts advertising and marketing practices. A review of a collection of Red Spot newspaper advertisements created by Guyenterprise reveal the privileging of Guyanese monuments and urban fashion.

Underlying the advertisements was the decolonizing narrative of the early post-independence years. Some advertisements such as the striking “The Champagne Beverage CREAM SODA” were also used as cinema slides a popular advertising platform when cinemas were central to leisure and entertainment. As Vic Insanally noted “Cinema slides were very popular with great audience reach and cheap.” Red Spot’s newspaper and cinema advertisements were complemented by the iconic enamel signs placed at cake shops groceries and other retail outlets.

Radio

By the end of World War II radio had become an important mass communication medium in British Guiana. The establishment of Radio Demerara by the private British corporation Overseas Rediffusion Ltd. in 1950 brought a mode of operation that accommodated several influential environmental forces: the governor and the colonial administration as well as the delivery of key audience segments to the commercial sector.

One of the characteristics of radio in pre- and post-World War II British Guiana has been the “brokerage system.” Individuals or companies purchase radio time to promote their own goods services or in some cases ideology. So it was not strange to have spot advertising by companies (e.g. Wieting and Richter D’Aguiar Imperial House) and programs (e.g. the Crown Rum Swizzle Dance Programme the DeCastro Wine Programme and Ovaltine Amateur Hour) that promoted specific products.

In 1952 DIH launched the “Cash In on Your Ideas Now!” radio promotion. This two-week promotion (Monday September 15 to Tuesday September 30) “offered BIG CASH PRIZES for the best IDEAS submitted which may be used as radio programmes.” The competition rules were provided during a five-minute block (5:25 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) Monday through Saturday on Radio Demerara. The first prize was BG$50 and the second prize was BG$25. There were six consolation prizes of one case of Pepsi-Cola each. The records pertaining to that radio promotion its winners and subsequent D’Aguiar Bros. Ltd. competitions and promotions were destroyed by fire. The reassembling of these details can be done through a careful study of the newspapers of the era. However given the incomplete runs and lack of digitization of available collections such a task is beyond the scope of this project a preliminary exploration of the social history of sweet drinks.

By the early late 1950s the Cola brands in British Guiana began to introduce new approaches such as image advertising which associates a product with the attractive attributes of an unrelated person object or concept. For example the Coca-Cola bottle is evocative of the female body shape. So it was not a stretch for the cola brands to associate their products with women. In 1958 both brands sponsored entrants in the Miss British Guiana Beauty Contest. In the next installment we will explore this and other marketing and promotion tactics in the “war” for the Guyanese sweet-drink market.

At a glance

On August 3 Facebook user Tess Colarte posted a video of physical therapist Ron Samaniego who goes by the name “Dr. Ron” saying that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contains HIV particles. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS.

Starting at the 9:14 mark of the video Samaniego said “Ang iba pang inaatake ng itong vaccine na ito eh actually one part of this vaccine is HIV may HIV particle itong mga vaccine na ito like iyong Pfizer may HIV particles siya.”

(The other thing that this vaccine attacks actually one part of this vaccine is HIV there are HIV particles in these vaccines like the one from Pfizer it has HIV particles.)

As of this writing the post has 6400 reactions 4400 comments 15000 shares and 897000 views.

The claim is false. There are no HIV particles in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

The US FDA’s fact sheet for healthcare providers administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine updated on August 23 does not list HIV particles among the vaccine’s ingredients. The messenger RNA (mRNA) component is “a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.”

The US CDC also has a document that lists down in Appendix C the ingredients of the Pfizer Moderna and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines. HIV particles are not included in the lists of ingredients.

The DOH has also dealt with the claim in a Facebook post on August 20 that addresses several of Samaniego’s claims. It said about the claim that COVID-19 vaccines contain HIV particles: “Hindi naglalaman ng mga sangkap na makakasama sa katawan ang COVID-19 vaccines kagaya ng pagka-baog HIV o ano mang mga sakit.”

(COVID-19 vaccines do not have ingredients that can cause bodily harm such as infertility HIV or any disease.)

The US FDA had given on August 23 its full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to be marketed under the name Comirnaty for use in individuals ages 16 and up. Emergency use authorization for the vaccine still applies for individuals ages 12 to 15 and the third dose in some immunocompromised individuals.

Samaniego has made several dubious claims about COVID-19 and vaccines that both the Philippine Physical Therapy Association Inc. and the DOH have denounced.

Principal Research Scientist at United States drug maker Pfizer Dr Vidia Roopchand has sought to dispel concerns that COVID vaccines were developed overnight but said they date back to the fight against two other coronaviruses.

He said research in tackling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the early 200s and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 formed the basis for developing vaccines for COVID-19.

“A lot of people don’t realise this but people have been working on coronaviruses for at least the last 20 years because the first SARS came out in 2001 so people have been working on spike for SARS and other coronaviruses for a long time… so SARS and MERS allowed us meaning the virology community… allowed us to make all of these structural substitutions” he said.

Speaking on a University of Guyana (UG)-organised webinar on the topic “SARS COV-2 (Covid-19) Viral Physiology and Vaccine Development” he explained that coronaviruses including many of the common cold viruses have been infecting humans for a long time. They include the Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) which has for many years been causing respiratory problems.

“People have been studying coronaviruses for a while but when SARS occurred people started taking notice and around that time there was a revolution i structural biology” he said adding that the technology advanced in making images of crystals. He said after MERS came on the scene scientists said coronaviruses were not as innocuous as they used to think resulting in them being able to examine gene and protein sequences.

He said the evidence shows that the Pfizer jab is neutralising the Delta variant even as he urged more people to be inoculated to reduce the chance of other variants. Dr. Roopchand urged people to visit the United States’ Food and Drug Administration’s website to examine the data on the vaccine.

The Virologist said the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine is made up an RNA sequence lipids some salt sugars among other constituents.

He said the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Emergency Use Authorisation based on the efficacy even as trials had been continuing. The FDA has since granted full authorisation for adults while emergency authorisation continues for children from 12 years upwards. The US government recently donated 146000 doses of the Pfizer jab for inoculating mainly adolescents as part of a ‘back-to-classroom’ plan from September 6 2021.

The Principal Researcher at Pfizer said the efficacy of the polio vaccine lasts a lifetime because the entire virus had been used for that vaccine but RNA was now being used for the first time in the manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Market competition over heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco products has been heating up. While regular cigarette sales have been declining due to concerns about second-hand smoke and increasingly strict regulations the market for HNB tobacco which emits relatively little smoke and smell continues to expand.

Companies have been launching many new products that boast improvements in heating methods and flavor.

IQOS Iluma

Philip Morris International CEO Jacek Olczak said at an event in Tokyo on Aug. 17 to launch a new product for the HNB tobacco brand IQOS that the new product will accelerate the transition to HNB and further grow the market.

The product — IQOS Iluma (suggested retail price at ¥8980 including tax) — hit stores Aug. 18.

HNB tobacco has less odor than regular cigarettes and has become popular because it is easier to smoke at home an advantage since people have been spending more and more time inside due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The company said IQOS Iluma has an improved heating system and better tobacco flavor. It also stated that fragile parts were eliminated to increase durability and it is no longer necessary to clean the inside.

According to Euromonitor International a British research firm Philip Morris had 70% of the Japanese HNB market in 2020. The newly launched product is intended to attract new customers.

Unlike regular cigarettes HNB devices can only be used with certain cigarettes. When someone buys an HNB device they essentially become a loyal customer of the brand. This is why companies put a lot of effort into keeping smokers using their own particular products and devices.

Ploom X

Japan Tobacco Inc. third in the HNB tobacco market in Japan at 10% launched nationwide retail sales of its new product Ploom X (¥3980) on Aug. 17.

The device has a higher heating temperature than the previous model and aims to achieve a flavor closer to that of regular cigarettes such as having a stronger aroma.

Customers can also check the device’s battery level by connecting it to their smartphone.

glo Hyper+

British American Tobacco holds the second-largest market share at 20%. Its new product glo Hyper+ (¥480 on its official online store) was released in January to encourage people to transition from regular cigarettes. It also allows smokers to adjust the heating temperature.

According to the Tobacco Institute of Japan 98.8 billion regular cigarettes were sold in Japan in fiscal 2020 down 16.3% from the previous year and the first time the number was below 100 billion since fiscal 1990.

In contrast sales of HNB tobacco reached 41.3 billion in fiscal 2020 which is more than 40% of the number of regular cigarettes sold. HNB tobacco is particularly popular in Japan which is home to majority of the global market worth about ¥2.1 trillion last year. And with Philip Morris aiming to stop selling regular cigarettes in Japan within 10 years competition in the sector is likely to intensify.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS05OTM1NTQxL0NpZ2FyZXR0ZXMtZ2lhbnQtTWFybGJvcm8tcGF5cy1zbW9rZS1mcmVlLWRyaXZlLmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtOTkzNTU0MS9hbXAvQ2lnYXJldHRlcy1naWFudC1NYXJsYm9yby1wYXlzLXNtb2tlLWZyZWUtZHJpdmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cigarettes giant: Marlboro pays for 'smoke-free' drive,"Tobacco giant Philip Morris International considered selling its Marlboro business to exit the cigarette industry its chief executive has revealed.

But Jacek Olczak said although he had held discussions about offloading Marlboro he decided to keep the business to help finance its growth in 'wellness' products.

His comments come as Philip Morris faces a growing backlash from health campaigners over its controversial plans to buy British inhaler company Vectura.

Philip Morris has said the move is part of its shift from cigarettes to a 'smoke-free' future where it sells less harmful e-cigarettes and 'wellness' products.

Life's a drag: Philip Morris said the move is part of shift from cigarettes to a 'smoke-free' future

Olczak told The Mail on Sunday: 'Yes we had this discussion [about selling Marlboro]. Our conclusion was if we retained cigarettes actually it would accelerate our journey [from traditional tobacco revenues] because I can allocate resources.

'I am in a position to take resources from cigarettes and move them to the reduced-risk products or move them to Vectura which I wouldn't be able to do if I didn't have access to the resources.'

Philip Morris has trumped private equity firm Carlyle's offer for Vectura with a £1.1billion bid for the FTSE 250 pharmaceutical business. Vectura's investors are in the process of voting on the deal.

Philip Morris needs more than 50 per cent of shareholders to support its bid by September 15. The battle intensified on Friday after Carlyle announced it had extended its offer timeline reminding shareholders it was still in the fight.

Philip Morris which is based in Switzerland but traces its roots back to London in 1847 owns a range of cigarette brands including Marlboro Chesterfield and Red & White.

The company is aiming to become a 'wellness' business that generates 50 per cent of its income from 'smoke-free' products by 2025. The company still sells more than 700 billion cigarettes a year.

In an escalation of his war with critics Olczak said Philip Morris needed to buy Vectura to make this vital move or it would have to continue to sell cigarettes indefinitely.

'Technically [by selling the Marlboro business] we could dispose of the problem but it doesn't mean the problem is solved' he said.

'This is a short cut which speaking from a societal perspective doesn't address that problem.

Philip Morris has trumped private equity firm Carlyle's offer for Vectura with a £1.1billion bid for the FTSE 250 pharmaceutical business

'And because we are a large part of the cigarette and tobacco market we are better equipped in the proper allocation of resources: three quarters of my resources go to finding alternatives.

'I've seen a number of markets where if everything is aligned we can stop selling cigarettes in ten years' from now. If I were only a cigarette company I would have no alternative.'

But medics and health experts have warned that the deal could scupper Vectura's key contracts and Government grants.

A group of 35 health experts wrote an open letter earlier this month saying a takeover by the tobacco company would 'significantly hamper' Vectura's strategy of operating as a research-focused pharmaceutical company.

Dr Nick Hopkinson one of the signatories claimed Philip Morris was inextricably linked to a vast number of smoking-related deaths. He said it was 'inevitable' medical experts would boycott Vectura if it were bought by the tobacco giant.

'As there are alternatives not using those inhalers is straightforward' he said. 'For most people switching is easy – there's no practical difference – though some need these inhalers because they're the only thing that works for them.",,,,,,,,,

Ida is expected to become the first major hurricane of 2021 to significantly impact oil gas power and refining operations.

Ida was upgraded from a tropical storm to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph early on the afternoon of Aug. 28 with the US National Hurricane Center projecting that it would strengthen to a major Category 4 storm before making landfall late Aug. 29 along the Louisiana coastline -- and likely just west of New Orleans.

The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said Aug. 28 that 90.84% of the US Gulf's crude oil or 1.653 million b/d already was shut in as well as 84.87% of the region's approximately 2.2 Bcf/d of natural gas production or about 1.893 Bcf/d. An estimated 279 offshore platforms were evacuated -- 50% of the US Gulf's total.

Close to 4.4 million b/d of operating refinery capacity is in the path of Ida as well primarily in Louisiana. Ida's wind speed will play a major role in how hard it strikes at the heart of USGC refining centers according to S&P Global Platts Analytics.

More than 90% of Gulf crude oil offline as Hurricane Ida treks through US Gulf

If the hurricane comes in with the 120 mph winds forecast earlier it could be ""a major factor"" in disrupting refining and petrochemical operations Platts Analytics said. Category 4 hurricanes have winds of at least 130 mph.

""Hurricane Ida is expected to come ashore along the same path as other storms which did extensive damage to USGC refining and petrochemical facilities. Many plants have been hardened against hurricanes but disruptions in operations are still very likely due to flooding power outages and personnel dislocations"" Platts Analytics said.

Louisiana and other Gulf Coast utility crews also were adding extra personnel in preparation for widespread power outages across the region.

A hurricane typically causes power demand destruction as it severs transmission and distribution lines to loads. With weaker demand lower prices would be expected but much of the nation's natural gas flows through Louisiana and Ida could disrupt that infrastructure and increase pressure on gas prices.

**Louisiana's 17 refineries have aggregate capacity of 3.4 million b/d representing about 20% of the nation's total capacity according to US EIA data.

**Mississippi has a total refinery capacity of 394000 b/d according to EIA.

**These refineries accounted for 1.4-1.6 million b/d of gasoline output 1.1-1.3 million b/d of distillate production and 300000-400000 b/d of kerojet supply Platts Analytics said.

**Colonial Pipeline said it was prepared and executing its storm plan.

Natural gas

Production cutbacks ahead of Hurricane Ida exceed those during 2005’s devastating Katrina

Ida barreled into Cuba on Friday after intensifying into a hurricane with 85 mile per hour (130 kph) winds according to the National Hurricane Center. It could become “an extremely dangerous major hurricane” and threaten the U.S. Gulf Coast “catastrophic wind damage” the NHC said.

Top Gulf of Mexico oil producer Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it suspended production at seven offshore platforms and two processing plants onshore. BP Plc stopped work at four platforms. Both said they were evacuating offshore workers.

Chevron Corp. said it was shutting in production at its six Gulf of Mexico platforms and evacuating all workers. BHP and Equinor pulled workers from offshore facilities spokespeople said.

Oil companies had shut 59% of Gulf oil production and 49% of natural gas output according to the U.S. offshore regulator. A total of 90 offshore facilities were evacuated and 11 drilling vessels moved out of harm’s way.

“This could be comparable to hurricanes Laura and Harvey as far as intensity goes” said Joe Bastardi chief forecaster with Weatherbell Analytics referring to two hurricanes with winds of at least 130 mph (209 kph). “In the worst-case scenario it could go as high as a category 5” he said.

During Katrina a hurricane that wreaked havoc in Louisiana supplies were cut by up to 1.53 million barrels per day. Production outages lasted for weeks due to damaged platforms and refineries. Last year’s Delta shut-in up to 1.69 million barrels per day.

Gasoline manufacturer PBF Energy pared production at its Chalmette refinery said people familiar with the matter and Phillips 66 said it was releasing non-essential workers and halting output at its Alliance Louisiana plant. Shell also is stopping fuel production at its Norco refinery and chemical manufacturing at its Geismar Louisiana plant it said.

Oil prices rose nearly 2% on Friday and posted their biggest weekly gain in over a year. Some U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline prices gained for a fourth day with one type of gasoline feedstock up by 600% since Tuesday.

Over 45% of U.S. refining capacity lies along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana’s governor called on residents to prepare for a major storm President Joe Biden issued a federal emergency declaration and New Orleans and coastal officials asked residents to move to higher ground. Five storms made landfall in Louisiana last year causing billions of dollars in damage.

(Reporting by Sabrina Valle Erwin Seba; editing by Dan Grebler and Howard Goller)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd2hkaC5jb20vbmV3cy9hLWh1cnJpY2FuZS1pZGEtdW5rbm93bi1lY29ub21pYy1pbXBhY3Qtb24tcmVnaW9uLWFuZC11cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Hurricane Ida unknown: Economic impact on region and US - Boston News Weather Sports,"A strengthening Hurricane Ida bearing high winds and the likelihood of flooding rain as it heads for the Louisiana coast could damage the energy-heavy Gulf Coast economy and potentially have economic consequences well beyond the region.

The Gulf is not only a major base for oil and natural gas companies but also a vital hub for the nation’s chemical and shipping industries.

Companies evacuated oil and gas platforms south of Louisiana ahead of the hurricane. But a far greater worry was potential damage to refineries and petrochemical plants in its projected path from flooding and storm surge.

Nearly 300 offshore platforms — or half the manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico — were evacuated ahead of the storm their production temporarily halted the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on its website Saturday. Floating rigs also cleared out. In all more than 80% of gulf oil and gas production halted the agency said.

But a potentially more serious concern was the fate of refineries and petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans in or near the projected path of a storm whose maximum sustained winds were expected to reach 130 mph (209 kph) at anticipated landfall late Sunday.

Louisiana’s 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the nation’s refining capacity and can process about 3.4 million barrels of crude per day according to the Energy Information Administration. Many could be vulnerable to flooding. The EIA said Ida could affect local energy supply — especially transportation fuel and electricity.

Less clear is whether the domestic fuel supply might be affected. U.S. daily oil consumption is a little under 20 million barrels a day. Analysts said it was too early to say though S&P Global Platts said the storm could halt production of 765000 barrels a day in gulf output.

It was not immediately clear how many refineries and petrochemical plants might be shut down.

Phillips 66 was halting production at its refinery on the Mississippi just south of New Orleans in Belle Chasse Louisiana due in part to “the potential for storm surge” said company spokesman Bernardo Fallas. It’s daily capacity is 250000 barrels.

Exxon Mobil said its Baton Rouge refinery which produces about 520000 barrels of crude daily continued to operate while Chevron said it had shut down operations at terminals on the Mississippi river and gulf coast and their related pipeline systems. Shell Marathon and Valero also have refineries close to the storm’s projected path.

“The industry has been through this maybe too many times over the last few decades” said Peter McNally an energy analyst at Third Bridge said of the hurricane. Several refineries in Lake Charles west of Ida’s projected path suffered wind damage in Hurricane Laura almost exactly a year ago.

Meteorologist Jeff Masters who flew hurricane missions for the government and founded Weather Underground said Ida is forecast to move through “the just absolute worst place for a hurricane.”

While refineries and petrochemical plants are generally built to withstand high winds they are not necessarily prepared for high water an increasing problem as global warming spurs higher rainfall amounts in big storms.

McNally said the industry is most concerned about flooding which is what cause so much havoc in 2017 with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area where petroleum products were spilled at flooded tanker and chemical plants.

”Louisiana is low so you are prone to the flooding. These things are built to withstand winds but it’s flooding you have tougher time dealing with” he said.

Sixty percent of the gasoline used on the East Coast are shipped from the Gulf Coast much of it through the Colonial Pipeline which is in the storm’s path.

In addition to oil production Louisiana accounts for 9% of U.S. natural gas yields. Last year the state’s two liquefied natural gas export terminals shipped out about 55% of total U.S. LNG exports according to the Energy Information Administration.

More than 90% of Gulf crude and 85% of natural gas production rapidly came offline as of Aug. 28 ahead of Ida's anticipated Louisiana landfall as a major Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds in excess of 130 mph according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the National Hurricane Center.

As of Aug. 28 afternoon more than 1.65 million b/d of crude volumes were shut in or 90.84% of total production as well as 1.89 Bcf/d of natural gas production or 84.87% according to BSEE. An estimated 279 offshore platforms were evacuated -- 50% of the US Gulf's total platforms.

Historically offshore production has returned to pre-storm levels 10-14 days after initial declines placing the week of Sept. 6 as a likely time for production to fully rebound according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. The reduced supply levels helped trigger spikes in crude oil natural gas and refined products prices on Aug. 27 at the end of weekly trading including gasoline and jet fuel prices.

Phillips 66 begins shutdown of Louisiana Alliance refinery ahead of Ida

US Gulf Coast refined product prices ahead of Hurricane Ida

Shell which has shut in production and evacuated all crews from most of its eight US Gulf platforms said Aug. 28 it would resume partial production at its Stones field which is just west of Ida's projected path. Shell had earlier shut in production from Stones when Ida was expected to travel more westward.

Otherwise production remains shut in at Shell's Ursa Mars Olympus and Appomattox platforms. At the Auger and Enchilada/Salsa platforms production has also been shut in while crews will be evacuated from them the Shell said.

Likewise Equinor said Aug. 28 it had shut down its Titan platform. ""All staff are safely evacuated"" company spokesperson Ola Morten Aanestad said.

BP confirmed it had evacuated and shut-in its four deepwater Gulf platforms and Murphy Oil said Aug. 28 it had finished shutting in its volumes. Other Gulf producers including Chevron and BHP said they were evacuating personnel and shutting in much of the offshore production.

Ida is expected to ""rapidly intensify as it moves over the Southeastern and Central Gulf of Mexico tonight"" on Aug. 28 the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was traveling at 16 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph as a Category 2 hurricane early on the afternoon of Aug. 28 according to the NHC.

The Sabine Pilots which serve the channel that feeds the biggest US LNG export terminal operated by Cheniere Energy advised late Aug. 27 that any facilities in the area that want to empty their berths should do so sooner rather than later as Ida approaches Louisiana.

Onshore developments

Platts Analytics said roughly 4.4 million b/d of refinery capacity was in the storm's path primarily in Louisiana. These facilities accounted for around 1.4-1.6 million b/d of gasoline output 1.1-1.3 million b/d of distillate production and 300000-400000 b/d of kerojet supply.

""Hurricane Ida is expected to come ashore along the same path as other storms which did extensive damage to USGC refining and petrochemical facilities. Many plants have been hardened against hurricanes but disruptions in operations are still very likely due to flooding power outages and personnel dislocations"" Platts Analytics said.

Thus far Shell said Aug. 28 it was closing its 230600 b/d refinery in Norco Louisiana and Phillips 66 already had shuttered its 255600 b/d Alliance Refinery in Belle Chasse Louisiana.

""Shell has initiated a safe and orderly shutdown of its manufacturing facilities in Geismar and Norco Louisiana in anticipation of Hurricane Ida"" said Shell's statement also citing its Geismar petrochemical plant.

The NHC warned preparations should be ""rushed to completion today"" in Louisiana. Utility crews in the state said they had ramped up their personnel to help deal with anticipated power outages.

From a gasoline supply standpoint inventories in PADD III are adequate now standing at close to 2.5 million barrels higher relative to the five-year average Platts Analytics said. Still if all the facilities in the path are shut gasoline supplies could be rapidly drained by more than 1 million b/d and stocks could draw down to the lowest levels seen since February in just one week.

Offsetting this is the likelihood that Colonial Pipeline also could be shut or curtailed and gasoline exports would be delayed or reduced Platts Analytics said.

Colonial Pipeline said Aug. 28 it has made preparations for the storm and would continue to monitor its developments.

For petrochemical facilities shutdowns are expected for both steam crackers and their downstream units. Potentially impacted facilities include roughly 6.5 million tons/year of ethylene capacity 3.8 million tons of polyethylene and 1.1 million tons of polypropylene according to Platts Analytics. Other facilities include 3.6 million tons of PVC and 300000 tons of MEG. The price implications are of course bullish especially given that the industry has not fully recovered from the February USGC freeze other outages this summer and logistical challenges said Platts Analytics.

Port and LNG movements

Chevron said Aug. 28 it had closed its Fourchon and Empire terminals in Louisiana and all related pipeline systems.

Port closures ahead of the storm will also cut exports of both crude and products from key facilities along the USGC.

The US Coast Guard said the Port of New Orleans is closed to all inbound traffic and may soon restrict all outbound traffic. The New Orleans Bar Pilots began suspending operations ""earlier than anticipated"" according to a notice from the New Orleans Board of Trade on Aug. 27. Three vessels were expected to depart Southwest Pass early Aug. 28 and one inbound vessel was expected.

The Port of Mobile in Alabama which includes Pascagoula Mississippi and services Chevron's 356440 b/d Pascagoula Refinery also is restricting all inbound traffic.

However LNG facilities in southwest Louisiana -- west of Ida's projected path -- said they were increasingly confidant they would not see significant impacts from the storm.

While Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG continued to operate exports could still be restricted until Ida passes if the channels that feed the terminals shut down. Pilots serving both channels were meeting to assess the situation according to notices to shippers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2h1cnJpY2FuZS1pZGEtMS42MTU2ODc40gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjYxNTY4Nzg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hurricane Ida intensifying en route to Louisiana as officials warn of dangers,"Forecasters warned residents along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to rush preparations Saturday ahead of an intensifying Hurricane Ida which is expected to bring winds as high as 209 km/h life-threatening storm surge and flooding rain when it slams ashore in Louisiana on Sunday.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that super-warm Gulf waters could rapidly magnify Ida's destructive power boosting it from a Category 2 storm to an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane in just 18 hours or less. Landfall was expected Sunday afternoon.

Coastal highways saw heavy traffic Saturday as people moved to escape the storm's path. Trucks pulling saltwater fishing boats and campers streamed away from the coast Interstate 65 in south Alabama. Traffic jams clogged Interstate 10 heading out of New Orleans.

""We're going to catch it head-on"" said Bebe McElroy as she prepared to leave her home in the coastal Louisiana village of Cocodrie. ""I'm just going around praying saying 'Dear Lord just watch over us.""'

Ida was poised to strike Louisiana 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts. A Category 3 storm Katrina was blamed for 1800 deaths and caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans which took years to recover.

Changes since Katrina

""We're not the same state we were 16 years ago"" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday pointing to a federal levee system that's seen major improvements since Katrina swamped New Orleans in 2005.

""This system is going to be tested"" Edwards said. ""The people of Louisiana are going to be tested. But we are resilient and tough people. And we're going to get through this.""

Edwards said 5000 National Guard troops were being staged in 14 parishes for search and rescue efforts with high-water vehicles boats and helicopters. And 10000 linemen were on standby to respond to electrical outages.

A tropical depression two days earlier Ida was strengthening so quickly that New Orleans officials said there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of the city's 390000 residents a task that would require co-ordinating with the state and neighbouring locales to turn highways into one-way routes away from the city.

Lines at gas pumps and car rental agencies grew long as residents and tourists alike prepared to leave Saturday.

""We were willing to wait it out but the hotel said we had to leave"" said visitor Lays Lafaurie of Fort Worth Texas waiting in a rental car line at the city's airport.

Threats extend beyond New Orleans

Ida posed a threat far beyond New Orleans. A hurricane warning was issued for nearly 320 kilometres of Louisiana's coastline from Intracoastal City south of Lafayette to the Mississippi state line. A tropical storm warning was extended to the Alabama-Florida line and Mobile Bay in Alabama was under a storm surge watch.

""I don't think it's ever been tested like it's going to be tested tomorrow or Monday"" Laurent said. ""I bought a dozen life jackets just in case.""

Ida was a Category 2 hurricane late Saturday night with maximum sustained winds of 168 km/h. The storm was centred about 375 kilometres southeast of coastal Houma La. and traveling northwest at 26 km/h. Ida's core was also about 235 kilometres south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Cuba started to clean up Saturday after Ida tore through Isla de la Juventud and then western parts of the mainland. The storm toppled trees and damaged crops and buildings. There were no reported deaths."

On this program we explore terms and expressions in the English language. And today we talk about a word that will help you talk about the best of times. That word is heyday.

If you are in your heyday you are in your prime. You are at the peak of your abilities. You are having your best days ever!

Some people had their heydays when they were young maybe in college or high school. They consider themselves past their prime. They might talk about those past experiences only and not plan for new experiences in the future. These people might be stuck in their glory days.

Other things besides people can have a heyday. If you are at the pinnacle of success you could say your career is having a heyday.

Also a place like a city can have a heyday and so can an industry.

For example I grew up in the rust belt of West Virginia. In its heyday my hometown was known for its steel industry. In fact every man in my family worked in the steel mills. But when the industry shrank the steel factory jobs disappeared. The city fell on hard times and today is still trying to recover. However many other parts of West Virginia are having a tourism heyday because of the beautiful natural environment.

So where does the word heyday come from?

Some word experts say that it first appeared in English in the 16th century as an interjection. An interjection is a word or cry (such as ""ouch"") that expresses a sudden or strong feeling. So ""heyday"" was used to express extreme happiness or wonder.

Around the same time ""heyday"" was also used as a noun meaning ""high spirits.""

Meriam-Webster online dictionary says it was not until the 18th century that the word was used to mean “the period when one’s achievement or popularity has reached its zenith.”

Usually we use heyday in the singular form. Saying the plural is a little less common.

And that’s all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories. Until next time I’m Anna Matteo.

But it wasn’t for a track and field meet.

High school students were in the venue to network with more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and up to 50 employers at the 2021 Battelle College Career & Community Fair.

The event was part of the Classic for Columbus a week of programming activities and a football match between Central State University and Kentucky State University at Ohio Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

Which companies were at the fair?

The building bustled with music and conversation as people hopped around to booths decorated with colorful logos. PNC Bank the Columbus Division of Fire and Quantum Health were just a handful of companies onsite. Students earned a free ticket to the football game if they received a passport stamped by six schools or businesses.

A trio of high school students from Lima Senior High School in northwest Ohio were there checking out potential options for their college careers.

“It’s really nice. I’m learning a lot of information” said Emonie Young a 15-year-old sophomore who wants to study nursing. She said she was interested in learning more about Central State.

“I’m thinking about that one too” said her best friend Honesty Baker also a 15-year-old sophomore who wants to be a traveling nurse. Baker said she learned about an opportunity to take a free State Tested Nurse Aides (STNA) course from one of the companies at the fair.

Anastazja Kirklen a 16-year-old junior who is interested in studying child psychology also is interested in attending a HBCU. But she'd prefer to go out of state “just to be around something different” she said.

How many people attended the career fair?

The fair was presented by Nationwide Huntington Bancshares the city of Columbus the Franklin County Board of Commissioners and Revolution Mortgage. More than 500 students from Columbus City Schools registered for the fair according to James Ragland who is on the Columbus City Schools Board of Education.

“It’s a dream come true for us” said Ragland who was at Saturday's event. “We understood that they’re already thinking about college but many of our students just needed a little bit more of a (push) to get over the hump with that. If we can catch them right now inspire them and move them towards that college track that’s really good for us.”

Ragland said he remembers attending the Classic for Columbus decades ago at the since-demolished Cooper Stadium in Franklinton. The Classic continued to operate in different parts of the state but went on a brief hiatus in recent years.

Classic board member Leonard Hubert said he was excited to help bring the event back to Columbus.

""Anytime you talk about an HBCU Classic everybody thinks football"" he said. ""Football is a central part of it but one of the things we talked about was the importance of having youth exposed to what a HBCU is about.""

How a North Linden church got involved in the career fair

New Salem Baptist Church in North Linden was another partner in the college career and community fair.

“Every day we try to wake up and figure out how the church can use its resources and relationships to create a connected community” said Adam Troy chief engagement officer of the Community of Caring Development Foundation the nonprofit arm of the church.

“Here in this setting it’s very nurturing. We have a number of students here who are high achievers but have just never been introduced to the HBCU experience. Today is about access and exposure.”

Both Adam Troy and his brother Eric attended Morehouse College an HBCU in Atlanta.

Eric Troy founder and CEO of Eficionado a brand management company said it was important to have OSU as a partner.

“We have so many people of color that don’t even see Ohio State’s campus"" he said. ""And so to have that kind of exposure is pretty cool.”

Representatives from rivals Central State and Kentucky State also were present to speak with students.

“We’ve got a lot of exciting things going on"" Lauren Young an enrollment specialist at Central State said. ""We have a brand new president. He’s pushing a lot of great incentives for students. Right now we have free books for all students all year. We have lots of different scholarships available and today we’re just here to spread that news and beat KSU.”

KSU recruiter and 2019 graduate Alona Davidson said it was important to give students opportunities to ""spread their wings"" beyond Ohio.

“When you go to K-State it feels like you’re walking into a family barbecue"" she said. ""You can be yourself fully with no judgment or no bias.”

As the event sponsor Battelle's goal was to ""lean into"" the HBCU community according to Chief Information Officer David White.

""We’re really working hard to embrace what that represents and how we can leverage that to help bring more diversity to the company” he said. “We really want to build that next generation of scientists. We look at the workforce we have today and we see an underrepresentation of people of color. And so we really are trying to figure out 'How do you solve that problem?' And part of that is reaching back into the universities.”

These figures are a reminder of the appallingly low employment opportunities for PWDs in the corporate sector. This untapped talent pool with immense potential and skills are waiting to be harnessed.

There are several reasons which work as barriers for people with disability to enter the workforce. For the person with disability they could range from lack of accessible education/skills lack of financial support to lack of encouragement from family and society to paucity of opportunities in the market supporting their disability and skillset. At times it is the perception on their work-related abilities negative attitudes and insensitivity stemming from ignorance stereotypes and fear of backlash. Also lack of infrastructure lack of sourcing avenues the myth around additional expenditure in the recruitment of PWDs and lack of awareness about disability in corporate India end up impeding the opportunities of people with disability to enter and then grow as part of the workforce.

Changing Landscape

Over the years there have been many constitutional and legal provisions on Disability that have been in our country ranging from the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 Rehabilitation Council of India Act 1992 and the Rights of Persons with Disability Act 2016 which covers 21 disabilities. On the skill front too we have the National Skill Development Corporation focussing on skill-based courses and courses being offered by community colleges and NGOs. Many Indian Corporates too have started doing their bit and have done some exemplary work under their Volunteering and CSR initiatives to up skill people with disabilities and prepare them to enter the workforce.ANZ India Tech Mahindra Spark Minda and Mindtree are a few organizations doing some meaningful work in this space.

Business Case for PWDs

Multiple studies and surveys suggest that inclusion of PWDs carries merit not just on humanitarian grounds. In fact there is a strong business case for their inclusion. As per a report titled “The Road to Inclusion – Integrating PWDs in Organizations” published by the Boston Consulting Group and Youth4Jobs companies hiring PWDs witnessed improved productivity(8-10% higher productivity established in several roles in manufacturing hospitality BPOs) lower attrition rates (5% lower than regular employees)and lower absenteeism which led to better bottom lines higher customer satisfaction levels and creation of a positive brand image.

Multiple other studies reveal PWDs are more disciplined and have a greater commitment towards work. While training them requires a higher investment but once trained their productivity is significantly higher. They are more intrinsically motivated to perform than their colleagues. Many organizations have already started recognising these benefits and have been employing them in large numbers not just as part of corporate social responsibility but rather as an operating model.

Creating an Inclusive Ecosystem for PWDs – Some Best Practices

More organizations have opened up to hire PWDs and mainstream them into the workforce. With an endeavour to build an inclusive and conducive environment for PWDs organizations are considering their specific needs preferences and motivational factors and designing suitable HR practices to attract them. There are 4 major action areas where we see organizations coming up with initiatives to help PWDs grow and sustain.

Employability – Inclusive Hiring - the first and foremost step is tapping this talent pool with appropriate hiring and selection processes in place. The Organizations in the hospitality industry like Lemon Tree InterContinental Sarovar and ITC have identified suitable roles basis the disability in Food & Beverage Service Housekeeping Security Laundry Concierge etc. through various NGOs across the country. Big Bazaar’s too is closely connected with various NGOs that work with PWDs. These NGOs become the recruitment pools from which Big Bazaar hires. Jubilant Food Works runs the “Inclusive Employment Program” for PWDs. Till date they have recruited more than 200 people having hearing and speech impairment across the country in their restaurants. JP Morgan has recruitment drives with Sign language interpreters and other accommodations. SAP has introduced neuro diversity initiatives to recruit applicants on the autism spectrum for suitable positions.

SAP has introduced neuro diversity initiatives to recruit applicants on the autism spectrum for suitable positions. Enablement –Accessibility and Reasonable Accommodations–Organizations are ensuring that they provide employees with disabilities with disabled friendly infrastructure accessible tools and technology and a formal accommodations program. For example Accenture has house nurses/assistants available to help employees with disability in their movement and other personal requirements at work if needed. They have special medical cabs for persons with disabilities. For hearing and speech impaired employees the transport team is trained to communicate through SMS. Including Accenture companies like ANZ and Loreal have done accessibility audits and are working on ergonomics of the offices by introducing things like having braille name plates on doors of conference rooms automatic doors contrasted sign ages accessible workstations apart from providing assistive devices such as wheelchairs joysticks and pedals to help employees work conveniently.

Empower – it is important to ensure that employees with disability are treated equally and not differently when it comes to performance evaluation compensation or training and upskilling them for current and future roles like any other employee in the organization. Their skill development needs might be different; hence a lot of organizations have IDPs Mentorship programs Career mapping initiatives in place to identify their training needs and accordingly design specific development programs for them. Organizations today support Like Jubilant Food Works boast of being the first company in India to institutionalize the Inclusive Development of PWDs.

Organizations today support Like Jubilant Food Works boast of being the first company in India to institutionalize the Inclusive Development of PWDs. Sensitization -To ensure acceptability and smooth transition of PWDs in the workforce sensitization of all stakeholders from the leadership to HR recruitment leads and teams facilities and operations teams and peers of the new recruits is important. This is imperative to demystify the myths around disability and overcome the cultural stigma associated with it. As part of the onboarding process organizations like lemon tree make it mandatory for employees to go through sign language training to promote ease of communication with their colleagues with speech and hearing impairment.

In the end if we look at the best practices the focus across organizations has largely been on visual and hearing disabilities. Awareness on disabilities like multiple sclerosis Parkinson’s disease and acid attack victims is still very low in the corporate sector and their inclusion therefore is low. Also it is important to note that simply having these policies and best practices in place does not help in the upliftment and empowerment of PWDs. Organizations need to ensure that their practices/policies are inclusive and not divisive in nature to ensure that they create a level playing field for PWD’s to enter and grow in the organisation.

The World Bank considers that leaving persons with disabilities outside the economy translates into a foregone GDP of about 5% to 7%. These are figures to ponder upon. Today we need more such forward looking and inclusive organisations in the country to play a pivotal role in partnering in this journey of building an inclusive society. Not only will such initiatives improve the employment opportunities and quality of life for people with disabilities but also bring in substantial gains to the economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHJlYWRpbmcuY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vd2hhdHMtb24tbmV3cy90aGFtZXMtbGlkby10aW55LXBpZWNlLWhlYXZlbi0yMTM4ODkxMtIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldHJlYWRpbmcuY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vd2hhdHMtb24tbmV3cy90aGFtZXMtbGlkby10aW55LXBpZWNlLWhlYXZlbi0yMTM4ODkxMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thames Lido: The tiny piece of heaven minutes from Reading town centre,"In the heart of urban Reading just a 10-minute walk from the town’s main train station is a private paradise for anyone looking to cool off in the – admittedly quite elusive – summer sun.

In 1903 women seeking a secluded swim had the benefit of a private pool protected by a canopy of trees. The Thames Lido drew water from its eponymous river filling a somewhat chilly basin known simply as the Ladies' Swimming Bath.

Following an Act of Parliament allowing them to spend tax revenues on public health Reading Corporation had built the biggest pool in the south of England (at 79m by 24m) in 1879 – but only men were permitted to swim there.

The Ladies' Swimming Bath offered Edwardian women the same exercise opportunities as their male contemporaries plus changing booths and enclosed showers to preserve their modesty.

The 1950s saw water pumped from a mains supply rather than the river while heating was also installed at the pool then known as Kings Meadow Baths. This heating was never switched on however and the facility fell into disrepair and was finally closed in 1974.

The building was Grade II listed in 2004 but its future was still in doubt. After rejecting plans to build a hotel on the site Reading Council granted redevelopment rights to a group of local campaigners – but their vision for the amenity was undefined.

Arne Ringner and his management team from Bristol Lido were chosen to restore the swimming pool to its former glory – and then some.

“It fell into near-collapse by the 1980s when heated indoor pools in modern leisure centres were the fashion” said Mr Ringner.

(Image: Thames Lido)

“The idea of swimming in an unheated pool was not interesting to kids at the time. So the corrugated iron roof was rusted gaping holes were developing and water was penetrating and it deteriorated very rapidly.”

The timber frames holding the roof up were in “very perilous condition” and even the walls had been penetrated by water and frost. The amenity also fell victim to vandalism.

""Vandals had full access” Mr Ringner added “and anything which could be smashed was smashed.”

But the Bristol Lido team could see great potential. In 2017 after a three-year restoration costing £3.5m the pool complex was reopened – complete with a restaurant and tapas bar bringing a “strong Spanish and Mediterranean feel” to the venue.

Now it offers saunas hour-long spa treatments and even a “swim massage and meal” package as well as time in the (finally) heated pool for both members and visitors.

“It’s now been open for three years and it’s doing well” said Mr Ringner. “Now we’re the jewel in the town's crown probably on a par with Reading Castle.”

Membership to the exclusive pool complex costs £649 per year or £59 per month with visitor passes costing £20 per person (when available).

Some have suggested that this makes the amenity – originally built for the public good – more exclusive than its builders intended.

But fans of the facility have defended it pointing out that annual subscribers attending four times a week pay the equivalent of around £2.50 per swim.

""These lidos become very much loved institutions” said Mr Ringner. “People come once a week or more and you get a community around the swimming – I’m very pleased that is happening.

“In Bristol we’ve had that for 14 years. It’s somewhere people meet for a swim a drink and a chat and that’s now slowly developing in Reading too.”

Of the price he added “It’s about the same as an annual gym membership. There’s a similar facility near Slough where membership is twice the price.

“It’s not like a local authority pool where you just pay £3 for a swim but that’s maintained at taxpayer expense. The way we run Thames Lido we can maintain the fabric of the building for as long as people want to use it – and something has to pay for that.”

The price is not so high that it puts most people off as evidenced by the waiting list of hundreds who wish to become members.

""It’s not just about the chattering classes coming from Henley” Mr Ringner added. “And it’s not a members’ club – it’s open to everyone. Anyone can come and use the restaurant bar and spa.”

Making access as open as possible is part of Mr Ringner’s culture – it's in his blood you could say.

“[Co-owner] Mark Thwaites and I are both Scandinavian brought up in a world where access to these facilities are treated as a common right” he said. “So we don’t want to put up barriers to access.

“If you took a socioeconomic cross-section of members you would find that it is quite broad.”

The vast majority however are over 18.

""Children can come but generally it is for grownups” Mr Ringner added. “It’s somewhere kids aren’t encouraged to scream and shout all the time. If you go to a public pool the din is almost unbearable.”

Just as in 1903 when it was first built Reading’s lido is somewhere for adults to take care of their health – both physical and mental.

""I think it’s important to take time out” said Mr Ringner “sit by the poolside maybe have a coffee maybe have a swim maybe have a treatment. It’s just for the indulgence of the senses.”

Great demand means that the pool is only open to members and those buying swim-and-eat packages. See ThamesLido.com for more information.

We brought ROAR and agencies together to launch the city’s first mobile COVID-19 vaccination bus visiting the neighborhoods where many restaurant staff live thus breaking down barriers between restaurant work schedules and vaccination sites.” What would you like to see change in New York state politics and government? “One dynamic that we’re already seeing change is representation of women at the highest ranks with Kathy Hochul assuming the role of governor.

Few of those millions however are aware of what’s happened in Richmond California. Over the past year the city has quietly implemented one of the most important police budget reallocations in the country. Richmond is leading the way on shifting public resources away from more and more policing and toward social programs that can achieve real public safety. The landscape of Richmond crime posed a particular challenge for this work. Throughout the aughts the FBI regularly ranked Richmond as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. Gun violence dominated public perception of the area. Marked reductions in homicide and overall crime rates were narrowly attributed to police chief Chris Magnus who helmed Richmond Police Department (RPD) efforts at community relations. We are a city that has long understood itself to love and need a whole lot more of the police. This despite the RPD’s high-profile scandals. In 2014 twenty-four-year-old Richard “Pedie” Perez was shot and killed by police officer Wallace Jensen. Perez was unarmed posed no threat to others and had committed no criminal act. The DA declined to prosecute Jensen. Richmond police also participated in the sexual exploitation of Celeste Guap a teenage sex worker who testified that on-duty officers from multiple Bay Area law enforcement agencies including RPD both sexted and hired her while she was underage. RPD leadership abetted the cover-up of the case and no criminal charges were ever filed against the nine participating officers. Six were issued written reprimands while three were fired. These scandals made no real dent in the city’s embrace of police as the cornerstone of public safety. Before this year roughly 40 percent of Richmond’s general fund went to policing while only 7 percent total to such community services as libraries and parks and recreation. Police salaries make up the bulk of the $67.2 million RPD budget: the average annual cost of a sworn armed officer is over $300000. True energy to reform RPD erupted after the May 2020 police murder of George Floyd. As in the rest of the country organized protests took place across the city. One month later the Richmond City Council set up an official Reimagining Public Safety Community Task Force to study the issue aiming to transition away from the RPD’s “event response” model and exorbitant budget consumption. Early discussions yielded a decision to not use the phrase ‘defunding the police.’ The consensus was that it required too much explanation and fed into conservative narratives about punishing police. The official task force represented both an opportunity and a danger. Discussions about redefining public safety were given new legitimacy. But subject to constrictive city procedures and appointments hostile to reform (including the head of the police union) the new committee could have also been the cemetery where progressive public safety ideas went to die. What saved the project was a combination of long-term electoral efforts by the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) and the sustained campaigning of a new community group now known as Reimagine Richmond.

The RPA and Reimagine Richmond Since its incorporation in 1905 Richmond has been a largely working-class ethnically diverse city. Situated on thirty-two miles of Bay Area shoreline its longtime economic engine was heavy industry and shipping; in recent decades the city has become a virtual company town for the Chevron oil refinery it houses. Established in 2004 the RPA initially came together to challenge the domination of city politics by Chevron and the corrupt police and fire union political machine. Although Richmond elections are nonpartisan the RPA began to function as its own quasi–political party coordinating candidate campaigns and providing ongoing support when its candidates were elected. It succeeded in electing a council member then mayor (an RPA cofounder) then more council members. In 2014 Chevron made a multimillion-dollar effort to win a friendly council; the oil giant was defeated decisively by the RPA slate which openly refused all corporate contributions. During the early response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests the RPA held two of the seven council positions. After the November election the RPA secured four seats with occasional support from a fifth non-RPA-affiliated member. The RPA’s protracted emphasis on developing leftist candidates and achieving electoral power would fuel the task force proposals to come. But the progressive majority needed actual policy to implement. The full campaign designing and messaging about a robust alternative to policing came directly from Reimagine Richmond a grassroots group aiming to create a responsive safety system through community-centered non-law-enforcement solutions. A collective vision emerged despite the new coalition’s internal range of views on public safety. Stances toward policing ranged from prison abolitionists to reformists who believed police a necessary social force requiring more oversight. These tensions should be expected when building policy on new political terrain particularly around such life-and-death issues as policing. Nor did these ideological tensions make the work impossible. Reimagine Richmond prioritized addressing the root causes of crime and poverty and that laser focus made ideological disagreements secondary to building effective programs. Early discussions for instance yielded a decision to not use the phrase “defunding the police.” The consensus was that it required too much explanation and fed into conservative narratives about punishing police. This decision did not mean the slogan’s proponents were forced to acknowledge its general ineffectiveness or reject the “defund” sentiment altogether. The rhetorical concentration we determined should remain on the positive project: Richmond must achieve a public-safety system for all. Reimagine Richmond created subcommittees to conduct both external research — what other cities had done or are doing — and Richmond-specific conditions such as how many 911 calls actually required an armed response. The task force then put some of that research into play. After a year it presented its four key programs all to be funded by police budget funds. The first builds out the Office of Neighborhood Safety (ONS) with $1.6 million of reallocation funds. ONS is an established city-run department centered on interrupting gun violence via street outreach and retaliation prevention. Developed in 2007 when Richmond was still ranked the ninth-most-dangerous city in the country ONS uses multidisciplinary research methods to assess which residents are most likely to either shoot someone or be shot themselves. The department does not share information with RPD and has helped reduce gun violence and the financial burden of shootings on the city. The second recommendation establishes a Community Crisis Response Program using $1 million in reallocation funds. Similar to the CAHOOTS system in Eugene Oregon a three-person team with mental health and medical expertise will be dispatched to the scene of certain mental health emergencies and gradually domestic conflicts and noise complaints. The third prong of our proposal expands support for unhoused people by approximately $1.8 million in reallocation funds. Safe Organized Spaces (SOS!) Richmond the community group primarily responsible for this dimension will use funding to improve hygiene and sanitation options for unsheltered people and provide jobs and job training reducing police interference at encampments. Finally the city’s YouthWORKS program will receive approximately $1.93 million in additional support. YouthWORKS assists young people aged 14–24 in job training and placement. Departmental capacity will thus grow from serving 125 Richmond youth annually to 500. Our slate of proposals recognizes that policing exacerbates the social issues it claims to fix. These interventions are tailored to the local characteristics and needs of our city. Simultaneously a larger structural analysis is at play here: this slate of proposals recognizes that policing exacerbates the social issues it claims to fix. Underpinning these programs is the clear conviction that economic disempowerment and poverty contribute to crime and make residents more vulnerable to violence; that our economic system withholds supportive structures to treat mental illness and forces people into committing desperate acts just to survive; and that racial justice must be braced by policy that reduces interactions with armed police.

Attacks That Didn’t Stick Bad-faith criticism of the work has been a major obstacle. The police union and Mayor Tom Butt a centrist Democrat particularly cozy with real estate developers and the RPD union have gleefully seized upon the pandemic crime wave narrative. Police budget cuts would cause incalculable harm to the department we were told. Longtime councilmember Nat Bates a former probation officer and vocal opponent demanded the police chief provide detailed crime reports at virtually every council meeting. After a shooting at a private party the mayor actually blamed the RPA for the violence insisting criminals felt emboldened because the police budget may be cut at some future time. Another favorite talking point was that RPD is different from other police forces as it does not have military-grade weapons does not cooperate with ICE and has flirted with community policing. (It is worth noting that current municipal restraints on police resulted from prior organizing done by the RPA and other community groups). Otherwise however there was little resistance to the actual programs developed by the task force — skeptics just did not want to reduce the police budget by even a small amount. In response we pointed out that large sections of the Richmond community did not feel safe from police presence that RPD is not devoid of the problems embedded within law enforcement culture and that Richmond absolutely could not continue to cut all other services to sustain RPD’s bloated costs. These narrative challenges are only two examples of many. But the pushback proved instructive: Reimagine Richmond began to keep closer watch on messaging which evolved to include a greater understanding of why some sections of the community feared police budget cuts. Emphasis on racial justice did not always prove effective particularly as we experienced the stark generational divide defining supporters versus opponents. And it was not merely white retired property owners who expressed fear; older generations of people of color also expressed the very real memory of police unresponsiveness in their neighborhoods. Reducing the police budget summoned past ghosts of racial injustice for this demographic. Organizers learned to pivot quickly and flexibly in our messaging; became willing to expand responses based on audience without ceding ground on our key principles; and perhaps most importantly for maintaining cohesion among left coalition-building recognized that the multiplicity of ideologies in Reimagine Richmond helped metabolize our responses to various community concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOS9wb2xpdGljcy9kZW1vY3JhdHMtYmlkZW4tcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzA4LzI5L3BvbGl0aWNzL2RlbW9jcmF0cy1iaWRlbi1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden is holding together the Democratic Party in Washington -- for now,"CNN —

Almost a year before Joe Biden was elected president fellow Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remarked in a New York Magazine profile that “in any other country” she and Biden “would not be in the same party.”

“But in America” the New York Democrat added with some resignation “we are.”

More than a year-and-a-half later the comment – which stirred up indignation at the time among some Democrats who viewed it as divisive – has been largely forgotten amid a continuing pandemic and now the unfolding situation in Afghanistan. But the truth in her words does a lot to explain the challenges now facing Democratic lawmakers who successfully walked a tightrope to legislative achievement with their initial Covid-19 “rescue” plan and are currently attempting another crossing as they negotiate the passage of a bipartisan infrastructure package alongside an even larger social spending bill.

That the fates of the two bills one championed by moderate Democrats and the other by progressives are tied together is in itself a neat metaphor for the broader dynamic influencing the party’s path in the Biden era as it seeks to show it can deliver for the American people ahead of next year’s midterms. Neither package has enough support to pass in the House of Representatives without disparate factions of Democrats agreeing to vote for legislation they would not under other circumstances be inclined to back. Democrats are in sum doing the work of a coalition government – the kind of fraught patchwork majority more typically found in the parliamentary democracies of Western Europe.

To advance any and all pieces of their shared agenda Democrats need unanimity in their Senate ranks and can only afford to lose a handful of votes in the House. Those thin margins and the fragility of leadership’s best laid plans came into stark focus these past few weeks during an eleventh hour revolt against what Washington insiders call the “two-track strategy” which aims to put both bills on Biden’s desk at about the same time – a legislative tactic of mutual assured destruction with both sides empowered to scuttle the other’s top priority.

Rivals on the trail allies on the Hill

The political battlefield is complex with overlapping incentives that mean primary season rivals can be allies on legislative matters.

That dynamic was on display during the recent standoff over the timing of a House vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill which has already passed in the Senate. A breakaway group of centrist House Democratic lawmakers demanded it come immediately to the floor a move that could have potentially stranded the legislation sought by the left. Eventually the group struck a deal with leadership allowing the both tracks of the process to move forward. But those few white knuckle days full of tense private meetings calls from the White House and the launch of pressure campaigns from outside groups underscored the tenuous nature of not only the legislation at hand but the party’s status quo.

After the agreement was in place New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the House Democratic Caucus Chairman summed up the fundamental political incentives that carried the day.

“The most important thing is as Democrats we remain united behind the objectives that have been set by President Biden” Jeffries said. “Democracy is messy and Democrats are not a cult we’re a coalition.”

The parameters of that coalition have evolved in recent years with the growth of the party’s progressive wing both on Capitol Hill and among a Democratic electorate increasingly supportive of more ambitious policies.

“The power struggle between establishment or corporate Democrats versus progressive shows how far we’ve come in a short amount of time. How far the progressive movement has come” said Joseph Geevarghese executive director of Our Revolution a progressive group founded in the aftermath of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. “We’ve gone from the outside being locked out being forced to take to the streets to actually having a seat at the table and real power and leverage where leadership has to take us seriously.”

The oddsmakers’ favorite to succeed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in leading the Democratic caucus if she retires in the coming years Jeffries a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has often flown the moderate flag on the front lines of the intra-party electoral fights. Some have played out in parallel to Democrats’ work in Washington. The special election to replace former Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge who gave up her seat in the 11th Congressional District to become Biden’s Housing and Urban Development secretary launched a proxy fight that pitted former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner a staunch Sanders ally and surrogate against the establishment backed-Shontel Brown a councilmember and local party chair. Brown ended up defeating Turner by a comfortable margin a result Jeffries and other moderates crowed over in the aftermath.

Jeffries’ pushback against the progressive primary apparatus conducted simultaneously with his work to make and maintain a unified front in Washington underscores the party’s sometimes awkward internal political realities.

In June Jeffries – along with New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell – announced the formation of an organization designed to defend incumbent Democrats who might face primary challengers. In effect the group was designed to match wits and dollars with Justice Democrats the group that backed Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive outsiders like Missouri Rep. Cori Bush and New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman both of whom defeated moderate longtime incumbents in 2020.

But even as the left lines up its challengers and moderates prepare to launch a well-funded counteroffensive they were ultimately pushing for the same legislative outcome on Capitol Hill even if they used different methods and messages – including outside attacks against each other – to get there.

During the standoff over the timing of the infrastructure vote Organize for Justice a sister organization of Justice Democrats joined other progressive groups to buy television and digital ads attacking the members of the rebel lawmakers in their home districts. Gottheimer was among those targeted.

“Constituents deserve to know the truth about how these nine conservative Democrats are blocking urgent action on jobs climate and child care” Alexandra Rojas of Organize for Justice and Justice Democrats said in a statement last Monday morning. “Americans have been waiting for over a decade for action on many of these issues it’s time to deliver results.”

Despite Gottheimer’s lead role in the drama over the timing of the infrastructure vote which threatened to undermine House leadership – of which Jeffries is a member – the mission of the new PAC called Team Blue remains unchanged.

“Team Blue PAC looks forward to supporting members of the House Democratic Caucus family” a source familiar with Jeffries’ thinking told CNN “with an emphasis on defending effective progressive legislators like Carolyn Maloney John Yarmuth and Danny Davis who are advancing the Build Back Better agenda.” (Maloney from New York’s 12th Congressional District and Davis from Illinois’ 7th are both facing primary challenges from Justice Democrats-backed candidates. Yarmuth the longtime congressman from Kentucky’s 3rd district is facing a primary fight with a progressive state lawmaker.)

Biden’s White House: keepers of the peace

The larger partisan bill that will need to be passed through the budget reconciliation process would – according to its early framework – create a universal pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds offer new child care benefits to working families and for the first time eventually provide a federal guarantee of paid parental family and personal illness leave. In addition to measures designed to curb climate change and invest in affordable housing it would also increase subsidies for Obamacare and after so many years of debate and advocacy lower prescription drug prices and expand Medicare – lowering the eligibility age while beefing up the popular program to include dental vision and hearing benefits.

Taken together the legislation would represent the largest and most consequential expansion of aid and protections to the social safety net in a generation. For many on the left it also amounts to a marker of the movement’s growing influence.

Though progressives still lag other factions of the party in terms of representation in Congress Biden and his team have since he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee in 2020 worked relentlessly to build a working relationship with the left and its energetic base.

Sanders his closest competitor and the final rival to fall on Biden’s late surge to the nomination has returned the favor. Ascending to the chair of the Senate Budget Committee after the Democrats with whom he caucuses won their Senate majority Sanders has worked closely with the White House even as some of his top campaign priorities like “Medicare for all” have been sidelined.

The White House in turn has provided a backstop for progressives during the push to get both of the party’s legislative priorities over the line. When the group of nine Democrats demanding an immediate House vote on the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill said Biden shared their desire the White House knocked them back.

“(Biden) has been clear that he wants both bills on his desk and that he looks forward to signing each” White House spokesman Andrew Bates told NBC News on Monday adding that the President supported Pelosi’s broader approach to steering the White House agenda.

The insistence from Pelosi that the process move forward on two tracks along with the public lines from the White House when silence might have upended the dynamic in the House reinforced growing confidence among Hill progressives that Biden could be trusted. Both the President and his director of legislative affairs Louisa Terrell were among those working the phones to help end the stand-off.

“All those pieces made me feel that we’ve got the ammo that we need going into the next stage of negotiations” a senior aide involved in progressive Democrats’ strategy told CNN suggesting they view moderate Senate Democrats as the next big hurdle. “And for whatever (West Virginia Sen. Joe) Manchin and (Arizona Sen. Kyrsten) Sinema’s antics they’re not talking about allowing the reconciliation bill to be stranded.”

Democrats – whose majority is only as useful as their near unanimity – appear to be on a path to fulfilling Biden’s ambitious framework. The party has shown to date that it can be both in “disarray” and a functioning operation – and that the imperative to act in coalition appears to be winning the day.

The umbrella group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil or APIB put together the protests as part of the weeklong “Struggle for Life” protest in the capital Brasília in anticipation of a decision from the Supreme Court that could invalidate Indigenous land claims.

“Our struggle takes as its target all governments that are complicit in Bolsonaro’s campaign of genocide all corporations that seek to profit from it” APIB said in a joint statement with Progressive International a left-wing coalition that sent a delegation to survey the situation. “The fight against Bolsonaro extends far beyond the borders of Brazil.”

“We are the ones suffering. The government doesn’t suffer. So that’s why we’re here to fight.”

APIB expected the Supreme Court would strike down a challenge to Indigenous land claims during its protest but the court postponed the judgment to next week after one vote was cast in favor of Indigenous rights. One right-wing lawmaker whose fortune comes from agriculture said he and his colleagues lobbied the justices to further delay the ruling so that Congress has time to pass measures that would strip Indigenous land rights through legislation instead of the courts.

Since 2019 Bolsonaro has used his executive authority to aggressively attack Indigenous rights slash environmental protections and cripple relevant law enforcement efforts — moves that have drawn international condemnation. Closely aligned with the powerful agribusiness lobby the government has also pushed forward a slew of consequential bills in Congress that if passed would be a death sentence for many of Brazil’s Indigenous communities and critics warn the entire Amazon rainforest.

“We are the ones suffering. The government doesn’t suffer” said Pasyma Panará president of the Iakiô Association in the Xingu region of the Amazon. “So that’s why we’re here to fight.”

The delegation from Progressive International included a member of the Spanish parliament Indigenous leaders labor activists and two U.S. congressional staffers who were participating in a personal capacity. The group traveled to Brasília and the Amazonian cities of Belém and Santarém for a week of meetings with Brazilian politicians and environmentalists and groups representing Indigenous communities labor and landless peasants.

“This delegation aims to bring the eyes of the world to Brazil” David Adler general coordinator of Progressive International told The Intercept. “We are here to develop a common strategy to confront the crises that are facing Brazil.”

Struggle for Life

More than 6000 representatives of 176 Indigenous groups pitched tents and lashed together bamboo shelters for seven days of protest and cultural exchange. The encampment sat on a dusty patch of land in the capital less than a mile up the main promenade from Congress the Supreme Court and the presidential palace.

To participate delegates from the most far-flung corners of Brazil’s massive expanses spent as many as three days on packed buses that navigated washed-out dirt roads traveling under the threat of ambushes from paramilitary gangs.

Before rousing speeches by movement leaders and allies could begin on the main stage groups of Xikrin Munduruku Xukuru and others dressed in full ceremonial regalia and performed traditional dances and songs for the crowd. Tech-savvy Indigenous influencers and journalists livestreamed the proceedings on social media engulfed in plumes of red dust.

“We know what evil is. Evil is the agribusiness invading our territories.”

“We know what evil is” said one speaker to applause. “Evil is the agribusiness invading our territories.”

Brazil’s Indigenous people have no shortage of reasons to protest. Their ancestral lands are increasingly threatened by major agricultural infrastructure projects and violent land thieves aided by government agencies. Violent attacks are on the rise and environmental degradation is making traditional ways of life less tenable.

Meanwhile Congress has been voting on one bill after another that would undo the hard-fought protections written into the 1988 constitution. Under Bolsonaro everything has gone from bad to worse.

For weeks organizers have been primarily focused on the Supreme Court decision that could substantially reduce constitutionally protected Indigenous territories. “It is one of the most important judgments in history” said APIB leader Sônia Guajajara in a livestreamed event last Thursday. “The struggle of Indigenous peoples is a struggle for the future of humanity.”

The measure known as the “Milestone Thesis” or “Marco Temporal” in Portuguese would invalidate the land claims of Indigenous groups that did not physically occupy the territory on the day the new constitution was signed in 1988 ignoring centuries of genocidal oppression that forced many tribes to flee their ancestral homes.

Indigenous land rights are enshrined in Brazil’s Constitution but the government has moved at a snail’s pace over the last three decades to process claims. Meanwhile Brazil’s agribusiness mining and lumber industries with their international backers have their eyes on many of the vast tracts of land mostly located in the Amazon that are claimed by natives. The business interests have been chipping away at the protections by any means necessary in the courts in Congress and on the ground.

Illegal invasions into Indigenous lands by violent heavily armed groups have been on the rise in recent years. Criminal groups have been emboldened by Bolsonaro who campaigned on the promise that if elected president “there won’t be a centimeter demarcated for Indigenous reserves” and has made racist genocidal comments about Indigenous peoples throughout his career.

“The Marco Temporal represents for us Indigenous peoples a declaration of extermination” said Eloy Terena a lawyer and Indigenous rights activist during an event last Thursday. Terena pointed out that many of Brazil’s 114 uncontacted tribes which rely on government protection live in territories that could be threatened if the Marco Temporal legal thesis is upheld.

Fight for Representation

The only way to put the brakes on the tractors that are plowing through the Amazon Rep. Joênia Wapichana told The Intercept is a “political renewal.” Indigenous people and their allies must “attain the majority within Congress” she said something that has never happened. “Maybe that way they might think twice before putting forward a proposal to reduce Indigenous rights.”

Wapichana 47 is Brazil’s first female Indigenous lawyer and member of Congress. She is currently the country’s sole Indigenous representative. At the “Struggle for Life” protest she got the rockstar treatment: Wherever she went adoring fans lined up to snag selfies.

In a meeting with a dozen leaders from some of Brazil’s hardest-hit Indigenous communities a Progressive International delegate asked which politicians they considered solid allies. The group hesitated to respond whispering among themselves until one of them spoke up: “Rep. Joênia has fought alongside us a lot” one Indigenous leader said going on to name a handful of nongovernmental organizations. None of them were from Wapichana’s state of Roraima. Any other names? This time the answer was quick: “No not that I remember.”

“Agribusiness not only buys advertising it also buys the editorial line and influences news coverage.”

The Mixed Parliamentary Front in Defense of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples launched in 2019 by Wapichana is comprised of 237 of Brazil’s 594 members of Congress. But during the first four days of the protest only two federal elected representatives stepped foot on the protest’s main stage and only a handful visited the encampment. No major presidential hopefuls or prominent government officials attended.

In a change from recent Indigenous protests — which ended in violent repression — police kept their distance. Coverage from major national news outlets has also been hard to come by. On Wednesday APIB’s executive coordinator Dinamam Tuxá lamented to The Intercept that none of the three main newspapers in Brazil — which rely on agribusiness advertising — had yet run a cover story on the historic protest. “Agribusiness not only buys advertising” he said “it also buys the editorial line and influences news coverage.”

International Solidarity

Even if the Marco Temporal is defeated in the Supreme Court dozens of other proposals and government actions threaten Indigenous lands and serve to push the Amazon rainforest closer to a deforestation “tipping point.” The result would be an irrevocable collapse of the ecosystem.

Leading scientists believe that the tipping point will come at 20 to 25 percent deforestation causing the lush Amazon to dry up and turn into a savanna provoking catastrophic carbon emissions and severe droughts throughout the continent. Eighteen percent of the Amazon has already been cut down and the rate of destruction has only increased under Bolsonaro.

“Our lives are at risk and we are asking for help” Auricélia Arapium a native leader from the Tapajós region told the Progressive International delegation during a meeting at the encampment on Monday. “We no longer have anyone to turn to in Brazil. That’s why we have approached international organizations so that our rights which are being threatened are preserved.”

In a press conference later that day Progressive International announced that it plans to work with partners around the globe to launch a boycott of foreign companies responsible for the destruction of the Amazon and the trampling of Indigenous rights. The investment giant Blackstone and the private agricultural conglomerate Cargill are at the top of their list.

“We need to look at the corporations that are fueling this and the U.S. and international foreign policy that’s enabling these corporations” said Nick Estes a professor at the University of New Mexico a Progressive International delegate and a citizen of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.

“The practices of these corporations like Cargill are fundamentally racist” said Estes who has contributed to The Intercept. “If more people understood how much Indigenous blood how much Black blood how much blood from Brazilians living on the land is spilt just for them to have a cheeseburger I think there would be much more outrage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3RldmVkZW5uaW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvd2h5LWJ1c2luZXNzLWFnaWxpdHktcmVxdWlyZXMtYS1zaGlmdC1mcm9tLWEtaGllcmFyY2h5LXRvLWEtbmV0d29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Business Agility Requires A Shift From A Hierarchy To A Network,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2021/08/29/why-business-agility-requires-a-shift-from-a-hierarchy-to-a-network/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3RldmVkZW5uaW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvd2h5LWJ1c2luZXNzLWFnaWxpdHktcmVxdWlyZXMtYS1zaGlmdC1mcm9tLWEtaGllcmFyY2h5LXRvLWEtbmV0d29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmFpci5vcmcvaG9tZS9hZnRlci0yNS15ZWFycy10aGVyZXMtYS1yZWFzb24tbXNuYmMtY2FudC1sb29rLWJhY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 25 Years There's a Reason MSNBC Can't Look Back,"On July 12 2021 a photo of Rachel Maddow was posted to the “Community” tab of MSNBC’s YouTube account. The accompanying text read:

To mark MSNBC’s 25th anniversary MSNBC Daily will feature 25 days of forward-looking essays on important issues from MSNBC anchors hosts and correspondents. Today Rachel Maddow writes about the future of election integrity.

Unlike Democracy Now! which also just celebrated 25 years or Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting which just reached 35 years MSNBC isn’t commemorating with any looks back to its founding or to its history as an outlet for journalism.

This choice might be because for much of its history MSNBC wasn’t branded as the liberal answer to Fox News. It was instead the ratings-seeking superfluous product of two mega corporations endeavoring to expand their respective news businesses. To do a full retrospective of the network one would have to include its record of platforming conservatives silencing antiwar voices and being early adopters of round-the-clock scandal coverage.

Early experiments

When General Electric–owned NBC and Microsoft (providing the MS) joined forces in 1996 to create a news network MSNBC hadn’t quite pinned down its plan for ratings success. In addition to simulcasting the radio host Don Imus known for his homophobic racist and sexist remarks (FAIR.org 4/11/07) MSNBC was seeking to cultivate a younger tech-savvy audience with programming that exploited a nascent World Wide Web.

The Site hosted by Soledad O’Brien and featuring a purple-haired animated “AI” named Dev Null was one of the first original programs. This failed to bring in an audience and was cancelled in 1997. The channel would soon abandon its tech-focused strategy for more sensational fodder.

It started getting warmer in 1998. Once the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke revolving around Bill Clinton lying about having a sexual relationship with a former White House intern MSNBC saturated its programming with the story. The Big Show hosted by Keith Olbermann was to become White House in Crisis. (FAIR founder Jeff Cohen—Extra! 3–4/98—suggested it instead be renamed News Media in Heat for its sex obsession.) Olbermann eventually apologized to Bill Clinton for contributing to what John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle (Santa Cruz Sentinel 12/31/98) referred to as “MSNBC‘s virtually nonstop cacophony of presidential and congressional shame.”

This saturation coverage model—perhaps pioneered by CNN during the OJ Simpson case in 1994—would become the rule for cable news: pick a story of sensation (usually at the expense of substance) and drill it into the ground 24/7 with no angle too stupid to be explored and repeated. The fact that this approach might condition millions of viewers to see trivial things as important while downplaying or completely ignoring more meaningful topics would be of little consequence to the company.

After stepping down as FAIR’s executive director Cohen worked for a time as a producer at MSNBC and later (in his book Cable News Confidential) described his first day at the network’s Secaucus New Jersey headquarters:

I ventured through the building’s central corridor where ten framed posters celebrated the highlights of MSNBC‘s early history. The first one I saw: “The Funeral of Princess Diana September 6 1997.” Then: “Death of JFK Jr.” On the opposite wall I saw “Columbine Shootings Live Coverage” and “Elián González Live Coverage” and “The Concorde Crash.”… If these were MSNBC‘s highlights what were its lowlights?

Moving toward a lineup

In 1999 a show called Equal Time sought to bring a little balance to the Clinton coverage. It was co-anchored by Cynthia Alksne a former federal prosecutor who was to be a pro-Clinton voice on the new program. Who was the other co-host? Iran/Contra operative Oliver North. Also added to their 1999 lineup was Watch It! With Laura Ingraham (FAIR.org 2/5/99); it was MSNBC that gave the former Clarence Thomas clerk her first cable platform.

It was around that time that MSNBC began to develop its permanent lineup. Chris Matthews joined in 1999 Mika Brzezinski in 2000 and Joe Scarborough in 2003.

Not all of its hires were so enduring. Alan Keyes who ran three times to be the Republican presidential nominee and would eventually go on to sue Barack Obama to provide proof he was born in the US was the host of Alan Keyes Is Making Sense. It was short-lived.

Then there was Michael Savage who was offered a platform—the Savage Nation—that he would quickly lose for making viciously homophobic remarks (FAIR.org 7/7/03) of the sort he was notorious for before MSNBC gave him a show (FAIR.org 2/12/03).

There was also an entire show devoted to crime news an overrepresented genre with a formula that drowns out examination of other pressing social ailments. That was called the Abrams Report hosted by Dan Abrams. The show would end when Abrams became general manager of MSNBC. Abrams failed upwards into the GM position after embarrassingly embracing lies in support of the Iraq invasion—declaring (12/12/02) that “within the past few weeks Iraq may have sold or given a chemical weapon possibly nerve gas to Islamic extremists affiliated with Al Qaeda”—sourcing this claim to “knowledgeable officials speaking without permission who describe it as a credible report but not backed up by definitive evidence.”

Casualty of the Iraq War

Another host destined for cancellation was Phil Donahue. Except in Donahue’s case cancellation wouldn’t be the result of saying something bigoted or manifestly false on air or not being able to maintain ratings—his were the highest on the network. For Donahue it would come from being an inconvenient antiwar voice in the lead-up to the Iraq War.

When Donahue was brought on in 2002 MSNBC was excited for the ratings that he was expected to bring. However the network quickly began to worry that Donahue would be a “dif­ficult public face for NBC in a time of war”—especially considering that NBC was owned by General Electric (which among other things was a weapons manufacturer; Extra! Update 4/03).

Apparently to compensate for his position Donahue was told to “balance” every antiwar guest with two pro-war guests (FAIR.org 12/22/04; CounterSpin 8/13/21). Except in the case of filmmaker activist Michael Moore for whom three pro-war voices would be required. Donahue was canceled soon before the invasion of Iraq; its lead-in show Countdown: Iraq hosted by Keith Olbermann was expanded to fill the timeslot.

This stance on Iraq could be felt permeating the network all the way down to its lower thirds. In March 2003 George W. Bush gave Saddam Hussein an ultimatum that either he and his sons leave Iraq within 48 hours or face war. MSNBC ran a countdown clock at the bottom of the screen (FAIR.org 3/19/03). This of course added to the lie that war was not a choice but a consequence of a defiant Saddam.

As the war progressed perhaps to make Joe Scarborough and Chris Matthews seem liberal by comparison MSNBC hired Tucker Carlson (FAIR.org 12/22/04). He held a primetime spot from 2005 until 2008 during which time it was in the channel’s interest to build his brand and make him as well-known as possible. Doubtless they bear some culpability for Carlson’s ascendancy.

Leftish—but not too left

2008 is when MSNBC became the network we think of today with the hiring of Air America host Rachel Maddow to head a new show in primetime. This would complement Keith Olbermann whose ratings had almost doubled since 2006 “when he started delivering ‘special comments’ criticizing the Bush administration” (New York Times 8/21/08). Countdown With Keith Olbermann would air at 8 p.m. and replay at 10 p.m. because the repeat garnered sufficient ratings to justify the redundancy.

This began an era when it was possible to find people like Amy Goodman or Jeremy Scahill on one of MSNBC‘s panel shows. Chris Hayes Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell for all their faults were far cries from the days of Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham.

However the new hosts’ leftism seldom extended beyond standard mainstream discourse particularly when it came to US foreign policy. “I’m a national security liberal which I tell people because it’s meant to sound absurd” Maddow told the New York Times (7/17/08). “I’m all about counterterrorism. I’m all about the GI Bill.”

In 2009 when the president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya was ousted by a military coup the coverage was characteristically scant. Maddow framed the coup as more of a curiosity than a crisis. While some of her coverage focused on the Republicans who planned trips to Honduras in order to support the coup government other of her segments poked fun at Zelaya’s attempts to re-enter the country. The fact that the Honduran military opened fire on supporters of Zelaya awaiting his return at the airport killing a teenage boy was not part of Maddow’s look at the lighter side of overthrowing an elected government.

When the US was set to initiate war with Libya in 2011 as opposed to reporting critically on the burgeoning conflict MSNBC served partly as a cover to the Obama administration. “Maddow observed that Obama like Bush was invading a Middle Eastern nation” Michael Corcoran and Stephen Maher wrote in Truthout (6/3/11):

But by initiating the attack without so much as a press conference to the American people she argued he was avoiding the “chest thumping” of previous administrations in an effort to “change the narrative” of US foreign policy.

Also in 2011 Keith Olbermann was fired despite healthy ratings; denials were issued that this had anything to do with the purchase of MSNBC and NBC by the cable giant Comcast (Guardian 1/21/11). The Atlantic (5/26/11) speculated that Olbermann might have been ousted for arguing after a mass shooting in Tucson that former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin needed to be “repudiated” for “amplifying violence.”

Cenk Uygur of the Young Turks was given the 6 p.m. slot that same year. His ratings were good. However sometime after being told to tone it down and invite on more Republicans it became clear that despite his ratings haul there was no upward mobility for his brand of vigorous criticism. He soon left MSNBC (Extra! 11/11).

Trump obsession

Ed Schultz was also part of the progressive wave that came to characterize the network post-2008 on air from 2009 to 2015. His end came when he was about to cover Bernie Sanders’ 2015 presidential primary launch. At the launch event Schultz was contacted by network president Phil Griffin who told him to pack up and leave. The network was not interested in covering the Sanders campaign launch. Schultz was gone from the network soon after (Intercept 2/22/16).

While MSNBC failed to give equal time to progressive candidates it found inordinate bandwidth to devote to presidential candidate Donald Trump contributing to the $2 billion in “earned media” Trump received during his 2016 campaign. During the 2016 election cycle MSNBC mentioned him more than all other presidential candidates Republican or Democratic combined.

An episode in May 2016 typified MSNBC‘s obsession with Trump while also displaying how truly similar they are to the other cable news networks. While Hillary Clinton was giving a talk to union workers in Las Vegas MSNBC (as well as Fox News and CNN) chose instead to air footage of an empty podium where Trump was scheduled to speak.

After the 2016 election Trump continued to dominate MSNBC; the Stanford Cable News Analyzer indicates that the network gave President Trump roughly two and a half times as much screentime from 2017–20 as it gave Barack Obama from 2013–16. As CJR (9/8/20) noted in 2020 “The network that consistently gives Trump the most airtime is not Fox News but MSNBC.”

And this attention paid to Trump was highly selective with vast amounts of news hours devoted to connections he may or may not have had with Russia. “Between Election Day [2016] and April 19 2019…MSNBC devoted 32 percent of all coverage” to the “Trump/Russia collusion scandal” CJR (10/18/19) reported.

This obsessive focus invariably crowded out countless other stories that may have been more important to voters but with less utility to the network as drivers of views and watch-hours. The passage of Trump’s massive tax cut for the wealthy for example was virtually eclipsed by MSNBC‘s exhaustive examination of the minutiae of the Mueller report and the “Russia Dossier” (FAIR.org 12/13/17).

A large portion of MSNBC’s existence is characterized by a lust for ratings endless coverage of trivialities and a craven echoing of officialdom. It may occasionally have a good take segment or even host but it will always be operating in service to profit—and corporate power (FAIR.org 10/4/10)."

PTC,PTC,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vY2F0aG9saWNoZXJhbGQuY28udWsvdGhlLWNvbnN1YnN0YW50aWFsLWNhbm9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The consubstantial canon,"While working on the Letter to the Hebrews I came across a fascinating theory that the Epistle began life as a synagogue sermon for the ninth day of the month of Av. I won’t go into the details of it gripping though it is except to mention that it depends in part upon the existence of something called the Palestinian Triennial Cycle (PTC). This is a set of readings appointed for use in Jewish synagogues and known to have been current in the second century AD.

Why is this of any interest to us? Because the PTC follows a strikingly similar pattern to the readings in the Roman Lectionary on Sundays: they would take a first reading from the Torah the first five books of the Bible which together comprise the Law of Moses and these were read through consecutively. Start at Genesis go through to the end of Deuteronomy and then round again every three years. The second reading was taken from the Prophets and crucially these second readings were not consecutive but were chosen to match up with the first reading in some way. For example on 9th Ab the first reading dealt with the incident of the golden calf from Exodus during which Moses in his anger breaks the tablets of the covenant; the second reading comes from Jeremiah 31 dealing with the promise of a new covenant written not on stone tablets but on the hearts and minds of believers. The link is I think fairly obvious.

Now our own Christian lectionary works the same way but in reverse as it were. The third reading is the Gospel and we read through these continuously more or less – at least in Ordinary Time. And like the PTC we are on a three-yearly cycle: we read Matthew then Mark then Luke then back to Matthew. What of John? The great set pieces from the first half of the Fourth Gospel are read on the Sundays in Lent and the second half is read in Eastertide. You’ll also have noticed that in August we have been taking a break from Mark to read John’s account of the Feeding of the Five Thousand and the subsequent teaching of Christ on the Bread of Life. Mark is the shortest Gospel and so perhaps needs supplementing.

Most importantly the first readings are taken from the Old Testament and like the second readings of the PTC are not continuous but are chosen to match the Gospel. So last Sunday (at time of writing) the story of Elijah and the miraculous appearance of bread to sustain him on his journey to the holy mountain links quite nicely with Christ’s teaching on the bread of life.

My main point however is to note the similarity in the fundamental principle that underlies our lectionary and that of Jewish synagogues 2000 years ago. It is not simply that there are similar stories but that there is foreshadowing. For example when the people of Israel in the wilderness broke faith with God and abandoned the covenant he had just made with them Moses was able to negotiate a renewal of that covenant and made new stone tables. But Jeremiah reveals that this incident points beyond itself to a time when God will ultimately remake his covenant with Israel in a higher way a covenant marked by spiritual rather than material boundaries.

However where there is similarity there is also difference: in the Jewish tradition the first readings follow continuously the foundational documents of Judaism stories establishing the promises God makes to Israel. Then the prophets look forward to

the ways in which the promises these documents contain will be brought to fruition in the fullness of time. For us Christians the Gospels show precisely how the fullness of time dawned in the life ministry death and resurrection of Jesus narrated in the Gospels.

Our first readings certainly foreshadow this fulfilment in Christ but what is highlighted by the matching of first reading and Gospel is precisely that the promises are now fulfilled in Christ and that in Christ God has kept his promises is the most remarkable and surprising way. This surprising faithfulness of God is built into the structure of our Sunday readings including also the second readings from the Epistles and Revelation which we read through quite systematically on Sundays through the three-yearly cycle and which explore precisely this theme of how in Christ God keeps the promises made to Israel.

There is more information on the lectionary at catholic-resources.org/Lectionary and I heartily recommend taking a look.

It is also a vehicle for reauthorizing America's surface transportation laws providing an opportunity for special interests to write new rules and mandates into federal policy.

While most of those niche fights are unremarkable the one shaping up between the railroad industry and its labor unions presents an interesting conundrum for the Biden administration and it could have significant ramifications for the economy and even for efforts to reduce carbon emissions. At issue: How many people does it take to drive a train?

Labor unions such as the Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers have been lobbying federal regulators to mandate that all freight trains operate with two-person crews in the cab. That's long been the standard industry practice for safety reasons. The engineer drives the train while the rail conductor handles equipment inspections and monitors track signals. Unions worry that advanced automation will allow railroads to run safely without a second person in the engine—and they want the government to step in to protect those jobs.

This dreaded automation is indeed occurring. All major rail systems in the U.S. now use positive train control (PTC) essentially a computer-based override system that monitors speed and track signals to avert collisions. The adoption of PTC—mandated by Congress since 2008—has helped dramatically reduce rail accidents. Data from the Association of American Railroads (AAR) an industry group show accidents are down 30 percent since 2000 while employee injuries have fallen by more than 40 percent. Railroading is safer now than it has ever been in large part due to those technological advances.

With PTC systems handling many of the in-cab duties that were formerly the rail conductor's responsibility railroads are seeking to reassign some of those workers. Because rail conductors typically do equipment inspections and perform other duties before trains depart from rail yards and after they return some will continue to work in that capacity. But any changes to the employment structure have to be approved as part of collective bargaining.

The unions' lobbying efforts can best be understood as a way to gain the upper hand in those negotiations. If the federal government mandates two-person rail crews railroads won't be able to negotiate other arrangements.

During the waning days of the Obama administration the unions nearly got what they wanted. In 2016 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) proposed a rule mandating two-person crews. But after investigating the issue for several years the FRA concluded in 2019 that the mandate was not ""necessary or appropriate for railroad operations to be conducted safely.""

Case closed—unless Congress gets involved which is exactly what could happen this year as part of Biden's infrastructure plan.

The president as you may have heard is a big fan of trains. And the White House has set ambitious goals for reducing America's carbon emissions during the next few decades. Trains could be a major part of that because moving one ton of cargo one mile by truck emits several times as much carbon dioxide as moving it by rail.

But mandating that the railroad industry employ twice as many people to drive each train means higher costs. A 2015 study by Oliver Wyman a consulting firm and the AAR found that switching from two-person to one-person crews could save railroad companies as much as $2.5 billion over a decade. Those savings could reduce the cost of rail freight making train transportation more economical. That in turn could mean fewer exhaust-spewing trucks on America's highways.

Despite the potential environmental benefits siding with the railroads could alienate Biden's labor union allies. Still without clear and convincing evidence that two-person crews are necessary for trains to operate safety—and with PTC doing a better job of preventing accidents than humans used to—there's no compelling reason for the government to get involved in this dispute. Private railroads and unions can make their own arrangements.

If Biden needs more convincing he should check in with his beloved Amtrak. The government-run passenger rail system dropped its own two-people-in-the-cab mandate back in the 1980s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c21ldGVyLmluL3JlZ2lvbmFsL2FuZGhyYS1wcmFkZXNoL3dvbWFuLXNpLWVuZHMtbGlmZS1hdC12aXppYW5hZ2FyYW0tcHRjLTY4MjU5NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman SI ends life at Vizianagaram PTC,"Vizianagaram: A woman sub-inspector ended her life at Police Training College (PTC) hostel in Vizianagaram on Sunday.

Emerald Coastkeeper filed an appeal with the county's board of adjustment seeking to overturn a development order issued to A+ Mini-Storage of Pensacola that cleared the way for the removal of the live oak tree plus 16 other protected trees at a North Palafox Street location in Brent.

W. M. Bell Co. of Santa Rosa County LLC bought the property next door to the storage business on North Palafox Street in April and submitted plans to the county to build a 16000-square-foot three-story mini-storage building.

Escambia County's tree ordinance requires developers to meet criteria to remove protected tree species and if removal is approved to pay a fee and plant mitigation trees. Protected trees larger than 65 inches in diameter are classified as ""heritage trees"" and carry higher fees and mitigation requirements if one is removed.

The live oak tree on the A+ Storage property was measured with a diameter of 85 inches. The county arborist noted in an email earlier this year that it was the largest tree she's ever measured in Escambia County.

An online petition seeking to save the tree had more than 4800 signatures as of Friday.

Earlier this month the county's Development Review Committee approved the issuing of a development order approving of the construction.

The developer has paid the county a $24010 fee to remove 17 protected trees on the lot including the ""heritage"" live oak tree. The developer's plans call for planting 12 young trees to meet the mitigation requirement as well.

Attorney Will Dunaway with the Clark Partington law firm filed an appeal this week on behalf of Emerald Coastkeeper an environmental organization that works to protect waterways in Northwest Florida.

Public outcry:Escambia County approved removing massive tree. After outcry county will now try to save it.

Tree removal approved:Escambia's largest tree is on chopping block. Advocates say 'weak' ordinance is to blame

In the appeal Dunaway said the developer did not meet the county's criteria for allowing the removal of protected trees.

Dunaway pointed out in the appeal that the land development code says that no authorization to remove a protected tree ""shall"" be granted if there has been a failure to take reasonable measures to design improvements that avoid taking down the tree. He argued the county staff failed to document compliance with the criteria and violated the land development code when it issued the development order.

""The applicant is well aware of the extent of these requirements"" Dunaway wrote. ""Staff is well aware of the extent of these requirements. They simply have not complied with the requirements.""

Escambia County Development Services Director Horace Jones told the County Commission last week that the developer met the required provisions of the county code and that's why the development order was issued.

Commissioner Lumon May asked if there was any way to try to save the tree and Deputy County Administrator Chips Kirschenfeld suggested approaching the developer again about options in the county code that allows variances to be issued when saving heritage trees.

County spokeswoman Laura Coale told the News Journal on Friday in an email that the staff met with the property owner and the project engineer to discuss the variances but none would enable the construction of the three-story building he wants.

""However about half the property is developable for something smaller"" Coale said. ""The owner is not interested in building something smaller. The county also asked the owner if he was interested in selling the property and he is not interested in selling at this time.""

Escambia County's Board of Adjustment meets once a month and the next meeting is set for Sept. 15.

Microsoft is preparing for a new future of Industry 4.0 apps smart cities and private operator involvement. With this in-mind it launched Azure private multi-access edge computing (MEC) an effort to help partners deliver edge computing networking and private cell service. Private mobile networks commonly encompass managed connectivity and managed services together with self-management options. This can be combined with Stack Edge for low latency Network Function Manager for cloud orchestration and Affirmed 5G Mobile Core for 5G core network functions.

Gabe Monroy VP of Azure Developer Experience shared an unusual compute use case. Microsoft is using HPE's Spaceborne Computer-2 on the International Space Station as a way to improve on limited bandwidth between the space station and Earth and as a showcase of edge and cloud workflows. High intensity data analysis occurs in space with the most significant results forward to Earth. The new computer was installed in April following up on earlier HPE installation dating back to 2017. Simulating future health diagnostics for space crews the HPE computer did initial processing of gene sequences and then Microsoft Genomics service carried out additional analysis. Prior to the full-fledged project Microsoft used ARM to simulate latency between the space station and the ground. Monroy wrote:

The experiment’s successful completion—and the data collected through it—is proof of how an edge-to-cloud computing workflow can be used to support high-value use cases aboard the ISS that might otherwise be impossible due to compute and bandwidth constraints. Without preprocessing the simulated output of the gene sequencer on the ISS to filter out only the gene mutations 150 times as much data would need to be downloaded to Earth. Thus a 200GB raw full human genome read which would require over two years to download given bandwidth and downlink window constraints could be filtered to 1.5GB—which can be transmitted in just over an hour. Microsoft expects planned tests to further increase this ratio.

The 20-acre parcel on Doe Run Road is among the last six Lancaster County properties once owned by Worley & Obetz executives and their relatives to be recently sold at auctions run by the trustee overseeing the firm’s bankruptcy liquidation.

The sale of the local parcels which ended a three-year dispute over their fate has raised more than $5 million for the company’s creditors U.S. Bankruptcy Court records show.

At the same time the transactions are bringing new uses to some of the sites and reviving existing uses at others including a self-storage complex and a multitenant commercial property.

The biggest new use would be at 149 Doe Run Road just outside Manheim Borough in Penn Township. The site now being farmed is zoned for mixed use which would allow the proposed development of 170 rental units plus small commercial uses such as a doctor’s office and restaurant.

Landis Quality Living an affiliate of Landis Communities believes the project would “meet a significant need for middle-market housing and fit well within the Manheim community” said Beth Trout vice president of advancement and communications at Landis Communities.

Subject to township reviews and approvals the first phase could open as soon as August 2023. The second and final phase could be occupied as early as 2025. Trout said it was too early in the development process to estimate the project cost.

Preliminary plans call for 18000 square feet of commercial space three three-story apartment buildings and 15 buildings of townhouses arranged into clusters facing inward toward open spaces to form “pocket neighborhoods.”

The independent living development would be aimed at middle-income singles and couples earning $30000 to $80000 annually Trout said. The Danner Trust which supported the now-closed Danner Home in Manheim for the elderly has donated $830000 to subsidize part of the rent on an undetermined number of units for tenants who qualify.

Landis Quality Living and Benchmark presented a conceptual plan for the as-yet-unnamed venture to the township supervisors Monday. No vote was taken.

Township Manager Mark Hiester called the location “a good site” for the project because it’s accessible from Doe Run and Stiegel Valley roads properly zoned served by public water and sewer and next to the Manheim Shopping Center which includes a grocery store pharmacy restaurant and hardware store.

Family business

Worley & Obetz was a Manheim-based family owned energy business that imploded in May 2018 when it was discovered that CEO Jeffrey Lyons had padded the books with $2 billion in phony business over 15 years to trick lenders led by Fulton Bank into approving $67 million in loans.

Once the scam was uncovered the business unraveled in three weeks costing all 275 employees their jobs. Lyons and two accomplices pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison; Lyons got a 14-year sentence.

Separately Worley & Obetz’s bankruptcy liquidation brought scrutiny of the business by a court-appointed trustee Christine Shubert whose job includes recovering the most money possible for its creditors. As part of that effort she determined that 17 properties in three states bought by company executives and relatives for personal use or as personal investments were funded in part by tapping Worley & Obetz’s fraudulently enhanced cash reserves.

The tainted source of the funds made the deals improper Shubert said regardless of whether the executives and relatives knew the true source of the money. Shubert also argued the company received no benefit from those unneeded properties. As a result Shubert said she was entitled to take the properties and sell them at auction for the benefit of the company's creditors who were owed $90 million. The company insiders disagreed saying the company benefited from the use of the facilities.

Shubert also accused vice chairman Seth Obetz of breach of fiduciary duty for failing to detect the fraud which Obetz disputed saying he’d been tricked along with the banks. Obetz added that he led other parts of the company than Lyons and even worked in a different building than Lyons.

The trustee reached a settlement last October with Lyons and his accomplices as well as Obetz and relatives who had a stake in the properties. As LNP | LancasterOnline reported insiders agreed to transfer ownership of 12 properties including the six here and other assets to Shubert with a total value exceeding $6.8 million.

The settlement was approved by a bankruptcy judge in December leading to the sale of the local properties this spring.

New owners new life

Landis Quality Living and Benchmark formed a partnership to buy 149 Doe Run Road for $995000 in May court records show.

Two other sizable sites a block away are being revitalized by local entrepreneur Jared Mizrahi founder of PCI Auctions.

Doe Run Self Storage 60-62 Doe Run Road which stayed open but was not charging rent or securing new clients this month reopened as Manheim Self Storage said PCI spokeswoman Chrissy Stoltz. The 100-unit property began clearing out its 39 abandoned units and seeking replacement clients.

Mizrahi who’s bought the contents of abandoned units elsewhere for years to auction said: “I've always wanted to get into the other side of the business.” He paid $1.65 million for the 4.2-acre property court records show. Also on the property is a commercial tenant Auto Graphics.

Mizrahi also bought a 7.2-acre commercial property across the street at 55 Doe Run Road for $1.4 million court records show.

Without active management roughly three-fourths of the property’s 33000 square feet has fallen vacant Stoltz said including spaces last occupied by industrial fastener firm Fastenal and Amerigreen a wholesale energy supplier owned by Worley & Obetz. Current tenants are Greenthirteen a collectibles shop and a storage tenant.

Stoltz said the site being marketed for lease by Compass Real Estate is drawing “a lot of interest” from prospective tenants.

The other significant property to change hands is 202 Greenfield Road a 2.9-acre site in East Lampeter Township which Worley & Obetz used as the headquarters of its commercial division and a WoGo fuel station location.

After standing idle for three years the parcel was bought by a partnership including James Guerin owner of JG Environmental which paid $1.67 million for the site court records show. (Guerin’s father also named James Guerin founded the former International Signal & Control.)

Guerin has leased part of the parcel to JG for administrative offices and fleet parking while continuing to use its 776 Flory Mill Road location for nonhazardous waste processing. He’s leased the former Amerigreen station to Quarles the largest operator of automated fueling stations for commercial fleets in the mid-Atlantic region with more than 125 locations in six states. It will open in October.

A fifth former Worley & Obetz property to change hands is a small commercial property at 41 Doe Run Road. It was sold for $212500 to Manheim resident Kenneth L. Hameloth court records show. Hameloth has his Edward Jones financial advising business there.

A similar parcel next door went through the auction process but ended up with the same owner as before. Obetz used a right of first refusal contained in the settlement to buy back a small converted house at 45 Doe Run Road paying $212500 too. Obetz is using it as the office for his Seth Energy which provides propane and heating oil and does HVAC plumbing and electrical work. It has 17 employees.

I have the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE in hand and have some first impressions to share. The Lenovo and Acer have many similarities when it comes to their size display and base model starting price. There are three key differences though: This Acer is a convertible Chromebook has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor and is LTE-capable.

The addition of that LTE radio adds to the price. Instead of the $349 cost for a base configuration the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE model I have is priced at $699.

That premium includes the LTE modem inside as well as 8 GB of memory over the standard 4 GB. Additionally storage capacity is bumped up from the base model’s 64 GB to 128 GB. Because this is technically an enterprise model the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade license is also included.

I can’t speak to the value proposition yet on the price difference because I really need to use this device as my daily driver for a bit. Still on paper it’s a steep premium to pay. Particularly if you’re a consumer and don’t need the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade license you’re paying for. Note that consumer models of this device don’t offer an LTE option. $699 is currently the lowest price you can pay for LTE support in this Chromebook.

As a refresher here are the full specifications of the model I was loaned:

Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE design

If you’ve seen one Acer Chromebook Spin 513 you’ve seen them all. What I mean by that is that every model has a SIM card slot but only the LTE-equipped configurations make use of it. Externally the LTE version is no different than the WiFi model.

That’s not a bad thing though. I liked the design of this device ever since I looked at a pre-production model back in October.

The device is thin and light for example and well built. It’s even thinner than the pre-production model thanks to some tweaks.

Even though the device is mostly plastic it has a decent amount of rigidity. The 13.3-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS touch screen has good viewing angles above-average brightness of 300 nits and uses Corning Gorilla Glass. I also like the design choice of thinning out the chassis in the closest first half; it adds to the nice svelte design.

So far the keyboard which is backlit is perfectly fine for my typing. It’s not what I’d call excellent but it’s not bad either. And it’s backlit which is appreciated. I find the trackpad a little small but I haven’t enountered any issues with it.

The included pair of USB Type-C ports are split on the left and right which is my preference. The left side also includes a USB Type-A port and the combination headphone/microphone jack. The dual speakers are under the chassis which is not ideal. However the sound levels are louder than I expected. I could watch a movie with these even when the Chromebook is on my lap.

All in all the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE (or even the non-LTE model) is a well designed super lightweight (2.65 pound) laptop.

First thoughts on performance

Since I was asked not to run performance tests on the pre-production model last year the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c was the biggest question mark in my head. And while I need several days of usage to fully test it I can already see that expectations of average at best performance for the price were well founded.

The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE is certainly usable for everyday tasks. But we’re talking about an ARM processor that was announced in 2019 and is already somewhat outdated. I’m expecting basic entry-level performance based on what I’ve seen so far including the writing of this post using the device.

I’ll provide a full performance analysis in my upcoming review but a simple Octane benchmark test in Guest Mode after a reboot earned a score of just under 23000.

That same testing setup on the non-LTE Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook with an 11th-generation Intel Pentium Gold processor returned more than double that score. And the base model price for that is $439 although you can currently find the 2-in-1 equivilent the Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook for $399. And that’s with an 11th-generation Intel Core i3 which should provide even more performance than the Pentium model.

Again so far this is certainly a usable Chromebook. But we’re talking entry level performance expectations from what I can see.

LTE setup speed test and usage

Given that I haven’t used an LTE Chromebook since the original Google Chromebook Pixel in 2013 I wasn’t sure what to expect when it came to setting up the LTE. I can happily report that in my case it was simple.

I popped in my SIM card and within 10 seconds the Chromebook self-configured itself for my carrier which is T-Mobile. Here are some of the settings you can modify in Chrome OS for LTE but I didn’t need to adjust anything.

Although I haven’t left home with the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE I did disable the WiFi radio and used mobile broadband with it. And it works no differently than if I was on WiFi albeit slower. For reference I have a WiFi 6 router and 1 Gbps internet connection at my home. So there’s no way I’d experience a quicker mobile broadband connection with the LTE modem.

Speeds and coverage vary by carrier and location of course. So I set my iPhone to use 4G LTE only (in lieu of 5G) and ran a baseline speedtest with it getting a download speed of 104 Mbps with 36 milleseconds of latency.

Using the same network on the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE these are the results. A smidge more latency and about half of the download throughput.

This didn’t surprise me because the Snapdragon 7c uses an LTE Cat12 modem which maxes out at 600 Mbps on the download. My iPhone has a much faster modem that supports 1 Gbps LTE connectivity. Again the age of the Snapdragon 7c is showing here.

Even so I could easily be productive using a mobile broadband connection that’s half of what the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 LTE is providing me. So I don’t think this a problem by any means. Most online browsing and productivity doesn’t need super-fast connectivity. It’s when you start consuming high resolution content attend video conferences or stream games that you want the fastest wireless pipe you can find.

I’ll be sure to test those scenarios using LTE as spend the next several days using this Chromebook so stay tuned!

Microsoft has now released the list of CPUs that officially support Windows 11 OS. As the company already confirmed most modern CPUs based on 64bit architecture 4GB RAM and 64GB storage will officially support Windows 11 OS. However those devices should also have TPM 2.0 to ensure PCs make more secure.

Here is the list of CPUs from Intel AMD and Qualcomm which officially support Windows 11 OS. If you have a PC with any of these CPUs then the computer will receive Windows 11 OS update by the end of 2021.

At DTU the average salary for the 500-odd students placed till now is Rs 22 lakh nearly 16% higher compared with this time last year.“The fight for talent this year is much more intense” said Rajesh Rohilla dean training and placement DTU. Nearly half the students already placed at DTU have bagged packages of Rs 20 lakh-plus.Covid has also turned out to be a boon in disguise as students have got to work on longer-duration internship projects online parallelly with their studies. This has led to a higher pre-placement offer conversion rate as companies have observed their work over a longer time said Rohilla.“It could be one of the best years in terms of placement so far” said V Samuel Rajkumar director at VIT’s Career Development Centre. More than 2000 of the institute’s 7500 registered students have been placed already; over 100 have received offers upwards of Rs 25 lakh.Intel and Nokia have hired more than 100 students each; Societe Generale has hired 75 and Microsoft 21 students. Video-calling platform Dyte’s offer of Rs 75 lakh is the highest so far.Many companies this year have increased their compensation packages said Sajith V head of Centre for Training and Placement at NIT Calicut.Four B-Tech students have bagged the top package of Rs 67.6 lakh. Goldman Sachs Oracle Cisco Qualcomm Texas Instruments Udaan and Bajaj Auto are among the companies that have made offers to 231 students so far.Around 180 students have been placed within a week at Bengaluru’s RV College of Engineering with an average package of Rs 20.5 lakh. The highest offer so far has been Rs 47.5 lakh from SaaS startup Clumio.“There’s been a 20-30% hike in the CTCs of several companies” said D Ranganath dean placement and training at RVCE.Harshvendra Soin global chief people officer Tech Mahindra said: “With accelerated digitalisation across organisations and sectors the demand for niche skills in emerging technologies has also accelerated. Our plan is to increase the fresher intake by 3x in this fiscal year through our flagship global campus hiring programmes.

The Bucs’ 23-16 win Saturday at Houston in the final preseason game proved that.

At 44 he may be better.

After a shaky first series Brady connected on his next 10 pass attempts and led the Bucs on touchdown drives of 91 and 93 yards before taking a seat early in the second quarter.

Brady finished 11 of 14 passing for 154 yards including a 24-yard touchdown to receiver Chris Godwin.

“I thought it was a great run-pass” Bucs coach Bruce Arians said. “The first (drive) was a no-huddle and something we’ve been wanting to get into and get going. Tom did a great job and great protection and guys were where they were supposed to be. Then ‘Ro’ (Ronald Jones) started running really well and it was another really good drive of mixing it up.

“I was very very pleased.”

Godwin caught three passes for 84 yards. The second-team defense got interceptions from cornerbacks Dee Delaney (two) and Herb Miller and rookie Joe Tryon-Shoyinka forced a fumble that was recovered by Khalil Davis.

Brady and the starters had only played six snaps this preseason so Saturday’s game was their time to get game-ready prior to the NFL regular-season opener against the Dallas Cowboys Sept. 9 at Raymond James Stadium.

The game couldn’t have started much worse for the Bucs.

Antonio Brown jumped offsides on the first play Ronald Jones was dropped for a 3-yard loss Brady fired incomplete to Brown and Giovani Bernard dropped a pass.

“I think any time you play you learn something” Brady said. “I’ve been doing this a long time but I don’t think you take anything for granted. You have to get the real reps. You have to get the real crowd noise. You have to get the real game clock. You’ve got to get the real situations and the more you do that a a team the better you′re going to be as the pressure mounts.”

Perhaps sensing they were running out of time to get into rhythm Brady went to the hurry-up.

Utilizing the no-huddle offense to perfection he completed all seven of his passing attempts on the second drive capping a 91-yard drive with the TD to Godwin.

Brady was nearly as impressive on the Bucs’ next try on offense.

The Bucs took over on downs at their own 7-yard line and Brady fired 32 yards to Godwin. That ignited a 93-yard march with Ronald Jones high-stepping into the end zone after a 13-yard run.

Brady has had an outstanding training camp and has demonstrated a complete mastery of the Bucs’ offense.

This time a year ago he was still learning the terminology and getting acquainted with new teammates.

But on Saturday he was decisive and extremely accurate spreading the football around to Godwin Mike Evans O.J. Howard and Brown.

General manager Jason Licht said the defending champions are ready for the Dallas Cowboys.

“Yeah we feel good about it” Licht said on the WFLA Channel 8 broadcast. “You know this is a great group here. Not only great players but just a great close-knit group. A lot of fun to coach and a lot of fun to be around. These guys are just very motivated to repeat. I’m not making any predictions here but they’re all very motivated here.”

Defensively their tackling needs to improve but that can be expected this time of year. But they forced five more turnovers Saturday.

Tryon-Shoyinka may be the steal of the draft and he had another big game Saturday.

“I was very very pleased” Arians said. “Obviously getting five turnovers but stopping them on all those fourth downs. That was obviously a totally different game when their kicker was injured. I thought our defense again we got Joe some more work. He needed some more work and Anthony (Nelson) and got them out of there.”

There was some sloppy play too. Rookie Jaelon Darden ran a bad route and Blaine Gabbert threw an interception. A bad snap by rookie center Robert Hainsey led to Gabbert being tackled in the end zone for a safety.

Kyle Trask threw his first TD pass of the preseason to tight end Codey McElroy and finished 12 of 14 for 146 yards with no interceptions.

It will be quite a scene when the Bucs begin defense of their Super Bowl title in less than two weeks. Of course Raymond James will be packed. It’s time to go for two.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvamFtZXMtcnV0bGVkZ2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjM2ODI3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Rutledge Obituary (2021) - Goochland VA - Richmond Times-Dispatch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/timesdispatch/name/james-rutledge-obituary?id=6368270 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvamFtZXMtcnV0bGVkZ2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjM2ODI3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbnNpbmdzdGF0ZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbHNqMDczNTk40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Pignataro Obituary,"James Pignataro

Okemos MI - James (Jim) Pignataro of Okemos Michigan passed on to his eternal reward on August 26 2021 at the age of 49 after a courageous six-year battle with cancer.

Born January 7 1972 in Queens New York to Roger and Linda Pignataro Jim grew up in Raymond Maine and graduated from Gray-New Gloucester High School in 1990. In 1994 he earned his bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary business administration/economics at the University of Maine at Farmington where he was also a multi-year varsity letter winner in baseball. Jim went on to earn his master's degree in athletic administration from the University of Tennessee in 1995 where he found his passion for working with student athletes.

Jim began his professional career at Florida State University before moving to Michigan State University where he worked in the athletic department for 25 years. He spent the majority of his career as the Executive Associate Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Services where he was dedicated to the overall care of student-athletes. With integrity dignity respect and compassion as his guiding principles Jim influenced hundreds of student athletes who have gone on to pursue careers both in and out of sports all over the world. His living legacy is realized through all those he guided and mentored.

Jim's service to his profession extended beyond East Lansing. In 2014 he served as President of the National Association of Academic and Student-Athlete Development Professionals. The organization honored him in 2016 with the Lan Hewlett Award which acknowledges distinguished service in the field of student-athlete academic and personal development.

Central to Jim's daily life was his steadfast faith in God and an unwavering love for his wife Alana and their children Ali and Jimmy. Through their shared love of sport Jim spent many happy family moments watching Red Sox baseball rooting for MSU and cheering at Ali's volleyball matches and Jimmy's baseball games. He will forever be their biggest fan.

Jim's love for a wide community of family and friends was marked by his infectious laugh and his signature homemade pasta ""sauce."" He always took time to care for others meeting at Dunkin Donuts or breaking bread at a local restaurant. He supported local schools and organizations through service coaching and mentorship. Jim was a devoted member of the River Terrace Church in East Lansing where he often volunteered in a leadership capacity. Jim shared unwavering faith hope reflections and prayer with family and friends during his journey with cancer reminding us always that God holds us ""In His Grip.""

Jim is survived by his loving wife of 20 years Alana Inkala Pignataro an elementary school teacher at Okemos Public Schools; daughter Alison (16) and son Jimmy (13); parents Roger and Linda Pignataro of So. Burlington Vermont; sister Nicole and husband Dr. Moise St.Louis of Mattapoisett Massachusetts; Aunt Virginia and husband Dr. Joe Valentino of Lexington Kentucky; Uncle Dino Pignataro and wife Judy of San Francisco California; mother-in-law Darlene Inkala of Okemos Michigan; sister-in-law Laurel Miller and husband Caleb of East Lansing Michigan; nieces Ella Bella Alexa and nephew Stefan.

Raymond Donald Blanchong II now 42 and his then-fiance Jessica Lynn Morris 32 both of Maumee Ohio were found guilty by a Monroe County jury of murder armed robbery and unlawful imprisonment in connection with the death of James Martin Wappner 45 of Toledo.

Both are serving life sentences in Michigan prisons. Both also appealed their cases but the Michigan Court of Appeals recently upheld the convictions and sentences.

“Defendant (Blanchong) argues that he was denied a fair trial because…there was insufficient evidence to support defendant’s convictions for first-degree felony murder and armed robbery. We disagree with each of the defendant’s arguments” the three-judge panel ruled.

The court also denied Morris’ various claims including ineffective counsel insufficient evidence and double jeopardy.

“All of the evidence tended to indicate that defendant was not merely present when the crime occurred but rather actively participated in the events that led to Wappner’s death and later attempted to conceal her actions” the judges said in their 20-page ruling.

The appeals filed separately followed a 2019 jury trial in Monroe County Circuit Court where both were convicted of multiple felonies including first-degree murder. Wappner‘s body was found in Lenawee County just north of the Michigan-Ohio border on December 3 2018.

At trial the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office presented evidence that Wappner was killed on December 2 2018 while attempting to sell drugs to Blanchong and Morris inside a vehicle in the parking lot of the Bedford Inn.

The Lenawee County medical examiner concluded that Wappner had received approximately 20 stab wounds three of which were fatal and suffered “severe blunt force injuries” to the back of his head. His body was then dumped in a rural area.

During the trial a woman testified that she was dating Wappner before his death and she admitted that Wappner made money by selling illegal drugs. When Wappner left home about one day before his death he had between $500 and $600 in cash on his person as well as “a lot of drugs” including crack cocaine marijuana and pills according to the appellate ruling.

Michigan State Police Detective Sgt. Michael Peterson tracked the suspects down and found them in Colorado. It was determined that Wappner was killed inside a vehicle because Blanchong didn’t have enough money to purchase drugs.

During trial Morris chose to testify on her own behalf and admitted that she and Blanchong both used cocaine and marijuana and that they had purchased drugs from Wappner “a handful of times.” She also admitted that she and Blanchong had attempted to purchase drugs from Wappner on the night of his death. While in the parking lot of the Bedford Inn she testified that a struggle ensued between Blanchong and Wappner inside the vehicle and that Blanchong was covered in blood. Defendant stated that she climbed into the driver’s seat of the vehicle while the two men were fighting and that she drove the vehicle away from the scene with both of them in the vehicle.

Although defendant admitted that she was present when Wappner was killed she maintained that Blanchong was responsible and that she did not contribute to Wappner’s death. Neither the jury nor the appellate court believed her.

During trial the judges ruled witness testimony and physical evidence linked both the defendant and Blanchong to the crime.

“The actions of defendant and Blanchong provide further circumstantial evidence of premeditation and deliberation” the appellate judges ruled. “Based upon the foregoing there was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s conviction for first-degree premeditated murder.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYmVuZ2Fsc3dpcmUudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL2xpc3RzL2NpbmNpbm5hdGktYmVuZ2Fscy1yb3N0ZXItYnViYmxlLXBsYXllcnMtYmlnLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlcy1wcmVzZWFzb24tZG9scGhpbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals roster bubble players who need big performances in preseason finale vs. Dolphins,"It’s now-or-never mode for Cincinnati Bengals players on the roster bubble.

This comes from well-known hardware leaker Kopite7kimi on Twitter who replied to a comment about the incoming GPUs arriving late in 2022 if they are actually on TSMC 5nm (and being expensive too).

of course TSMC N5August 26 2021

As Wccftech which spotted this tweet points out the leaker had previously said that what will presumably be RTX 4000 graphics cards would be built on a 5nm process but the assumption was that Nvidia could stick with Samsung for making Lovelace chips. Now Kopite7kimi has clarified that it’ll purportedly be TSMC and this backs up what we’ve heard in recent times from another leaker – namely Greymon.

Greymon has theorized that Lovelace GPUs could be made on TSMC 5nm or maybe even an enhanced 5nm process (‘N5P’) which would offer an even better performance leap from Ampere.

Analysis: Fingers crossed for an earlier release – but what about those prices?

Remember these are pretty airy rumors at this stage but the fact that more than one source is now saying TSMC 5nm does suggest that maybe this is the route Nvidia will indeed take. It’s also possible that only certain models of RTX 4000 cards will be made at TSMC and other chips could be manufactured at Samsung.

Whatever the case it’s good to hear that Kopite7kimi believes that we won’t be waiting until late 2022 and that the next-gen graphics cards could arrive a bit earlier in the year. Particularly as previously Greymon seemed to quite firmly assert that these cards wouldn’t pitch up until the close of 2022 at best.

Fingers crossed that we could see RTX 4000 cards sooner than expected perhaps although it wouldn’t be a surprise if these new models were seriously pricey as the original tweet Kopite7kimi replied to suggested.

That’s very much the direction that the GPU industry has been headed of course but hopefully the extra pressure that stock shortages have been putting on pushing prices upwards will ease as we get to a better place in terms of component supply throughout 2022.

That said another recent rumor indicated that graphics cards could get more expensive at the beginning of next year interestingly with this theoretically being driven by TSMC upping its prices (responding to the huge demand for its chips). Which if it pans out would be an argument for Nvidia not switching to TSMC you would think – or perhaps only using it for certain models like maybe the cutting-edge flagship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXN0ZWRyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2N0cmxhbHRkZWxldGUtaS1ob3BlLXRoZS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwOTAtc3VwZXItcnVtb3Vycy1hcmUtZmFrZS00MTYwNDAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ctrl+Alt+Delete: I hope the Nvidia RTX 3090 Super rumours are fake,"New rumours suggest that a Nvidia RTX 3090 Super graphics card could be in the works with boosted specs set to make it the most powerful graphics card in the GeForce range. That may sound great on paper but honestly I’m hoping these rumours are fake.

The Super card range – which debuted with the Turing 20-series cards last generation – is made up of specced-up versions of pre-existing graphics cards with boosted video memory bandwidth and additional CUDA cores allowing users to gain a performance boost without spending substantially more.

They proved to be pretty popular with the Turing generation so I’m not surprised to see Nvidia reusing this tactic for its Ampere cards. However I don’t think that launching a new Nvidia RTX 3090 Super graphics card makes much sense right now.

The Nvidia RTX 3090 is currently the most powerful GeForce graphics card you can buy but I’d argue that the performance gains you get compared to the Nvidia RTX 3080 card do not justify the hefty price jump.

The retail price of the Founders Edition RTX 3080 is £649 while the RTX 3090 is priced at a whopping £1399 – that’s double the price. But since the RTX 3080 can already handle AAA games with a plus 60fps performance there are very few people who would need anything more powerful.

Of course the RTX 3090 is really a Titan in disguise so it’s more beneficial to content creators than gamers. Yet I still find it strange that Nvidia is rumoured to be working on a Super variant for the graphics card that needs a performance boost the least.

It’s not just the price you need to be worried about either. The real kick in the teeth is that (according to Twitter leaker Greymon55) the RTX 3090 Super could have a graphics card power that exceeds 400W. That’s a hefty jump from the graphics power of both the RTX 3090 (350w) and RTX 3080 (320W) potentially requiring you to upgrade your PSU and even accept a costly hike for your electricity bill.

It’s also impossible to ignore the GPU shortage right now. It’s incredibly difficult to find a high-end graphics card that hasn’t had its price inflated. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has suggested the GPU shortage could last through the majority of 2022.

It feels like a bit of a slap in the face to PC gamers for Nvidia to keep launching ultra-expensive graphics cards when its current crop of cards are constantly out of stock. I appreciate that Nvidia will want to launch its Super range before it moves onto the 40 Series generation in 2022 but couldn’t it just stick with the RTX 3060 Super RTX 3070 Super and RTX 3080 Super cards instead?

Of course it may turn out those RTX 3090 Super rumours are fake as we’ve only got tenuous Twitter rumours to go by right now. But if Nvidia does end up launching the souped-up graphics card I bet it’s going to be greeted with more eye rolls than jubilation.

The brand new architecture will be built on TSMC's 5nm process. This is massive news if true - and let's talk about that for a second. Kopite has leaked pretty much all the details of the Turing and Ampere architectures and has historically been extremely accurate. That said as always with leaks and before multiple confirmations a grain of salt never hurt anyone.

NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will ""come out a little bit earlier"" according to industry insider

Kopite had already previously confirmed that the Ada Lovelace architecture would be built on the 5nm process but it was assumed that this would be a Samsung node. NVIDIA had made the (correct) decision to transition to Samsung for foundry services because it had (accurately) forecasted the demand that would be hitting TSMC. Having to share resources with Apple and AMD was a gamble and NVIDIA's decision to go with Samsung appears to have been mostly validated.

of course TSMC N5 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26 2021

Yet if this leak is correct then NVIDIA is going back to TSMC for their 5nm process - and likely means at least one flagship GPU series will be produced at TSMC - which is business that Samsung Foundries just lost out on. Even if they build the high end chips on TSMC and keep the low end at Samsung (which is where the volume usually lies) it is still interesting because it means that Jensen has lost faith in Samsung's ability to keep pace with the bleeding edge nodes.

Ada Lovelace will come out a little bit earlier. Keep patient. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26 2021

Kopite has also stated that Ada Lovelace GPU will be arriving sooner than expected although since they have not confirmed the timeline in the first place we still don't have a concrete date. Rumors have put the arrival of Ada Lovelace GPUs between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 so if Kopite is expecting NVIDIA to push back the production and commence mass production a bit early the Q2 2022 timeframe might be the one to keep in mind going forward.

Recap on NVIDIA ADA GPU architecture

In many ways Ada Lovelace can be thought of as the world's first computer enthusiast. She is the first person to have realized that the Analytical Engine proposed by Charles Babbage had applications beyond pure calculation and also published what is thought to be the first algorithm (becoming the first computer programmer) intended to be carried by such a machine. This was almost half a century before Alan Turing would finish their work and invent the general-purpose computer during the world war.

NVIDIA has been known to base its architectures on prominent physicists mathematicians and scientists and Ada Lovelace is no different. Videocardz actually managed to find a major hint in NVIDIA's own merchandise store that appears to confirm this rumor about Lovelace architecture being the next generation of GPUs from the company. If you look at the heroes showcased during GTC's 2018 keynote you find not only Ada Lovelace but what are potentially all future architectural codenames from NVIDIA. Jensen might have sneakily left the entire future roadmap (as far as codenames go) in the GTC'18 keynote.

The NVIDIA AD102 ""ADA GPU"" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change) provided by Kopite. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. The only way this is even possible is because NVIDIA is apparently building this on the 5nm process which has significant die area and power reduction. Interestingly if you assume a clock speed of 1.75 GHz you can also get the peak single-precision performance of the ADA 102 GPU: 64 TFLOPs.

According to Kopite the ADA architecture will feature a much bigger L2 Cache (both Turing and Ampere have 6 MB of cache) which means this might be a major architectural revision (as Turing was to Pascal and Pascal was to Fermi/Kepler) instead of just the usual process shrink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3ZpZGVvY2FyZHouY29tL25ld3ovbWljcm9zb2Z0LXRvLWFsbG93LXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtdG8tYmUtaW5zdGFsbGVkLW9uLW9sZGVyLXBjcy10aHJvdWdoLWlzb3MtYnV0LXRoZXktbWlnaHQtbm90LWdldC11cGRhdGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft to allow Windows 11 to be installed on older PCs through ISOs but they might not get updates,"Microsoft will allow Windows 11 to be installed on older systems through ISO

This means that Windows 11 installation could be bypassed but only when manually installing Windows through ISO rather than upgrading through the Windows Update tool.

The automatic update will not be possible for officially unsupported hardware. The Verge also claims that Microsoft has updated their initial statement by adding that ISO installations may lack support for Windows Update altogether which would be a major drawback. Consumers ‘evaluating’ Windows 11 experience on unsupported hardware would not receive both the securities as well as hardware updates which for Microsoft’s own sake does not make much sense.

Update to official compatibility list: Intel Core-X added AMD Zen1 not included

Microsoft clarified that after carefully analyzing the performance and compatibility of AMD Zen1 architecture they concluded that Ryzen 1000 series will not be included in the official support list. At the same time Microsoft adds support for Core-X and Xeon-W series but also Core 7820HQ which is used by Surface Studio 2.

The company outlined the requirements for a crash-free experience. Devices supporting Windows 11 must have a 99.8% of crash-free experience the company clarified in an official blog post.

ASUS adds Windows 11 support for Intel Kaby Lake and Skylake through Intel 200 motherboard series update with TPM

TechSpot reports that ASUS is now rolling out updates for Intel Z270 H270 and B250 motherboards with support for Windows 11. The BIOS update comes with TPM enablement for these motherboards despite Skylake (6th Gen Core) and Kaby Lake (7th Gen Core) officially not being on the list of supported processor series for Windows 11.

“The following motherboards are compatible with Windows 11 under current testing. The upgrability [sic] is subject to the support from operation system or 3rd party drivers availability.” — ASUS via TechSpot

What this means is that Microsoft could support those processors if they wanted to (as long as the motherboard supports TPM/SecureBoot). However that processor may still not align with Microsoft’s reliability requirements. Unfortunately Microsoft does not share its internal Windows 11 compatibility testing results.

It appears Sony has cut a crucial corner to help turn the popular console from a loss-making product into profit-providing hardware. The thorough teardown uncovered exactly how the new PS5 manages to be 300 g/0.66 lb lighter.

4 Reviews

A video created by Austin Evans has revealed why the new “11-series” PS5 is 300 g/0.66 lb lighter than the “10-series” launch PS5. Apparently Evans paid a small fortune of over US$1000 to get hold of one of the revised PS5 consoles which was shipped from Japan to California just so he could find out what differences could be discovered in the entertaining teardown comparison video. Digital Editions of the Sony machine were used here.

The first revision of the PlayStation 5 has the model number 1100B whereas the launch model has the number 1015B. As has already been reported the stand screw for the new PS5 is easier to undo but Evans wanted to dig deeper so he went through a brief battery of tests while both consoles were in operation. The noise emissions were similar and negligible from a reasonable distance and the power draw difference could be put down to a simple margin of error but there was a perturbing find in regard to heat development.

The new PS5 was consistently 3-5 °C/6-9 °F hotter at the vents on the rear side than the launch PS5. Disassembly of the consoles also revealed that the fans were different and although they weighed the same and came from the same supplier the fan in the new PS5 has visibly longer and more curved fins. However after removing the white covers of the consoles and removing all the screws Evans and co-host Jimmy Champane of PSReady looked shocked at how clearly different the heatsinks in the two PlayStations were.

The revised PS5’s heatsink immediately looked smaller and after removal of the whole mainboard Evans was left exclaiming “Oh my God! I’ve got like half the heatsink!” Unsurprisingly weighing the two boards answered the question of why the new PS5 is 300 g/0.66 lb lighter than the original PS5 with Sony seemingly trimming down some of the copper and aluminum parts of the heatsink to save on costs leaving the console running at a higher temperature but within what the company would have deemed acceptable tolerance.

While there also seems to have been some change concerning the Wi-Fi module in the 1100B model the hosts were obviously more perturbed about the considerable heatsink differences. With the addition of an expansion SSD the PS5 would have to deal with even greater heat emissions something that could be more of a problem down the road for the new variant of the console over the launch model. As many commentators have opined it seems Sony has provided more of a downgrade rather than an upgrade with the lighter PS5.

Greg Abbott

TYLER Texas (News Release) - AUSTIN - Governor Greg Abbott today announced that the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) in partnership with local officials will establish a new COVID-19 therapeutic infusion center in Tyler. The infusion center will begin accepting patients on Tuesday and has been provided with Regeneron’s monoclonal antibodies to treat outpatient cases of COVID-19 who have a referral from a doctor. This treatment is available at no cost to the patient. Local partners include Smith County Northeast Texas Public Health District UT Health East Texas and Christus Trinity Mother Frances Health System.

According to Smith County Judge Nathaniel Moran the therapeutic infusion center will be located inside the UT Health North Campus on U.S. Highway 271.

“The new infusion center in Tyler which is the second currently operating in East Texas will help us reduce the burden on hospitals as we continue to mitigate the spread of COVID-19” said Governor Abbott. “COVID-19 antibody infusion treatment is available for free to all Texans who test positive for the virus and have a doctor’s referral. Texans can visit meds.tdem.texas.gov to find a therapeutic provider near them.”

Governor Abbott TDEM and the Texas Department of State Health Services have established and expanded antibody infusion centers in communities across the state over the past few weeks. COVID-19 antibody infusion treatment can prevent a patient’s condition from worsening and requiring hospital care. These facilities also help increase bed capacity in hospitals so that resources are available for the most ill patients. The State deployed similar measures beginning in November 2020 to communities across Texas.

These state-sponsored Infusion Centers are in addition to the antibody infusion treatment that is provided by more than 200 private health providers across the state.

Antibody infusion centers are currently operating in the following communities with more coming online in the coming days:

Austin (DSHS)

Beaumont (TDEM)

The Woodlands (DSHS)

Corpus Christi (DSHS)

Edinburg (TDEM)

Fort Worth (DSHS)

Harlingen (TDEM)

Houston (DSHS)

Laredo (DSHS)

Lubbock (TDEM)

Nacogdoches (TDEM)

Odessa (TDEM)

San Antonio (DSHS)

Tyler (TDEM)

The treatment is free and available to all Texans who test positive for COVID-19 and have a doctor’s referral. Texans can visit meds.tdem.texas.gov to find a therapeutic provider near them.

Christina Pushaw spent more than a week doing battle on Twitter over an accurate — albeit unflattering — story about Gov. Ron DeSantis’ financial ties to the maker of a drug he’s touting to fight COVID-19. No doubt DeSantis approves of Pushaw’s pugnacious tactics but the entire saga is a sorry display by a hyper-political administration that is all too eager to pick petty fights with the media.

It started with an Aug. 17 story by Associated Press reporter Brendan Farrington headlined “DeSantis top donor invests in COVID drug governor promotes.” The report citing financial and elections records detailed that the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel owns $15.9 million in shares of Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc. maker of the antibody treatment DeSantis has been urging Floridians sick with COVID-19 to take. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin meanwhile has donated more than $10 million to a political committee that supports DeSantis.

Using public records to connect the dots between people in power and the influential donors who fund their campaigns is just a routine part of political reporting. Farrington included the context that hedge funds typically have a wide range of investments — and quoted Pushaw pointing out that Citadel with $39 billion in holdings owns far more shares in vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna. The story also noted that the mega hedge fund BlackRock which has mostly donated to Democrats also owns shares of Regeneron.

When cool heads on Twitter pointed out that the story is in fact accurate Pushaw’s complaint became about the headline (which is also accurate). She made the astonishing leap in logic that it might even dissuade sick people from seeking the antibody treatment if they think the governor is only touting it for his own political gain. The COVID crisis in Florida is not that people are avoiding lifesaving treatment. It’s that so many need it.

Nonetheless Pushaw disparaged the story as a “baseless political narrative” and has been one-upping her own outrageous rhetoric since. Soon after the story went online Pushaw tweeted a link to it and wrote “drag them” a social media call to action to flood a user with mocking messages. She denied that was her intent but Pushaw’s 30000+ followers heard the call anyway. Farrington wrote that he woke up in the middle of the night to hateful messages and death threats.

Pushaw’s Twitter account was suspended for 12 hours and she deleted the “drag them” tweet. But if there’s any question about her level of remorse she has since tweeted about the story more than 200 times calling it a “hit piece” and Farrington a “media activist.” She warned Farrington that if he didn’t change the story she would “put you on blast.” She also retweeted a message that said “Light. Them. Up.” in reference to the AP. Reminder: This is a public employee whose job is to disseminate information about the governor’s actions and policies and respond to inquiries from the media.

Press secretaries’ interactions with reporters are often adversarial — that’s healthy in a democracy — but Pushaw for all her righteous indignation prefers to play in the dirt.

She landed her $120000-a-year gig with DeSantis after writing to his office about wanting to help combat “pervasive … false narratives” in the press. She’s prolific on Twitter — and has had to delete and apologize for posts before — often tapping into controversies like mask mandates and repeatedly tweeting at reporters who challenge DeSantis policies.

DeSantis — who is now fundraising off the AP story by claiming it’s all a conspiracy — built a national profile as a guest on Fox News slamming any media figure liberal pundit or Democratic politician who criticized Donald Trump. Pushaw speaks the same language as DeSantis and Trump a noxious glossary of bullying pettiness and demagoguing. It may be effective for riling up the Twitter trolls but it’s beneath them. It’s beneath us all.

Rasha Alqahtani’s ambitious proposal — inspired in part by personal experience with the stressors of the pandemic — has been accepted as a screener for a personal disorder anxiety according to a report from Smithsonian magazine.



Alqahtani began researching her prizewinning project last year as a participant in Mawhiba a national STEM program for gifted-and-talented students in Saudi Arabia and won a behavioral science award in this year’s Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.



This is an annual competition for ninth through twelfth graders administered by the Society for Science in Washington D.C. Her prototype aims to address the problems of stigma and inaccessibility that psychologists say present substantial roadblocks to teens getting mental health care.



In addition to her STEM research Alqahtani is a poet and artist. She is determined to help her peers learn about their anxiety — in the wildly popular setting of ‘Minecraft’. Alqahtani recounts how she wanted to work toward something that would genuinely help people in her generation.



She’d seen anxiety affect the lives of people around her — a family member a “genius” schoolmate who’d cry and hyperventilate with each test strangers in TikTok confessionals. To some extent she struggled with it herself as “a straight-A student trying to keep perfection” the Smithsonian reported.



“I tried to heal myself by myself almost all of the time” she said. “In Saudi Arabia we are starting now to connect the dots and to raise awareness about mental health. Going to a psychologist does still have a negative effect on a person in society” Alqahtani said.



The magazine writes Alqahtani resolved to do something about the anxiety she’d noticed around her and the sense that taking the immediate step of going to a psychologist might daunt some teens. Research bore out her observations: The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that anxiety is in the top ten causes of teen illness and disability.



“I would just tear up to live in ‘Minecraft’ for a day. I really love it” she said. So as the pandemic made her and so many others feel anxious she proposed a research project for a Mawhiba program that would use the familiar fun format of a video game to evaluate players for GAD.



Rather than the daunting task of building a full-blown game from scratch Alqahtani set her sights on what she calls a “feature” a module that users would access within a preexisting video game. For the purposes of the prototype she didn’t actually code the feature but instead produced a video simulation of what it would look like within the game of “Minecraft” the Smithsonian reported.



Alqahtani drew on one of her hobbies — she makes short films — and created a video that looked like “Minecraft: Story Mode” in which players choose their own adventures by indicating how they’d like to respond to various scenarios.



In Alqahtani’s version instead of deciding which character to save from a monstrous enemy users choose how they’d react in different potentially anxiety provoking scenarios. In scoring the assessment a higher score after completing 13 of these questions should indicate higher anxiety levels.



To develop the different scenarios Alqahtani adapted a psychometric from the 1950s the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale the first internationally utilized measurement of someone’s tendency towards anxiousness.



She found the stilted true/false statements of the TMAS — like “At times I am so restless that I cannot sit in a chair for very long”— hard to conceptualize so she adapted them into “Minecraft” scenarios.



She surveyed more than 500 peers about their willingness to get a psychological assessment online and then guided 35 female participants through the game demo on Zoom and logged their answers.



Ultimately her analysis showed that the video-game-scenario results corresponded with those of the actual TMAS; people’s scores on one measure resembled their scores on the other.



“It’s kind of life-changing” she said. “You see that when you work this hard people...give you the appreciation you deserve.”



Alqahtani’s innovative test could become part of the cutting-edge field of digital therapeutics operating at the intersection of psychology and technology. At King Saud University her first-choice school she intends to major in software or biomedical engineering.



She plans to add multiple different metrics of anxiety to her game feature to make its assessment more complete and is eager to find collaborators to propel the project forward. — SG",,,

In one 2019 survey of BI and analytics professionals a combined 94% of the 500 respondents cited data and analytics as very important or somewhat important contributors to business growth and digital transformation strategies in their organizations.

The survey conducted for BI software vendor MicroStrategy and detailed in a report titled ""2020 Global State of Enterprise Analytics"" also found that 59% of those organizations were moving forward on advanced and predictive analytics applications -- the realm of data science. That was up seven percentage points from a similar survey done a year earlier.

Survey respondents listed security and privacy concerns as the No. 1 barrier to more effective use of data and analytics but other top challenges included limited access to siloed data the lack of qualified talent insufficient employee training and the absence of an analytics strategy. To help turn data into actionable information more and more organizations are creating data science teams to lead their efforts in areas such as data mining predictive modeling machine learning and AI.

Let's look at best practices for structuring and managing a data science team including the different ways one can be set up the positions it's likely to include and the executives who a team may report to in an organization.

Different models for structuring a data science team ""To some degree building and maintaining a strong data science team is an art"" said John Bottega president of the EDM Council a global association that focuses on data management best practices standards and training. Responsibilities for data collection management and analysis once typically fell under the CIO whose IT team worked with business users to implement data warehouses and BI systems to hold and organize data and do basic analysis and reporting. However over the past two decades more organizations separated the data function into its own department as the amount of internal data stores grew supporting technologies evolved and data-related tasks became more differentiated and specialized. The increasing importance of advanced analytics to business success also drove the need for a data science team with skilled data scientists and other workers. Today many organizations have a team or an entire data science department; larger ones may have multiple teams that operate independently or in a coordinated way. How companies structure their teams varies based on the maturity of their data science program as well as their data analytics goals overall organizational structure and enterprise culture. However some common models on data science team structure have emerged with each having pros and cons. Team structures can be: Decentralized. Data science team members work within the individual business units they support. This allows team members to closely collaborate with business executives and workers on data science projects but it can hinder the strategic use of data across an organization and require more resources than smaller companies may have available.

Data science team members work within the individual business units they support. This allows team members to closely collaborate with business executives and workers on data science projects but it can hinder the strategic use of data across an organization and require more resources than smaller companies may have available. Centralized. The data science function is consolidated at the enterprise level under a single manager who assigns team members to individual projects and oversees their work. This model more easily allows for an enterprise-wide strategic view and uniform implementation of analytics best practices but it can limit the ability of team members to become experts in a particular area of the business. Some organizations establish a formal data science center of excellence to house a centralized team.

Some organizations establish a formal data science center of excellence to house a centralized team. Hybrid. The data science team is managed centrally but members are assigned to work with specific business operations and are accountable for helping those units reach their objectives to make data-driven decisions. In hybrid structures a center of excellence may also focus on promoting data science best practices and standards. As with the decentralized model resource constraints can be an issue.

Data science team roles and responsibilities There are some common elements that a data science team must have to be successful. ""Regardless of industry data science teams need to be strong in three core areas: mathematical technology and business acumen"" Bottega said. ""Finding a single person that excels in all three is quite rare. Many companies will have someone that is fluent in two of three and then the rest of the team can be built around that filling in the gaps to ensure the team as a whole is strong in all three."" Small organizations or those with limited analytics needs or early-stage data science initiatives may have a generalist handle all the required tasks. Larger entities as well as those with more mature programs typically include some combination of the following roles in their data science teams. Data scientist. As the title indicates data scientists are the core members of a team. They use statistical methods machine learning algorithms and other tools to analyze data and create predictive models; some also build data products recommendation engines chatbots and other technologies for various use cases. Data scientists typically have a variety of skills in areas such as mathematics statistics data wrangling data mining coding and predictive modeling as well as business knowledge and communication and collaboration skills. Increasingly they also have advanced data science degrees or graduate-level data science certifications. Data analyst. A data analyst doesn't have the full skill set of a data scientist but can support data science efforts. The main responsibilities of data analysts are to collect and maintain data from operational systems and databases use statistical methods and analytics tools to interpret the data and prepare dashboards and reports for business users. Data engineer. Data engineers are responsible for building testing and maintaining data pipelines; they generally have a background in software engineering or computer science that suits their focus on the technology infrastructure and data collection management and storage. They also often work closely with data scientists on data quality data preparation and model deployment and maintenance tasks. Data architect. A data architect designs and oversees the implementation of the underlying systems and data infrastructure that the team uses. In some cases a data engineer might also handle this role. Machine learning engineer. Also sometimes called an AI engineer this position works in conjunction with data scientists to create deploy and maintain the algorithms and models needed for machine learning and AI initiatives. In some organizations data science teams may also include these positions. Citizen data scientist. An informal role this can involve business analysts business-unit power users and other employees who are capable of doing their own data analytics work. Citizen data scientists often have an interest in acumen for or some training on advanced analytics although the technologies they use -- for example automated machine learning tools -- typically require little to no coding. They often work outside of a data science team but may be incorporated into ones that are embedded in business units. Business analyst. In some cases business analysts may be members of a data science team in their regular role which includes evaluating business processes and translating business requirements into analysis plans -- areas in which they can help support the work of data scientists. Data translator. A new addition to the roster these professionals -- also known as analytics translators -- act as a liaison between data science teams and business operations and help plan projects and translate the insights gleaned from data analytics into recommended business actions. Data visualization developer or engineer. They're tasked with creating data visualizations to make information more accessible and understandable for business professionals. However data scientists and data analysts may handle this role themselves on some teams.

Who manages and oversees data science teams? A team may be led by a director of data science data science manager lead data scientist or similar managerial position. The reporting structure for teams similarly varies. Generally though organizations assign either a C-level executive or high-ranking functional manager to oversee the data science team. The most visible data science leader is the chief data officer. The CDO position dates back to 2002 with financial services firm Capital One widely recognized as the first company to implement the role. Many others have since followed suit: Data and analytics consultancy NewVantage Partners reported that 65% of 85 large companies it surveyed in 2020 had CDOs up from 12% when it first did the annual survey in 2012. Initially focused primarily on data governance management and security functions many CDOs have now also taken on responsibility for data science analytics and AI. Other organizations have created a chief analytics officer (CAO) role to oversee their data science and analytics teams while some have combined the CDO and CAO positions into a single chief data and analytics officer. In addition the head of a data science team may report to a different executive -- for example the COO CFO or CIO or a position such as vice president of analytics vice president of business data or director of data and strategy. This organizational chart is an example of how a data science can be structured.

How data scientists work with business users Organizations of all kinds are striving to become data-driven and with good reason: Many see it as a key to remaining competitive in the digital age. To that end data science teams should work collaboratively with business managers to: Clearly understand the business questions they want the team to answer. Articulate the objectives they have for using the information it provides. Map out how to apply the information to make decisions and take actions. ""Data scientists need to work closely with the business unit to understand how the data they provide helps drive the business and understand exactly what [business users] need out of the data"" said Josh Drew Boston-area regional vice president for Robert Half Technology and The Creative Group two units of staffing firm Robert Half International Inc. Once they have that understanding data science teams cannot merely present their findings. They must help their business colleagues understand the insights gained from the data and how that information can shape product and services offerings marketing campaigns supply chain management and other key parts of business operations to support enterprise goals such as higher revenue increased efficiency and better customer service.

Tools that a data science team needs Dozens of tools ranging from data visualization and reporting software to advanced analytics machine learning and AI technologies enable the work that data science teams do. The number and combination of technologies needed is unique to each team based on its goals and skill levels. The following is a list of commonly used data science tools that includes both commercial and open source technologies: statistical analysis tools such as SAS and IBM SPSS;

machine learning frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow Weka Scikit-learn Keras and PyTorch;

data science platforms from various vendors that provide diverse sets of capabilities for analytics automated machine learning and workflow management and collaboration;

programming languages in particular Python R Julia SQL Scala and Java;

Jupyter Notebook and other interactive notebook applications for sharing documents that contain code equations comments and related information;

data visualization tools and libraries such as Tableau D3.js and Matplotlib;

Spark Hadoop and other big data platforms and analytics engines as well as cloud object storage services and NoSQL databases; and

the Kubernetes container orchestration service for deploying analytics and machine learning workloads in the cloud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzI4L3Jvb2tpZS1xYi1zdWZmZXJzLWtuZWUtaW5qdXJ5LWluLWluZHlzLXdpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rookie QB suffers knee injury in Indy's win | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"DETROIT -- The Indianapolis Colts' depth chart at quarterback took another hit.

Rookie Sam Ehlinger was knocked out of the preseason finale with a knee injury in a 27-17 win over the Detroit Lions on Friday night.

""It didn't look good"" Colts Coach Frank Reich said. ""We need to wait for the doctors' final say.""

With Carson Wentz recovering from foot surgery Ehlinger is competing with second-year quarterback Jacob Eason to possibly take the team's first snap in two weeks when the season opens.

Ehlinger was hurt in the first half after he was 3 for 3 for 63 yards including a 60-yard pass after escaping a sack and had a 14-yard run. Eason was 10 of 14 for 74 yards.

To keep Eason healthy for Week 1 the Colts let 28-year-old Brett Hundley finish the game under center and he took full advantage.

Hundley threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Deon Jackson and the rookie running back rushed for a tying two-point conversion. A few snaps later linebacker Curtis Bolton intercepted David Blough's pass to set up Rodrigo Blankenship's 42-yard field goal -- his fourth of the game -- that put Indy ahead 20-17.

Jackson converted a third down with a 42-yard touchdown run up the middle with 1:50 left sealing a 3-0 preseason for the Colts.

Detroit fell to 0-3 under first-year Coach Dan Campbell.

""I'm encouraged -- I am"" Campbell said. ""Do we still have work to do? Yeah. A lot of work to do but we have time. The hardest thing is to have urgency and patience at the same time. I don't know how you do that but I'm working on it.""

The Lions looked like they might win the preseason game when they led 14-6 late in the first quarter on Tim Boyle's 15-yard touchdown pass to Quintez Cephus and Godwin Igwebuike's 1-yard run for a score.

Detroit's defense which was one of the worst in NFL history last season failed to stop Indy's fourth-string quarterback to hold on for the win.

CHIEFS 28 VIKINGS 25

KANSAS CITY Mo. -- Patrick Mahomes was nearly perfect throwing for 117 yards and two scores in his only two chances with the ball and leading Kansas City over Minnesota.

Mahomes was sharper than he'd been his first two exhibitions finishing 8 of 9 with the only miss a throwaway with nobody open. Mahomes capped his first series against Minnesota with a 35-yard throw to Tyreek Hill who'd run right by former Chiefs cornerback Bashaud Breeland then capped the second with a short TD pass to tight end Blake Bell.

Mahomes' counterpart Kirk Cousins wasn't nearly as effective for Minnesota. He led the Vikings to a field goal on his first offensive series but went three-and-out on each of the next two finishing 5 of 7 for 57 yards. Cousins looked out of sync with his receivers and took a big loss on a sack by Anthony Hitchens.

Chiefs backup Chad Henne didn't play Friday night so Shane Buechele got plenty of work. The rookie was sharp driving KC for a TD and a 21-3 halftime lead but Buechele also threw a pick-six to Parry Nickerson in the fourth quarter.

The Vikings' defense scored two touchdowns during their three preseason losses. Their offense scored only one a 32-yard run by backup running back A.J. Rose Jr. midway through the third quarter Friday night.

Derrick Gore answered with a 56-yard catch-and-run to help Kansas City finish 3-0 in the preseason.

PANTHERS 34

STEELERS 9

CHARLOTTE N.C. -- Sam Darnold completed 19 of 25 passes for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns and Carolina defeated Pittsburgh in the preseason finale for both teams.

Darnold who saw his most extensive action of the preseason spent most of the first quarter under duress despite playing against a defense that was resting all of its starters.

But the 2018 No. 3 overall draft pick acquired this offseason from the New York Jets stayed calm and rebounded finding rookie Terrace Marshall Jr. for a 13-yard touchdown pass and Robby Anderson for an 8-yard score before exiting at halftime. D.J. Moore caught six passes from Darnold for 48 yards.

Christian McCaffrey sat out but the rest of Carolina's offensive and defensive starters played the entire first half.

JETS 31 EAGLES 31

EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. -- James Morgan threw a 49-yard Hail Mary to Kenny Yeboah as time expired and Josh Adams ran in the two-point conversion to lead New York to a tie with Philadelphia in a preseason finale that was played without most of the teams' starters.

The scores capped a stirring -- and entertaining -- comeback that had the Jets players and coaches celebrating wildly on the sideline as if they had won a playoff game.

The start was delayed 30 minutes because of strong storms that moved through the New York and New Jersey area.

Most of the projected starters for both teams sat out -- including quarterbacks Jalen Hurts for Philadelphia and Zach Wilson for New York -- after the squads held joint practices at the Jets' facility on Wednesday and Thursday.

New York was trailing 24-10 when Ty Johnson had a 3-yard run up the middle for a score as time expired in the third quarter.

The victory extends its all-time record to 37-0 in FIBA Americas Championship competition since its 2009 debut.

The 31 points from Combine Academy's Dillingham was a team record as he added six rebounds four assists and three steals. Ronald Holland of Duncanville (Texas) had a strong performance for Team USA finishing with 21 points and 12 rebounds. He averaged a team-best 19 points and 10.2 rebounds through six games.





The 15-point victory was the team's slimmest margin of victory of the tournament outscoring opponents 611-334 through their first five games. Meanwhile the 90 points was the lowest scoring output of the tournament after averaging 122.2 points heading into the championship game.





Team USA finished the game shooting 42.9 percent from the field and knocked down 11-of-37 from 3-point territory. They held Argentina to 37 percent shooting and forced 20 turnovers while outrebounding Argentina by 17. Tiziano Prome finished with a team-high 15 points and 6 rebounds in the loss for Argentina.

A very different place to the one we have today.

Cattle market sheep sale Bell Hotel etc in background. Date: Unknown (Image: Archant Library)

A time when the city and towns across Norfolk and Suffolk had market days and half-day closing. Once a week there was a busy day and a quiet afternoon in our communities.

In Diss where I grew up Friday was packed for market day while on Tuesday afternoon the streets were empty…up the road in Norwich half-day closing was on a Thursday and of course Saturday was the big market day on “Norwich Hill” in front of the Castle.

Wandering around that part of the city now it is difficult to image those times when it was packed with livestock members of the farming community country and city folk.

One man who wrote a fine piece about Norwich Hill was author Robert Bagshaw in his book More Memories of Norfolk 30 years ago.

“I still cling to the belief that something of the heart went out of Norwich when they took away the old Cattle Market and transplanted it at Harford Bridges” he wrote.

“Mind you part of the city’s agricultural soul had already gone for the Corn Exchange had long been demolished and the Agricultural Hall was no longer fulfilling its original function.

“But when the city finally gave up playing host to the weekly invasion from the countryside there was little left to remind Norwich of the debt it owed to its agricultural surroundings” said Robert.

And he went on: “For as long as any of us could remember Saturday had been the day when Norwich became a farmyard with all the sights and sounds - not to mention the smells – of the countryside.

“The cobbles of the city streets echoed to the assorted sounds of sliding hooves hobnailed boots and clattering sticks” he added.

The Hill was the Saturday mecca for the farming fraternity. Sheep by the hundred at the bottom fat cattle the store cattle and the area up to Rose Avenue was where the modest and much respected Edmund Ireland carried out sales.

Then there were the pigs and the smaller stock such as goats and rabbits ferrets and cage birds…and it was Sir Alfred Munnings who painted the horse sales at Spelman’s with such passion..

And rows and rows of stalls – the 'car boots' of their day.

“To a little boy such as I was then it was the most wonderful of all spectacles. It was frightening yet alluring smelly yet romantic. It was inconceivable then that the tradition of the Saturday Market on Norwich Hill could ever become nothing more than just a memory. But the market has gone and all that remains is the memory.”

The late Robert who lived at Wymondham was a dentist when he wasn’t writing. Look out for his books in the second-hand shops. They are wonderful reads.

These pictures were taken back in 1957 and were sent to us many years ago by John Duffield. At the time he was a trainee with the firm of Jonathan Howlett who sold cows calves and store cattle on a Saturday.

“The characters featured include Bob Applegate market foreman and Albert Barker who was a drover and also milked out every awaiting collection for the new owners. Note: cigarette over the bucket” said John. Different times…",,,

Both Toski Sands Market of Petoskey and Provisions Wine Market & Deli of Boyne City aim to have the best selection of liquor for their customers but up until recently didn't have anything unique and specifically theirs.

Both stores embarked on a barrel sharing program that allows them to taste test a number of bourbons from a distillery choose their favorite and market it as their own unique blend or ""store pick.""

""We've done three different store picks. Two of which we shared with our friends at Provisions"" said Toski Sands cashier Trevor Ross.

Ross who helps with liquor ordering explained that the way a barrel sharing program works is that either a store or the distiller's representative will reach out to one another to purchase a single barrel of bourbon. However a full barrel yields over 400 bottles.

""It's too many to try and sell"" he said. ""We wanted to split it up and since Provisions is such a similar store we really wanted to work with them.""

The first barrel share the stores did was back in April through the TC Whiskey Company out of Traverse City.

The second barrel which was a unanimous pick between the two stores hit store shelves in late July.

""That was with Three Chord Distillers and they brought us about 10 or 12 different samples ranging from ryes to different high proof bourbons"" said Provisions bartender and ""jack of all trades"" Harley Welsh.

""We all took notes and after the tasting we discussed which ones we liked the most and the one we picked was at the top of the list for all of us"" he said.

The way the barrel share program works is a distiller will bring in samples for a store to choose from. Once they choose and order their barrel it gets packaged and labeled with a special label designated it as a store pick.

Both Toski Sands and Provisions received TC Whiskey and Three Chord bottles with their logo and name on it for their own one-of-a-kind bourbon.

""People don't always realize that we can't get or can't always get special blended bourbons or super high end things. Some of it's impossible to get"" said Welsh.

""When they ask us about special or unique things it's been great to be able to point them to this as you literally can't get it anywhere else. It's a special Provisions (or Toski Sands) labeled bottle"" he said.

Ross explained the uniqueness of the bourbons even further in that ""...when you get a single barrel it really gets its own unique characteristics and tastes. You literally won't get the same taste characteristics or bottle anywhere else.""

Both Toski Sands and Provisions have a number of store pick bourbons left and are looking forward to continued collaboration for future one-off store branded bottles.

""It really has been a great thing for us as I think both stores are established and our customers trust our tastes"" said Provisions store manager Samantha McKenney.

""We wanted to get to Kentucky this past year for a third barrel but the pandemic put a halt to that. However we are hoping to travel down that way in the spring"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L2J1cmxpbmd0b24tc3RvY2stZHJvcHMtOS1hZnRlci1lYXJuaW5ncy1pcy1pdC1hLWJ1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burlington Stock Drops 9% After Earnings: Is It a Buying Opportunity?,"The off-price retailer posted excellent second-quarter results but expects to experience significant margin pressure over the next few quarters.

U.S. retail spending has surged this year with brick-and-mortar chains driving the bulk of the industry's growth. Off-price retailers have been some of the biggest winners.

On Thursday Burlington Stores (BURL -0.31%) joined its two larger rivals -- TJX Companies and Ross Stores (ROST -0.99%) -- by reporting stellar second-quarter sales and a big earnings beat. Nevertheless Burlington stock plunged 9% following the earnings release. While the retailer does face near-term margin headwinds this pullback could be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Another excellent quarter

Like many brick-and-mortar retailers Burlington Stores suffered during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close its stores and dented traffic after they reopened. However its business has come roaring back this year.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2021 comparable store sales surged 20% relative to fiscal 2019. Including the benefit of two years of store openings total sales rose 35%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to $2.59 as the strong demand environment boosted gross margin and enabled Burlington to spread its operating expenses over more sales.

Burlington's momentum continued in the second quarter. Comp sales jumped 19% driving a 34% increase in total sales compared to second-quarter 2019. Gross margin improved again helping Burlington post a 55% increase in operating income and a 43% increase in adjusted EPS versus two years ago.

The company's revenue of $2.21 billion comfortably beat the analyst consensus of $2.05 billion. Similarly its adjusted EPS of $1.94 crushed the average analyst estimate of $1.38. However even with these strong results Burlington stock failed to maintain its big year-to-date gains following the earnings release.

A cautious outlook spooked investors

During Burlington's recent earnings call management said it expects double-digit comp sales growth to continue in the second half of fiscal 2021. Nevertheless executives struck a cautious tone with respect to near-term profitability due to soaring freight and supply chain costs. This matched the downbeat earnings forecast Ross Stores provided a week earlier.

Indeed CFO John Crimmins estimated that if comp sales grow by 10% this quarter Burlington's operating margin would decrease by about 2.5 percentage points relative to 2019. This forecast likely contributed to Burlington stock's big decline on Thursday.

Of course if Burlington can sustain its first-half revenue growth rate for the rest of fiscal 2021 it might be able to absorb the current cost pressure while holding margins flat. However with the U.S. government starting to pull back on fiscal stimulus measures management expects sales growth to moderate in the months ahead.

Big upside offsets high valuation

Even after Burlington stock's recent pullback the shares trade for about 30 times forward earnings. That compares to 22 times forward earnings for Ross Stores. Indeed Burlington shares have consistently carried a higher valuation than other major off-price retailers in recent years.

However Burlington has more long-term upside than its larger more established peers. First it has massive expansion potential. The company sees room to eventually operate 2000 stores in the U.S. up from just 792 at the end of last quarter. That would represent a 153% increase. By contrast Ross Stores' long-term target of 3000 locations implies room to increase its store count by only 58% over time.

Second Burlington has meaningful margin expansion potential. In fiscal 2019 it recorded a 9.3% adjusted operating margin compared to Ross Stores' 13.4% operating margin during the same period. Management has developed a clear plan to close that gap by shifting the store base toward smaller stores with higher sales per square foot and faster inventory turnover.

Burlington stock remains quite pricey to be sure. But between its existing track record of success its expansion potential and management's plans to boost its operating margin it holds plenty of promise for patient investors. That makes the recent pullback look like an enticing buying opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaW5tZW5sby5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOC9tZXJ2aW4tZy1tb3JyaXMtcGFzc2VzLWF3YXktYXQtYWdlLTEwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mervin G. Morris passes away at age 101,"Mervin G. Morris passes away at age 101

Long-time Atherton resident Mervin G. Morris founder of Mervyn’s Stores and philanthropist passed away on August 24 2021 at the age of 101.

Merv lived the quintessential American Dream. He was born in San Francisco on July 4 1920 to Fannie and Harry Morris. He was a third generation Californian. His great grandparents ran a store in the Mother Lode during the Gold Rush.

Merv grew up in the small Central Valley farming town of Delano along with his sisters Bertille and Jacqueline. His parents ran a local retail store called Morris’ and Merv learned the retail business early on by working as a sales clerk. After graduating from Delano High School in 1938 he went on to attend one semester at the University of California Berkeley before being called home.

Merv remained in Delano helping with the family business until he enlisted in the military during World War II. He was stationed domestically during the war running an Army post exchange based in Arkansas. Merv was discharged with the rank of Captain.

Merv returned home after the war and rejoined his parents in the family business. He eventually decided he needed to strike out on his own and relocated to San Francisco. On July 29 1949 at the age of 29 Merv opened the first Mervyn’s in San Lorenzo California.

While he was in the early years of building his business Merv met Roslyn Grossman a young woman from Napa on a blind date. They married in San Francisco in September of 1950. They soon welcomed four children into their family: Diane Jeff and twins John and Jim.

From 1949 to 1960 Merv continued to grow the San Lorenzo Mervyn’s store expanding multiple times beyond its original location and solidifying the Mervyn’s way. He then set his sights on additional locations. Mervyn’s celebrated its first day as a public company in the spring of 1971. With the additional funds from the public offering Merv was able to rapidly expand Mervyn’s.

Mervyn’s was sold to Dayton Hudson (now Target) in January 1978. Merv remained Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company until 1979 by which point there were approximately 75 Mervyn’s stores.

During his 30-year tenure as founder and CEO of Mervyn’s Merv built a reputation of having both a keen business mind and a deep sense of loyalty. His employees and customers loved Mervyn’s and Merv returned the feelings in spades. He was respected and beloved. He was an innovative leader smartly choosing his store sites and understanding the consumers of the post-War boom years. In recognition of his achievements in 1977 Merv was elected chairman of the board of directors of the National Retail Merchants Association an organization comprised of approximately 3500 retail stores worldwide. At the time Merv was the first West Coast retailer to head the organization in more than 60 years.

After he retired from Mervyn’s Merv became Chairman of Morris Management Company a family investment firm. He held many board positions including serving on the boards of Dayton Hudson Corporation Ross Stores Pacific Gas & Electric Company Vans Shoes and the Oakland Tribune.

Merv also became a committed philanthropist and served as a trustee on numerous non-profit boards including the Boys & Girls Clubs of America the California Academy of Sciences the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Stanford Hospital the Jewish Home for the Aged Mt. Zion Hospital of San Francisco and the University of Southern California. He was appointed to serve as a Trustee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum by President George W. Bush in 2002. He was also a civilian advisor to the Commanding General of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

Merv and Roz built an admirable philanthropic legacy during their nearly 66 years of marriage. They made a major investment to build the Mervin G. Morris Clubhouse for the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula. They were also committed supporters of the Peninsula Volunteers in Menlo Park providing critical funds to build the Roslyn G. Morris Activity Center. Their philanthropic interests further included the San Francisco Symphony the San Francisco Opera and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Merv was the quintessential patriarch of his family. He was a devoted brother to his dear sisters and a remarkable father grandfather and great-grandfather. He was the master of the toast at every family affair and was deservedly the center of everyone’s orbit. To imagine a family gathering without him is unthinkable but we can rest assured that his astounding legacy will live on for his family and for the broader community for many years to come.

Merv was predeceased by his loving wife Roz by his parents and by his sister Bertille. He is survived by his four children and their spouses — Diane Jeff (Missy) John and Jim (Susan) — and by his sister Jacqueline. He is also survived by his 14 grandchildren his 10 great-grandchildren and by his devoted friend Cynthia Hockey. The family is grateful for the excellent assistance provided to Merv by Vicky Evangelista Shirley Schall Esthela Prado Hicenia Aguirre and Jane Feng.

Merv’s family will host a Celebration of Life at a later date. In lieu of flowers if you wish the family asks that donations in honor of Merv be sent to the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula (401 Pierce Road Menlo Park CA 94025) Peninsula Volunteers Inc. (800 Middle Avenue Menlo Park CA 94025) or a charity of ones choosing.",,,,,,

Fain Royal Caribbean Group’s President and CEO spoke about the battle the company is facing with its fight against the Delta variant and COVID-19 in general.

Mr. Fain remains confident that the fight can only be won through vaccinations and believes the battle the cruise industry faces with the Delta variant is similar to the battle the Allies and the Germans fought out in the Second World War.

The comparison according to Mr. Fain makes sense: “I love historical perspectives and the best comparison I can think of is the battle of the bulge. It may be a bit of an extreme comparison but the parallels to our current situation are very strong and very informative.”

Delta Variant Proving To Be A Huge Hindrance For Growth

Only weeks ago Richard Fain spoke about the battle that was almost over. Believing the worst was behind us the virus had been controlled somewhat and through the use of the vaccines that are out there the world would become normal again.

But the Delta variant has undoubtedly put a spanner in the wheels. Delta is far more contagious than the earlier versions of COVID and has generated another big spike in cases. Royal Caribbean Group sees a slump in bookings and the current cases have hurt their business:

“Fortunately the vaccines are still very effective and they’ve kept the overall hospitalizations and fatalities. Well below last winter’s peak even with this much more dangerous variant that’s hurt our bookings and your business especially for this year in the beginning of next.”

It has not shaken the belief for the CEO that this is another battle in the fight the industry and the world is fighting against a common enemy.

“Like World War Two we’re fighting a powerful and determined enemy.”

In his video the CEO of the second-largest cruise company in the world draws parallels between the fight the soldiers in WWII thought against the German troops and how Americans are fighting against COVID now:

“The battle of the bulge was a huge attack by the Germans on American forces near Belgium towards the end of world war II. The attack was a total surprise and our troops were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The concern was that if the Nazis defeated our troops there they would split the allied forces in half and thereby prolonged the war.”

“Everyone worked together and saved them. They’re heroes and they’re resolved saved the lives of countless numbers of people who otherwise would have been victims in a longer war. There are some almost uncanny parallels to our current fight against COVID. Firstly like World War II we’re fighting a powerful and determined enemy.”

Richard Fain believes that despite America being a country that admires the rugged individual the country now needs to stand together and do what is right. And that means everyone able should be vaccinated.

“We have no choice but to do what it takes to defeat this insidious disease. I hope and I trust that America will once again stand up and be counted. Secondly only by working together can we win. All of us need to be vaccinated just like the American heroes that shortened the war by their actions during the battle of the bulge we all need to do what it takes to contain COVID by taking the vaccine not for ourselves but for our loved ones our friends.”

The FDA’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine in recent weeks is a big step forward and one that Richard Fain appreciates. The future remains optimistic for the company and while bookings are not there yet in the near term the long-term prospects remain positive.

Richard Fain believes the end is near despite the peak in hospitalizations and fatalities which occurred mainly amongst those who have chosen not to be vaccinated. Richard Fain closes his video message with a bit of simple advice: “Please wash your hands and dammit. Get vaccinated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA4L25lYXJseS02MC1vZi10aGUtcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWdyb3VwLWNydWlzZS1mbGVldC1pcy1ub3ctYmFjay1pbi1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 60% of the Royal Caribbean Group Cruise Fleet is Now Back in Service,"With its cruise restart plan picking up pace the Royal Caribbean Group will a achieve a major milestone in August.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvaHVudGVyLWJpZGVuLWd1bi1jaGFyZ2VzLTAwMTU3MTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge denies Hunter Biden's bid to dismiss gun charges,"Federal law bars people who use illegal drugs from buying guns. Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

For those who wonder what Salesforce might look like without CEO Marc Benioff we got a small taste of it when the company reported its earnings last week announcing revenues of $6.34 billion for the quarter.

The bombastic chief executive was dialing in from Geneva Switzerland where he was attending World Economic Forum meetings. When Benioff's call dropped halfway through his prepared remarks his top lieutenants swiftly stepped in: chief operating officer Bret Taylor jumped right in where Benioff left off passing it to chief revenue officer Gavin Patterson (who was also in Geneva) and then CFO Amy Weaver for their parts of the presentation.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This small incident highlighted a larger trend: It's increasingly apparent that Benioff has groomed an executive team that doesn't strictly need him around to keep the cloud software giant alive and humming. That's important given recent reports that Benioff has already tapped Taylor as his replacement-to-be ahead of a potential departure.

All of those executives have become more visible to employees too: Taylor Patterson Weaver and Salesforce philanthropy chief Ebony Beckwith have all taken turns leading a weekly all-hands meeting for employees in a rotation that includes Benioff a spokesperson tells Insider.

It's not clear if or when Benioff plans to leave Salesforce — and in fact many inside and outside the company say it's hard to picture the executive ever leaving the $247 billion cloud giant that he founded with Parker Harris in 1999.

""I've never seen someone more driven and more into the weeds of a business for as long as he's been"" a former senior Salesforce executive told Insider expressing doubt that Benioff could ever fully leave the company even if it means exchanging his CEO role for a title like Executive Chairman.

Related stories

""I don't think Marc is going to step away"" Valoir analyst Wettemann agreed. ""I think what we will see is him continue to delegate more leadership which at this point in Salesforce's evolution is what he should be doing.""

The rise of Bret Taylor

Taylor in particular has emerged as Salesforce's most prominent executive outside of Benioff himself. People close to Salesforce say that Taylor's influence and profile at the company has only grown as he takes on more of the day-to-day duties of running the company. Salesforce declined to comment on Taylor's involvement in daily operations.

He first joined Salesforce in 2016 via the acquisition of his startup Quip and quickly rose through the ranks to become chief operating officer in late 2019. In a somewhat unusual arrangement for a COO a number of other C-suite executives report directly to Taylor including the CEOs of Salesforce's three biggest acquisitions to date: MuleSoft Tableau and Slack.

In fact Taylor himself was instrumental in orchestrating Salesforce's $27.7 Slack acquisition with Benioff crediting him as the visionary behind the company's ambitions to conquer the new world of remote work and take on chief rival Microsoft. The challenge experts say will be uniting all of Salesforce's big-money acquisitions into a coherent offering for customers.

""Bret Taylor has the right skill set for that because he is an engineer and a product visionary"" JMP Securities analyst Pat Walravens said citing the company's growing success in selling multiple of its products to the same customers as a strong positive signal.

The Salesforce bench is stronger than ever

Whether or not Taylor ends up leading the company he's backed up nonetheless by a team of key executives that experts say is only getting stronger.

In a recent note to clients Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin calls out Patterson the revenue chief who was promoted to the role last August. Patterson is hitting his stride Zukin wrote and is ""highly effective in strategic deal making."" Zukin also shouted out new chief product officer David Schmaier who he says has the right background to help Salesforce help its own customers get more from the software.

The trio of Taylor Patterson and Schmaier are exactly what Salesforce needs to step up its growth Zukin said.

""Those are the three key figures there that I do think collectively have very different experiences that are synergistic"" Zukin told Insider.

Walravens and Wettemann would add two more names to the list of key leaders at Salesforce to watch: CFO Amy Weaver who recently took over the role after her predecessor Mark Hawkins retired and Sarah Franklin its chief marketing officer who founded the very successful Trailhead customer education platform.

Whether or not Benioff actually goes anywhere however having that deep leadership bench will pay dividends for Salesforce with the exec seen as focusing more of his energy outside the company.

""I think definitely there are some strong candidates and I think what we've seen as Marc has expanded his role beyond really Salesforce CEO to thinking about public policy and thinking about philanthropy beyond the company is that he's groomed a number of folks in key leadership areas"" Valoir's Wettemann said.

Activist Commentary: ValueAct has been a premiere governance-oriented investor for 20 years and since 2017 has been helmed by Mason Morfit as chief investment officer. ValueAct has broadened the activist playbook a little under Morfit but it continues to be a premier governance-oriented investor with its partners on the boards of approximately half of the firm's core portfolio positions.

This investment in Fiserv is right in ValueAct's sweet spot – a technology company with good management products and relationships that are somewhat misunderstood by the market. Some of ValueAct's most profitable investments were in other misunderstood technology businesses like Microsoft Seagate and Adobe. For example both Microsoft and Seagate were viewed as PC companies when they were really Cloud companies. The market now views Fiserv as an old legacy technology company when it is really a new world company.

Even as a legacy technology business Fiserv is a good company growing at approximately 8% per year. But Fiserv is transforming itself well before being disrupted by smaller competitors and it has the relationships to scale their technology with their deeply integrated clients. A perfect example of this is Clover the company's smart POS terminal. Clover came out a few years after Square but Clover's business is already bigger with the amount of payments it is processing and growing faster than Square. Clover could be valued today at $30 billion to $45 billion including debt on a standalone basis and could be worth $185 billion by 2024.

But Clover is just one opportunity to transform. The key here is that management is embracing this transformation strategy and could find other organic and strategic opportunities to further it. If the company fully embraces its evolution it should be able to achieve an annual growth rate of at least 15%. This transformation can increase the company's lifetime value of its products by 60%.

In order to get there there are three main areas for the company to focus on. First investing to drive this growth rate up. Second growing through acquiring and integrating a few other businesses that are like Clover. And third simplifying its strategy and how it communicates with the market. The market needs to better understand the company and its opportunities.

Right now FISV trades at a discount to the average S&P 500 company even though its growth rate is higher than the average S&P 500 company without giving credit for additional growth from Clover. ValueAct can be very helpful in assisting management in achieving this transformation just like they did at Microsoft Adobe and Seagate. As history has shown they will be at least an engaged and supportive shareholder and if need be will provide value as a director to create value for shareholders. They will certainly continue to engage with the company on a supportive basis as they get to know each other better and if they do end up taking a board seat it will likely be on an amicable basis to support management.

More than 90% of Gulf crude and 85% of natural gas production rapidly came offline as of Aug. 28 ahead of Ida's anticipated Louisiana landfall as a major Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds in excess of 130 mph according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the National Hurricane Center.

As of Aug. 28 afternoon more than 1.65 million b/d of crude volumes were shut in or 90.84% of total production as well as 1.89 Bcf/d of natural gas production or 84.87% according to BSEE. An estimated 279 offshore platforms were evacuated -- 50% of the US Gulf's total platforms.

Historically offshore production has returned to pre-storm levels 10-14 days after initial declines placing the week of Sept. 6 as a likely time for production to fully rebound according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. The reduced supply levels helped trigger spikes in crude oil natural gas and refined products prices on Aug. 27 at the end of weekly trading including gasoline and jet fuel prices.

US Gulf Coast refined product prices ahead of Hurricane Ida

Shell which has shut in production and evacuated all crews from most of its eight US Gulf platforms said Aug. 28 it would resume partial production at its Stones field which is just west of Ida's projected path. Shell had earlier shut in production from Stones when Ida was expected to travel more westward.

Otherwise production remains shut in at Shell's Ursa Mars Olympus and Appomattox platforms. At the Auger and Enchilada/Salsa platforms production has also been shut in while crews will be evacuated from them the Shell said.

Likewise Equinor said Aug. 28 it had shut down its Titan platform. ""All staff are safely evacuated"" company spokesperson Ola Morten Aanestad said.

BP confirmed it had evacuated and shut-in its four deepwater Gulf platforms and Murphy Oil said Aug. 28 it had finished shutting in its volumes. Other Gulf producers including Chevron and BHP said they were evacuating personnel and shutting in much of the offshore production.

Ida is expected to ""rapidly intensify as it moves over the Southeastern and Central Gulf of Mexico tonight"" on Aug. 28 the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was traveling at 16 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph as a Category 2 hurricane early on the afternoon of Aug. 28 according to the NHC.

The Sabine Pilots which serve the channel that feeds the biggest US LNG export terminal operated by Cheniere Energy advised late Aug. 27 that any facilities in the area that want to empty their berths should do so sooner rather than later as Ida approaches Louisiana.

Onshore developments

Platts Analytics said roughly 4.4 million b/d of refinery capacity was in the storm's path primarily in Louisiana. These facilities accounted for around 1.4-1.6 million b/d of gasoline output 1.1-1.3 million b/d of distillate production and 300000-400000 b/d of kerojet supply.

""Hurricane Ida is expected to come ashore along the same path as other storms which did extensive damage to USGC refining and petrochemical facilities. Many plants have been hardened against hurricanes but disruptions in operations are still very likely due to flooding power outages and personnel dislocations"" Platts Analytics said.

Thus far Shell said Aug. 28 it was closing its 230600 b/d refinery in Norco Louisiana and Phillips 66 already had shuttered its 255600 b/d Alliance Refinery in Belle Chasse Louisiana.

""Shell has initiated a safe and orderly shutdown of its manufacturing facilities in Geismar and Norco Louisiana in anticipation of Hurricane Ida"" said Shell's statement also citing its Geismar petrochemical plant.

The NHC warned preparations should be ""rushed to completion today"" in Louisiana. Utility crews in the state said they had ramped up their personnel to help deal with anticipated power outages.

From a gasoline supply standpoint inventories in PADD III are adequate now standing at close to 2.5 million barrels higher relative to the five-year average Platts Analytics said. Still if all the facilities in the path are shut gasoline supplies could be rapidly drained by more than 1 million b/d and stocks could draw down to the lowest levels seen since February in just one week.

Offsetting this is the likelihood that Colonial Pipeline also could be shut or curtailed and gasoline exports would be delayed or reduced Platts Analytics said.

Colonial Pipeline said Aug. 28 it has made preparations for the storm and would continue to monitor its developments.

For petrochemical facilities shutdowns are expected for both steam crackers and their downstream units. Potentially impacted facilities include roughly 6.5 million tons/year of ethylene capacity 3.8 million tons of polyethylene and 1.1 million tons of polypropylene according to Platts Analytics. Other facilities include 3.6 million tons of PVC and 300000 tons of MEG. The price implications are of course bullish especially given that the industry has not fully recovered from the February USGC freeze other outages this summer and logistical challenges said Platts Analytics.

Port and LNG movements

Chevron said Aug. 28 it had closed its Fourchon and Empire terminals in Louisiana and all related pipeline systems.

Port closures ahead of the storm will also cut exports of both crude and products from key facilities along the USGC.

The US Coast Guard said the Port of New Orleans is closed to all inbound traffic and may soon restrict all outbound traffic. The New Orleans Bar Pilots began suspending operations ""earlier than anticipated"" according to a notice from the New Orleans Board of Trade on Aug. 27. Three vessels were expected to depart Southwest Pass early Aug. 28 and one inbound vessel was expected.

The Port of Mobile in Alabama which includes Pascagoula Mississippi and services Chevron's 356440 b/d Pascagoula Refinery also is restricting all inbound traffic.

However LNG facilities in southwest Louisiana -- west of Ida's projected path -- said they were increasingly confidant they would not see significant impacts from the storm.

While Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG continued to operate exports could still be restricted until Ida passes if the channels that feed the terminals shut down. Pilots serving both channels were meeting to assess the situation according to notices to shippers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""One year after his passing the memory of @chadwickboseman remains this alive in me"" she added.

In the comments section a number of stars sent their love and support. ""Holding space for your heart today❤️❤️❤️❤️"" wrote Elaine Welteroth as Viola Davis added ""My heart💔💔.""

Josh Gad who starred in 2017's Marshall alongside Boseman also shared his own tribute.

Posting three images Samuel could be seen with friends enjoying a cigar before posing with fellow guests pop star Pixie Lott and Idris Elba's wife Sabrina Dhowre Elba.

Meanwhile Lady Kitty Spencer has been enjoying an extended honeymoon which on Thursday continued with a boat trip with friends off the Amalfi Coast.

Princess Diana's niece and husband Michael once again stayed at the Il San Pietro Hotel in Positano where rooms cost up to £3590-a-night.

The couple first checked-in to the five-star hotel on July 27 three days after their lavish wedding in Rome. It is not known whether the couple have rented out the luxury room for the duration of the summer or if they are enjoying a second stint.

Kitty has been sharing almost daily Instagram updates on her trip.

In one of the most recent snaps the society beauty poses in a beautiful D&G dress in the brand's signature gerbera and daisy print dresses with a pair of purple D&G mules.

Describing the hotel as 'home sweet home' Kitty who was in the UK over the weekend for BFF Jemima Herbert's wedding shared videos of their meals overlooking the azure waters.

The couple also dined out at the Rosselini restaurant in Ravello which boasts one Michelin star.

It comes after the couple were spotted in Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera on Tuesday.

The 30-year-old newlywed captured her dream-holiday starting with a few snaps of the Palazzo Avino.

The pink hotel is located high up in the hills of Ravello and offers incomparable views of the bay.

Lady Kitty shared beautiful pictures of the hotel's pink walls and stairs which culminated in breath-taking views of the glittering water.

Dressed in an orange form-fitting cocktail dress by Dolce & Gabbana Lady Kitty looked in her element as she took in the view from the hotel's terrace before sitting down for dinner at Rosselini's.

On Tuesday the heiress and model was spotted in Beaulieu-Sur-Mer on the French Riviera enjoying dinner with her husband.

The outing came just days after Lady Kitty attended the lavish wedding of Lady Jemima Herbert to her insurance broker beau Hugo Davies at Wilton House Wiltshire over the weekend.

The 30-year-old model wore a recycled £1650 carretto print silk chiffon D&G sundress teamed with a pair of oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses paired with a red leather clutch bag draped over her shoulder.

The socialite wore her blonde tresses back in a sleek low ponytail and accessorised her look with dainty gold earrings and a matching bracelet.

Kitty was among guests including Belvoir Castle's Lady Violet Manners as she attended Lady Herbert's wedding to Davies earlier this week.

The couple who were 'old friends' before becoming romantically involved announced their engagement in January last year but had to rearrange their nuptials twice due to the pandemic.

Both Kitty and the bride donned two outfits to the wedding swapping elegant day outfits for more comfy party ensembles later in the night.

The company was born of the inventiveness of seven employee-owners five of whom lost their factory jobs in 2000 to an industry consolidator.

Today those employee-founders still pay themselves modest $75000 salaries; their last raise was in 2009. They and their workers have built a company valued at up to $30 million.

Aggressive has grown from $5 million in revenue a decade ago to $25 million. In 2013 it vacated two antiquated leased buildings and opened a $5 million plant in East Bethel. Employment is up 50% since to 75 people.

Some workers have made up to $100000 a year including overtime. Fifteen boast salaries bigger than the owners.

""This was never about how much money the founders could make"" said founder and CEO Paul Johnson who graduated from nearby St. Francis High School. ""We put in $200000 cash in total and we didn't pay ourselves for two years. And then we paid ourselves $25000 a year until 2009. We have always put the company and employees first.

Aggressive Hydraulics CEO Paul Johnson left with Roger Hamilton of BankCherokee at Aggressive Hydraulics in East Bethel.

""It was about creating the best products and service and the best place to work. We're just the stewards here.""

Aggressive has broken ground on a 40000-square-foot expansion to the East Bethel plant which has become constrained at its current size of 60000 square feet. The $3 million in expansion financing was arranged by BankCherokee with assistance from the town of East Bethel in the form of a tax-increment loan for site preparation.

Aggressive designs and manufactures hydraulic cylinders for new and used equipment made by manufacturers of trucks for garbage and recycling amusement parks agricultural and forestry and oil-field equipment. Some of its larger U.S. competitors import lower-cost product from Asia and Central America. And it also competes with Chinese-based manufacturers that also price lower.

Aggressive competes on quality and service including rush-order replacement parts that can't be provided overnight from China.

Justin Swarts service and purchasing manager for Con-Tech the southern Minnesota maker of concrete-mixer trucks said he long has purchased from Aggressive. ""Their pricing is fairly competitive and their word is really good"" Swarts said. ""They do what they say they are going to do. Also we like to do business with a small Minnesota-owned manufacturer.""

Despite the success of Aggressive its expansion carries some risk. It has pricing constraints because it makes a lot of different parts and doesn't benefit from mass production.

""This is somewhat of a flywheel"" Johnson said. ""We need to grow to retain our customers. And we must expand our capability with higher volumes. We have to leverage the value of those customers. This also puts us into position to sell those incremental capabilities to other customers. We also want to leverage our ability to buy steel. That all adds up to increasing the value of company and employee retention.""

The expansion has been easier to finance than the company's last one in 2012 and 2013.

At that time real estate prices were still depressed following the Great Recession. BankCherokee couldn't get the valuation it needed to fully fund the loan. It took more equity from the employee-owners a TIF loan from the city as well as credit from the Metropolitan Consortium of Community Developers which typically makes small inner-city loans to complete the package. Everybody is getting paid back on time.

""Aggressive started with a lot of industry experience"" said Roger Hamilton of BankCherokee. ""They came with a niche and a plan and an experienced leadership team. And Paul and his team are long-term thinkers. We've been talking to them about expansion for five years. They are conservative.""

Johnson said Aggressive's managers wanted to be sure the expansion-related debt service could be covered by today's revenue.

""We wanted to know that we could cash flow the expansion"" Johnson said. ""We didn't want to be under the gun.""

Johnson in a hearing last week at East Bethel City Hall noted that Aggressive Hydraulics pays almost $5.6 million annually in wages health insurance premiums and retirement contributions in addition to a lot of taxes. The company supports a dozen or more local charitable organizations.

Johnson 59 has worked in manufacturing since graduating college. He has passed on opportunities to sell the company to private-equity firms and larger operators. He aspires to generate enough work to grow profitably and employ 100 within five years.

""If we take care of the company and the employees it will take care of us"" he said. ""We grew up here and built this business over 19 years. It is our legacy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2xlZXMtZGlzY291bnQtbGlxdW9yLWZvdW5kZXItaGFlLXVuLWxlZS1kaWVzLWF0LTc5LTI0MjkwNzIv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbGVlcy1kaXNjb3VudC1saXF1b3ItZm91bmRlci1oYWUtdW4tbGVlLWRpZXMtYXQtNzktMjQyOTA3Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lee’s Discount Liquor founder Hae Un Lee dies at 79,"His son Kenny Lee confirmed his death on Saturday.

Hae Un Lee the founder of Lee’s Discount Liquor and a longtime philanthropist in Southern Nevada has died at age 79.

His son Kenny Lee confirmed his death to the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Saturday.

Stephanie Siverston the company’s chief financial officer said Lee died Friday of pancreatic cancer. He was diagnosed with the disease in October.

“I can’t say enough great things about him” Siverston said. “He’s like a father figure to so many people.”

Lee immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea and opened his first liquor store Plaza Liquor in 1981 on Spring Mountain Road. The company which has 22 stores is the largest liquor chain in Las Vegas Siverston said with other locations in Mesquite Reno and West Wendover.

A statement from the company Saturday afternoon called Lee a prominent member of the community whose nonprofit gave millions of dollars to organizations in Southern Nevada.

On Aug. 13 the company celebrated the 40th anniversary of the opening of that first liquor store. The city of Las Vegas and Clark County also named Aug. 13 “Hae Un Lee Day” to celebrate the business owner Siverston said.

Siverston said Lee’s family is devastated by his death adding that the 79-year-old “put out a good fight” after he was diagnosed with cancer.

“I think we all know that he’s at peace but we all thought he would beat it” she said.

‘Tremendous loss’

Lee’s longtime friend Larry Ruvo said they met when Lee was just starting his business in Southern Nevada. Their friendship dated to when Lee opened his store on Spring Mountain.

“He actually slept at his first store he would stay on the property” Ruvo said. “He really believed he would have success in Las Vegas. He was so tenacious about growing his business looking all over the valley for ways to expand. He was passionate about giving back to the community. He couldn’t be stopped. He was a classic immigrant success story.”

Lee donated generously over the years to the Keep Memory Alive organization the philanthropic arm of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.

“He was a consistent friend and a loyal friend for decades” Ruvo said. “He was a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights later on. We went to games together. This is a big loss for our city.”

Lee donated to several charitable causes and created the nonprofit Lee’s Helping Hand Foundation in the early 2000s to support organizations such as Opportunity Village New Vista Ranch and Spread the Word Nevada according to a recent Facebook post from the company.

“Mr. Lee’s greatest inspiration is knowing that he can contribute a helping hand to the people in need in his local community” the post read.

After Lee’s Discount Liquor cashier Matthew Christensen 24 was gunned down in an armed robbery attempt in 2016 the company started a GoFundMe that raised nearly $50000 for the man’s family thanks partly to a $10000 donation from the Lee family.

Gov. Steve Sisolak also expressed his condolences for Lee and his family on Saturday writing on Twitter that was was “a great friend.”

“This is a tremendous loss for our community — but Mr. Lee’s legacy will live on” he said. “We will keep his family close in our hearts.”

Pat Hickey a former Nevada assemblyman posted on Twitter that Lee “epitomized the American Dream and was a generous benefactor to many great Nevada causes.”

Small beginnings

Lee was a former bureaucrat in South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Social Affairs but he wanted a new life for his family in the U.S. But when he first arrived no one would hire him because of the language barrier the Review-Journal reported in 2016.

After a brief attempt at opening a dry cleaning business in New York Lee decided selling liquor would be easier for someone learning English.

“He would go there just grab a bottle put it down and they’d tell him the total and he’d give them the money” Kenny Lee told the Review-Journal in 2016. “As he was walking out the store he said ‘You know what this is the perfect business because I don’t actually have to talk to customers.’”

Lee’s first store was first renamed A Plaza Liquor so that it would be the first result in a phone book. He then changed the name to “A Plaza Liquor Barn” until a California business with a similar name threatened to sue. Instead Lee came up with the signature Lee’s Discount Liquor name.

“Here in the United States people like discounts Discount Tires etc.” Lee said in 2016.

Lee started working seven days a week for 15 to 18 hours and managed the store mainly by himself. His children Annie Tina and Kenny handed out flyers.

The chain has expanded across the valley with billboards and commercials displaying the company’s signature joking advertisements. Even the company’s Facebook page has a joke with a picture at the top reading “I’m on a liquor diet. I’ve lost 3 days already.”

Lee is featured in many of the advertisements smiling or pulling a silly face with his son who became the company’s president in 1993.

Throughout the years Lee said he wasn’t ready to retire. When his business celebrated its 30th anniversary and he was 69 Lee laughed at the idea.

“My feeling is ‘only 30 years?’ I pretty much still enjoy work” he told the Review-Journal in 2011. “I love work. I’m still strong.”

Lee is survived by his wife Sun Lee his three children and eight grandchildren.

The company which is known for its southern-fried chicken and biscuits said employees had been putting in a lot of overtime and could use the closures on August 30 and September 13 to ""rest and recharge.""

AP asked Bojangles spokesperson Stacey McCray to clarify whether staffers would be paid during the closures. McCray responded that they would not.

Bojangles would offer employees opportunities to work additional hours if they chose she added.

Insider has attempted to reach out to Bojangles for comment.

Bojangles told AP that the closures were ""in response to industry-wide labor shortages and other stresses put on its employees who've worked hard through the pandemic.""

Like many areas of the US North Carolina appears to be acutely affected by the labor shortage. As Insider's Grace Dean reported on Thursday a McDonald's branch in the state shut its dining room because it couldn't find enough staff.

According to The News & Observer newspaper the labor shortage's impact is being felt among some of North Carolina's distribution centers factories and construction sites.

One reason for this is because staffing firms that supplement and hire temps or contracters are struggling to fill positions in the area the newspaper reported.

Bojangles has been operating since 1977 and has become a cult favorite over the years. It operates in 768 locations across 452 cities according to data on its website.

Although most locations are in the Southern US it began an aggressive expansion push in 2018 Insider previously reported. Around that time the company's stock plummeted before rallying to its highest price that year.

The chain has sought to reinvent itself with a new fried-chicken sandwich as Insider's Rachel Askinasi recently reported. Earlier this month a Bojangles food truck situated in New York gave more people a chance to try out the snack.

After landing the airport celebrated the airline's addition by shooting red- blue- and yellow-dyed water over the airplane with firetrucks as the plane rolled to the gate.

Passengers included a few returning University of Oregon students and others who were excited to use the outbound flight to connect to larger cities for work.

Kelly Owens an Albany resident was at the airport to fly to Chicago for a job interview with a layover in Las Vegas. He said he looks forward to using the new direct flights to visit family members in Las Vegas.

Eugene Airport welcomes new airline Avelo with nonstop service to Hollywood Burbank Airport

""Being able to come to Eugene to fly out rather than drive to Portland is a much quicker drive with less traffic so I like that a lot"" said Owens 54.

Cathryn Stephens the airport's acting director said she appreciates having Southwest added to Eugene and potentially expand its offerings in the future. She added she looks forward to the ""Southwest Effect"" phenomenon in which markets that Southwest enters experience a decrease in average airfares and an increase in passengers.

A few passengers such as Raegan Chase a 17-year-old first-year University of Oregon Orange County California said she appreciated the flight attendants who made the trip enjoyable by rhyming the speech about seatbelt requirements.

The airline's addition also meant new jobs for roughly 25 people hired as ramp agents who offload bags and service the airplanes when they come in. It's their first job in aviation and includes a mix of part- and full-time positions station manager George Ohanian said Sunday.

Under construction on a 9.5-acre site at 9850 Carroll Canyon Road The Hub at Scripps Ranch will have 260 apartments and 10700 square feet of retail and restaurant space much of which has already been leased according to Marco Sessa principal and senior vice president of Sudberry Properties.

“The goal was to bring in a little residential. They didn’t have a ton of it right around there” Sessa said.

The project will be have five residential buildings four of which are four stories. The four-story buildings will have elevators.

Two 1960s vintage buildings that were razed to make way for the new development were on once the headquarters of Pacific Southwest Airlines and still had remnants of their former use Sessa said.

At one-time one of the buildings had eight flight simulators for pilot training Sessa said.

More recently the buildings were used for firefighter training.

The Look

Sessa said the design of The Hub is meant to stay in the character of the surrounding community.

“Architecturally the buildings are a nice blend of a little bit of traditional but contemporary” Sessa said. “I wouldn’t call it a higher density product. It was done with a fair amount of back-and-forth with the local community.”

The Hub was designed by MVE + Partners based in Irvine the same firm that designed Sudberry’s Civita project in Mission Valley.

“The buildings are shaped like a U. Inside that U there is a two-unit building a little jewel box building” Sessa said.

There also 10 townhomes in pods of two inside the courtyard of the bigger four-story buildings he said.

The apartments will start leasing in September with some of the apartments ready to occupy in October.

“As the first units are beginning to open the construction will trail for several months into next year” Sessa said. “By next April everything will be done.”

Likely tenants are “young professionals” who work in nearby office parks with a smattering of students from Miramar Community College Sessa said.

“We’re beginning to draft a wait list” Sessa said.

The Market

Demand for apartments in on the rise in an already tight market according to the commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

The countywide apartment vacancy rate at the end of the second quarter of 2021 had dropped to 2.6% down from 4.2% in the Q2 2020 Cushman & Wakefield reported.

The firm predicted that the vacancy rate would stay below 4% for the next five years.

With apartments so scarce Cushman & Wakefield projected that rents would rise by 5.6% for the full year of 2021 and rise 3.8% in 2022 compared to an average annual growth of 4.3% from 2016 to 2020.

The HUB will have a mix of one-bedroom two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments that will range from 614 square feet to 1391 square feet with nine-foot ceilings hardwood-style flooring in main area carpeting in bedrooms stainless steel appliances quartz countertops and full-size washers and dryers.

Some of the two-bedroom apartments have dual master bedrooms so they can be shared with roommates Sessa said.

The apartments will be designated smoke-free.

Shared amenities will include an outdoor pool spa and lounge a 2053 square-foot fitness center an indoor lounge with a demonstration kitchen a game room and a media screening room.

Monthly apartment rents have yet to be set but Sessa said they’d likely be in the low 2000s for the one-bedroom apartments in the higher 2000s for the two-bedroom apartments and a little more than $3000 for the three-bedroom apartments.

Among the commercial tenants that have already leased space Starbucks has leased 2061 square feet and is scheduled to open in September.

Pacific Dental Services has leased 3266 square feet and is expected to open in the first quarter of 2022.

Big Cheech’s Chicken ‘N Waffles and Sliders has leased 2063 square feet is projected to open in spring 2022.

Matt Moser of Retail Insite is handling leasing.

Challenging

“We have a pretty challenging site from a civil engineering standpoint. We have a pretty elaborate storm water system” Sessa said. “Water leaving the site will be nonexistent or cleaner than the rain that fell on it.”

The storm water system included drilling four wells that allow water to percolate 120 feet into the ground Sessa said. “That has all kinds of water quality benefits.”

Additionally Sessa said 70% to 80% of the material from demolishing the two buildings that were on the site was recycled.

Construction of The Hub started in 2019 just as the COVID-19 pandemic hit primarily in getting materials.

“That has created some its share of interesting dynamics from price and availability and supply chain” Sessa said.

For example Sessa said all the lumber used in the project was ordered and delivered early on as a hedge against lumber prices that skyrocketed.

“We had a fair amount of challenge on just where to put things. You run out of room really quickly” Sessa said. “It will be nice when this thing finally opens.”

Screenshot by ZDNet

Data analysis is the joy of our time.

Well our working time.

It seems that businesses are spending as much money on bulking up their data capabilities as they are on well anything else.

I worry that this constant number-munching turns us all into permanently neurotic beings. Still sometimes the numbers seem to help senior executives make decisions that they know won't be universally popular.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has often been regarded as the quintessential data-driven human. So when he announced that his airline's employees would all have to be vaccinated by Oct. 25 -- or they'd be fired -- it was instructive how he presented his case.

Speaking to MSNBC he began: "" We knew there'd be some negative reaction and there has been. But my email inbox particularly from employees has been running about 10 to 1 of people just thanking us for doing it.""

There's that instant quantification. Ninety% seem to be in favor. He'd only just got started.

""I didn't appreciate how many people there are in our workforce -- and in the country -- who really know... they're looking at the data"" he said. ""They see all the same facts that all of us see. They know it's the right thing to do.""

Only then did he suggest that the airline ""would have done it anyway.""

Yet he leaned on the data first in order to make his case before adding: ""For us it's a safety issue.""

Baited into declaring whether his decision was a way to increase passenger numbers Kirby again went back to data: ""Over 99% of the people who are in hospital or that are dying from COVID-19 are unvaccinated.""

This helped him extrapolate to the idea that ""[you're] about 300 times as likely to die of COVID-19 if you're unvaccinated. Once you have that statistic in your mind at least to me it's impossible not to require vaccinations.""

Then you might think that all other airlines would look at that data and reach the same conclusion. Yet American Airlines Southwest and Delta didn't.

The innately cynical might drift to wondering whether the fact that two of these airlines are based in Texas and the other in Georgia may have had something to do with that.

Then again Delta did reach for a perhaps even more controversial measure with respect to COVID-19 -- and again leaned on data.

Last week the airline announced that it'll increase the health insurance premiums for their unvaccinated employees by $200 a month.

CNBC reported the words of Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a memo sent to employees. Instead of declaring this measure as the right thing to do from a home humanistic moral standpoint Bastian offered cold data: ""The average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost Delta $50 000 per person.""

He followed with: ""This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision not to vaccinate is creating for our company. In recent weeks since the rise of the B.1.617.2 variant all Delta employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated.""

Some may wonder whether these CEOs merely searched for the appropriate data to serve their already-made decisions. One can imagine recalcitrants snorting that it's their body their choice and tangentially their expression of not caring what may happen to their fellow humans.

In Delta's case there are surely troubling implications. Would the same sorts of penalties ever be levied on those with say a genetic history of cancer or diabetes? What if it could be proved that some ailment resulted from someone's personal choices -- smoking or drinking for example?

Some will see these decisions as purely political. Because in some twisted infernal manner saving lives seems to have become a symbol of which political faction you embrace.

We live in an extraordinary time one where our business life is more and more infused with data. Yet too many will deny the veracity of data in the rest of our lives because it doesn't suit their political worldview.

I'll confess that United's decision encouraged me to prefer United should the occasion arise.

But it's the airline's expression of its attitude rather than its data presentation that persuades me."

Reuters



Some Starbucks employees report their mall stores are closing.

Last year Starbucks said it was updating its strategy to focus on drive-thru and pick-up store formats.

Starbucks says it will still have some stores in malls.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The suburbs are making a comeback but malls are getting left behind as Starbucks wants out too.

Three Starbucks employees in three states whose employment was confirmed by Insider shared that their mall-based stores closed in the last month. They all requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

One barista in a Texas mall said he was ""blindsided"" at the news of the closure. All the baristas Insider spoke to were offered transfers to other locations.

Closing mall kiosks is part of Starbucks' strategy of investing more in drive-thru and pickup locations. Last summer Starbucks announced it would close 400 US stores to ""strategically optimize"" its portfolio with the greatest changes in urban markets.

""Starbucks continues to make meaningful progress to reposition our US store portfolio through this trade area transformation which is now nearly 80% complete. In the past 12 months we have opened 554 new stores combined with in-store seating and drive-thru service repositioning our store portfolio to create a blend of traditional Starbucks stores with convenience-led formats"" a Starbucks spokesperson told Insider.

Fast food and fast-casual brands across the country have optimized drive-thrus over the last year as they became crucial in the age of COVID-19. Drive-thru orders have grown across the fast-food industry since the pandemic closed many dining rooms. On-the-go orders meaning drive-thru and pickup orders made up 80% of Starbucks orders prior to the pandemic Starbucks told Insider and increased more than 10% over pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2021.

Starbucks has invested in new technology and formats as drive-thrus become even more critical to the brand. The coffee chain has started adding double drive-thru lanes along with implementing video ordering capabilities and handheld tablets for baristas to take orders. These developments can all decrease wait times and make drive-thrus more efficient by reducing bottlenecks Kalinowski Equity Research founder Mark Kalinowski previously told Insider.

The coronavirus pandemic sped up the shift to pick-up and to-go locations Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in an earnings call in 2020.

Despite the shift in strategy Starbucks says ""high-traffic areas like malls airports campuses and our other licensed locations will remain a key pillar of the Starbucks experience."" This reiterates the chain's earlier statement last year saying ""Our vision is that each large city in the US will ultimately have a mix of traditional Starbucks cafés and Starbucks Pickup locations.""

Starbucks decision to focus on drive-thrus and other formats over some malls makes sense. The retail apocalypse has made headlines for years as some malls die a slow death and retail vacancy rates hit new highs. More than 12000 stores closed in 2020 many of them crucial anchor stores that once kept malls afloat. The list of 2021 closures is still growing.

For PSL lovers who can have dairy this came as exciting news. However an Eat This Not That! nutrition analysis has highlighted a significant issue with some pumpkin-flavored drinks for consumers with one particular dietary restriction. Here's what nutrition experts suggest you may want to know.

After Starbucks dropped their fall menu on Wednesday we heard from one reader who was seeking recommendations for dairy-free pumpkin drinks after they'd visited one of the major chains. (In this case it wasn't Starbucks.) ""[I] couldn't wait to have a PSL"" she said. ""I drank half then googled it. The pumpkin spice flavoring is made with condensed milk.""

It's true. Lots of consumers don't realize that many of the major coffee chains including Starbucks include some form of milk as an ingredient in their pumpkin syrup. For consumers like the one in this instance—a nursing mom with an infant who has an extreme dairy sensitivity—this can be confusing. ""I thought getting oat milk and no whipped cream would be enough"" she told us. Unfortunately some fall drink lovers are learning the hard way. For nursing mothers in particular this may be especially concerning because recently it was reported that dairy is now the biggest food allergy threat to children.

Says Katie Bressack a board-certified holistic nutritionist in Los Angeles (and a mom of twin infants herself): ""I personally would not have thought that there was dairy in [a coffee drink made with plant milk]."" Adding: ""It's a good reminder that you have to triple-check everything just like you would read labels in the grocery store.""

To help you navigate pumpkin spice season here's a quick list of options to consider if you cannot or do not drink dairy.

Seek out plant-based pumpkin spice products at the supermarket.

The grocery store's refrigerated section may offer a range of dairy-free pumpkin spice sips. Purchasing at the grocery store allows you time to review the label and educate yourself.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

One plant-based fall treat we're enjoying this season is the Pumpkin Spice Latte Cold Brew with almond milk from Califia Farms.

""It's surprising how many people don't know the Nutrition Facts are published online for chain restaurants and eateries"" Wesdock tells Eat This Not That! ""I use a nutrition facts brochure I picked up from a Starbucks as an education tool with my patients as well. It's always an eye opener!""

Most chains do publish their nutrition information online—however that's not always the case with limited time offerings and seasonal drinks. In that case keep reading for another suggestion…

Ask the barista.

If you're unsure of what's in an order and can't find the information online ask the barista. If they haven't been trained to know the answer offhand they should be able to check the ingredients' containers for you.

They Exist But You Won’t Find Them at Starbucks,"A new campaign draws attention to the fact that Starbucks cups are not truly recyclable due to a coating of polyethylene plastic on the inside of the cup.

Starbucks has made several pledges to produce recyclable cups dating back to 2008 — but its cups are still unable to be recycled economically.

Solutions already exist for fully recyclable cups including a coating for paperboard barrier packaging that uses 40-51% less plastic.

When you order your Venti-sized espresso macchiato at Starbucks it will arrive in what looks and feels like a cardboard cup topped with a plastic lid. After you finish your drink you might think about dumping your cup into a paper recycling bin. But you shouldn’t. Starbucks cups are actually lined with polyethylene plastic coating that makes it nearly impossible to recycle experts say.

“Paper recycling is designed for recycling paper — not plastic” Will Lorenzi president of packaging engineering company Smart Planet Technologies told Mongabay in an interview. “There’s a whole variety of products that have plastic coatings on it … and when those products hit the pulper [in a recycling plant] they block it up. It’s almost like a storm drain. If there’s a few leaves a branch maybe the storm drain is going to be fine. But if you get too many leaves and too many branches all of a sudden the whole drain clogs up.”

It’s estimated that 1.6 million trees are logged each year to produce Starbucks cups and that 4 million of these cups end up in landfills according to Stand.Earth a group that started

in 2016. Starbucks itself actually pledged to create a fully recyclable paper cup back in 2008 but nothing resulted from this commitment.

“So many people have confessed to us that they feel at least a little bit guilty about ordering a single-use coffee in a paper cup that came from critical forests” Jim Ace a senior campaigner and actions manager at Stand.Earth told Mongabay in an email. “Many feel even worse when they learn it’s lined with polyethylene plastic whether they are concerned for their own health or the health of the planet. Most consumers don’t realize Starbucks cups have been uneconomical to recycle in part because they are lined with plastic so they’ve ended up in landfills.”

According to a recent survey conducted in the U.S. by the SEAL Awards which recognizes companies for their sustainability and environmental leadership 83% of Starbucks customers actually believe that Starbucks cups can be recycled.

“At heart the cup problem is a moral and leadership issue” Matt Harney founder of SEAL said in a statement. “Like the 83% of consumers we surveyed I recently thought that paper cups were in fact recyclable.”

Stand.Earth ended its campaign in 2019 when Starbucks partnered with other industry giants to support the NextGen Cup Challenge which called on innovators to create a recyclable and compostable cup. Twelve winners were chosen but two years later the problem has still not been solved.

“Starbucks committed itself to solving its cup problem and have taken steps to develop solutions but the majority of its customers still leave the store with single-use disposable paper cups that are lined with plastic which end up in the landfill” Ace said. “Until that is solved Starbucks still has a responsibility to address the problem.”

A commercially viable solution is already here Lorenzi said. In 2016 his company Smart Planet Technologies developed EarthCoating a film for paperboard barrier packaging that uses 40-51% less plastic than conventional plastic coating barriers.

“We came up with something that would basically be recyclable and at the same time work just as well as the current packaging we have” Lorenzi said. The coating uses a special mix of minerals and resin so that the coating can easily be separated from the cardboard during the recycling process and sink to the bottom of the pulper along with dirt and other residue he added.

Several big companies including United Airlines and Taco Bell in Australia already use recyclable products with EarthCoating Lorenzi said. Yet Starbucks has not adopted this technology despite Smart Planet Technologies reaching out to Starbucks on several occasions.

“They pretend we don’t exist” Lorenzi said. “They pretend it’s not happening. They continue to do their own thing.”

On Starbucks’ website the company pledges to “double the recycled content recyclability and compostability and reusability” of its cups and packaging by 2022.

Yet Lorenzi said he is not convinced this is a definitive goal. “It’s about the fifth date they set” he said. “They started in 2008 — they were going to do it by 2012. And in 2010 they said they’d do it by 2015. In 2015 they said they’d do it by 2020. They’re now with the next one which is 2022.”

Starbucks did not respond to Mongabay’s request for comment.

This month the SEAL Awards Impact Team launched a campaign called #UpTheCup to call on Starbucks to truly adopt a recyclable cup. An accompanying petition has already garnered more than 60000 signatures.

“In reality as a society we entrust leaders to make decisions — like the type of cup used — in a truly responsible way even if that issue has gone undetected by the general public” Harney said. “To quote C.S. Lewis ‘Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching.'”

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

After bringing back the PSL Starbucks has released a new wave of merchandise for its 2021 fall collection which is in stores now.

Eagle-eyed shoppers have found a handful of new tumblers cold cups travel mugs and reusable coffee cups in stock at Target and some regional café locations.

Company materials shared on social media indicate that more Halloween items are coming to stores over the next few weeks including new glow-in-the-dark cups and more themed merchandise.

Starbucks aficionados have a lot to be excited about this week — everyone's favorite coffee chain has brought back its ever-popular pumpkin spice latte and introduced a brand new apple-flavored macchiato that critics are already buzzing about. But diehard merchandise collectors were likely even more jazzed to see an entirely new line of cold cups tumblers and mugs drop into select cafés across the nation. The best part? These new items are all wonderfully themed for the upcoming transition into prime coffee season fall!

Because Starbucks tends to release new seasonal collections in stages some social users were surprised to see many vibrant colors used in the first few pieces released earlier this week. One such standout is a classic Starbucks studded bling cup in a venti-sized (24oz) dome. The cup is neon hot pink and finished with a soft touch to differentiate it from other studded cups the brand has released this year.

There's also a new boxed set of metallic pearl hot cups available in five different finishes likely being sold at retail for $24.95. The hues range from a striking lilac to a rich oxblood and will surely be a fabulous way to enjoy a hot cup of coffee as temperatures begin to drop in September.

But many fans are most excited about the core line of new fall merchandise. According to company materials shared via social media there are more than 25 new items coming to stores through the end of October with a handful of items sold exclusively at Starbucks cafés nestled in local Target superstores. Some of the merchandise may be delayed depending on where you live; Starbucks collectors have been sharing images indicating that production is delayed though the chain has yet to confirm this rumor.

Even though they are not exactly Halloween-themed Starbucks has tapped into a dark color palette for many of its new tumblers and cold cups. One particularly striking venti-sized option is the Baroque-themed cup below (a Target exclusive!) which is double-walled to protect the intricate design. It pairs well with a black stainless steel cold cup that features a leaf motif.

Another favorite is the mottled black tumbler which we've shared below thanks to eagle-eyed shopper Sarah behind @starbucksnsunshine on Instagram. This striking design is also available as a shorter traditional hot coffee mug alongside five other new mugs on shelves this season.

It's unclear how much these cups are retailing for just yet but venti-sized options usually range in price between $18 and $25 depending on the design. Traditional mugs and shorter options like this neon green grande-sized cold cup below can sell for less. Plus if you're able to find a new cup in a corporate retailer you're able to trade in 400 Starbucks stars for a free item of your choice.

Everyone is wondering when exactly Starbucks will drop more merchandise this season particularly the highly anticipated release of its Halloween products. Similar to last year's collection it's rumored that Starbucks will be releasing another glow-in-the-dark cold cup featuring a fantastically spooky spider web motif. We're betting that the new venti-sized cold cup featuring a cartoonish black cat will be among this year's most popular trophies for collectors.

There's a chance that some Starbucks fans will already have access to new Halloween merchandise as soon as this week. Snapshots across platforms suggest that depending on where you're located full collections may be in stores already. We'll update this story with new information and details about Starbucks' full Halloween collection as it becomes available.

If you're on the hunt for one of these new items the best place to start looking would be your local Target cafe — usually these locations receive new merchandise first. And if all else fails turn to Facebook Marketplace or  where a trio of new items is already available for purchase. Happy hunting!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2phcGFudG9kYXkuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L2ZlYXR1cmVzL25ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy9zdGFyYnVja3MlRTIlODAlOTktcHVtcGtpbi1zcGljZS1sYXR0ZS1maW5hbGx5LWFycml2ZXMtaW4tamFwYW4_Y29tbWVudC1vcmRlcj1sYXRlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte finally arrives in Japan,"By Oona McGee SoraNews24

Every time a new season rears its head on the calendar you can bet Starbucks is one step ahead of it with a brand new limited-edition offering on the menu.

Now that autumn is just around the corner customers in Japan will be treated to a special set of drinks and this time it won’t be anything like the Witch and Princess Frappuccinos from 2018 or the Masquerade Party drinks from 2019.

Because this year Japan will finally be able to enjoy the one drink that’s been eluding them for 15 years. The drink that screams “Autumn!” or rather “Fall!” for Starbucks customers overseas. And that drink is the Pumpkin Spice Latte.

This is big news for customers in Japan who only got a fleeting taste of the famous Starbucks latte for a short time in 2006. As U.S. customers will know seeing as they’ve been enjoying the drink since 2003 the Pumpkin Spice Latte is “a harmony of pumpkin puree with pumpkin spice flavor"" containing ingredients like cinnamon ginger nutmeg and cloves to help conjure up the taste of a freshly baked pumpkin pie.

Both the hot and cold versions contain espresso and milk with a sprinkling of nutmeg and a whipped cream topping for rich and creamy flavor.

Over at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo there’ll be another surprise on the menu for customers as they’ll be offering a new Autumn Spice Oat Latte inspired by the Pumpkin Spice Latte.

This special beverage combines cinnamon and allspice the key flavors of the Pumpkin Spice Latte with Starbucks Reserve Coffee espresso a unique high-quality blend roasted onsite at the Tokyo Roastery. Oat milk and a touch of pumpkin puree is added along with a topping of green pumpkin seed pieces to create a warming beverage with a gentle aroma and spicy sweetness that’s perfect for autumn.

Both new drinks will go on sale from Sept 1 with the Pumpkin Spice Latte on the menu until Oct 31 or until stocks last in short through to Venti sizes ranging in price from 462-579 yen for takeout and 470-590 yen for dine-in customers.

The Autumn Spice Oat Latte will only be sold at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo until Nov 11 or until stocks last with both hot and cold versions available in one size only priced at 972 yen for takeout and 990 yen for dine-in customers.

The four-story 112-year-old structure owned since August 2020 by the Aniston Group was sold recently to an entity called 1213 State St. LLC for $415000.

The owner of the limited liability corporation whose name is listed on the mortgage recorded in the Erie County Courthouse is Roman Stefanelli 47.

Stefanelli works as a chocolate maker at Romolo Chocolates which is owned by his family.

He is also the owner of Roman Stefanelli Properties at 1400 S. Hill Road.

Stefanelli also is the owner of a building at 1325 State. The building was home to Pepperoni Paulie’s an Italian restaurant that opened in 2017 and closed a year later.

More recently the building has been home to ABC 24-hour Childcare.

He declined to be interviewed but said in a text that he didn't have any plans for the building. He also stressed that he had purchased the building not the Bourbon Barrel which closed its doors in 2020.

John Buchna executive director of the Erie Downtown Partnership said last week that he wasn't free to discuss the details but was aware that two partners had plans for a business that would fall in the broad category of bar restaurant or nightclub.

He described them as a couple of local business owners with experience in the restaurant industry.

Past owners have had some success in running bars and nightclubs in that same spot.

The Bourbon Barrel a nightclub bar and restaurant that featured a mechanical bull and dozens of kinds of bourbon had a five-year run on State Street.

Before that the Cell Block a nightclub that was launched in Williamsport opened its Erie location in 2005 and remained open until 2014.

Buchna said he doesn't know the timeline for the future development of the property but said he feels good about the future of the State Street property.

""It's a good investment"" Buchna said. ""It's a local owner. They are established business owners joining forces to get this new project started.""

Despite the eventual failure of the Bourbon Barrel Buchna said he's encouraged by widespread efforts being made throughout the city.

""That area is getting more investment"" he said. ""It's been vacant for a little more than a year and we are glad they are trying to do something.""

Instead New Albany got the 2-1 win only to lose 4-1 to St. Ignatius in the championship.

How might that match have gone had the Bombers advanced?

Well if Sunday's Jesuit Cup final at St. Xavier was any indicator perhaps not well. St. Ignatius won comfortably 6-1. On a muggy afternoon both coaches cleared their benches when the game was all but decided in the waning moments

Tanner Creech's penalty kick with 3:17 remaining was the lone Bomber goal.

""This weekend is always a big barometer early on to give us an idea where we stand against some of the best teams in the state"" St. Ignatius coach Mike McLaughlin said. ""St. X is such a big rivalry game.""

The Bombers kept St. Ignatius scoreless for nearly 20 minutes until junior midfielder Nolan Spicer scored. Ten minutes later senior mid Will Armsworthy scored then Spicer added another for the 3-0 halftime advantage.

Junior forward Zsombor Onodi tallied twice in the second half with a successful boot by senior mid Luciano Pechota sandwiched between Onodi celebrations.

""We're having fun"" McLaughlin said after hoisting the traveling trophy. ""There's lots of smiles on their faces. If you can take the pressure and turn it into fun with a group of talent like this good things happen.""

Junior keeper Patrick McLaughlin warded off a header by St. Xavier junior Reece Heisel in the first half. In the second he deflected a would-be goal from Pat Ahrens off a corner by deflecting it over the bar. Beyond that Creech's free shot was the highlight spoiling the shutout.

""It presents an opportunity to learn"" St. Xavier coach Brian Schaeper said. ""It's an opportunity early in the season to challenge yourself against the best. For us it's a chance to grow. It's humility which is a good thing to learn at this point in the season. There is a bar which is much higher than where we were today.""

To be fair not many Ohio schools have fared well against the Wildcats. Coach Mike McLaughlin is approaching 450 career wins. His team has not only been back-to-back state champions but they've also been named national champions in consecutive years according to Top Drawer Soccer.

The dynasty includes 10 total state championships and six national honors. After Sunday the Wildcats have won 45 straight games. In last year's 21-0 campaign they were only scored upon 10 times.

This season goalkeeper McLaughlin has been the loneliest lad on the pitch for the most part as the Wildcats defense has seemingly formed a force field around the pipes.

""It's not just our back four it's the idea that the moment we lose the ball no matter where it is on the field everybody becomes a defender and has to win the ball back"" McLaughlin said.

Said St. Xavier's Schaeper ""There are quick moments that they just capitalize on. Their first three goals were all off restarts. If there's a turnover they fly off of it. They really capitalize on those moments of transition and restart and that's how they were able to build up a lead.""

St. Ignatius is now 4-0 now outscoring opponents 21-1. Many of their players have Division I offers and senior Pechota will be heading to Ohio State where St. Xavier's Creech will join him. The two spent time together Saturday night.

St. Xavier last defeated St. Ignatius four years ago 4-2 in this same tournament. That was also the last time they won the Jesuit Cup. Last season was the Bombers' first regional title since 2008. They finished 16-3-2 after the state semifinal loss to New Albany.

St. Xavier's last state title in soccer came in 1983 but the reality is most of the state champions have been to the north since title games began back in 1974. Mason won in 2013. Before that Alter won in 1987 Turpin in 1986 Centerville in 1984 the Bombers in '83 and Finneytown won in 1976 and 1974.

Including St. Xavier's Jesuit Cup opening win over St. John's Jesuit 2-0 the Bombers are now 2-1-1. Their Greater Catholic League-South opener is Thursday at La Salle.

Laughter rippled through the full house in the St. Clair council chambers.

“They’re actually smiling at us” Cedar said. “It’s really nice.”

The mayor and council recognized the accomplishments of the St. Clair Little League girls 10U state championship team. The mayor introduced Matt Karas the president of St. Clair Little League and coach Ron Cook calling them “the bread and butter of St. Clair Little League.”

“The time the hours the energy that these guys put into this — we are very fortunate” said Cedar as heard on the CTV-Channel Six recording of the meeting “We have a tremendous facility out there — St. Clair Little League Field — and a great program.”

Cedar presented Karas and Cook with certificates of appreciation.

“I’m pretty fortunate this year to get the opportunity to coach every one of these girls” said Cook. “They’re pretty special. They’re one of two teams in St. Clair that have won the 10 and under state championship boy or girls. They played absolutely phenomenal. We outscored our opponents through the tournament 113-13. … We allowed nine walks throughout the tournament with three different pitchers Mallory Randall Cameron Kern and Kerry Yeager. All three girls could be Number One pitchers on any team around without a doubt. I was blessed to have them.”

The 14 girls on the team received rings. One player missed the award ceremony after she had been exposed to COVID-19.

Karas presented Cook a plaque from Little League International recognizing his 50 years of service in District 7.

“We’re standing in the room with the best in the state” said Cedar.

A number of St. Clair Little Teams have captured state championships. The Boys 13-U team won the state title in 2015 in District 7’s intermediate division. The boys Junior League team won the title in 2018 — as did the girls team. The girls 10-U squad won the Minor League state championship in 2019.

What’s the secret?

“Everybody asks me how we get our program the way we have it” Cook said. “I just tell everybody ‘It’s St. Clair.’ It starts with class and we go from there. If I’ve got class with my players class with my parents class with the organization class with you guys up here that just means a ton to the program. Having these girls down here to see folks like yourselves giving time back after little league — I know you played I know you played I know you played you played” — Cook pointed to four of the seven council members — “it’s pretty special. It starts here and continues on. … Giving these girls the opportunity to come up here and get a ring and stuff from little league that’s huge.”

Cyndi Stevenson and Paul Renner and Sen. Travis Hutson.

Patty said the county's growth has led to more cases and combined with COVID-19 delays caused a backlog in the legal process.

T-Mobile is “humbled” it said announcing new partnerships with security heavyweights on Friday.

On Thursday a 21-year-old US citizen claiming to be the attacker who stole data on more than 50 million T-Mobile customers called the telecom’s security “awful.”

On Friday a “humbled” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert wiped the egg from his face and apologized for the debacle the repercussions of which have affected a total of more than 50 million customers at this point. As of Aug. 18 T-Mobile had estimated the total number of ripped-off records to be ~40 million: a number that rose to ~50 million on Aug. 20 and could double if the purported thief is true to his word.

When the breach was widely reported 11 days ago the purported thief was offering to sell 30 million records for ~1 penny each on an underground forum: what he claimed was a subset of 100 million customer records. He alleged that he was going to sell the other 50 million privately. As of Thursday he hadn’t acknowledged having sold any of the records.

The Wall Street Journal has been chatting with the purported attacker via Telegram for a while. The news outlet has confirmed that his name is John Binns: a 21-year-old US citizen of Turkish descent who moved to Turkey a few years ago. Binns reportedly discussed details about the breach before they were widely known.

The WSJ noted that T-Mobile was initially notified of the breach by a cybersecurity company called Unit221B LLC which said that the telecom’s customer data was being peddled on the dark web.

Who is John Binns?

Binns told the WSJ that he conducted the attack from his home in Izmir Turkey where he lives with his mother. His father who died when he was two was American while his mother is Turkish. They moved back to Turkey when Binns was 18.

If the name rings a bell it’s because the seller told Alon Gal CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock that this sucker-punch to US infrastructure was done in retaliation against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Binns at the hands of CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019 as Gal tweeted at the time (from an account that has since been suspended).

This breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019. We did it to harm US infrastructure. —Attacker’s alleged statement to Gal

It’s not clear who “we” refers to but Binns said he needed help. In his conversation with the WSJ Binns described the attack as a “collaborative effort to find the login credentials needed to crack T-Mobile’s internal databases” and that another online actor offered in online forums to sell some of the stolen T-Mobile data.

Binns sued the FBI CIA and Department of Justice in 2020 alleging that he was tortured and harassed by the US and Turkish governments and is seeking to compel the US to release documents regarding these activities under the Freedom of Information Act. He told the WSJ that the kidnapping story is legitimate – why would he lie?:

I have no reason to make up a fake kidnapping story and I’m hoping that someone within the FBI leaks information about that. —John Binns as quoted by the WSJ

Binns reportedly uses the online handles IRDev and v0rtex among others. He’s apparently got a track record that includes “peripheral involvement” in the creation of a massive botnet of compromised devices that was used for online attacks four years ago having been in cahoots with the gamers who infected devices around the world.

These botnets are often used by gamers to knock people and websites offline in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The pandemic caused a surge in such attacks: As of September 2020 more people were online during lockdowns and work-from-home shifts making for lucrative pickings for DDoS-ers.

T-Mobile’s ‘Awful’ Security

Binns told the WSJ that he penetrated T-Mobile’s defenses in July after scanning the company’s known internet addresses looking for weak spots and using what the publication called “a simple tool available to the public.” (That tool well might have been Shodan: a search engine used to uncover servers connected to the internet that’s often used by threat actors and researchers to find vulnerabilities.)

He found an unprotected exposed router last month he told the Journal. From there Binns said he managed to break into T-Mobile’s data center outside East Wenatchee Wash. where he reportedly accessed more than 100 servers that contained the personal data of millions. By Aug. 4 he had stolen millions of files thanks to what he told the Journal was the mobile phone seller’s pathetic security:

I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful. —John Binns as quoted by the WSJ

Cybersecurity experts have been nodding vigorously albeit in more diplomatic terms than “awful.” The Journal spoke with Glenn Gerstell a former general counsel for the National Security Agency who said that the fact that the theft included records stolen from prospective clients or former long-gone customers shows that somebody or somebodies at T-Mobile isn’t practicing good data management hygiene: “That to me does not sound like good data management practices” he was quoted as saying.

Granted that work gets harder all the time. Randy Watkins chief technology officer at cybersecurity consulting and managed detection and response (MDR) services company CRITICALSTART told Threatpost on Friday that the attack shows how difficult it is to secure growing perimeters and how tough it is to monitor attack surfaces.

Watkins warned that alerts set off by an intruder’s activity – including initial compromise subsequent lateral movement and data exfiltration– are dismissed at an organization’s peril: “Even if this generated alerts they would likely be low-priority and something that would be disregarded as a likely false-positive” he said via email. “As attackers take advantage of these less-obvious tactics it is becoming more critical to resolve every alert generated by detection toolsets.”

Something’s Wrong in Magenta Land

By some accounts this is the sixth time that T-Mobile has been attacked in recent years.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said last week that it’s investigating this most recent breach. T-Mobile is also facing at least two class-action lawsuits accusing the company the second-largest US wireless carrier of failing to protect customer data.

T-Mobile was attacked twice last year and in 2018 about 2.5 million customers had their data exposed in a network breach. That attack also became part of a federal class-action lawsuit.

The most recent theft involved the records of more than 13 million current customers more than 40 million prospective customers who had applied for credit with the company and 667000 former customers T-Mobile said last week. An additional 902000 prepaid customers also had some data exposed.

Some records contained Social Security numbers phone numbers names security PINs physical addresses unique IMEI numbers IMSI numbers driver license numbers and dates of birth: in short all the ingredients necessary for identity theft.

A source familiar with the investigation told the WSJ that the Seattle office of the FBI is investigating.

The Latest From T-Mobile

On Friday T-Mobile’s CEO Mike Sievert announced that the company has sought help on the cybersecurity front. He said in a statement that the company has entered into long-term partnerships with Mandiant and with consulting firm KPMG LLP.

“We know we need additional expertise to take our cybersecurity efforts to the next level – and we’ve brought in the help” Sievert said. “These arrangements are part of a substantial multi-year investment to adopt best-in-class practices and transform our approach. This is all about assembling the firepower we need to improve our ability to fight back against criminals and building a future-forward strategy to protect T-Mobile and our customers.”

With regards to details behind the attack Sievert painted this as the work of an erudite threat actor. “What we can share is that in simplest terms the bad actor leveraged their knowledge of technical systems along with specialized tools and capabilities to gain access to our testing environments and then used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data” he was quoted as saying in Friday’s statement.

Security experts weren’t too sure about T-Mobile’s characterization of this as a fancy attack.

Well Good Luck With All That

Some security experts said that the move to pull in the security big guns is a good step but T-Mobile’s got a lot of gunk to scrape out and it won’t happen overnight. Ian McShane Field CTO of security firm Arctic Wolf and former Gartner analyst told Threatpost that given how many breaches T-Mobile has suffered over the last few years he’s already skeptical about the company’s claims that the breach was a “highly sophisticated” attack. “I’m sure many others in our industry will be just as keen as I am to understand the cause and the lessons learned especially as it seems the internal investigation was only sparked by posts from a Twitter account with what appeared to be inside knowledge” he said.

Mark Manglicmot vice president of security services at Arctic Wolf told Threatpost that one of the poor practices brought to light by the breach is storing Social Security numbers in plain text. “Encryption of this data is a mandatory part of the security equation” he pointed out.

Moreover since this is T-Mobile’s sixth such breach in a few years it’s apparent “they haven’t taken security seriously enough” Manglicmot continued. “Their IT asset management and patching of systems is poor. The combination of poor defenses and a lack of capable real-time detection and response is a recipe for this type of data theft disaster. Once a data rich company like T-Mobile experiences a breach the flood-gates open to other attackers to find additional cracks. Reports are stating their security is a mess. It’s a good step that they are bringing in reputable help to investigate and bolster defenses but it’s going to take T-Mobile years to fully get their security program on par with their responsibility to customers.”

Then too there’s that throbbing sore thumb: namely the exposed router. Agio founder and CEO Bart McDonough pointed out to Threatpost that the unsecured router that Binns claimed to have exploited “appears to have had a different configuration than other routers. The hacker exploited the weakness in this non-standard configuration.” T-Mobile should have had an AI-based anomaly detection system in place he said: one that might have caught the aberrant login and resulting data exfiltration “allowing T-Mobile to perhaps minimize the damage from this attack.”

Many businesses aren’t as complex as T-Mobile; nor do they get targeted with such intensity. Still there are lessons to be learned for other businesses McDonough observed. “All businesses could benefit from enhancing their cybersecurity fundamentals. Specifically deploying device configuration management access management and AI-based detection of anomalous and suspicious network activity.”

As it is many if not most organizations only have a static awareness of their “surface” e.g. internal systems exposed to the Internet he continued. “When an administrator makes a change (or mistake) the new exposure point should set off alarms and someone should be asking the question ‘is that system router etc. presenting what we are intending?'”

Here's everything we know so far.

What is T-Mobile?

T-Mobile is a subsidiary of German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom AG providing wireless voice messaging and data services to customers in dozens of countries.

In the US the company has more than 104 million customers and became the second largest telecommunications company behind Verizon after its $26 billion merger with Sprint in 2018.

How many people are affected by the hack?

T-Mobile released a statement last week confirming that the names dates of birth social security numbers driver's licenses phone numbers as well as IMEI and IMSI information for about 7.8 million customers had been stolen in the breach.

Another 40 million former or prospective customers had their names dates of birth social security numbers and driver's licenses leaked.

More than 5 million ""current postpaid customer accounts"" also had information like names addresses date of births phone numbers IMEIs and IMSIs illegally accessed.

T-Mobile said another 667000 accounts of former T- Mobile customers had their information stolen alongside a group of 850000 active T-Mobile prepaid customers whose names phone numbers and account PINs were exposed.

The names of 52000 people with Metro by T-Mobile accounts may also have been accessed according to T-Mobile.

Who attacked T-Mobile?

A 21-year-old US citizen by the name of John Binns told The Wall Street Journal and Alon Gal co-founder of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock that he is the main culprit behind the attack.

His father who died when he was two was American and his mother is Turkish. He and his mother moved back to Turkey when Binns was 18.

How did the attack happen?

Binns who was born in the US but now lives in Izmir Turkey said he conducted the attack from his home. Through Telegram Binns provided evidence to the Wall Street Journal proving he was behind the T-Mobile attack and told reporters that he originally gained access to T-Mobile's network through an unprotected router in July.

According to the Wall Street Journal he had been searching for gaps in T-Mobile's defenses through its internet addresses and gained access to a data center near East Wenatchee Washington where he could explore more than 100 of the company's servers. From there it took about one week to gain access to the servers that contained the personal data of millions. By August 4 he had stolen millions of files.

""I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful"" Binns told the Wall Street Journal. ""Generating noise was one goal.""

Binns also spoke with Motherboard and Bleeping Computer to explain some dynamics of the attack.

He told Bleeping Computer that he gained access to T-Mobile's systems through ""production staging and development servers two weeks ago."" He hacked into an Oracle database server that had customer data inside.

To prove it was real Binns shared a screenshot of his SSH connection to a production server running Oracle with reporters from Bleeping Computer. They did not try to ransom T-Mobile because they already had buyers online according to their interview with the news outlet.

In his interview with Motherboard he said he had stolen the data from T-Mobile servers and that T-Mobile managed to eventually kick him out of the breached servers but not before copies of the data had already been made.

On an underground forum Binns and others were found selling a sample of the data with 30 million social security numbers and driver licenses for 6 Bitcoin according to Motherboard and Bleeping Computer.

T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert explained that the hacker behind the attack ""leveraged their knowledge of technical systems along with specialized tools and capabilities to gain access to our testing environments and then used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data.""

""In short this individual's intent was to break in and steal data and they succeeded"" Sievert said.

Binns claimed he stole 106GB of data but it is unclear whether that is true.

Why did Binns do it?

The 21-year-old Virginia native told the Wall Street Journal and other outlets that he has been targeted by US law enforcement agencies for his alleged involvement in the Satori botnet conspiracy.

He claims US agencies abducted him in Germany and Turkey and tortured him. Binns filed a lawsuit in a district court against the FBI CIA and Justice Department in November where he said he was being investigated for various cybercrimes and for allegedly being part of the Islamic State militant group a charge he denies.

""I have no reason to make up a fake kidnapping story and I'm hoping that someone within the FBI leaks information about that"" he explained in his messages to the Wall Street Journal.

The lawsuit includes a variety of claims by Binns that the CIA broke into his homes and wiretapped his computers as part of a larger investigation into his alleged cybercrimes. He filed the suit in a Washington DC District Court.

Before he was officially identified Binns sent Gal a message that was shared on Twitter.

""The breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019. We did it to harm US infrastructure"" the message said according to Gal.

Was Binns alone in conducting the attack?

He would not confirm if the data he stole has already been sold or if someone else paid him to hack into T-Mobile in his interview with The Wall Street Journal.

While Binns did not explicitly say he worked with others on the attack he did admit that he needed help in acquiring login credentials for databases inside T-Mobile's systems.

Some news outlets have reported that Binns was not the only person selling the stolen T-Mobile data.

When did T-Mobile discover the attack?

The Wall Street Journal story noted that T-Mobile was initially notified of the breach by a cybersecurity company called Unit221B LLC which said their customer data was being marketed on the dark web.

T-Mobile told ZDNet on August 16 that it was investigating the initial claims that customer data was being sold on the dark web and eventually released a lengthy statement explaining that while the hack did not involve all 100 million of their customers at least half had their information involved in the hack.

Is law enforcement involved?

T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said on August 27 that he could not share more information about the technical details of the attack because they are ""actively coordinating with law enforcement on a criminal investigation.""

It is unclear what agencies are working on the case and T-Mobile did not respond to questions about this.

What is T-Mobile doing about the hack?

Sievert explained that the company hired Mandiant to conduct an investigation into the incident.

""As of today we have notified just about every current T-Mobile customer or primary account holder who had data such as name and current address social security number or government ID number compromised"" he said in a statement

T-Mobile will also put a banner on the MyT-Mobile.com account login page of others letting them know if they were not affected by the attack.

Sievert admitted that the company is still in the process of notifying former and prospective customers millions of whom also had their information stolen.

In addition to offering just two years of free identity protection services with McAfee's ID Theft Protection Service T-Mobile said it was recommending customers sign up for ""T-Mobile's free scam-blocking protection through Scam Shield.""

The company will also be offering ""Account Takeover Protection"" to postpaid customers which they said will make it more difficult for customer accounts to be fraudulently ported out and stolen. They urged customers to reset all passwords and PIN numbers as well.

Sievert also announced that T-Mobile had signed ""long-term partnerships"" with Mandiant and KPMG LLG to beef up their cybersecurity and give the telecommunications giant the ""firepower"" needed to improve their ability to protect customers from cybercriminals.

""As I previously mentioned Mandiant has been part of our forensic investigation since the start of the incident and we are now expanding our relationship to draw on the expertise they've gained from the front lines of large-scale data breaches and use their scalable security solutions to become more resilient to future cyber threats"" Sievert added.

""They will support us as we develop an immediate and longer-term strategic plan to mitigate and stabilize cybersecurity risks across our enterprise. Simultaneously we are partnering with consulting firm KPMG a recognized global leader in cybersecurity consulting. KPMG's cybersecurity team will bring its deep expertise and interdisciplinary approach to perform a thorough review of all T-Mobile security policies and performance measurement. They will focus on controls to identify gaps and areas of improvement.""

Both Mandiant and KPMG will work together to sketch out a plan for T-Mobile to address its cybersecurity gaps in the future.

Has this happened to T-Mobile before?

No attack of this size has hit T-Mobile before but the company has been attacked multiple times.

Before the attack two weeks ago the company had announced four data breaches in the last three years. The company disclosed a breach in January after incidents in August 2018 November 2019 and March 2020.

The investigation into the January incident found that hackers accessed around 200000 customer details such as phone numbers the number of lines subscribed to an account and in some cases call-related information which T-Mobile said it collected as part of the normal operation of its wireless service.

The previous breaches included a March 2020 incident where T-Mobile said hackers gained access to both its employees' and customers' data including employee email accounts a November 2019 incident where T-Mobile said it ""discovered and shut down"" unauthorized access to the personal data of its customers and an August 2018 incident where T-Mobile said hackers gained access to the personal details of 2 million of its customers.

Before it merged with T-Mobile in 2020 Sprint also disclosed two security breaches in 2019 as well one in May and a second in July.

What happens now?

The stolen data which came from the wireless provider's databases of current former and prospective customers included Social Security numbers as well as other key information cybercriminals could use to open up new credit cards file fraudulent tax returns or apply for driver's licenses under the victims' names.

On Friday T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said the company's investigation into the breach was ""substantially complete"" though it continues to coordinate with law enforcement. He apologized for the hack and said the company had hired Mandiant a cybersecurity company and KPMG a consultancy to shore up its cyber defenses.

""To say we are disappointed and frustrated that this happened is an understatement"" Sievert wrote in a statement adding that keeping customer data safe is a ""top priority.""

Here's what we know about the giant cyberattack so far:

What happened?

T-Mobile says cybercriminals compromised its systems and stole the personal information of current former and prospective customers. The company initially said the attack which it confirmed on Aug. 16 affected about 40 million people but it later raised the total to more than 54 million people.

The information stolen included consumer names addresses Social Security numbers and dates of birth along with driver's licenses and other identification. In some cases IMEIs and IMSIs which identify devices and accounts were taken. Some account PINS were also stolen.

T-Mobile says there's no indication any consumer financial data such as credit card or other payment information was compromised.

Who's to blame?

As with all cyberattacks figuring out who did it can be tricky. The Wall Street Journal published on Aug. 26 an interview with John Binns a 21-year-old American who claimed responsibility for the hack. Binns who moved to Turkey a few years ago called T-Mobile's security ""awful"" and said he'd committed the hack in part to get attention. He declined to say whether he was paid to carry it out or if he'd sold any of the stolen data.

The Journal reported that it remains unclear whether Binns was working alone or with others. It also reported that the Seattle office of the FBI is investigating. T-Mobile is headquartered in nearby Bellevue Washington.

What's T-Mobile doing about it?

In its statement T-Mobile said its investigation conducted with the help of Mandiant identified how the attacker gained entry to its servers vulnerabilities it's since closed. As a result the company says it's confident the customer data isn't at risk of being stolen again by different cybercriminals.

T-Mobile said it's tasked Mandiant with developing a strategic plan to boost its overall cybersecurity operations. KPMG will review T-Mobile's security policies to identify gaps and areas that need to be improved.

What about the people affected?

T-Mobile says it's contacted nearly all the affected customers and that those it believes weren't affected will see a banner on their online account login page notifying them. It's also in the process of attempting to reach all the affected former and prospective customers.

To those affected T-Mobile is offering free access to McAfee's ID Theft Protection Service for two years and advanced spam-blocking. It's also offering its Account Takeover Protection service to protect postpaid customers which is designed to protect consumers from having their accounts ported out and stolen. The company has also reset PIN numbers for all prepaid customers after the exposure of 850000 accounts.

How can I protect myself?

Once your personal information has been compromised there's really no getting it back. The best you can do is try to keep tabs on it. Taking T-Mobile up on its offers of identity theft and account takeover protection can help with that.

Meanwhile people who've had their Social Security number stolen should freeze their credit. That'll prevent anyone other than them from opening a new financial account or taking out a loan in their name.

This is a good time to make sure you're using strong passwords and two-factor authentication on all of your accounts.

An American man living in Turkey claims to be the hacker behind a massive T-Mobile breach the Wall Street Journal reported.

T-Mobile customers are left feeling frustrated by their wireless carrier over security concerns.

Customers are experiencing fraudulent charges on debit cards and spam calls and text messages after the breach.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

T-Mobile customers are dealing with the fallout of a security breach that exposed the personal information of more than 53 million people with some telling Insider they've recently experienced fraudulent charges on debit cards and spam calls and text messages.

Customers also expressed frustration that the man who took responsibility for the attack said it was easy.

""Their security is awful"" John Binns a 21-year-old American who now lives in Turkey told The Wall Street Journal on Friday claiming to be the hacker behind the breach.

Binns gained access to the servers after discovering an unprotected router by scanning T-Mobile's internet address for weak spots The Journal reported. Over 53 million people had personal information compromised in the hack such as names addresses dates of births phone numbers Social Security numbers and driver's license information.

Many customers are now dealing with the repercussions of the hack and feel as though T-Mobile is not doing enough to protect them as some information hits the dark web.

Eddie Richards a T-Mobile customer from Elizabethtown Kentucky told Insider he did not know about the hack until it reached the news. Richards is part of T-Mobile's family plan and while only the primary account holder was notified of the data breach by the company he believes that all customers should have been made aware.

""It just frustrates me honestly"" Richards said. ""If our data is a priority for you guys to keep safe how come I haven't gotten a notification or anything like that?""

The telecom company has previously said that no financial information was compromised in the breach but Richards said he has dealt with several fraudulent charges on his debit cards since.

""I put two and two together"" Richards said explaining that although he can't prove it's connected to the breach he feels it is too much of a coincidence. Richards has also started getting more spam calls and messages on his cell phone including several emails.

Like Richards Amina Jeffery and her husband Trent have also received an increased number of spam calls and text messages since the breach. Most of the fraudulent messages involve sending or receiving money in transactions the Jefferies did not make.

The Jefferies who have been T-Mobile customers out of Milwaukee Wisconsin for many years feel let down by the wireless carrier.

""I felt like they tried to just basically downplay it that's what kind of irritated me"" Amina Jeffery told Insider in an interview. ""For me they're just trying to avoid responsibility.""







T-Mobile did not specifically comment on what customers told Insider and referred back to an apology statement released by the company's CEO Mike Sievert on Friday. Both Richards and the Jefferies want more to be done.

""What does that have to do with the rest of my life?"" Amina Jeffery said. ""If somebody has my social and my birthday and my name that is enough right there to go and be me so that just doesn't work for me.""

Despite this the Jefferies and Richards are still T-Mobile customers.

T-Mobile and Sprint merged in April of 2020. Now the company has a total of approximately 104.7 million customers according to its latest earnings report. Nearly half of the company's current customers were affected by the breach.

The company is almost done with its investigation into the incident and the breach is contained according to a statement released by T-Mobile on Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzgvMjgvMjI2NDY0MzkvdC1tb2JpbGUtZGF0YS1icmVhY2gtY2VvLXNlY3VyaXR5LW1hbmRpYW50LWtwbWfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile CEO calls massive data breach ‘humbling’,"A recent T-Mobile data breach coughed up the information of more than 50 million people including some who aren’t current customers or never were.

This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years

Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours” he writes.

It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one two in 2020 plus one each for 2018 and 2019."

If any company does things differently it’s Warby Parker the Wharton-founded start-up that took on a monopolistic eyeglass industry by selling $95-and-up specs direct to consumers online.

In over a decade since its founding Warby Parker has built up a portfolio of 145 stores to augment its big online presence and is on pace this year to surpass $500 million in sales. Soaring interest in other online retailers such as Allbirds and StitchFix likely helped prompt Warby Parker’s latest adventure: filing last week to go public.

And it’s not going the traditional IPO route either.

First difference? Warby Parker will list directly on the New York Stock Exchange forgoing traditional support from investment bankers and the roadshow with investors.

Second difference: like Amazon Warby Parker transitioned from online-only sales to opening its retail stores. That can help it appeal to an older demographic and build out a retail presence in addition to their direct-to-consumer business said Michael Solomon a marketing professor at St. Joseph’s University’s business school.

“They’re riding a few waves favorably -- the move to online shopping and a category like eyewear was sitting there waiting to be improved. In addition they’re an online pure play that moved to opening retail stores” he said.

Others like the beauty subscription firm BirchBox “did that too and it reflects the omni-channel retail reality we live in. You have to be where your customers are and people want to go back to stores” Solomon said. “From a pure marketing view it’s really smart to stake a claim in both domains.”

The online boom has spurred investor interest in Philly start-up GoPuff a food delivery business recently valued at $15 billion and Casper mattress seller which went public last year.

It’s not clear when the Warby Parker IPO will begin trading. The company is still awaiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to complete its review though it hopes to file sometime this year listing its Class A common stock under the ticker symbol “WRBY.”

Another big difference? Warby Parker operates as a B-Corp. which means shareholders don’t always come first. The public interest is baked into their thinking. Indeed under the glasses’ giveaway program it says it has distributed eight million pairs free.

Investors should understand the implications of that. The company is “focused on positively impacting all stakeholders” as opposed to merely shareholders. According to their SEC filing that means the company may make decisions that result in higher costs if it benefits the public good or local communities.

That has been their style so far. And it has worked pretty well. But it could get complicated.

Wharton grads

Warby Parker was founded in 2010 by four Wharton alums two of whom stayed -- Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa.

Now headquartered in New York City the co-founders sell designer-quality prescription glasses and contacts. The company now offers eye exams and vision tests and has opened stores across the U.S. and Canada. In this region its shops are on Walnut Street in Philadelphia and at the Suburban Square shopping area in Ardmore and the King of Prussia Mall.

Warby Parker also appeals to the Generation Z desire for a “double bottom line” distributing a pair to someone in need with every purchase through their Buy a Pair Give a Pair program. To date Warby Parker has distributed more than eight million glasses to people in need.

“Gen Z business founders want to solve problems and thank heaven that’s the case” said Donna De Carolis dean of Drexel University’s Close School of Entrepreneurship. “Whether it’s through a for-profit or a nonprofit or a B corporation there are many ways to a successful start-up.”

The numbers

The eyeglass seller has posted stellar revenue growth but hasn’t yet turned a profit.

Despite COVID-19 Warby Parker actually saw its share of sales through stores increase. Before the pandemic it did 65% of its business in stores the rest online. This year even after the virus struck the proportion sold in stores fell but then recovered to 50%.

In 2019 the firm’s sales surged to $371 million a one-year jump of $100 million. But in 2020 growth slowed. Warby Parker posted sales of $394 million that year reflecting a slowdown during the pandemic when the company closed some stores. The company broke even in 2019 but lost $22 million in 2018 and $55 million in 2020.

Still it has rebounded this year. It sold $271 million in glasses in the first six months of 2021 a 54% increase over the same period the previous year. And losses for the half-year narrowed from $10 million in 2020 to $7.3 million in 2021.

That lack of profitability is largely because Warby Parker spends heavily on marketing “as they should. Otherwise they won’t be around for very long” said St. Joe’s Solomon.

What’s the company worth? Most recently its valuation was estimated at around $3 billion. To be sure it is still far smaller than those dominant in the field most notably international giant EssilorLuxottica owner of LensCrafters and Pearle Vision. EssilorLuxottica is worth more than $70 billon.

Still current investors in Warby Parker include plenty of venture capital and Wall Street firms.

Crunchbase data show that Warby Parker has raised a total of $536 million funding over nine rounds the last in August of 2020. Backers include D1 Capital Partners and T. Rowe Price most recently.

Over the past year Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve has again and again used the same phrasing to kick off his press conferences after it sets interest rates. “Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary-policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability.” It may not set pulses racing. But that is just how Mr Powell wants it: a projection of control in terms any schoolchild can understand.

The simple wording belies a remarkable evolution in Fed policy and practice on his watch. Mr Powell has overseen a giant monetary response to the covid-induced slowdown. The Fed has bought more than $4trn in assets during the pandemic (equivalent to 18% of GDP ) dwarfing the scale of its actions after the global financial crisis and swelling its total balance-sheet to $8.3trn (see chart 1). Mr Powell has refined the way the Fed communicates targeting his messages at ordinary Americans rather than economists. He has led a landmark shift in the way it thinks about interest rates. And in the process he has presided over a bold gamble keeping policy ultra-loose even as inflation soars. To his supporters—of whom there are many—he saved America from an economic catastrophe. To his critics however he is steering it into danger.",,,,,,,,,

So they've pivoted to new tactics including painting climate advocates as hypocrites.

Drawing attention to advocates' non-eco-friendly habits undermines their credibility and distracts from policy changes.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

After Prince Harry told Oprah Winfrey that climate change and mental health are two of the ""most important issues facing the world today"" the New York Post threw the words back at him. In a story earlier this week the Post reported that the ""double-talking dilettante"" had taken a private plane from Colorado to California.

Sky News and The Times too have lambasted Harry's carbon-intensive jetsetting. All three publications are tied to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which previously denied the science of climate change. Murdoch is on the advisory board of Genie Energy an energy company that invests in oil and gas projects.

London mayor Sadiq Khan an anti-pollution advocate got similar treatment from The Sun another Murdoch-owned publication for flying 32000 miles between 2016 and 2019 and purchasing 4.3 million paper towels in a year.

According to Michael Mann an atmospheric science professor at Pennsylvania State University these types of stories are part of a larger strategy: Groups that support the continued use of fossil fuels have increasingly begun to point out climate advocates' seemingly hypocritical behavior rather than denying that climate change is real. It's one of many new strategies the fossil-fuel industry has adopted according to Mann's latest book ""The New Climate War.""

Mann told Insider that in his view ""2009-2010 was the last hurrah for good old fashioned climate-change denialism."" By 2019 62% of Americans agreed that climate change was affecting their day-to-day lives.

""It's beyond not being able to deny the science"" he said. ""It's now a matter of having to deny reality.""

So instead of hammering the ""climate change isn't happening"" message the fossil-fuel industry now seems to be fostering finger-pointing and infighting among environmentalists. That siphons time and attention away from efforts to bring about systemic changes to cut emissions — policies like carbon taxes incentives for renewable energy or restrictions on fossil-fuel infrastructure.

""What better way to discredit thought leaders and key messengers than to tar them as hypocrites based on accusations that they don't walk the walk?"" Mann said.

'Mr. Global Warming?'

Leonardo DiCaprio Al Gore and Barack Obama have all been targets of this ""climate hypocrisy"" line of attack.

DiCaprio started a multi-million dollar environmental conservation fund and used his 2016 Oscars speech to talk about the climate crisis. But when he flew from France to New York in a private jet to accept an environmental award later that year the headlines followed.

""Hollywood hypocrite's global warming sermon"" the Herald Sun's read. (The Herald Sun also belongs to Murdoch's news empire.) The New York Post called DiCaprio a ""megapolluter"" and ""Mr. Global Warming"" and suggested that the actor's flight ""expanded his carbon footprint by 8000 miles in about 24 hours.""

Gore meanwhile is known for the 2006 documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth."" But after he starred in a sequel to the film in 2017 an op-ed in The Daily Caller suggested that Gore's home devoured 34 times more energy than the average US household. The Daily Caller founded by Tucker Carlson received $3.5 million in funding from the Koch Family Foundations and the Charles Koch Institute in the last decade. According to Greenpeace the Koch brothers spent $15 million to finance 90 groups that attacked climate science and policy between 1997 and 2018.

The Daily Caller piece was written by Drew Johnson founder of the Beacon Center of Tennessee a libertarian think tank. Johnson was for the most part doubling down on a tactic that had worked for him a decade earlier.

""He tells other people how to live and he's not following his own rules"" Johnson told ABC in 2007 after the center published a report describing how Gore's 20-room home used 20 times as much electricity as the average American house.

The criticism of Obama came in 2019 when an op-ed in the Hill blasted him for buying a house in Martha's Vineyard. Purchasing ocean-front property the piece argued suggests one isn't actually worried about sea-level rise. The article was written by Katie Pavlich an alumna of the Young Americans' Foundation — an outreach organization of the conservative movement with financial ties to the Koch Brothers.

""If the former president is truly concerned about sea levels rising as a result of climate change"" Pavlich wrote ""his latest real estate purchase places doubts on his sincerity.""

That type of argument Mann said directs attention away from the companies emitting the carbon that contributes to sea-level rise.

""It would be funny if it weren't so pernicious"" he added.

'Carbon shaming'

Shaz Attari a climate-communications researcher at Indiana University Bloomington thinks this new tactic is working. Her research suggests that scientists and communicators with large carbon footprints have less credibility than those with reduced carbon consumption and that people are more likely to support policies or recommendations if the leader promoting them has a small carbon footprint.

""When it comes to message uptake advocates are judged for inconsistency between their behavior and advocacy"" Attari told Insider. ""This judgement is dominated by flying or home energy consumption.""

Attari said she even once gave a talk in New York City about reducing personal energy use and someone in the audience asked: ""Hey you flew to this meeting — why should I listen to what you say?""

""The tactic of carbon shaming is quite an effective way of inciting infighting among climate advocates"" Mann said. ""There are armies of bots and trolls deployed to generate these arguments online of 'Why do you fly?' 'Why aren't you a vegan?'""

'Climate sadism'

Mark Maslin an Earth science researcher at the University College London told Insider that ""attacking the messenger has always been part and parcel"" of fossil-fuel interests' strategy to counter environmental movements.

What's changed he said is the tenor of these attacks which Maslin says have escalated into a vicious pageantry of ""climate sadism.""

Take for example the backlash against Greta Thunberg. The teenage activist is a difficult target for the hypocrisy argument since she doesn't eat meat or fly. One staff member at the Heartland Institute a Koch-funded think tank did point out that the boat Thunberg once used to cross the Atlantic was made of plastic but for the most part conservatives and anti-environmentalists have chosen to target Thunberg's personality instead.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called her a ""little brat"" in 2019. Donald Trump said she had an ""anger management problem.""

Conservative commentator Michael Knowles called Thunberg who has Asperger's syndrome ""a mentally ill Swedish child"" on Fox News. Fox host Laura Ingraham meanwhile compared the Thunberg's youth climate movement to a murderous cult of children from a Stephen King novel.

""The blowback is directly related to the impact you're having"" Kim Cobb a climate scientist from Georgia Tech told Insider. Thunberg's movement she added was ""striking a nerve with every single human on the planet at that point.""

The Heartland Institute even briefly worked with the German anti-environmental group EIKE to hire a German teenager Naomi Seibt to fashion herself as an antithesis to Thunberg.

""Many people believe I'm being pushed as an 'Anti-Greta'"" Seibt told Insider last year.

""It's wrong to look up to her as a climate puppet and symbol"" Seibt said of Thunberg adding ""I don't want people to panic about the world ending.""

Over the course of four months for a monthly salary of $2000 Seibt produced videos for the institute like ""Naomi Seibt vs. Greta Thunberg: Whom should we trust?"" and spoke at the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference. Seibt quietly parted ways with Heartland in April 2020.

""The Anti-Greta just shows how cynical they are"" Mann said adding ""they think it's all a shell game about distraction and deception — that's what they've got left.""

In Prince Harry's case reports about his plane flights do seem to have discredited the prince's climate agenda. A recent Newsweek poll in the UK found that 66% of respondents viewed the prince as ""hypocritical on air travel."" But the number most stories about Harry's trip left out is the US's total emissions from fossil fuels: 4853 million metric tons of carbon in 2019 alone.

Harry's private flight from Aspen to Santa Barbara meanwhile emitted at most 9 metric tons of carbon dioxide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yOS9ub3J0aC1iYXNlLW1lZGlhLWxlYWRzLTItN20tcHJlLXNlcmllcy1hLWZ1bmRpbmctaW4tZGlnaXRhbC1tZWRpYS1zdGFydHVwLXZpZXRjZXRlcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Base Media leads $2.7M pre-Series A funding in digital media startup Vietcetera,"Ho Chi Minh City-based Vietcetera a digital medial network originally created for millennials and Gen Z will broaden its target demographic after getting $2.7 million in pre-Series A funding.

My 67 GTO has 3 different types of brightwork. When people say ""chrome"" they often are describing a look rather than the actual metal. But the stuff that is chrome plated is the stuff that is usually cast out of what is called ""pot metal."" The bumpers are too but I'm just talking trim. The rocker molding is thin stamped stainless. The window vents and door handles are chrome plated. The window trim and driprail moldings are all anodized aluimum. And that stuff SUCKS because it eventually gets cloudy and the only way to make it bright is to remove the anodization which is chemically bound to aluimum meaning it has to be sanded down and off so it is very time consuming. Then it has to constantly be polished.



Why is black trim considered a fad by some? WHy is chrome not a fad? Because it was first used? So were chrome bumpers......when is the last time you saw any of those? Are LED headlamps a fad too?



I personally think black trim looks better on modern cars. My 944's were late 80's cars but even the 911's from the late 70's on look better than the early 70's ones because the trim was black rather than chrome. Now for cars with chrome bumpers different story. Some cars look good with brushed aluminum (the satin finish looking stuff like Audi has one some of the S cars). But bright chrome looks as dated as greased back hair and rolled up jeans with cagiarette packs rolled into shirtsleeves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC1kZWFkLWJhdHRlcnktcXVhcnRlci1taWxlLXRpbWUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVzbGFyYXRpLmNvbS90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkLWRlYWQtYmF0dGVyeS1xdWFydGVyLW1pbGUtdGltZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model S Plaid at 20% battery after 40 quarter-mile runs is still a monster,"By

Back when the Taycan Turbo S was released Porsche made it a point to highlight that the all-electric sports car is capable of maintaining its performance despite multiple launches unlike its main competitor the Model S Performance which tended to lose power as its battery was discharged. This particular weakness does not exist anymore with the Model S Plaid but if a recent video is any indication it appears that Tesla’s repeatability of performance has reached absolutely insane levels.

Brooks Weisblat of YouTube’s DragTimes channel has been having a blast with his Tesla Model S Plaid taking the vehicle to the track and racing it against practically every car willing to step up against it. In a recent video the veteran drag racer decided to test how well the Model S Plaid would perform when the vehicle’s battery was just at 20%. The test according to Weisblat was performed after 40 quarter-mile runs since each launch consumed about 2% of the Plaid’s battery.

Much to his surprise the Model S Plaid performed shockingly well. Despite its low battery level and the run being its 41st journey through the drag strip the Tesla was still able to finish the quarter-mile in 9.94 seconds at 136.40 mph. The vehicle’s 0-60 mph time was also listed at 2.33 seconds as per Dragy data. This all but proved that Tesla was not joking when it stated that the Model S Plaid’s performance would be incredibly consistent and leagues better than its already impressive predecessors.

While the Plaid’s predecessors like the Model S “Raven” Performance and the Model S P100D with Ludicrous Plus were amazing machines that could slay supercars they tend to exhibit a drop in performance as their batteries lose their charge. This was evident when Car and Driver tested the Model S Performance against the Porsche Taycan Turbo S over 15 quarter-mile runs. The motoring publication claimed that the Model S slowed down to such a degree that at one point the vehicle’s 0-60 mph time went beyond 6 seconds and its quarter-mile time slowed down to over 14 seconds.

Such a result seems extremely improbable for the Tesla Model S Plaid. Showing consistent performance after 40 quarter-mile launches is impressive in its own right but completing a sub-10-second run with a low battery level proves that the Model S Plaid is nothing short of a monster. With such numbers it appears that drag racing fans should start getting used to the sight of the Model S Plaid embarrassing supercars on the drag strip even as their batteries approach empty.

On Aug. 28 2021 a Tesla Model 3 hit a state highway patrol cruiser in Orlando missing the officer who stopped to help a disabled motorist on the highway. According to Florida Highway Patrol the Autopilot feature was enabled in the Tesla involved in the crash.

The company is already under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a series of crashes involving its cars that occurred between January 2018 and July 2021 across nine states. According to the agency the August crash was the 12th involving a Tesla vehicle.



Key Takeaways A Tesla Model 3 in Autopilot mode crashed into a state trooper's car on a Florida highway in August 2021 making it the 12th incident involving this Tesla feature.

News of the crash didn't have a big impact on Tesla's share prices sales or its investment in vehicle automation technology.

Other car companies like Ford General Motors Lexus and Volvo are also testing self-driving technology.

Google and Uber have reported crashes and fatalities involving their autonomous vehicle technologies.

Autonomous vehicles represent $54 billion of the global car market which is expected to grow.



How Tesla's Autopilot Feature Works

Autopilot is a standard feature in every new vehicle produced according to the company. Tesla owners who purchased vehicles without the feature may add the Autopilot and self-driving packages for an additional cost to be added after-market.

According to Tesla:

Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel. When used properly Autopilot reduces your overall workload as a driver. Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with 8 external cameras 12 ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide you on your journey. Model 3 and Model Y built for the North American market have transitioned to camera-based Tesla Vision which are not equipped with radar and instead rely on Tesla’s advanced suite of cameras and neural net processing to deliver Autopilot and related features. Model S and Model X continue to be equipped with radar.

The company warns drivers not to be complacent even if their car is equipped with this feature. They should remain fully attentive and keep their hands on the wheel at all times. In fact the driver should be ready to resume normal operations at any time when the feature is running.

Tesla chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk tweeted out statistics claiming that vehicles equipped with the company's Autopilot feature were about 10 times less likely to be involved in a crash compared to the average vehicle. But critics say those statistics lack important context and ignore the age of the average car which is approximately 12 years when driven on American roads.

""NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving themselves. Every available vehicle requires a human driver to be in control at all times and all state laws hold human drivers responsible for operation of their vehicles"" the NHTSA stated.





Tesla warns drivers that the Autopilot and self-driving capabilities aren't designed to make vehicles fully autonomous.

Self-Driving Stats

The NHTSA documented a dozen crashes that reportedly involved Tesla's Autopilot feature—in some cases fatal. A driver was killed in May 2021 in Southern California after his Model 3 whose automated driving system was partially engaged struck another vehicle on the highway. But Tesla is hardly the only company testing or producing self-driving capabilities let alone whose vehicles have been involved in crashes.

Autonomous vehicles are a big part of the automotive industry and represent $54 billion of the global car market with companies like Ford General Motors Lexus and Volvo dropping their names in the hat. Names like Apple Uber Google and Amazon are also embracing the technology testing out self-driving vehicles to automate their services. Experts suggest this market has much promise with the potential to grow about 10 times before 2030.

Google's self-driving capabilities came under scrutiny when one of its self-driving cars was involved in a crash in February 2016. The vehicle a Lexus SUV hit a bus while making a lane change at a speed of two miles per hour. Authorities said no one was injured. Another Google vehicle was involved in a collision with another vehicle in May 2018. The van which had a driver in it was in self-driving mode when it crashed into another van.

A pedestrian was killed in Tempe Arizona while walking her bike across the street after she was hit by a vehicle in self-driving mode in 2018. This was reported to be the world's first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle. Authorities stated that the car's safety driver who was driving for Uber at the time was ""visually distracted"" by her cell phone and failed to take control of the vehicle at the time. The company said it suspended its self-driving testing following the incident.



Tesla closed at about $783 per share on Oct. 6 2021.

Tesla Investors Shrug Off Latest News

Any effect the crashes may have had on the company's stock has certainly waned. Tesla shares traded at $736 following the news of the crash in Florida—relatively unchanged from the previous day.

This is a stark contrast to the previous fears investors had that sent the stock price down. The stock dropped by more than 4% after the NHTSA announced its investigation in mid-August. It fell by 8% in 2019 after the National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the Autopilot feature was engaged during a fatal crash in March of that year.

Investors' nonchalance to the latest news may be due to two reasons. Even as it has faced multiple safety concerns Tesla has become an expert at navigating regulation. Most investigations into Autopilot technology have absolved the feature of blame from accidents and crashes of Tesla cars. More importantly the investigations have yet to hinder sales numbers which continue to increase on a quarterly basis for its cars.

Investors may also be holding out hope for Tesla's promised Full Self-Driving technology which is still in Beta mode. It promises complete autonomy meaning that drivers can take their hands off the wheel after Tesla's artificial intelligence (AI) system takes over driving functions.

A Tesla said to be in Autopilot mode hit a state trooper's patrol car and another vehicle on a highway in Florida early Saturday morning local media reports.

The Florida state trooper was stopped with his emergency lights on and was trying to help another vehicle that was stopped on the interstate in Orlando just before 5 a.m. Florida Highway Patrol told WKMG ClickOrlando.

The Tesla apparently failed to move over on the interstate as it approached the vehicles eventually hitting both of the cars and nearly missing the state trooper who was out of his patrol car the crash report obtained by ClickOrlando stated. The Tesla had Autopilot engaged the report said.

Tesla did not respond to Insider's request to comment on the accident.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently investigating Tesla's driver-assist Autopilot feature.

The NHTSA has identified over 11 crashes since 2018 in which a Tesla in Autopilot or ""Traffic Aware Cruise Control"" mode has struck vehicles at first-responder scenes according to a document detailing the scope of the investigation.

Most of the crashes in the investigation took place after dark and had involved emergency vehicles with flashing lights flares illuminated arrow boards or even traffic cones near them Insider reported.

In April two people died in a car crash outside of Houston Texas after the Tesla they were in ran off the road.

Authorities at the scene said nobody was driving the car and it was suggested that the passengers were using Tesla's Autopilot feature Insider reported. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Autopilot was not engaged in that incident.

Autopilot automates some highway-driving tasks but it does not allow the cars to fully drive themselves. Tesla has come under fire for Autopilot's name which critics say is misleading and invites drivers to misuse it Insider reported. Tesla also sells other features called ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" which also does not make the car autonomous.

At DTU the average salary for the 500-odd students placed till now is Rs 22 lakh nearly 16% higher compared with this time last year.“The fight for talent this year is much more intense” said Rajesh Rohilla dean training and placement DTU. Nearly half the students already placed at DTU have bagged packages of Rs 20 lakh-plus.Covid has also turned out to be a boon in disguise as students have got to work on longer-duration internship projects online parallelly with their studies. This has led to a higher pre-placement offer conversion rate as companies have observed their work over a longer time said Rohilla.“It could be one of the best years in terms of placement so far” said V Samuel Rajkumar director at VIT’s Career Development Centre. More than 2000 of the institute’s 7500 registered students have been placed already; over 100 have received offers upwards of Rs 25 lakh.Intel and Nokia have hired more than 100 students each; Societe Generale has hired 75 and Microsoft 21 students.

Microsoft Flight Simulator delivers a complete digital recreation of planet Earth but it's only the start of a multi-year journey. The title provides a platform for future updates to come and is also supported by a growing community of third-party developers and their content. Microsoft Flight Simulator already features a wide selection of mods and add-ons and more are added all the time both in the official Marketplace and from a variety of other sources further cementing MSFS as one of the best PC games around.

The MSFS Marketplace provides a hassle-free channel to access new content from both Asobo Studio and third-party developers but it can be hard to know where to start or what content is worth your attention (and much of the content is premium). Outside of the Marketplace there are innumerable sources for additional MSFS content. Now that Microsoft Flight Simulator is on Xbox there are more people than ever with eyes on the game asking what the best mods and add-ons are.

Here are our picks for the best mods and add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is the 2020 revival of the classic flight sim franchise from Microsoft. This time around the helm was controlled by Asobo Studio and the ambition for the project was higher than ever: a top-class simulation experience that encompasses the entire world.

The end result is one of the most visually stunning and technically impressive video games of all time and a title that especially after numerous post-launch updates caters to both flight sim veterans and casual players. Asobo Studio truly knocked it out of the park but the original release was limited to powerful gaming PCs. However Asobo Studio recently brought Microsoft Flight Simulator to Xbox a fantastic port that immediately became the showcase for Xbox Series X|S consoles and made Microsoft Flight Simulator one of the best Xbox games for those interested in a premier flight sim.

Both the list of Microsoft Flight Simulator airports and the list of Microsoft Flight Simulator aircraft are impressively extensive and continue to improve over time. MSFS even gives players ways to augment their flight sim experience with optional first-party and third-party content from the official Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace or external sources.

This might include additional planes or airports improvements to existing planes or locations visual and quality-of-life improvements new activities and missions custom liveries and more. Microsoft Flight Simulator is absolutely the premier flight simulator available right now and is even more unique thanks to its recent Xbox launch.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is available right now on PC Xbox Series X Xbox Series S and Xbox Game Pass for Xbox and PC.

A32NX — FlyByWire Simulations

Available from FlyByWire Simulations for free

FlyByWire Simulations for free Compatible with PC

The Airbus A320 family of airliners are some of the most popular and instantly recognizable aircraft in the world and the A320neo is one of the standard aircraft included in Microsoft Flight Simulator. However the community quickly realized that Asobo Studio's implementation of the A320neo was far from perfect and a group of talented creators (who go by FlyByWire Simulations) set out to improve upon the base.

The A32NX mod adds a whole range of improvements to the default A320neo including an all-new cockpit interior supported by the anecdotes of dozens of real-world A320 pilots and various other enhancements all over the aircraft. If you want to fly this legendary aircraft with the highest degree of realism this is the mod for you.

FlyByWire Simulations is a smaller group of creators who work on this project when they can so new developments and features can be slow to arrive at times. Still as the A32NX mod stands right now it's already a fantastic addition to Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Boeing 747-8 — Salty Simulations

Available from GitHub for free

GitHub for free Compatible with PC

In a similar vein to the A32NX mod listed above Salty Simulations has worked tirelessly to introduce a ton of improvements to the beastly Boeing 747-8 airliner which dominates any sky it's flying in. Improvements include internal and external textures and a myriad of additions and enhancements to the cockpit which is at least to hardcore flight simulator users the most crucial part of an aircraft and certainly the most important to get right.

The 747-8 is a truly massive aircraft so only the most confident of pilots should settle down in the cockpit but with Salty Simulations mod you're at least guaranteed it'll look as real as possible. You'll have to grab this mod from GitHub versus other ""more official"" MSFS add-on sources but the installation process is still relatively painless.

Airbus H135 Helicopter — Hype Performance Group

Available from Flightsim.to for free

Flightsim.to for free Compatible with PC

Microsoft Flight Simulator boasts of an impressive number of aircraft across all purposes ranges and sizes and the number continues to grow over time. However one category of air-capable transportation that players missed at launch was the inclusion of helicopters which add an entirely different dynamic to your flying experience. Fortunately courtesy of Hype Performance Group you can achieve that dream in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The Airbus H135 added via this add-on may not be explicitly perfect in every way but it's being constantly improved and iterated on over time. This mod is a lot of fun if you have ever fancied flying a helicopter over a bustling city or scenic countryside and the H135 here looks great is entirely functional and even comes with different liveries from which to choose.

Liveries Mega Pack — Project Mega Pack

Available from Project Mega Pack for free Livery Manager from GitHub for free

Project Mega Pack for free Livery Manager from GitHub for free Compatible with PC

Microsoft Flight Simulator features a ludicrous amount of options and settings to configure your game exactly how you want it but options for customizing individual aircraft tend to be limited. There's currently an official ""Aviator Club"" livery pack in the MSFS Marketplace to celebrate how far the game has come but it's only one MSFS-branded livery for the default aircraft.

If you want to go above and beyond there's no better option than the Liveries Mega Pack which to date includes well over 700 unique liveries across all of Microsoft Flight Simulator's aircraft. The liveries are all high quality and offer a range of options from real-world liveries and brands to not-as-real options. This pack is genuinely impressive but it's also a lot to install.

If you want specific liveries from the pack you can also install the option Livery Manager to customize which liveries from the pack are installed. Also be sure to check out our guide on how to use custom liveries in Microsoft Flight Simulator for even more guidance on the subject.

We Love VFR — PuffinFlight

Available from Flightsim.to for free Region 2 from Flightsim.to for free

Flightsim.to for free Region 2 from Flightsim.to for free Compatible with PC

Microsoft Flight Simulator features unbelievably spectacular visuals but plenty of finer details are sacrificed to achieve the grander scale the game enjoys. Some of these finer details are actually crucial to pilots looking for the most realistic experience in MSFS as they provide visual cues in the world to align an aircraft. With the We Love VFR add-on from PuffinFlight thousands of these objects are accurately placed all over the world.

The pack includes objects like communication towers antennas chimneys construction cranes and much more. There are two regions to We Love VFR with each adding tens of thousands of new objects. Region 1 covers Europe and Asia while Region 2 mostly covers North and South America.

Global AI Ship Traffic — KL791

Available from Flightsim.to for free

Flightsim.to for free Compatible with PC

Microsoft Flight Simulator features live AI traffic of aircraft that accurately follows real-world traffic or commercial aircraft providing a greater sense of depth to the game. However pilots that spend a lot of time by coasts or over oceans may have noticed a strange omission: ships are nowhere to be seen. With Global AI Ship Traffic a similar solution to Microsoft Flight Simulator's built-in live AI aircraft traffic is added but for water vessels.

Dozens of kinds of ships are added in this add-on including military vessels cargo ships cruise ships fishing boats and many more. What's more many of the most famous and well-known ships actually follow their real-world routes in-game so you can find those ships while flying around if you want. MSFS is an impressive simulation experience but the addition of ships takes it to a new level.

Bushtalk Radio — Bushtalk

Available from Flightsim.to for free account from Bushtalk Radio for free

Flightsim.to for free account from Bushtalk Radio for free Compatible with PC

Many Microsoft Flight Simulator players may just be looking for the realest virtual flight experience they can find but more casual players may desire simply flying around and exploring parts of the world. For those who fall in the latter group Bushtalk Radio is perfect. This optional add-on is entirely free (but does require an account) and acts as a ""tour guide"" of sorts for MSFS flights.

When you're flying around Bushtalk Radio will provide interesting facts and information about surrounding locations and points of interest and can give you a greater sense of where you are in the world. This is a great add-on for casual flights and pairs wonderfully with Microsoft Flight Simulator's already existing Discovery Flights.

Orbx MSFS Products — Orbx

Available from Orbx and the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace for a range of prices

Orbx and the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace for a range of prices Compatible with PC and sometimes Xbox

Finally the last add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulators is actually a collection of MSFS mods. Orbx is one of the biggest creators for Microsoft Flight Simulator and they've created mods for enhanced airports locations and much more. Some of their content is available in the Microsoft Marketplace most of it through their website and prices range from free to approximately $30 (although some may go higher).

Orbx creates quality mods and add-ons for MSFS so any of their products are likely a safe bet to elevate your experience. There's a lot to choose from and unlike many of the other mods on this list Orbx does have options in the MSFS Marketplace meaning you can also install them on Xbox consoles!

Rapat Umum Hari Kebangsaan 2021

COVID-19

Saudara saudari sekalian sudah hampir dua tahun COVID-19 menjejas kehidupan kita. Namun di sebalik cabaran itu kita berjaya bangkit sebagai satu masyarakat yang utuh.

Banyak kegiatan dan sambutan terjejas gara-gara COVID-19. Solat di masjid dihadkan. Begitu juga kunjung-mengunjung pada Hari Raya. Dan dua tahun berturut-turut korban di masjid dan ibadah haji juga tidak dapat dilakukan.

Dalam mengharungi COVID-19 masyarakat Melayu/Islam telah berikan kerjasama penuh. Saya sanjung dan hargai kecekalan anda. Saya juga ingin melahirkan penghargaan saya kepada para pemimpin masyarakat asatizah serta masjid-masjid di bawah bimbingan Mufti atas kepimpinan dan usaha mereka untuk terus menggalakkan orang Melayu/Islam mendapatkan vaksin.

Dengan lebih ramai orang disuntik kita kini melonggarkan sekatan secara beransur-ansur. Ini termasuk membolehkan lebih ramai jemaah di masjid-masjid.

Sungguhpun demikian kita harus cuba sedaya upaya untuk memberikan vaksin kepada mereka yang masih belum disuntik terutama sekali warga emas yang paling mudah sakit teruk jika dijangkiti COVID-19. Jika anda warga emas silalah dapatkan suntikan vaksin secepat mungkin!

Usaha-usaha Masyarakat dan Pemerintah

Saya gembira melihat masyarakat Melayu/Islam bersatu padu dan saling mengambil berat antara satu sama lain sepanjang pandemik ini. Semangat gotong-royong dan sikap tidak putus asa inilah yang menjadi kunci kemajuan anda selama ini.

Malah laporan Banci Penduduk 2020 baru-baru ini mendapati bahawa masyarakat Melayu mencatatkan kemajuan yang sangat ketara sepanjang sedekad lalu. Lebih ramai orang Melayu daripada semua peringkat usia berkelulusan tinggi. Kadar siswazah Melayu naik seganda. Jumlah pekerja PMET Melayu juga meningkat. Hasilnya keluarga Melayu kini meraih pendapatan lebih baik. Syabas!

Kita lihat lebih ramai orang Melayu semakin berjaya. Seperti Aarman Yazeed. Selepas tamat NS Aarman bekerja di Thermo Fisher Scientific antara syarikat pembuat peranti perubatan terbesar di dunia. Beliau bekerja keras dan gigih belajar kemahiran baru. Prestasinya menyerlah dan beliau dinaikkan pangkat sebagai pengurus pengilangan. Karyawan seperti Aarman antara sebab Thermo Fisher yakin dan baru-baru ini mengambil keputusan untuk menghasilkan vaksin di Singapura.

Satu lagi contoh ialah Samsiah Suliman Pengarah Urusan Jumain Sataysfaction. Samsiah adalah peniaga generasi ketiga perniagaan sate keluarga yang bermula dengan datuknya lebih seratus sepuluh tahun lalu. Saya bertemunya baru-baru ini. Samsiah beritahu saya apabila mengambil alih perniagaan itu beliau yakin akan potensinya. Beliau berusaha untuk mempelbagaikan rangkaian produknya termasuk menyediakan pilihan bukan daging seperti sate ini. Nampak macam sate babat tapi ini sebenarnya sate cendawan. Sama lazatnya! Samsiah juga berjaya membawa sate Singapura ke pentas antarabangsa. Hari ini syarikatnya mengeluarkan 80000 cucuk sate sehari dan mengeksport ke Hong Kong Kanada dan Timur Tengah.

Saya harap kisah-kisah kejayaan seperti Samsiah dan Aarman akan menjadi perangsang kepada masyarakat Melayu/Islam untuk terus maju jaya.

Namun Banci Penduduk 2020 juga menunjukkan beberapa trend membimbangkan berkaitan pemilikan rumah dan pendidikan.

Seperti rakyat Singapura yang lain kebanyakan keluarga Melayu memiliki rumah mereka sendiri. Orang Melayu yang tinggal di flat sewa semakin meningkat. Itu kesalnya. Antara sebabnya ialah sebahagian pasangan muda yang berkahwin ingin berdikari sebelum mereka bersedia untuk membeli flat. Ini tidak begitu membimbangkan tetapi ada juga yang mengalami perubahan mendadak dalam keadaan keluarga atau kewangan mereka. Ada pula yang menghadapi cabaran-cabaran rumit hingga sukar untuk merancang bagi masa depan mereka.

Setiap tahun dengan bantuan Pemerintah sebahagian keluarga ini berjaya pindah dari flat sewa ke flat milik mereka sendiri. Memiliki flat HDB sendiri bukan setakat mempunyai tempat berteduh. Ia membantu warga kita membina masa depan yang cerah. Kita mesti tingkatkan kesedaran bahawa flat sewa hanyalah huraian sementara. Kita mesti galakkan keluarga-keluarga di flat sewa memantapkan pendapatan agar mereka boleh memiliki rumah sendiri dan maju seiring dengan masyarakat.

Dalam hal ini usaha-usaha di peringkat masyarakat sangat penting. Contohnya Projek DIAN@M³ bakal membantu lebih banyak keluarga Melayu/ Islam untuk memanfaatkan program sokongan Pemerintah dan menjadi pemilik rumah. Pemerintah akan memberikan sokongan penuh kepada mereka.

Saudara saudari di Singapura kita berusaha untuk membina sebuah masyarakat yang inklusif. Kuncinya pendidikan. Itulah sebabnya Pemerintah banyak melabur dalam bidang prasekolah dan pendidikan.

Tetapi kita mesti tumpukan perhatian kepada segolongan pelajar yang ketinggalan. Mungkin mereka kurang keyakinan diri dan dorongan. Kadangkala masalah keluarga menjejas prestasi mereka.

Menteri Maliki Osman menerajui UPLIFT pasukan bertindak yang menggandingkan agensi Pemerintah dengan rakan kerjasama di peringkat masyarakat. UPLIFT menyediakan bantuan awal dan berterusan bagi pelajar-pelajar kurang bernasib baik daripada semua kaum demi meningkatkan pencapaian pendidikan mereka.

Badan-badan Melayu/Islam dan rangkaian M³ juga bergiat aktif untuk saling melengkapi usaha-usaha ini.

Saya gembira melihat para pelajar meraih manfaat daripada program-program nasional dan masyarakat kita. Contohnya Siti bukan nama sebenar seorang graduan politeknik dan adik-adiknya. Oleh kerana pendapatan keluarga yang kecil mereka disokong beberapa agensi Pemerintah dan badan masyarakat sepanjang tempoh persekolahan mereka.

Misalnya mereka dimasukkan ke Pusat Jagaan Pelajar dengan subsidi ComCare. Program ini memupuk tabiat dan rutin harian yang baik. Siti sendiri menerima sokongan skim TTFS MENDAKI semasa di politeknik. Salah seorang adik Siti pula menerima sokongan akademik tambahan bagi Bahasa Inggeris dan Matematik melalui Program Tuisyen Kerjasama antara badan-badan bantu diri.

Tahun lalu ibu bapa mereka hilang pekerjaan ekoran COVID-19. AMP Singapura memberi bantuan tambahan untuk memenuhi keperluan pendidikan Siti dan adik-adiknya sementara ibu bapa mereka memantapkan pendapatan keluarga. Ibu bapa mereka juga dibimbing AMP untuk tingkatkan kemahiran yang membolehkan mereka berdikari semula.

Berkat sokongan padu dan menyeluruh daripada pelbagai pihak adik-adik Siti maju di sekolah. Bahkan mereka menerima beberapa biasiswa dan anugerah kerana cemerlang dari segi akademik dan perwatakan. Pengalaman Siti sekeluarga menunjukkan bahawa sekitaran penjagaan dan sokongan yang membina berjaya menghasilkan kesan yang besar dalam mutu kehidupan mereka.

Dengan membantu mereka yang pada mulanya ketinggalan kita menjayakan dasar meritokrasi dan maju bersama sebagai satu rakyat.

Dengan membantu mereka yang pada mulanya ketinggalan kita menjayakan dasar meritokrasi dan maju bersama sebagai satu rakyat. PM Lee Hsien Loong

Bangsa dan Agama

Dasar meritokrasi juga bergantung kepada perpaduan masyarakat majmuk kita.

Kita menikmati keharmonian kaum dan agama sejak merdeka. Kita bertolak ansur saling menghormati dan menyediakan ruang bagi semua masyarakat untuk hidup aman damai. Namun keseimbangan ini sangat rapuh. Lantas ia perlu dijaga dengan begitu teliti seperti kita menatang minyak yang penuh. Pada masa yang sama kita patut membuat penyesuaian sejajar dengan nilai-nilai yang berubah dari generasi ke generasi dan aspirasi pelbagai kumpulan yang semakin meningkat.

Salah satu penyesuaian sedemikian ialah soal pemakaian tudung oleh jururawat Muslim. Ini bukan isu baharu. Saya sendiri telah berbincang tentang perkara ini dengan pemimpin agama dan masyarakat. Mereka telah menerangkan dengan jelas mengapa pemakaian tudung penting kepada masyarakat Melayu/Islam. Mereka berharap Pemerintah akan mengubah peraturan untuk membenarkan para kakitangan beruniform memakai tudung.

Saya katakan kepada mereka “Saya faham hasrat anda. Saya hargai pandangan anda dan akur tentang aspirasi masyarakat Melayu/Islam. Tetapi saya juga berharap anda turut memahami pertimbangan dan keprihatinan nasional Pemerintah.”

Saya tekankan keprihatinan utama kami ialah keharmonian kaum. Pemerintah wajib memastikan bahawa sebarang perubahan kepada peraturan mengenai tudung harus merapatkan masyarakat Singapura yang berbilang kaum. Kita tidak mahu perubahan ini meluaskan jurang antara kaum dan melemahkan kita.

Bagi murid-murid sekolah dan para pegawai perkhidmatan awam beruniform termasuk SAF dan polis kami tidak dapat membenarkannya atas sebab-sebab yang sangat genting. Bagi para jururawat sebenarnya ada sebab-sebab yang munasabah di sebalik dasar Pemerintah. Namun pertimbangan untuk membenarkan atau tidak membenarkannya adalah agak seimbang. Dari semasa ke semasa keseimbangan baru boleh dibuat secara berhati-hati dan bertahap-tahap.

Beberapa bulan lalu saya memberitahu sekumpulan asatizah dan pemimpin masyarakat bahawa saya berharap dapat buat keputusan mengenai isu ini menjelang Rapat Umum Hari Kebangsaan. Harinya sudah tiba. Keputusan sudah diambil. Isu ini bukan hanya melibatkan masyarakat Melayu/Islam tetapi ada kepentingan nasional bagi masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama kita. Jadi saya akan jelaskan lebih lanjut dan membuat pengumuman rasmi dalam ucapan Bahasa Inggeris sebentar lagi.

Kesimpulan

Saudara-saudari sekalian masyarakat Melayu/Islam terus mencapai kemajuan yang membanggakan tahun demi tahun. Sedang kita mara ke hadapan sebagai sebuah masyarakat inklusif penting untuk kita memiliki kematangan antara kaum dan membuat penyesuaian demi keperluan satu sama lain. Sama penting ialah meningkatkan semangat saling membantu seperti sepanjang pandemik ini khususnya bagi golongan yang memerlukan.

Marilah kita bersatu padu saling membantu dan erat bermuafakat bagai aur dengan tebing. Dengan itu kita akan terus teguh makmur dan bersinar dan mencapai impian kita bersama sebagai satu rakyat satu bangsa satu Singapura!

Terima kasih.

Sedang kita mara ke hadapan sebagai sebuah masyarakat inklusif penting untuk kita memiliki kematangan antara kaum dan membuat penyesuaian demi keperluan satu sama lain. PM Lee Hsien Loong

English Translation of National Day Rally 2021 Malay Speech

COVID-19

It has been almost 2 years since COVID-19 affected our lives. Despite the challenges the strength of our collective spirit shone through.

Many activities and celebrations were affected because of COVID-19. Mosque attendance and Hari Raya visits had to be restricted. For the second year in a row Korban rituals at the mosques and Haj could not be carried out.

I am grateful for the community’s cooperation and forbearance. I also thank the Malay/Muslim community and mosque leaders as well as asatizah led by the Mufti for showing leadership and persuading the community to be vaccinated.

Now with more of us vaccinated we can gradually ease restrictions. And also allow larger numbers of congregants at the mosques.

Still we must do our utmost to vaccinate as many as possible of those not yet vaccinated. Especially the elderly who are most vulnerable. If you are a senior citizen please get vaccinated soon!

National and Community Efforts

I am glad to see the Malay/Muslim community rallying together caring for one another throughout the pandemic. This gotong royong and “can do” spirit have been key to the community’s progress over the years.

The latest Census 2020 shows the significant progress that the community has made over the past decade. More Malays across all age-groups are attaining higher qualifications. The proportion of Malay university graduates has doubled. The proportion of Malays working as PMETs has also increased. As a result Malay household incomes have gone up too. Well done!

Many more Malays are doing well. Like Aarman Yazeed. He works for Thermo Fisher Scientific one of the world’s largest medical device makers. Aarman joined Thermo Fisher after completing NS. Over the years he worked hard and constantly upskilled himself. He performed well and was promoted to become a manufacturing manager. Good employees like Aarman are one of the reasons Thermo Fisher decided to expand its facility to make vaccines here.

Another example is Samsiah Suliman Managing Director of Jumain Sataysfaction. Third generation running her family’s satay business which started with her grandfather selling satay as a hawker over 110 years ago. I met her recently. Samsiah told me that when she took over the business she saw its potential. She diversified her product range to include non-meat options such as mushroom satay. She successfully brought Singapore-style satay to the international stage. Now her company threads 80000 sticks of satay a day and exports to Hong Kong Canada and the Middle East.

I hope success stories like Samsiah and Aarman will inspire the community.

However Census 2020 also highlighted some worrying trends in home ownership and education.

Like other Singaporeans most Malay families own their own homes. Malay households in rental flats has increased. This is unfortunate. There are several reasons. For instance there are young married couples who want to live independently before they are ready to buy a flat. This is understandable. But there are some who may have suffered sudden changes in family or financial circumstances or be facing complex challenges and have difficulties planning for their future.

Every year with the Government’s help some of these households are able to buy their own homes and move out of rental flats. Home ownership is not merely about having a roof over your head. It is also for Singaporeans to secure a better future. Hence we must help more households in rented flats recognise that renting is only a temporary housing solution and to encourage them to stabilise their income so that they can move towards home ownership and progress with the rest of society.

Community efforts are important. Initiatives like Project DIAN@M³ help more Malay/Muslim households access Government support and progress towards home ownership. The Government will give them our full support.

In Singapore we strive to build an inclusive society. Education is key to this endeavour. That is why the Government invests heavily in preschool and education.

But we must also pay extra attention to students who are falling behind. They may be lacking self-confidence and motivation. Or sometimes family problems hinder them from doing well.

Minister Maliki Osman is leading UPLIFT a taskforce that brings together Government agencies and community partners. UPLIFT will provide early and sustained support for disadvantaged students of all races to improve their educational outcomes.

The Malay/Muslim Organisations and the M3 network are complementing this effort.

I am happy to see students benefitting from national and community programmes. Take for instance Siti (not her real name) a polytechnic graduate and her siblings. Coming from a low-income household they have been supported by various Government and community organisations throughout their schooling years.

For instance ComCare subsidised their fees at Student Care Centres where they developed daily routines and good habits. MENDAKI’s Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) supported Siti’s polytechnic education. Her younger brother received additional academic support for English and Mathematics through the Collaborative Tuition Programme (CTP) run by self-help groups.

Last year their parents lost their jobs due to COVID-19. AMP Singapore stepped in to provide additional support for the children’s schooling needs while their parents work towards stabilising their income. AMP is also helping their parents through upskilling programmes so that they can be self-reliant again.

With holistic support from various parties Siti’s siblings have thrived in school. They received bursaries and awards for good academic achievements and exemplary character. The experience of Siti and her family shows that the right care environment and support can make a big difference.

By helping those who are struggling we make meritocracy work for all of us and enable everyone to progress together as one nation.

Race and Religion

Meritocracy also depends on the strength of our diverse community.

We have enjoyed racial and religious harmony since independence. Through “give and take” with mutual respect and accommodation from all communities. This is a delicate balance. It therefore has to be carefully maintained like balancing a cup filled with oil (Malay proverb: seperti menatang minyak yang penuh). And at the same time make adjustments to keep up with changing values from generation to generation and aspirations of different groups.

One such adjustment is the wearing of the tudung by Muslim nurses. This is not a new issue. I previously discussed this with Malay/Muslim religious and community leaders. They explained why wearing the tudung was important to the community and hoped that the Government would change the rules to let officers in uniform wear the tudung.

I told them “I understand your hopes and wishes. I understand your views. I can empathise with the community’s aspirations. But I hope that you too can understand the Government’s national considerations.”

I said our main concern was to strengthen our racial harmony. The Government must make sure that any change to the rules would bring the different communities closer together and not divide us.

For students and other uniformed services including the SAF and Police we do not allow tudung to be worn for some crucial reasons. For nurses there were also valid reasons behind the Government’s policy; but the arguments for and against it are more finely balanced and over time a new balance could be carefully and incrementally struck.

A few months ago I told a group of asatizah and community leaders that I hoped to make a decision by National Day Rally. The day has come. The decision has been made. As this is not just a matter for the Malay/Muslim community but one of national interest that concerns our multi-racial and multi-religious society I will give further details and make the announcement later in the English speech.

Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen year after year the Malay/Muslim community has consistently made significant progress. As we progress as an inclusive society it is important to see a maturity in understanding between communities in making adjustments for one another. We must also help one another like what we are doing in fighting COVID-19 especially those who are falling behind.

Let us remain united help one another and be strong in consensus building like the interdependence between bamboo trees and riverbanks (Malay proverb: bagai aur dengan tebing). Only then will we continue to be indomitable prosperous we will shine and achieve our common aspirations together as one people one nation one Singapore!

This includes more Malays across all age-groups attaining higher qualifications

He noted however that there are still “worrying trends” in education as well as home ownership

While most Malay families own their own homes the proportion of Malay households in rental flats has increased

The Government will pay extra attention to students who are falling back in their studies

SINGAPORE — While the Malay community has made significant progress in the past decade there are still “worrying trends” among the Malay community here particularly in the areas of home ownership and education Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday (Aug 29) during his National Day Rally speech.

Pointing to the latest national census in 2020 Mr Lee said that while most Malay families own their own homes the proportion of Malay households in rental flats has increased.

While this could be due to young married couples wanting to live independently before they are ready to buy a flat this could also be attributed to those facing financial constraints.

“(There) are some who may have suffered sudden changes in family or financial circumstances or be facing complex challenges and have difficulties planning for their future” said Mr Lee who spoke first in Malay.

“Home ownership is not merely about having a roof over your head. It is also for Singaporeans to secure a better future.”

The 2020 national census data shows that the number of Malay households in one- and two-room rental Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats grew from about 9100 in 2010 to about 18600 last year.

At the same time the number of Chinese households in rental flats grew from 28000 to 28700 over the same period while this figure was 4600 to 6800 for Indian households.

Mr Lee said that while some Malay households have been able to move out of their rental flats to buy their own homes with the help of the Government more must be done to help households in rental flats.

This includes helping them recognise that renting is a temporary solution and encouraging them to stabilise their income to move towards home ownership and progress with the rest of society said Mr Lee who was speaking to a live audience at the Mediacorp studio at One-north as well as to 2000 participants over video-conferencing platform Zoom.

Mr Lee’s last National Day Rally speech was in 2019 with last year’s rally being cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This year’s rally was also postponed by a week from Aug 22 after stricter measures were imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus in Singapore last month.

Turning to the topic of education Mr Lee said that it is key to the Government’s endeavour of building an inclusive society.

The Government must also pay extra attention to students who are falling behind he said.

“They may be lacking self-confidence and motivation. Or sometimes family problems hinder them from doing well” said Mr Lee noting that a task force was set up to provide early and sustained support to disadvantaged students across all races to improve their educational outcomes.

Malay-Muslim organisations and the M3 network are complementing the efforts of this task force added Mr Lee.

The M3 network is a tie-up between self-help group Mendaki the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore and the People’s Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council.

Highlighting the example of polytechnic graduate Siti (not her real name) and her siblings who were supported by various government and community organisations including self-care group Mendaki throughout their schooling years Mr Lee said he was happy to see students benefiting from national and community programmes and eventually thriving in school.

“With holistic support from various parties Siti’s siblings have thrived in school. They received bursaries and awards for good academic achievements and exemplary character.

“The experience of Siti and her family shows that the right care environment and support can make a big difference” said Mr Lee.

MORE MALAYS WITH HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS

Mr Lee also highlighted the “significant progress” that the Malay community has made over the last decade noting that more Malays across all age groups are attaining higher qualifications.

The proportion of Malay university graduates has also doubled in this period.

In 2020 the proportion of those aged 25 and above who are university graduates stood at 10.8 per cent for Malays while this figure was 5.5 per cent in the 2010 census.

Mr Lee also noted that the proportion of Malays working as professionals managers executives and technicians has also increased.

“As a result Malay household incomes have gone up too” he said.

Mr Lee cited the example of Ms Samsiah Suliman the managing director of satay manufacturing company Jumain Sataysfaction as a Malay individual who is doing well.

Ms Samsiah who was present at the Mediacorp studio during Mr Lee’s speech expanded her family’s satay business by diversifying into non-meat options such as mushroom satay.

Mr Lee also spoke about Mr Aarman Yazeed an employee of medical device maker Thermo Fisher Scientific who joined the company after completing his National Service and worked his way up to become manufacturing manager.

“Good employees like Aarman are one of the reasons Thermo Fisher decided to expand its facility to make vaccines here” said Mr Lee.

“I hope success stories like Samsiah and Aarman will inspire the community.”",,,,,,,,,

U.S. retail spending has surged this year with brick-and-mortar chains driving the bulk of the industry's growth. Off-price retailers have been some of the biggest winners.

On Thursday Burlington Stores (BURL -0.31%) joined its two larger rivals -- TJX Companies and Ross Stores (ROST -0.99%) -- by reporting stellar second-quarter sales and a big earnings beat. Nevertheless Burlington stock plunged 9% following the earnings release. While the retailer does face near-term margin headwinds this pullback could be a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Another excellent quarter

Like many brick-and-mortar retailers Burlington Stores suffered during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close its stores and dented traffic after they reopened. However its business has come roaring back this year.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2021 comparable store sales surged 20% relative to fiscal 2019. Including the benefit of two years of store openings total sales rose 35%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to $2.59 as the strong demand environment boosted gross margin and enabled Burlington to spread its operating expenses over more sales.

Burlington's momentum continued in the second quarter. Comp sales jumped 19% driving a 34% increase in total sales compared to second-quarter 2019. Gross margin improved again helping Burlington post a 55% increase in operating income and a 43% increase in adjusted EPS versus two years ago.

The company's revenue of $2.21 billion comfortably beat the analyst consensus of $2.05 billion. Similarly its adjusted EPS of $1.94 crushed the average analyst estimate of $1.38. However even with these strong results Burlington stock failed to maintain its big year-to-date gains following the earnings release.

A cautious outlook spooked investors

During Burlington's recent earnings call management said it expects double-digit comp sales growth to continue in the second half of fiscal 2021. Nevertheless executives struck a cautious tone with respect to near-term profitability due to soaring freight and supply chain costs. This matched the downbeat earnings forecast Ross Stores provided a week earlier.

Indeed CFO John Crimmins estimated that if comp sales grow by 10% this quarter Burlington's operating margin would decrease by about 2.5 percentage points relative to 2019. This forecast likely contributed to Burlington stock's big decline on Thursday.

Of course if Burlington can sustain its first-half revenue growth rate for the rest of fiscal 2021 it might be able to absorb the current cost pressure while holding margins flat. However with the U.S. government starting to pull back on fiscal stimulus measures management expects sales growth to moderate in the months ahead.

Big upside offsets high valuation

Even after Burlington stock's recent pullback the shares trade for about 30 times forward earnings. That compares to 22 times forward earnings for Ross Stores. Indeed Burlington shares have consistently carried a higher valuation than other major off-price retailers in recent years.

However Burlington has more long-term upside than its larger more established peers. First it has massive expansion potential. The company sees room to eventually operate 2000 stores in the U.S. up from just 792 at the end of last quarter. That would represent a 153% increase. By contrast Ross Stores' long-term target of 3000 locations implies room to increase its store count by only 58% over time.

Second Burlington has meaningful margin expansion potential. In fiscal 2019 it recorded a 9.3% adjusted operating margin compared to Ross Stores' 13.4% operating margin during the same period. Management has developed a clear plan to close that gap by shifting the store base toward smaller stores with higher sales per square foot and faster inventory turnover.

Burlington stock remains quite pricey to be sure. But between its existing track record of success its expansion potential and management's plans to boost its operating margin it holds plenty of promise for patient investors. That makes the recent pullback look like an enticing buying opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

FORT WORTH Texas – Eli Vastbinder had just crawled down upon Chiseled in the bucking chutes during Round 5 of the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Iron Cowboy presented by Ariat when his body decided it wanted to quit on him.

Chiseled had lunged forward inside the bucking chutes and Vastbinder could feel the muscles in his riding arm cramping up.

Vastbinder was dripping sweat minutes earlier after the 30-year-old already had ridden four of the five bulls he had climbed upon during Championship Sunday – two more than expected because of two re-ride options that he converted into qualified rides.

Back inside the bucking chutes at Dickies Arena Vastbinder tried to recompose himself as Chiseled began to settle down. He wiggled his riding hand in an attempt to work the cramps out. The sleeve of his tan shirt had melted into two different shades a dedicated mixture of grit toughness sweat and mud.

Vastbinder had already become a fan favorite at the final PBR Major of the season thanks to his determination all weekend long.

The crowd in Dickies Arena and Vastbinder’s fellow riders erupted in Round 4 when he rode Zorro for 87.5 points to advance to the final round and they also saluted him despite his shortcomings in Round 5.



The Statesville North Carolina bull rider’s weekend came to a heartbreaking end when Chiseled bucked him off in 7.06 seconds. Paulo Lima rode Woopaa for 95.25 points to steal the Iron Cowboy title out of Vastbinder’s battle-tested hands in the winner-take-all Round 5.

Vastbinder attempted six bulls in less than 24 hours in Fort Worth the equivalent of competing at the five-day PBR World Finals.

“I was pretty tired” Vastbinder admitted in the locker room with a fresh plaid shirt on. “I didn’t really realize it until I got down in the bucking chutes and I was taking my wrap and (Chiseled) was kind of moving around and I was trying to hold onto my rope and my muscles were just tightening up and aching pouring sweat.

“Dickies Arena needs some AC.”

Vastbinder’s career-best second-place finish earned him $25344.28 and 116 world points. He also rode four bulls in one event for the first time.

The performance also put Vastbinder well on his way to his first PBR World Finals as he jumped up to No. 22 in the world standings after beginning the event at No. 31.

“It’s always good when you stay on some bulls and win some money win second” Vastbinder said with pride but also with a hint of disappointment in his voice. “But I really had that pictured going a lot different. I’ve been on that bull two other times. I was 86 on him one time when he was a calf (in 2018 in Caldwell Idaho) and then he bucked me off in San Antonio at the rodeo at 6 seconds. Then he got me again here today so I definitely owe him.

“I’ll definitely be picking him the next chance I get.”

Vastbinder first rode Juju for a career-high 89.5 points in Round 1 on Saturday. He then advanced to the eight-rider Round 3 by converting on his re-ride @PBR on TikTok for 87.75 points in Round 2. He qualified for the four-rider Round 4 by converting on another re-ride Oreo for 89 points in Round 3.

Vastbinder’s 4-for-5 performance also moved him up to No. 6 in the Rookie of the Year race.

Rookie Standings

1. Chase Dougherty (478.5 points)*

2. Rafael Henrique dos Santos (-25 points)*

3. Junior Patrik Souza (-81.5 points)

4. Jesse Petri (-123.42 points)

5. Colten Fritzlan (-139 points)*

6. Eli Vastbinder (-189 points)

*Currently out of competition because of injury

Vastbinder trails injured ROY leader Chase Dougherty by 189 points heading into next weeks’ PBR Air Force Reserve Cowboys for a Cause team competition on the USS Lexington in Corpus Christi Texas.

“If I win it I win it” Vastbinder concluded. “Jesse Petri and Chase Dougherty Austin Richardson – there’s a lot of really good guys in there that have been going really hard all year. My goal is just to stay on as many bulls as I can win as much as I can. If that means I’m Rookie of the Year winning the world all I can do is just stay on.”

South of San Luis Ronda Lobato raced the rising floodwaters in San Francisco Creek every spring to fill sandbags that protected her grandparents’ farm.

North of Center potato farmer Sheldon Rockey faced so much spring mud that he had to learn to extract his stuck tractor.

Outside Monte Vista Tyler Mitchell needed only a hand shovel on the family farm near Monte Vista to reach shallow underground flows in the Valley’s once-abundant water table.

Today those tales of plentiful water seem like a distant mirage. Ten of the past 11 years have delivered below-average snowpacks for the upper Rio Grande basin with this year’s snowpack measuring just 58% of normal at the key May 1 measurement. All but one of the main local reservoirs were less than half-filled.

Farmers face significant cutbacks from wells now and likely from river flows and irrigation ditches later this season.

Against this stark backdrop of drought three other vast changes loom.

The biggest is a state court judgment that came after decades of excessive well pumping by valley farmers and ranchers. Local irrigators now must restore 400000 acre feet of water – more than 1.3 million people in metro Denver use in an entire year – to Valley groundwater systems within 10 years.

A second challenge is a plan by former Gov. Bill Owens and a metro Denver business group to pump and divert additional deep groundwater from the San Luis Valley to new buyers outside the San Luis Valley likely on the Colorado Front Range.

And the third long-term issue is a forecast for flows to be reduced even further perhaps as much as 30% because of climate change according to Colorado’s Rio Grande Implementation Plan.

Buffeted by drought court orders climate change and Front Range diversion plans the water supply of the San Luis Valley faces pressure as never before.

Shortages loom. Cuts seem inevitable.

“Our demand for water has far exceeded our supply for years and now our supply is in a 20-year downward trend” said state Sen. Cleave Simpson general manager of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District. “We keep facing drought after drought. The sense of urgency continues to build.”

It all threatens the way of life for the 46000 residents of the San Luis Valley where agriculture is the driving economic force. Farming and ranching account for $340 million of sales each year while providing 18% of the region’s jobs. That puts agriculture behind only the government as a source of local employment. About one of every three dollars of basic income in the San Luis Valley comes from agriculture.

The San Luis Valley is the nation’s No. 5 producer of potatoes – behind only the states of Idaho Washington Wisconsin and Oregon – and a leading supplier of quinoa and alfalfa hay. (The Colorado Potato Administrative Committee says the San Luis Valley is the No. 2 producer in the U.S. for fresh potatoes.)

In a region long beset with poverty – one of every four Valley residents is impoverished nearly double the statewide rate – farming and ranching have offered one economic success story. In Saguache County the annual net income or profit per farm was $113000 says the US Department of Agriculture census. Net income per farm in Rio Grande County was $105000.

But all those jobs all that money hinge on one thing: an ample and dependable water supply.

“The climate of the San Luis Valley is arid and a successful agricultural economy would not be possible without irrigation” says the U.S. Geological Survey.

Average annual precipitation on the Valley floor is 7 to 10 inches but potatoes for example need an additional 14 to 17 inches of irrigation water during the growing season. Alfalfa hay the Valley’s top crop by acreage requires up to 24 inches for a crop.

This adds up to an enormous thirst. According to state water engineers San Luis Valley agriculture accounts for 810000 acre feet of consumptive water use per year.

By contrast Denver Water needs only 247000 acre feet of water to supply the 1.3 million people within its city and suburban service boundaries.

In other words metro Denver requires only one third as much water as the San Luis Valley to produce a gross domestic product 60 times greater – a $202 billion annual economy vs. a $3.3 billion economy.

Because the San Luis Valley has so much water being put to comparatively low economic use metro Denver water developers continue to focus a covetous eye on Rio Grande diversions.

After the AWDI proposals of the 1980s and the Gary Boyce plan of the 1990s the Gov. Bill Owens-backed Renewable Water Resources proposal is the latest push to take advantage of relatively low prices to pipe water out of the San Luis Valley.

In the crosshairs is one of the oldest agricultural traditions and cultures in Colorado.

The first surface water right in Colorado appropriated in 1852 is the People’s Ditch near San Luis. With a series of community irrigation canals called acequias Hispanic settlers soon started growing food in the high desert with water from the Conejos Rio Grande Alamosa Culebra San Luis Saguache Carnero and Trinchera among other rivers and creeks.

By the 1870s as much as 50000 acres in the San Luis Valley was irrigated. After the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad that number soared to 400000 acres by the 1880s. By 1900 demand for water in several valley streams already outstripped the natural supply.

Farmers responded by building reservoirs and especially digging wells. By the time of World War I the San Luis Valley was home to at least 5000 groundwater wells. The rush was on. Underground supplies seemed endless.

Until they weren’t. In 1972 Colorado water officials ordered a moratorium on construction of new wells in most of the valley and then ended new appropriations of groundwater in the rest of the valley in 1981 which was one of the worst snowpack years on record with just 11% of normal on May 1.

Luckily that one terrible year of drought in 1981 was followed by six successive years of some of the best snowpacks in the recorded history of the Rio Grande Basin. From 1982-1987 few worried much about groundwater because the rivers were flooding.

Another run of giant snowpacks in the mid-1990s helped to keep the pressure off groundwater pumping – while helping to build the memories of valley residents like Ronda Lobato Sheldon Rockey and Tyler Mitchell.

A battle over water exports: Plan to pipe water to Front Range

has big backers few specifics



Q&A with Renewable Water Resources: The Citizen requested a sit-down interview and was asked to email questions.

“I remember the snowbanks being bigger than me – the winters were so long and cold” said Lobato whose aunt and uncle lived along San Francisco Creek. “When the runoff came we had to fill sandbags to protect against flooding. Today there is no water in San Francisco Creek. It doesn’t run at all.”

Farming is never easy but water shortages make it even tougher said Tyler Mitchell.

“I remember as a kid being able to dig with a shovel to find water. Now I might have to go 30 feet to find it” said Mitchell whose family runs 18 center pivot irrigation rigs. “The ditch water used to go all summer long. Now we’re lucky to get one month and some ditches do only a few weeks. We don’t have enough surface water to grow cash-value crops every year.”

The mid-1990s were the heyday of San Luis Valley agriculture said potato grower Sheldon Rockey and that era changed the way of thinking for a generation of farmers.

“I remember when the river flooded three years in a row. I got the tractor stuck in the mud” Rockey said. “There was a lot of money made without worrying much about water. The issue with the older crowd of farmers is that they were so successful for so long. Now that we’re in drought it’s hard to change your thinking.”

The bountiful water years of the 1980s and 1990s in the San Luis Valley have flipped the typical generational divide in farming. Because they lived through the wettest times the older farmers tend to have a brighter view than the younger farmers local agricultural officials say.

“Farming is an optimistic profession” said Heather Dutton manager of the San Luis Valley Water Conservancy District and Rio Grande Basin representative on the Colorado Water Conservation Board. “People my father’s age have seen farming here at its best when we had giant years for water. But the data and science don’t give me many reasons to think those days will come back around.

“If the big water years do come back that would be tremendous. But I don’t want us to ignore the freight train coming at us right now.”

That train began blasting its horn about 20 years ago.

State water engineers long had been concerned about well-pumping by valley irrigators but the connection between groundwater and surface water was not clearly understood. Starting in January 1976 engineers began monitoring the level of valley aquifers. Groundwater declined steadily but gradually which led to the state moratoriums on drilling.

However 2002 was the driest on record for the Rio Grande Basin with a May snowpack of just 6%. With little available surface water valley irrigators turned underground for supplies.

The result: In just one year engineers recorded a 400000 acre foot drop in Valley aquifers. That is a huge amount of water – a single acre-foot is enough to support two families of four people for a year.

In response to the vast agricultural overpumping came a flurry of laws regulations and court actions.

For the past decade valley irrigators have been under a court order to maintain a sustainable aquifer system. That means restoring at least 400000 acre feet to underground supplies officials say. (Engineering studies say the unconfined aquifer actually has been drained by as much as 1 million acre-feet since 1976.)

Little progress has been made to return that water in the past 10 years. Now irrigators face a 2031 deadline to repay the water debt.

Still 5000 irrigation wells continue to pump in the valley including 3000 in the key Subdistrict 1 north of Monte Vista and west of Hooper.

The $426000 state Rio Grande Implementation Plan was blunt: “Because the sustained and lingering drought since 2002 has not been matched with a decline in agricultural consumptive use use of the aquifers is unsustainable.”

What local water officials now fear is a replay in the San Luis Valley of what happened to irrigators on the South Platte River where years of over-pumping by farmers combined with a resulting state court order led to the 2006 shutdown of 440 wells and the pumping curtailment of hundreds of others.

In the San Luis Valley the clock is ticking. A reckoning awaits.

“Shutting down wells – there are people here who can’t survive that” said Simpson the state senator. “We are 10 years into this plan to create and maintain a sustainable aquifer system but we are not yet back to where we started. There are no easy solutions.”

Scientists say it won’t get any easier. Because of climate change a study by the Bureau of Reclamation Sandia National Laboratories and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forecasts even more challenges for water users in the Upper Rio Grande Basin:

Flows will decrease by 33% by 2100 at the Rio Grande near Del Norte Conejos River near Mogote Los Pinos River near Ortiz and San Antonio River at Ortiz. Flows will decrease by 50% at the Rio Grande near Lobatos.

Peak river flows will come earlier shifting from June to May.

Fewer water rights will be served. From 1950 to 1999 the average junior-most water right to be served in June on the Rio Grande was a 1910 priority but by 2100 it will be an 1890 priority.

“We are an incredible agricultural community but we don’t have the water supply we used to” said Dutton the Rio Grande representative on the Colorado Water Conservation Board. “There are more people who want water than there is water available. We are facing scarcity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbGVhZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzE1MDk4MDgvbG9vay1iYWNrLXR3by1pbm1hdGVzLWVzY2FwZWQtZnJvbS1zY2ktZGFsbGFzLWluLTE5OTnSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc2xlYWRlci5jb20vbmV3cy8xNTA5ODA4L2xvb2stYmFjay10d28taW5tYXRlcy1lc2NhcGVkLWZyb20tc2NpLWRhbGxhcy1pbi0xOTk5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Look Back: Two inmates escaped from SCI-Dallas in 1999,"🔊 Listen to this

Several hours after sunrise on Aug. 16 1999 officials inside the State Correctional Institution at Dallas in Jackson Township discovered two inmates – Michael McCloskey and Anthony W. Yang – had escaped.

A 20-mile perimeter was set up by state police as law enforcement searched vehicles and tractor-trailers traveling on major roadways in the Back Mountain and Sweet Valley. Homeowners were strongly encouraged to remain inside and lock their doors.

Barns and garages were searched. Two state police helicopters flew over the area for hours.

“Authorities would not say how the men escaped from the 1800 inmate prison which is surrounded by two fences topped with razor wire” the Times Leader reported Aug. 17 1999 a day after the escape.

Officials at the prison during a news conference released photographs of McCloskey and Yang but said little about the escape.

It was later learned McCloskey and Yang withheld eating in order to lose weight and get skinnier to squeeze themselves between cell bars they cut with a makeshift tool. They took advantage of a process not practiced at the prison where corrections officers used a hammer to bang the bars.

After McCloskey and Yang wiggled themselves out of their cell window they used a ladder they assembled using wood clothing bedding and electrical cords to scale the razor wire fences near an unmanned tower. The tower was manned during daylight hours when inmates were in the yard but unmanned at night.

McCloskey and Yang waited as vehicle patrols passed until they made their dash to woods that once encircled the facility.

State officials in Harrisburg were quick to point fingers while the union representing corrections officers blamed the state for budgetary cutbacks that demanned the towers.

Canines from the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facility picked up the scents of McCloskey and Yang leading them to the Susquehanna River.

“VA K9 Unit dogs Kena a 5-year-old German shepherd and Elmer a 3-year-old bloodhound did the tracking throughout the week. Magnum a 7-year-old German shepherd trained in apprehension searches and narcotics and explosives detection was along to grab the men if they tried to run” the Times Leader reported Aug. 25 1999.

Those on the hunt for McCloskey and Yang with help from the canines were led to Hanover Township where Yang attempted to carjack an elderly woman in a parking lot where Tractor Supply is located today. Gerrity’s Supermarket was once located in the building.

“Elmer tracked McCloskey and Yang from behind Gerrity’s to the Sans Souci Parkway through about four miles of woods” the Times Leader reported.

Once the dogs gave the army of state and local police officers a direction searchers took over.

McCloskey and Yang knew their freedom was about to end.

The two fugitives jumped into the Susquehanna River off Sans Souci where they were captured.

“Both men were clad in long underwear and treading water in the Susquehanna River when they were located at about 6:45 p.m. by a state police helicopter hovering over more than 100 officers who combed a wooded area along the Sans Souci Parkway in Hanover Township” the Times Leader reported Aug. 20 1999 a day after the capture.

McCloskey and Yang were staying under a tree about 100 feet in woods behind Gerrity’s. Searchers found a large cache of doughnuts the inmates had apparently obtained from the trash bin of the supermarket or nearby restaurants.

Following the capture state legislative hearings were held on the Penn State Wilkes-Barre campus to learn how the two inmates escape. Security enhancements were made at SCI-Dallas to include more and upgraded surveillance cameras new fencing and thousands of trees were removed."

Lufthansa has recently fallen on hard times like many other airlines which took a hit in the wake of the pandemic. The airline reportedly has been carrying around 50 percent of the passengers it had been in 2019 before the pandemic hit.

The airline has also been flying to around 88 percent of pre-pandemic destinations.

Christina Foerster Lufthansa board member for Customer IT & Corporate Responsibility said Lufthansa would be adding a new midday flight for routes that have become especially popular.

“Daily frequencies will increase on many connections” she told the Funke media group on Sunday. “This is important for business travelers who want to fly there and back on the same day.”

Foerster also reportedly said there would also be new menus which combine German cuisine with international influences Reuters writes which will be introduced as of Sept. 1.

In March Lufthansa made another overture to fliers by expanding the “pay as you fly” program and letting it apply to its subsidiaries Swiss Austrian and Brussels Airlines.

“Pay as you Fly” is a B2B affiliated program that works with business travelers and has been available for years — it’s not a new program. The program was aimed at larger customers and was not worthwhile just for them so the company is now broadening it to apply to the cheaper classes.

The company said the program also now encompasses current Flex tariff offers including the use of the fast lane and preferential booking.

But European flights on the contrary have been rebounding back from the effects of the pandemic thus far. Flights as of mid-August were 27 percent down from the same week in 2019 which was the smallest change since March 2020.

After a yearlong restoration to an existing building Brinkwaters Hotel held an open house last week to spotlight the business which will rely heavily on the town’s tourism population.

“I think Damascus is on the verge of a small-town renaissance — bringing economic vitality back to the rural town” said Trey Waters who along with business partners Eric and Emily Brinker of Blowing Rock North Carolina has refashioned a former business site into a 13-room lodging facility. The new business will cater to outdoor enthusiasts who are attracted to what the Damascus area has to offer.

Waters believes Damascus is a prime location for their new business because of its proximity to the Virginia Creeper and Appalachian trails.

“People come to Damascus and stay one night. They ride the Creeper Trail and go home. We’re trying to create the opportunity for two- or three-day stays.

“I’ve often heard that people come and enjoy Damascus and then go stay in Abingdon because we’re at capacity in town. Our business was an attractive opportunity to turn space into a nightly rental program” said Waters.

Local business owners and residents believe the new lodging facility will be an asset to the town.

“The open house was amazing” said Susan Coleman who along with her husband John Coleman owns Discover Damascus an innovative tourism gift shop in downtown Damascus. “The spacious rooms are beautiful and well designed and they’ve even thought about the kiddos with a loft in many of the rooms.”

John Coleman added “I think it’s a tremendous asset to our Damascus town to have a wonderfully furnished modern facility for folks to stay over and enjoy the amenities of Southwest Virginia.”

Damascus resident Richard Smith said “The quality of accommodations here is equal to or better than some of the finest boutique hotels I’ve seen in other places. It’s definitely a place for upscale travelers who want to stay in a small country town.”

Real estate career

Waters’ attraction to Damascus came at an early age.

Growing up in Bristol Waters and his brother often visited family members in Damascus where they rode horses on the Creeper Trail and played in the creeks.

After graduating from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences at Campbell University in North Carolina Waters worked as a pharmacist in North Carolina where he grew to prefer the business side of his pharmacy career. Throughout the years he purchased as many as 17 pharmacies two of which he continues to own.

In 2005 he purchased the Damascus building that at the time housed Laurel Family Pharmacy. Waters said he planned to one day return to Damascus and be the town pharmacist.

As it turns out the pharmacy relocated in town and there were other tenants to follow before Waters decided to turn it into the short-stay lodging.

‘Thoughtfully designed’

The short-stay lodge is thoughtfully designed recognizing the surrounding natural world.

The facility has an industrial modern décor featuring polished concrete floors cinderblock interior walls exposed rafters and exposed ductwork. Retro-style kitchen appliances offer a vintage feel he said.

“We used earth tones to represent the blue in the water the green foliage and the orange seen in the fall foliage” said Waters.

Four types of rooms are available for rent with some of them featuring two queen beds and others designed as studios with king beds and full kitchens.

The facility will operate as a touchless system allowing customers to use booking sites including Vacation Rentals by Owner (VRBO) Airbnb and Trip Advisor platforms all of which are companies that operate online marketplaces for lodging rentals.

“You can stay without having to interface with a person” said Waters. “A code sent to the customer opens the front door and room door and stays live during the period stay.”

Managers Anya and Hunter Faust of Damascus are available to help with bookings and guest experiences.

The couple owns the property management company Experience Damascus. “Brinkwaters is our largest client and we can’t be more excited for the opportunity to manage it” said the wife.

Before he became one of the fan favorites of the Atlanta Braves as a player and now as a television analyst Francoeur was a Clemson recruit. And not just any recruit. He was one of the top safety prospects in the country coming out of Parkview High School in 2002.

But now almost two decades later Francoeur’s connection to Clemson remains even stronger than it was when he was committed to play for the Tigers before being drafted No. 9 overall by the Braves in the 2002 MLB Draft.

He still has a relationship with former Clemson head coach Tommy Bowden. He is tight with both Dabo Swinney and his brother Tracy and one of his closest high school friends is Clemson Deputy Athletic Director Graham Neff.

“I am happy he is up there and for me it is great to have these people that you still know and talk to” Francoeur said to The Clemson Insider at Truist Park on Saturday.

Years ago when Dabo Swinney was just beginning his tenure at Clemson Francoeur would give Swinney and his sons tickets to Braves’ games.

“He is great. Him and his brother I text Tracy all the time. He is a beauty” Francoeur said. “They know I love to be a part (of Clemson). I am just a big fan and it is fun. They enjoy having people support the program that are outside that area. Outside Anderson and Greenville you know people around the area.

“So whenever Dabo comes in recruiting and stuff every once in a while he will stop by go to lunch or do something so I am always happy for hm. He has done a great job and I love what he stands for up there. So for me it is a perfect fit.”

Francoeur says he still talks to Bowden too. He says they talk quite a bit and he and his wife usually go out to dinner with the Bowdens at least once a year when they are in Florida.

“I have always stayed in close contact with them. Tommy is awesome man. Tommy is a lot of the reason why I chose Clemson” Francoeur said.

Jack Leggett was the other reason. The former Brave said he had a great relationship with Clemson’s former Hall of Fame baseball coach.

His relationship with Bowden crew stronger when he bought a house alongside him in Florida.

“Me and Tommy became next door neighbors down there. So we always kind of saw each other whenever he would come down for the season” Francoeur recalled. “Of course when he resigned and that whole ordeal we saw him full-time.

“I just became a Clemson fan. I loved the University and everything about it.”

Football season has finally arrived.

The vast majority of those players didn’t stick around but a 22-year-old right-hander who overcame some brutal outings to show off all his immense potential did.

Two years after holding an eventual 97-win Braves team to one run in the best start of his major league career Logan Webb returned to Atlanta as the Giants’ emerging ace and proved that performance was not a fluke.

With seven scoreless innings against a first-place Braves team on Saturday Webb led the Giants (84-45) to a 5-0 win –the team’s 15th shutout victory– as he put the finishing touches on a National League Pitcher of the Month campaign.

Tommy La Stella hit a first-inning home run Mike Yastrzemski launched his team leading 21st homer and added a RBI double but when Webb pitches the spotlight tends to belong to him.

Saturday was no different.

When Webb last pitched at Truist Park in 2019 he was a rookie with a 6.51 ERA who appeared mostly overwhelmed in his brief stint in the big leagues. The right-hander was a work in progress at the time but the first quality start of his career gave the Giants an indication he possessed the mentality and what Bochy termed the “equipment” (often referred to as “stuff”) to succeed in the major leagues.

With his seventh consecutive quality start for a Giants club that’s streaking toward the postseason Webb may have a new “best start of his major league career” and San Francisco has a starter no opposing lineup wants to see right now.

“That was a special moment for me in ’19” Webb said. “And I was just happy I didn’t get to pitch the day game again.”

With his 13th consecutive start allowing two runs or fewer Webb lowered his season ERA to 2.65 and now holds the longest such streak for a Giants pitcher since Ferdie Schoop held opponents to two runs or fewer in 16 straight starts for the New York Giants from 1916-1917.

The Giants won for the 12th time in Webb’s last 13 games and much of Saturday’s success can be attributed to Webb’s work in the middle innings.

The right-hander shouldn’t have been in a sixth-inning jam but third baseman Wilmer Flores did him no favors early in the frame. After Freddie Freeman hit a groundball up the middle that tipped off Webb’s glove a shifted Flores failed to charge the ball and his throw to first was too late to retire the reigning National League MVP.

The Giants starter picked up his teammate by inducing a potential 5-4-3 double play ball off the bat of the next hitter Austin Riley but Flores’ throw to La Stella at second base was wide and sailed into right field. With runners at the corners and no one out Webb was at his best as he retired Dansby Swanson on a weak popup to shallow center field before catcher Travis d’Arnaud bounced into an inning-ending 6-4-3 double play.

After the inning Flores and Webb embraced in the dugout.

“He was the first person I wanted to see in the dugout and I think he was feeling the same way” Webb said. “Honestly it was my fault on the first one. I went for the ball I knew where he was playing and when I pulled away it went off my glove. So I apologized for that one and he apologized for that one and said ‘Thanks for picking me up.’ Flo is my guy.”

Flores felt the same way.

“I just told him ‘Way to pick me up’ he did a great job in that inning” Flores said. “You can just see it out there he’s tough and he’s just great.”

The sequence highlighted all the progress Webb has made in his young career as he’s matured from a pitcher who was rattled by the slightest bit of bad luck to an ace who can pitch around defensive miscues and bad bounces.

The Braves put pressure on Webb early as Atlanta advanced runners into scoring position in the first and third innings but the youngest player on the Giants roster didn’t crack. Despite throwing 59 pitches through just three innings Webb was able to work deeper into Saturday’s game thanks in large part to a three-pitch fourth inning.

After hitting Braves catcher Travis d’Arnaud on the elbow with the first pitch of the frame he got Adam Duvall to ground into a 4-6-3 double play before Braves center fielder Joc Pederson flew out to left fielder Alex Dickerson to end the inning.

According to Baseball Almanac Webb joined Jon Gray of the Rockies Phil Bickford of the Dodgers and Tyler Gilbert of the Diamondbacks as the only other major leaguers with three-pitch innings in 2021. Webb’s was also the first thrown by a Giant since Madison Bumgarner retired the Padres on three pitches in the third inning of a 3-2 San Francisco win on August 14 2010.

Webb pitched with a lead from the moment he took the mound as La Stella hit a line drive into the right field seats off Braves starter Huascar Ynoa in the first inning. The Giants added on again in the third when Webb doubled and scored on a La Stella sacrifice fly but didn’t take a comfortable lead until the eighth when first baseman Darin Ruf and Yastrzemski each drove in runs with two-out hits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21sYi9nYW1lL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTIyODk5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants 5-0 Braves (Aug 28 2021) Final Score,"MLB 2024: What to make of Braves Mets Phillies in NL East

Adam Duvall also homered for the Braves.

A.J. Minter (2-4) pitched a scoreless seventh for the win. Losing pitcher Tony Watson (5-4) allowed three hits a walk and three earned runs.

In Seattle Edward Olivares hit a two-run home run in the 12th inning while Salvador Perez hit a grand slam in a second straight game as the Kansas City Royals beat the Seattle Mariners 8-7.

Olivares gave the Royals a chance to win twice after being called up driving in the go-ahead run in the top of the 10th with a sacrifice fly before Luis Torrens drove in the tying run in the bottom of the inning.

“You just never know who’s going to be the hero” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “He didn’t even start the game.”

Perez became the 25th player in major-league history to hit grand slams in back-to-back games when he launched one in the fourth inning tying the game at 5-5.

It was the third straight game with a grand slam for the Royals who are one shy of tying the major-league record set by the San Diego Padres last year.

Four other teams have hit slams in three straight games since 1895.

Perez has hit six home runs in the eight games on the team’s current road trip bringing his season total to 36. The Royals have won six of those games. His tally of 15 home runs since the All-Star break leads the American League.

“He’s in a unique space doing what he’s able to do on both sides of the ball” Matheny said of the catcher.

Carlos Hernandez took over for starter Kris Bubic with an out in the fifth inning. He held the Mariners hitless retiring 14 straight batters in regulation to keep the game tied.

“They really flipped the script on us” Mariners manager Scott Servais said adding of Hernandez: “He just absolutely slammed the door on us.”

Hernandez pitched the 10th giving up his first hit to Abraham Toro. The infield single moved designated runner Kyle Seager to third and he scored on Torrens’ deep sacrifice fly to the warning track in left making it 6-6.

Hernandez finished with six strikeouts and no walks in 5-2/3 innngs.

“They gave me the heads up that I was going to be the emergency guy and I was ready” Hernandez said.

Josh Staumont (3-2) gave up a run in the 12th but earned the win with 1-1/3 innings pitched and two strikeouts after being activated from the injured list earlier in the day.

Yohan Ramirez (0-2) picked up the loss after allowing Olivares’ fifth homer of the season.

Kansas City have 34 come-from-behind wins this season.

The Mariners loaded the bases to start the first and second innings on the way to a 5-1 lead.

Toro drew a bases-loaded walk — the Mariners’ 19th of the season — off starter Kris Bubic to begin the scoring for Seattle.

Torrens had a two-run double in the first and drove in another run in the second. He finished with four RBIs.

The Royals used three hits in the fourth inning to load the bases against starter Logan Gilbert setting up Perez’s fifth career slam — tied for second-most in Royals history behind Frank White’s six.

TSN,Tyson Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXVnLzI5L2l0cy1nb2luZy10by1kby1ub3RoaW5nLWJ1dC1nby11cC1tZWQtc2Nob29sLWpldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's going to do nothing but go up': Med school jets housing expected to increase Fort Smith population over decade ...,"FORT SMITH -- The city is no longer second-largest in the Arkansas but leaders believe it's primed to grow much faster over the next decade.

Fort Smith grew from 86209 to 89142 between 2010 and 2020 but lost its place as second-largest to Fayetteville according to decennial census results. Fayetteville's population according to the 2020 count is 93949.

While Fort Smith's growth is modest compared to other cities leaders and developers believe a more prominent sudden population jump is possible due to initiatives such as Arkansas Colleges of Health Education's health and wellness research center and fighter jets set to relocate at Ebbing Air National Guard Base.

The census every 10 years determines how federal money is appropriated to communities throughout the United States. These dollars can go to schools hospitals roads and public works according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

While the Fort Smith grew 3.4% it fell to third behind Fayetteville the southernmost large city in Northwest Arkansas and home to the University of Arkansas. Northwest Arkansas is home to Walmart Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport -- three of the country's largest companies.

Fort Smith's county Sebastian didn't grow as much as other parts of the state either. Sebastian County grew 1.6% while Benton and Washington counties in Northwest Arkansas grew 28.5% and 21.1%. In central Arkansas Saline County grew 15.2% while Craighead County in the northeast part of the state grew 15.3% data shows. Saline County is part of the greater Little Rock area while Craighead County holds Jonesboro home of Arkansas State University.

Mayor George McGill said he puts an asterisk next to the city's 2020 census because of how the social restrictions in place to prevent the spread of covid-19 might have affected the process. He believes Fort Smith's population should be closer to 95000.

""At this point what we're doing is just gather the information and do an honest assessment of what we should do moving forward"" McGill said.

Despite the drop to third some say the city's comparatively modest growth is cause for optimism. State Rep. Justin Boyd R-Fort Smith said the numbers show resilience from the 2012 closing of the city's Whirlpool plant. At its peak in 2005 the appliance plant employed 4500. It eliminated more than 1000 jobs with its closing.

In the past decade the city has added thousands of homes in the Chaffee Crossing area. Engineered material manufacturer Glatfelter opened one of its production plants in that area. And The Unexpected arts festival has helped renew interest in downtown Fort Smith.

""They've arrested their decline which is step one"" said Mervin Jebaraj director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas' Sam M. Walton College of Business.

Rod Coleman chairman of ERC Holdings noted the limited amount of land for development in the city could be partially responsible for the more modest growth. He said housing in Chaffee Crossing the fastest-growing part of town wasn't built until recent years.

Coleman also noted growth in nearby Greenwood just south of Fort Smith. The town grew from 8952 to 9516 in the last decade census data shows. All other towns of more than 1000 people in Sebastian and Crawford counties -- where Fort Smith and Van Buren are -- also gained population according to the census.

But within the city leaders and developers point to Arkansas Colleges of Health Education as a current driving factor for growth and development. The school broke ground in 2015 and now has a college of osteopathic medicine and offers a master's degree in biomedicine and occupational and physical therapy programs. It's set to have a health and wellness research program following a $32.3 million grant.

Leaders also point to the selection of Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Fort Smith as the preferred location for up to 36 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. The initiative is expected to bring more than 800 pilots support workers and dependants to the area according to military estimates.

McGill said ""things are just now starting to fall in place"" in Fort Smith that will drive population upward.

Fighter jets med school and Chaffee Crossing

Parker estimates 3900 rooftops have emerged in Chaffee Crossing since Colleges of Health Education was built. While Parker attributed this growth to his college others say the school isn't the only contributing factor.

Chaffee Crossing is the product of the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority working to develop more than 7000 acres of former Army land into east Fort Smith and Barling. Since 1997 the land has seen more than $2 billion in investments according to Redevelopment Authority Marketing Director Lorie Robertson.

Coleman who for 50 years has worked in housing in Fort Smith said consistently low interest rates on homes have allowed the city to steadily grow over the last decade. He said interest rates are even better after covid-19 due to an excess of cash in the lending market.

Coleman also said Chaffee Crossing ""in the last four or five years"" has afforded housing developers unused land to build homes. He also said people have moved from outside Fort Smith to Chaffee for jobs at ArcBest and Mars Petcare.

""The last year has been great growth"" Coleman said of Chaffee. ""There has not been anybody who hasn't been able to build something and put it on the ground that did not sell immediately almost.""

But Coleman also said the medical college has been a driving factor in the growth. The college in 2021 graduated its first class of 150 doctors Parker said. These numbers don't account for the colleges' other programs that push the total number of students to around 900.

""We intentionally underbuilt our student housing because we wanted the community to benefit from what we're creating"" Parker said.

Most of the students come from the school's ""service area"" of Arkansas Oklahoma western Tennessee southern Missouri and northern Louisiana. About a third are from other places in the United States Parker said.

Of the graduated class of doctors 10 of them are completing their residencies in Fort Smith Parker said. He estimated 83% of doctors stay where they complete their residencies. And each doctor accounts for four additional medical employees he said.

The college also has more than 180 employees. More than 80% of them moved from outside Fort Smith Parker said.

The medical colleges is also going to expand into the old Golden Living center where it will house its Research Institute Health and Wellness Center. The facility will facilitate biomedical research and more educational opportunities for students according to Susan Devero communications director for the colleges.

Once complete the facility will be filled with about 100 employees with Ph.D.s plus additional staff Parker said.

""There's not 100 Ph.D.s available in Fort Smith Arkansas"" Parker said. ""We've got to bring them in from the outside.""

Parker also said the employees themselves -- many of whom make more than $100000 per year -- have an impact on the population because of their expendable income. He said the money spent on activities like dining creates more business thus leading to more jobs in the area.

The selection of Ebbing as the preferred location for Foreign Military Sales and a F-35 training center is also expected to positively impact the area's population and economy. The base will house up to 36 F-16 and F-35 fighter jets for Singapore and Foreign Military Sales participants according to the U.S. Air Force. Foreign Military Sales allows the U.S. to sell defense equipment lend services and hold training exercises to a foreign country when the president determines it will strengthen world peace the Air Force states.

The initiative is estimated to bring 345 U.S. military personnel 180 Singapore military members and 300 dependents to the River Valley according to a Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce news release. Officials expect the initiative to have up to a $1 billion economic impact on the region.

""The next three years is going to be very very successful in the housing business out here just because of what we've heard and know about based on the jobs at the med school based on the Singapore mission"" Coleman said.

McGill who helped convince the Air Force and Singapore delegation to select the city as the location said be believes the people in charge of locating projects such as these trust the region will grow. He said the decisions to locate in Fort Smith is ""simply preparing for that.""

""What we're trying to do is make sure we're providing infrastructure for that kind of growth"" he said.

'Amenities amenities amenities'

While housing and economic wins give McGill hope for the future he said these alone aren't enough to keep growing the city.

McGill said amenities -- things for residents to do outside of work -- are decisive in whether people move to another area or stay where they are. The same is true for businesses that wish to attract and retain qualified employees said Propak CEO Steve Clark.

McGill said amenities in Northwest Arkansas -- just one hour north of Fort Smith -- were a draw for the Air Force and Singapore delegation to move planes to the city. The region touts amenities such as nightlife in Fayetteville Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville and the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers.

""If I'm taking my family to another town whether we have this this and this whether it's a skate park or trail system or whatever it may be it's going to weigh in to those decisions"" Clark said.

Residents and visitors have shown renewed interest in downtown Fort Smith from The Unexpected arts festival which Clark founded. Before covid-19 the festival annually brought a handful of nationally and internationally acclaimed muralists to the city for a week to paint their works on buildings throughout downtown.

In the last five years downtown has had venues including a coffee shop cigar lounge and skate park open to the public. The Bakery District a multipurpose gathering space with a coffee shop bookstore food truck and patio area has also opened. But the area also lost a brewery and music bar during covid-19 and a western wear store in spring 2021.

Clark gave a nod to Peacemaker Music Festival and Steel Horse Rally which combined bring more than 100000 people to the downtown area each year. He also said development on the city's riverfront will contribute to the attractiveness of the city -- the openings of the U.S. Marshals Museum and Community School of the Arts in that area are expected in 2022.

""In the world we live in now it's amenities amenities amenities"" McGill said. ""Quality of life is the attraction.""

While McGill expects people to move to Fort Smith for jobs he also expects the development of the riverfront and downtown will be a draw. He said people who move to Fort Smith for this reason will fill jobs city leaders wish to attract.

But Clark said the city still needs to accelerate its development of amenities. Some are on their way such as the renovation of the park at West End in downtown and of the barracks in Chaffee Crossing.

""There's a lot of other municipalities that are trying to woo the same employers and employees that we currently have and want in our town"" Clark said.

A positive outlook

When asked what he expects Fort Smith's population to do in the next 10 years Parker's answer was simple: ""It's going to do nothing but go up.""

One of the keys to this growth Jebaraj said is consistency in investments and improvements. Clark agrees -- he said the city won't continue to grow if its stakeholders don't continue to invest in good jobs and amenities.

Coleman predicts the city will witness the same growth in the next five years that it saw in the last decade.

Boyd said community leaders will continue to make the city ""the right place for businesses to grow"" and improve life in the city.

""I feel very positive about our community and our ability of people to live in Fort Smith and surrounding communities as well and look forward to seeing what the next decade has in store for our community for Fort Smith for our surrounding communities and the state of Arkansas"" said Boyd.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWFkY2l0aWVzLmNvbS9hcnRzLWFuZC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MvcGFzc2lvbmF0ZS1uZXctZGlyZWN0b3Itb2Ytd29tZW4tdW5pdGVkLXN0YXJ0cy1hdC11bml0ZWQtd2F5LXF1YWQtY2l0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Passionate New Director of “Women United” Starts at United Way Quad Cities | Quad Cities,"Ashley Hicks has spent her whole professional career in banking but she’s cashed in her experience on and off the job and is investing it into a major nonprofit – as the new Women United director for United Way Quad Cities. She and her boss already are seeing it reap profitable rewards.

“I have watched Ashley from afar in all of her involvement in the community and her passion. She wears it on her sleeve” United Way president/CEO Rene Gellerman said Thursday. “Plus her energy and excitement. She’s very well-known in the community and that’s a great asset for us. Her passion for the community makes a huge difference. You’ve got to have that when you work for United Way.

“She’s obviously very articulate and cares about kids and you can see that all over her social media and things she’s involved in” she added. “I think she’s a terrific asset and I’m excited to see what she does.”

Women United (www.unitedwayqc.org/womenunited) is a group of caring women who are dedicated to make the Quad-Cities the best place for kids to grow up.

Since 2011 nearly 200 Women United investors have raised and invested nearly $5.5 million in research-based strategies to support quality child care and early learning experiences for our youngest Quad Citizens. They have invested in quality child care opportunities for families and education and retention of child-care providers in the Quad-Cities.

“Their priority is really to help support parents and our youngest Quad Citizens” Gellerman said noting they focus on children up to 8 years old. “They mobilize about 250 women who contribute anywhere usually starting $1000 a year.”

Their first goal was to increase the number of child-care slots in the area. “It was to ensure that more kids had access to early quality child care services” Gellerman said.

Women United has its own steering committee of about 25 women who meet every other month. It’s similar to the African American Leadership Society which started in 2019.

Ashley Hicks started as new director Aug. 23 succeeding Leslee Cook and the program was originated by Jen Dobrunz who formerly worked for United Way and is now the executive director of the Quad Cities Cultural Trust.

Hicks’s job is to develop and build donor and volunteer relationships while working to create volunteer engagement strategies and also develops and coordinates early childhood interventions focused on preparing children to be successful in kindergarten and build community will for the importance of early childhood.

She previously worked for 20 years in Q-C banking for MetroBank American Bank & Trust and the last four years at Northwest Bank and Trust (a major United Way supporter).

“I’ve done a lot of volunteer work” Hicks said of Girl Scouts one year on the Humility Homes board and Junior League. “I’ve always wanted to be involved in the community. My biggest job in banking was relationship building; that’s really what I was focused on what I was good at. So I’m taking those same skills and bringing them here – working on building relationships with women in Women United and growing that area into something that can really be transformative here.”

Hicks’s last job was retail market manager working with local businesses in whatever services they needed.

A Hampton native and United Township grad she and her husband John (who works in management for Tyson Foods) have twin 13-year-old daughters so she intimately understands the needs of kids.

“Humility Homes receives support from United Way and I know the biggest thing is United Way doesn’t put a lot of hoops up. I know from that board they were very appreciative of the support that United Way gives” Hicks said. “The fact that there are people in the Quad-Cities that are struggling to meet basic needs such as housing I think we live in a community where it’s not as in our face as other communities it’s very easy to believe that it doesn’t exist. And I wanted to be a part of helping those and correcting that. There shouldn’t be such a wide gap between residents in the Quad-Cities.”

Northwest Bank has been a strong partner of United Way and its annual campaign Gellerman said. Bank president/CEO Joe Slavens and their team “go all out to support the community and United Way is one of their big benefactors” she said. Hicks said it’s a goal for Slavens to

make the Top 10 of United Way’s community partners in their workplace campaigns.

Northwest Bank is very invested in the nonprofit Hicks said.

“It’s way a small company can really make a big impact in the Quad-Cities” she said. “United Way allows you to basically instead of doing a little here and here make the biggest impact and affect the most Quad Citizens. We all succeed when everybody does well.”

Slavens “is very passionate when he speaks about it and we always did some kind of kickoff” Hicks said of raising money for United Way. “Joe spoke from his heart about his reasons why he believed in United Way. From there we did workplace campaign events and he was very good about – for Day of Caring and volunteerism and he was very supportive of my and other employees’ desires to volunteer and get involved.”

The Day of Caring was planned for Sept. 23 but is being cancelled because of Covid Gellerman said. “A lot of Day of Caring is made up of our corporate partners and our corporate partners were concerned. You look at John Deere and Arconic. They are being very careful about promoting gatherings with their employees.”

United Way is recommending people still volunteer year-round and offers an online Volunteer Hub with those opportunities at https://unitedwayqc.galaxydigital.com/.

“From somebody that worked in the corporate world what I like about that is companies can even do it different days” Hicks said. “In my world a bank can’t shut down for a day. This allows the employees to maybe find a way to do stuff on the weekend after hours. It’s something I would love to see people get involved in and check out.”

Among Women United’s accomplishments are:

Raised $2.5 million toward the building of the Scott County Family YMCA Learning Center in downtown Davenport which opened in 2016.

Invested $275000 to improve local child care and education facilities and support training and professional development for local providers.

More than 950 local children and families have graduated from Born Learning Academies that have been hosted by 22 Quad-Cities organizations.

1000 families receive a minimum of 3 text messages a week with activities and tips for turning everyday moments into teaching moments.

90000 Born Learning calendars have been distributed since 2015 with 365 days of activities for parents to do with their children.

Meeting local needs through Covid and beyond

Improving education is one of the core tenets of the Q-C United Way as it found one in six kids in the Q-C start kindergarten without the skills needed to succeed. A child who is not ready for kindergarten is twice as likely not to be ready at grade-level by third grade Gellerman said.

Third grade is a pivotal point; if you fall behind chances are you may stay there the rest of your life according to United Way. It says students unable to read at grade level by the end of third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school.

“When a child is ready for kindergarten they’re twice as likely to be reading by third grade” Gellerman said. “That third grade is really the key lever that helps determine the success of kids. That’s one of their priorities to help these kids – particularly kids of color.”

In the Q-C 84 percent of white children are ready for kindergarten compared to 71 percent of kids of color according to United Way. Just 43 percent of children of color are reading at grade level in third grade compared to 73 percent of white children it found.

This past May Women United led a new competition (with KWQC) called “The Pitch” to offer prizes to the best ideas to improve children’s literacy and make sure they don’t fall behind in school. The winners were:

Rise United ($40000): “Bridging Literacy” – Moline Public Library and Project Now: Headstart helping non-English speaking families with three to five-year-old children gain access to more reading materials by bringing literature to them and providing parents help as students learn.

“Bridging Literacy” – Moline Public Library and Project Now: Headstart helping non-English speaking families with three to five-year-old children gain access to more reading materials by bringing literature to them and providing parents help as students learn. Entrepreneurial Spirit Award ($20000): “P.A.S.T” – Martin Luther King Center P.A.S.T. (Parents and Schools Together) will have the Martin Luther King Center as the space to bring together 25% school administrators and 75% parents to gather input and ideas on improving reading skills for children.

“P.A.S.T” – Martin Luther King Center P.A.S.T. (Parents and Schools Together) will have the Martin Luther King Center as the space to bring together 25% school administrators and 75% parents to gather input and ideas on improving reading skills for children. Stronger Together Awards (2 winners for $10000 each):“SHEro Festival” – Love Girls Magazine “Level Up” – Two Rivers YMCA SHEro Festival will get young girls to put together their own zines and present those projects at a festival giving them a chance to see themselves and strong women in literature. Level Up will bring kids into e-sports as a way to inspire reading through different programs. The Twin Rivers YMCA will help bring this to kids throughout all of the Q-C area.

“We had 15 local organizations nonprofits that participated in a 12-week learning cohort to look at the challenges and really be creative and innovative about solutions” Gellerman said. Women United underwrote the prizes to improve grade-level reading of students and hosted “The Pitch” televised on KWQC.

“That really inspired those organizations to think differently” she said noting Joe Slavens was one of the four judges.

Individuals who earned the awards were:

Together for Tomorrow participants who completed the program each received grants bringing the total awarded to Q-C nonprofits and innovators to $100000.

Together for Tomorrow — one of United Way Quad Cities’ capacity-building programs launched earlier this year — is a resource group for nonprofits focused on education. “The Pitch” was essentially the culminating event of the first session. More information and a list of cohort participants is available at www.unitedwayqc.org/togetherfortomorrow.

Another new Women United program started last year was the Quad Cities Tutor Connection an easy-to-access tutor connecting site for parents with students in grades K-12. The program was launched during the Covid pandemic to help students deal with the unprecedented learning environment.

“I’m excited to turn some of that passion toward the younger generations and help some of the areas with Women United” she said. Their main focus is on the United Way Born Learning Academy – a six-week program to support parents of young kids and helps those parents be their child’s first and best teacher Hicks said.

“We provide a meal we provide child care and we’re usually in an area the parent can easily get to to take away all those barriers” she said. The free program is aimed at parents of pre-K kids to help them be prepared to start school.

“They’re often held in more marginalized neighborhoods churches and schools” Gellerman said. “It really is a success story that’s probably not as well-known as it should be. That’s a program that Women United incubated and now if we can get over Covid we have data that prove it works.”

Since the pandemic the now-eight-year program has mostly been offered virtually and women can take classes online – in groups of 12 to 15. They usually do two sessions a year. “It was a great learning opportunity too because some of the barriers for parents’ participation could be a child’s sick so they can’t come that night. They can still do them and log in virtually so they won’t miss a session.”

“In addition to supporting those parents helping them learn about social-emotional development it’s an opportunity for parents to build relationships among themselves” Gellerman said of Born Learning. “They can talk about the common things they’re facing.”

United Way offers free Kindles to families that finish the program loaded with apps for kids as well as gift cards given along the way to incentivize parents to attend Hicks said. “It’s an amazing program and I’m excited to get started and unpack all that.”

Starting this fall she’d like to continue Born Learning offered as hybrid online and in person.

“We’ve learned through Covid that sometimes that technology does help” Hicks said. “I do have some facilitators who are very excited to go in person. I think it’s going to depend on the location – what the location feels. Due to Covid we have different rules in place depending on what side of the river we’re on.”

Smith has a league-leading 28 interceptions among all safeties since he entered the NFL in 2012. Only Hall of Famer Paul Krause (150) has started more games at safety in Vikings history than Smith (129).

According to a person with knowledge of the deal speaking on condition of anonymity because the terms were not being announced the new contract is worth $64 million with a little more than $26 million guaranteed. That will put Smith safely among the top five highest-paid safeties in the NFL with Seattle's Jamal Adams at the top of the annual average values.

Prior to the signing Smith was in the final year of his deal with a salary cap hit slightly above $10 million. At age 32 the new contract ought to ensure he'll stay with the Vikings as long as he's on the field. No one from the team was available to the media on Sunday. Smith was scheduled to address reporters on Monday.

Drafted in the first round in 2012 out of Notre Dame Smith quickly entrenched himself as the anchor of the secondary and had two of his four career interception returns for touchdowns as a rookie. He made his first Pro Bowl in 2015 and was an All-Pro pick in 2017. Smith also holds the franchise record for defensive backs with 13 1/2 career sacks.

Smith is seventh in Vikings history in interceptions with Krause (53) leading the way. Bobby Bryant (51) Ed Sharockman (40) Joey Browner (37) Nate Wright (31) and Carl Lee (29) are next.

Smith has not missed a game to injury over the last four years with just one absence in 2019 when the Vikings held several starters out of the final regular season game with their seed for the playoffs already secured.

This year Smith will have all new starters around him in the secondary with safety Xavier Woods and cornerbacks Patrick Peterson Bashaud Breeland and Mackensie Alexander all signed as free agents.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzRmYWNlMGM2LWMxZmItNDdhZi05NzJiLTg3NDllOTJiNGJhZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How US community banks became 'irreplaceable' in the pandemic,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The 28-25 loss against the Chiefs likely did little to ease his concerns heading into the regular season.

Kirk Cousins' preseason ended with just one score — a 26-yard field goal by Greg Joseph — in six drives failing to produce the points Zimmer had sought from any quarterback. The Vikings' winless preseason saw the offense score two touchdowns in 35 drives against the Broncos Colts and Chiefs.

The recent loss was ""sloppy"" said Zimmer who added he expects results to differ when he soon takes the bubble wrap off Vikings stars.

""We planned on not playing [starters] very long"" Zimmer said. ""I wanted to make sure we got out of there healthy and [Cousins] took a good shot on that second drive. I think if you look at a lot of the guys that played they're probably not ready to play yet. I've been really cautious with some of the other guys because of injuries.""

Cousins came within 8 yards of the goal line on the opening drive. Strikes to tight end Irv Smith Jr. — the only starting weapon Cousins got on Friday night — for 16 and 23 yards moved them into position. But a third-down pass to receiver Chad Beebe was deflected and the Vikings settled for a field goal while Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw touchdown passes on his two drives.

Chiefs linebacker Anthony Hitchens spoiled any chance at momentum. Hitchens sacked Cousins to open the next series with a well-timed blitz up the middle and past running back Ameer Abdullah. The sack snowballed into back-to-back three-and-out drives to end Cousins' night. He completed five of seven passes for 57 yards with only one completion — a 6-yard catch by Whop Philyor — to a receiver.

BOXSCORE: Kansas City 28 Vikings 25

""We'll have a few more guys with us in Cincinnati"" Cousins said referring to the Sept. 12 season opener. ""I think that helps. There's always stuff to work on.""

The lack of top weapons was glaring. Once again Cousins didn't have running back Dalvin Cook or receiver Justin Jefferson. He was also without receiver Adam Thielen who played last week against Indianapolis but is recovering from a quad bruise suffered against the Colts.

""It's really hard"" Zimmer said of evaluating the offense without its stars. ""Actually on all sides of the ball. I feel like we're going to be pretty good but we still have to go and prove it.""

Sixteen players on the Vikings' 79-man roster were unavailable Friday including eight starters in Cook Jefferson Thielen defensive end Danielle Hunter linebackers Eric Kendricks and Anthony Barr safety Harrison Smith and cornerback Patrick Peterson.

The Chiefs' firepower looked Super Bowl-worthy. Mahomes and his top weapons receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce made quick work of the Vikings defense in two series marching 149 yards for two touchdowns and a 14-3 lead.

Mahomes completed his first six passes for 104 yards including a 35-yard touchdown to Hill over their former teammate in Vikings cornerback Bashaud Breeland. Hill breezed past Breeland who gave him a free release at the line of scrimmage and didn't look back on the go route.

""That was [on Breeland]"" Zimmer said. ""He didn't cover the guy.""

As final cuts loom on Tuesday Vikings backups — especially at quarterback — didn't do much to quell Zimmer's concerns. All NFL teams must set initial 53-man rosters by Tuesday afternoon.

Jake Browning the No. 2 passer throughout the preseason doesn't have much of a case to keep that job. Browning threw for just one first down on three drives in the second quarter. He completed 2 of 8 passes for 41 yards.

Rookie quarterback Kellen Mond showed off his legs scrambling for two first downs including to convert a fourth down. On the next play running back A.J. Rose Jr.'s 32-yard run scored the Vikings' only offensive touchdown of the preseason.

But Mond committed two turnovers throwing a pass over the head of tight end Zach Davidson and into an interception by Chiefs safety Armani Watts. Mond later lost a fumble when he was hit from behind by Chiefs defensive end Tim Ward in the third quarter.

""Davidson's got to go up there and make a little better effort getting that ball"" General Manager Rick Spielman said during the television broadcast.

The Vikings defense scored as many touchdowns — two — as the offense this preseason thanks to cornerback Parry Nickerson's interception returned for a touchdown in the fourth quarter off backup Chiefs quarterback Shane Buechele.

Cousins said he isn't hanging his head knowing the offense's potential.

""I feel good"" Cousins said. ""Great rapport with our coaches with our plan; I really like the plan. I feel good about our unit. Excited about our guys and now we're getting close to the real thing we really got to get ready to go and get our guys healthy and start fast."""

You’re wrong. Do some research on EV range and weight. Click to expand...

Wow. It's almost like I haven't spent the last six years of my life working in engineering with electric vehicles.How about we look at the facts which you clearly like to ignore.First of all the Model Y 21"" Uberturbine front wheel and tire assembly is 66.6lbs each. The rear is 70.8lbs each. I literally weighed mine (brand-new) two weeks ago so I am confident in these weights.The 19x8.5"" TSV is 29.55lbs. The 255/45/19R Continental DWS06 is 27lbs per Tire Rack. Add in the weight of the TPMS Sensor and the average wheel weights (1lb) and your total assembly is roughly 57.55lbs. So you are saving 9.05lbs per front assembly and 13.25lbs per rear assembly. For a net total savings of 44.6lbs. Which is again nowhere near the ""100lbs"" you claimed.Reducing rotational weight can help with improving acceleration all else being equal. However it has nearly no impact on range. This is because once moving the amount of energy required to keep the lower rotational weight rotating is offset by the increase in momentum/inertia. Therefore unless you are planning to accelerate and decelerate rapidly and continuously while driving which would be in contrast to the way 99% of people drive it makes no real-world difference.Additionally while it may take slightly less energy to get the vehicle up to speed it also results in less energy being recaptured during regenerative braking and more friction losses from the conventional braking system.Do you really think that Tesla would have overlooked wheel weight if it made a difference? There's a reason why they focus on the aerodynamic profile on the wheel while basically completely ignoring the weight of the wheel. Tesla's wheels are very heavy. If they could increase range by 5% by putting on a wheel that is 20% lighter of course they would have already done that a long time ago. They're not dumb.Of course any company selling aftermarket Tesla wheels is going to tell you that it makes a big difference in range they're literally incentivized to sell you wheels that's their business.In conclusion you might in ideal circumstances notice a 1% improvement in range with these lighter wheels. Because at the end of the day you are saving almost precisely 1% of the overall weight of the vehicle. I will again that tire selection is far and away the most important factor in determining range when it comes to wheel and tire selection. To be clear I am not saying that the weight makes NO difference but it is very close to nothing and would not impact real-world usability in any way.The 18"" Michelin MXM4 on the Model 3 was an incredibly efficient tire though fairly poor in every other measurable regard.Here is a decent article on the subject: Wheel Weight – Does it Matter? – All EV Info @Knightshade - feel free to add your input.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY2JzYXVzdGluLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC92aWRlby11YmVyLWRyaXZlci1hc3NhdWx0ZWQtYnktcGFzc2VuZ2Vy0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9jYnNhdXN0aW4uY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC92aWRlby11YmVyLWRyaXZlci1hc3NhdWx0ZWQtYnktcGFzc2VuZ2Vy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: Uber driver assaulted by passenger,"DARIEN Conn. (WKRC/News 12 Connecticut/CNN Newsource) - An Uber driver is sharing his terrifying story after he was assaulted by a passenger.

The whole incident was recorded on a Dashcam and police may use it as evidence to charge the assailant.

In the shocking video a passenger reaches into Uber driver's Sijo George's driver's side window as he screams for help.

""I thought 'I'm going to get killed' you know?"" said George.

It started out as a normal pickup for him with two male passengers in two different drop-off locations just before midnight.

There wasn't much interaction until both passengers left the vehicle at the first stop prompting George to ask about the second drop-off location.

That's when one of the passengers began asking to see George's driver's license.

""He keep asking 'Show me your license'"" said George.

In a matter of seconds the situation turned violent.





After being punched multiple times George tried to call for help.

The passenger fled the scene momentarily before returning to attack again.

""I had a CT scan because I you know I was bleeding from my ears and I called like all those booths from all the sides"" George said. ""So you can see you know my legs and my ribs.""

George was able to call 911 at the scene. The scarring incident had shaken George and his family.

""That's the father of my kids"" said his wife Maria George. ""And for someone intoxicated or not like there's no excuse to just lose it and to go after an innocent man who is pleading.""

George works as an Uber driver on the side to support his family but says after this incident he can't do it anymore.

""That's the last night"" he said. ""That's the last trip.""

Do uber and Lyft apply higher surge pricing based on your phone's battery level?

Does Uber hike ride prices when you're low on battery?

By Chandraveer Mathur 09:39 am Aug 28 202109:39 am

What's the story Over the years suspicions have grown about whether or not ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft hike fares if your phone's battery is low. The topic has resurfaced for discussion on Twitter after a self-professed techie tweeted about an extremely expensive ride becoming cheaper after she charged her phone. There isn't concrete evidence yet but here's the whole story.

Motives

Why would Uber Lyft vary pricing based on battery level?

First off the possible motivation could be that users would accept whatever price is quoted instead of facing the possibility of a dead phone and no cab options while waiting for the supposedly demand-based pricing to drop. Secondly Uber and Lyft's apps have access to your phone's battery level and could use the information if they chose to.

Wild fluctuation

If your phone's battery is below 20% prices increase

The suspicion was first raised by Twitter user Sarah (@NerdyAndNatural). She claims that both Uber and Lyft hike cab fares when your phone's battery is low. She shared an instance where the $25 to $30 ride price jumped a whopping $81 while her phone's battery was at 18%. Once the phone was charged up to 25% the price dropped back down.

Twitter Post

Sarah's tweet about correlation between battery level and surge pricing

No evidence

No concrete evidence of such hikes is available yet

While Sarah's experience doesn't prove Uber or Lyft were indulging in the ""dirty"" strategy she isn't the first to spot the correlation between the battery level and cab pricing. A Forbes report from mid-2016 and an unrelated report from 2019 independently corroborate Sarah's observations. Meanwhile one could also argue effective surge pricing dropped in the time spent recharging the phone's battery.

Information

Some suggest using Firefox since it can't access battery level

In the replies to Sarah's tweet some users reportedly claimed that they were unable to recreate the circumstances and verify her observation while another user advised using Uber through Firefox since it allegedly doesn't have access to the battery level API.

Vehement denial

Obviously Uber denies factoring in the device's battery level

Back in 2016 Uber's then head of economic research Keith Chen reportedly commented on the matter in a podcast episode. He said Uber noted clients are more likely to accept surge pricing if their phone is about to die. Chen clarified that Uber doesn't use this information and it's just an interesting observation. Are we to believe Uber doesn't use data it already has?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdWJlci1ib2F0LXJpdmVyLXRoYW1lcy10YXhpLWxvbmRvbi10cmFuc3BvcnQtcGhvdG9zLTIwMjEtONIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdWJlci1ib2F0LXJpdmVyLXRoYW1lcy10YXhpLWxvbmRvbi10cmFuc3BvcnQtcGhvdG9zLTIwMjEtOD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Uber Boat ride down London's River Thames: PHOTOS,"I took a ride on an Uber Boat down the River Thames in London.

Co-Founder and CEO Arctic Wolf • Eden Prairie

EY elevator pitch: Arctic Wolf offers comprehensive cybersecurity operations tailored to each enterprise. It focuses on identifying and filling the gaps in companies’ IT infrastructure that can allow cyberthieves access. It then continuously monitors the company’s IT security system—firewalls identity authentication software and so on—to make sure all the virtual doors are locked and all the windows stay shut.

Revenue: Not available

Employees: 900

Business: Cybersecurity operations and management for small and midsize enterprises

Interview with NeSmith: What opportunity did you see when you co-founded Arctic Wolf in 2012?

It wasn’t that there weren’t companies doing cyber; it’s that people were failing at it all the time. You can buy a set of products hire a big group of people and then set up cybersecurity capabilities. But as you can tell from the press it’s clear that people are constantly failing at it. Our goal was to build a company to perform continuous monitoring. It’s easy to say [but] incredibly difficult to do day in and day out because the threats never go away.

Your fast-growing company recently landed $150 million in new funding. What sets it apart from other companies in the cybersecurity space?

What makes us unique is a focus on the outcome. Almost every other company focuses on a product feature people or process. Our focus on day one has been on the outcome. We decided that to deliver that outcome we would have to build our own technology stack and use our own people. And we would need to integrate them into a wide variety of organizations in the form that they would want us to.

How do you work with customers?

When we engage with an organization first and foremost we’re going to understand what they’re good at doing and what they’re not good at doing. Then we augment and wrap around them [services] to allow them to have complete capability. We’re not going to become your full security operations capability. We’ll build around what you have.

This summer you announced that Arctic Wolf is entering several overseas markets.

We’ve been growing by expanding upmarket and adding new product capabilities. The next growth dimension we’ve just started to add is opening up new geographies. What’s challenging about that is the way we go to market and the way we serve customers is through a very intimate experience. We have what we call “concierge security teams” two- or three-person security teams that leverage the technology platform for that set of customers. We are building a security operations center in Germany. It’s a global platform but it’s presented to the customer as a very local capability.

Janet Johanson

Founder and CEO BevSource • The Lab Little Canada

EY elevator pitch: BevSource is a matchmaker that connects people with new ideas for beverages to companies that can produce them. The company also handles contracts production run management quality control order filling and other services for the beverage entrepreneurs except sales and marketing. On average BevSource manages production of 10 million cases of product per year.

Revenue: $80 to $100 million

Employees: 85

Business: Connects beverage companies with beverage producers and helps beverage companies prototype new products

Interview with Johanson: What did you envision 19 years ago when you got started?

I worked at Minnesota Brewing in St. Paul which also co-packed for other beverages. When it went bankrupt clients called me and asked “Would you help me find a new place?” I said “Would you pay me?” And they said yes.

How do you connect them to a production facility?

It depends on what you’re making how much you want to make and what location you want to make it in. Do you want to make a coffee? Do you want to make a beer? Do you want it to be organic or kosher? We take all those pieces and find you the best home.

There are so many beverage entrepreneurs.

Fifty years ago you wouldn’t have seen as many. There wasn’t a new-age beverage section at Target for instance. Now people are looking for what’s new and next what’s healthy what’s different. We make really challenging products—people who want to put probiotics into a beverage products like that.

What other services do you provide?

These entrepreneurs have great ideas but paperwork is often their worst nightmare. We love doing the paperwork and setting up supply chains. We also make sure their products are made right. Saying yes is how we got to where we’re at. We started out just being the matchmaker—then customers said “Can you help us get labels registered?” And we said “Yeah I guess we can do that.” Or “Can you handle the orders from the distributor?” “Sure OK.”

Why did you launch The Lab in 2019?

We wanted a place to try out ingredients recipes and processes for our customers. We do all that for both big and small companies. Many local craft brewers drop off samples to make sure that their quality is good. New breweries can make sure their recipes work before they open. We thought that since we make cool new stuff we should let people taste it and give feedback.

Jamie Candee

CEO Edmentum • Bloomington

EY elevator pitch: We’re all familiar with the traditional public school teaching approach: You come to class the teacher talks at you you leave with homework and you come back the next day. But millions of children can’t or don’t want to learn that way at least not solely. Edmentum’s products give schools the flexibility to offer both in-person and virtual learning so that all students can thrive.

Revenue: Not available

Employees: More than 1200

Business: Digital-based educational materials and tools primarily for K-12 public schools

Interview with Candee: What makes Edmentum entrepreneurial?

When I think of the word entrepreneurial I think about recognizing a problem then figuring out a different way to solve it. One of the biggest problems school districts have is offering only one model for learning. Our virtual instructional services have more than 250 virtual teachers who are state-certified. We offer all the curriculum the teaching and administrative services and we teach you how to run your own virtual school.

What’s an example of an Edmentum innovation?

We took a product to market three years ago called Exact Path. It gives K-12 learners quick assessments and pinpoints where their learning gaps are. A challenge if you’re a teacher with 30 second-graders in your classroom is trying to figure out where all your kids are at; they’re learning at all different levels. We use machine-learning adaptive technology to pinpoint where kids are at in math reading and English language arts. Then we give teachers reporting data and we personalize instruction. This allows teachers to help each learner stay on track within his or her grade level.

You left Edmentum in 2013 as chief revenue officer then returned in 2017 as CEO. Why come back?

I was running another company as CEO in Minnesota called Questar Assessment. After we sold Questar the board of directors at Edmentum called and asked me whether I’d be willing to come back as CEO. I’ve always had an affinity for what we do here at Edmentum. I started my career as a teacher and I’ve seen how great tools like Edmentum’s create equitable learning opportunities for kids.

Many teachers worry that tech will replace them.

We don’t believe that. We believe that education technology should be an amplifier of great teaching and give teachers the ability to reach all their students.

What’s next for Edmentum?

We’ve entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Apex Learning based in Seattle that is a secondary-level online courses provider. Apex has made substantial investments into honors and advanced placement coursework as well as career and technical education pathways.

Tony Miller

Founder and CEO Bind Benefits Inc. • Minneapolis

EY elevator pitch: Bind Benefits administers health plans for companies that self-fund insurance coverage. More recently it has expanded into offering its own health plan for employers with 50 or more employees.

Revenue: Not available

Employees: More than 300

Business: Health plan administration

Tony Miller is no stranger to health care startups. Bind is the third new company Miller has piloted in recent years.

Miller was the co-founder and CEO of Definity Health which focused on consumer-driven health benefit programs. The company sold to UnitedHealth Group Inc. in 2004 for $300 million.

In 2006 Miller founded Carol Corp. The company started by offering a web portal for consumers to compare health care prices then pivoted to become a health care consulting firm. UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum acquired Carol Corp. in 2011.

Miller also founded Lemhi Ventures in 2006 which has the stated goal of using the “leverage of venture capital as the engine of change in health care services.” Miller is the managing partner of the investment firm which is an original investor in Bind.

Bind started with the concept of “on demand” health coverage. It administered health coverage for companies with self-funded insurance. Bind touted plans that allowed covered employees to opt in for some specific coverage only when it was needed. Bind itself was not a health insurer.

That changed in the fall of 2020 when it expanded into the fully insured health plan market offering its own plan to companies with 50 or more employees. After starting in Florida Bind is now offering its plan in five states.

But the model remains fundamentally the same. Miller’s pitch calls for eliminating deductibles cost uncertainty and coverage barriers in health insurance for patients.

Miller offered his take on the state of the health care business in a recent commentary: “Traditional health plans herd employees down a set path that is designed around a group. The data and technology needed to deliver a personalized and flexible health plan experience that truly works better for everyone already exists.”

Investors have been bullish on Bind. By mid-2021 the company had raised nearly $300 million in financing including a $105 million round that closed in October 2020. UnitedHealth Group is one of its investors. Given his track record it’s tough to bet against Miller.

Todd Wilkinson

President and CEO Entrust Corp. • Shakopee

EY elevator pitch: Entrust offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions focusing on protecting identities payments and data. Its products are designed to allow people to cross international borders securely make payments and other transactions and move data online. Some companies are strong in digital technology; others focus on physical products such as identification cards. Entrust offers both capabilities.

Revenue: $800 million

Employees: 2600

Business: Products and services for secure credential issuance digital identity and cybersecurity

Interview with WILKINson: You joined Datacard Entrust’s predecessor in 2005 as CFO after executive positions at USG and GE. What was the appeal of a smaller company?

It had strong technologies great market position and a global footprint which was really important to me. And the things that I believed the company needed to be even more successful at were areas [where] I had skills to contribute particularly the knowledge of how to assemble a strong team.

Entrust has been around for 52 years. How is it entrepreneurial?

The term applies to us in the mode of thinking that’s required to reinvent yourself and move toward customer needs. In 2008 when I became CEO we started to pivot to more of a recurring revenue model. We invested heavily in innovation; more recently we’ve invested in acquisitions to also accelerate growth. We pivoted toward areas like digital identity just as our customers were beginning their own digital transformation.

Transitioning to a software-as-a-service model was another pivot for the company both technologically and from a core-capability perspective. Today we have a series of cloud-enabled products which are delivering a significant amount of our revenue. We look at all our solutions comprehensively. That allows us to build solutions that a point product can’t handle or a smaller company can’t bring to market. Looking at the ways that we’re innovating I would argue that that is entrepreneurial.

What company plans can you share?

We’re targeting $1 billion in revenue in the near term. There is a significant amount of room for us to grow both organically and by acquisitions. We’re continuing to extend our solution reach. We acquired a company called HyTrust in January that is more focused on cloud and software container security management—security technologies for where the world is going. And in April we acquired WorldReach Software a digital ID verification company that simplifies the experience for end users applying for and using secure digital identities. There is a significant amount of near-adjacency opportunities for us to extend into.

Nicole Lorenzen Atchison

CEO Puris Holdings • Minneapolis

Tyler Lorenzen

CEO Puris Proteins • Minneapolis

EY elevator pitch: Puris was plant-based when plant-based wasn’t yet cool. Jerry Lorenzen founded the company in 1985 to help create more sustainable food from plants. His children Nicole Atchison and Tyler Lorenzen are now running the show. The company’s calling card is its Puris pea protein products. Ag giant Cargill invested at least $100 million in Puris in 2018 and 2019. And Fast Company listed Puris as its No. 1 Most Innovative Food Company. Atchison says the company has grown rapidly year-over-year.

Revenue: Not available

Employees: 315

Business: Manufactures non-GMO plant-based ingredients

Interview with Atchison and Lorenzen: What drove the pivot of the business?

Lorenzen: The belief was always about plant-based nutrition and this idea where plant-based proteins would be at the center of the plate and people would think plants first in terms of where they get their protein sources as the world grows into the population it will be in 2050. That was always the purpose. The concept was we have to do that in a sustainable fashion from seed all the way to food and we just happened to pivot to peas because they are the most sustainable regenerative solution.

How crucial is Cargill’s backing?

Lorenzen: Huge. Cargill’s belief in what we’re doing and where we’re taking this business certainly [existed] before it was in the news on a daily basis. ESG [environmental social and governance criteria] sustainability plant-based food was not a topic of discussion as often as it is today. Cargill supported us before that happened which really put us in the driver’s seat.

Where does Puris fit in the plant-based industry?

Atchison: Partnership is such a key piece of our business model and our growth plan. Between Cargill and our customer partners how we partner throughout the industry is I think how we’re looking at the growth of it too. The more people involved the more ability we have to really have an impact in the industry. We are open to help people join the plant-based industry. That’s what we actively do every day is work and partner with people on innovation or supply chain considerations—the whole gamut.

What’s next for the company?

Atchison: The future is really exciting for Puris. We’ve spent the last 30 years putting the pieces in place to create the foundation of what we’re starting to see play out in the plant-based food movement today. Puris Proteins Tyler’s company has our Dawson [Minnesota] facility opening up which is a big step for both Puris but also the industry here in North America—specifically by de-bottlenecking one of the biggest constraints in the plant-based industry which is ingredient supply.

Charlie Youakim

Co-Founder and CEO Sezzle Inc. • Minneapolis

EY elevator pitch: Charlie Youakim’s Sezzle startup is sizzling. The company is among many offering a “buy now pay later” platform for customers. Users can buy products from retailers that use Sezzle and consumers can make four interest-free payments. Sezzle’s revenue comes from fees charged to retailers. One of the biggest clients Minneapolis-based Target Corp. inked a three-year deal with Sezzle this summer. The company is already public in Australia and has floated plans for a U.S. IPO.

Revenue: $59 million

Employees: More than 300

Business: An alternative payment platform for online shoppers

Interview with YoUaKim: What did you learn from running your first startup Passport?

I learned a lot the hard way. We didn’t have mentors. We had to learn it all the first time which makes it harder. I think when you learn it yourself you don’t screw up twice. I learned that your destiny is really in your control. Despite the fact that you may have really powerful competitors and you seem like you might be outgunned if you just focus on “keep marching ahead” adding value for your key stakeholders and you just keep on doing it you can find success. Don’t worry too much about your competitors; worry more about yourself.

What mistakes did you make?

We used to talk to the wrong funding companies. We would talk to people who would want to write checks for pre-IPO. We’d waste a ton of time talking to venture capital groups and private equity groups that really wanted nothing to do with us at earlier stages.

How important was the deal with Target?

I think time will tell but I think it’s a key deal for us in terms of clout and impact—basically making a statement that we are here to play as a company. We are a $1 billion market cap [company] and all of our key competitors are $20 billion $30 billion and $40 billion in market cap. They’re much much larger than us. I think a lot of people could discount us because of that. But now people know we’re on the map.

What sets Sezzle apart from big companies in this sector?

We follow a stakeholder approach to business. Our mission is to financially empower the next generation and we follow through with it. We’re the only company that has a credit-building aspect. When you utilize our payment product we can help you build your credit score up which is really important for young consumers and it fits our mission. We’re also a Certified B Corp. which really speaks to our differentiation and our approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But 14 percent of Hispanic Americans characterized their health in those terms as did nearly 18 percent of Black Americans.

In recent years access to care has improved in the wake of the Affordable Care Act which reduced the number of uninsured Americans across all racial and ethnic groups. But the racial health gap has remained according to a series of studies published on Tuesday in the journal JAMA.

A dismal picture of persistent health disparities in America was described in an issue devoted entirely to inequities in medicine. The wide-ranging issue included research on spending and patterns of care comparative rates of gestational diabetes and the proportion of Black physicians at medical schools.

The journal’s editors committed to a sharper focus on racism in medicine after a controversy in June in which a staff member seemed to suggest that racism was not a problem in health care. The ensuing criticism led to the resignation of the top editor and culminated with a pledge to increase staff diversity and publish a more inclusive array of papers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vY2hhdG5ld3N0b2RheS5jYS8yMDIxLzA4LzI4L3B1YmxpYy1vci1wcml2YXRlLWNhbmFkYXMtcGVyZW5uaWFsLWRlYmF0ZS1hYm91dC1ob3ctdG8tc29sdmUtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public or private: Canada's perennial debate about how to solve health care,"The question is how to fill in those cracks. All three main national political parties are promising some form of health care improvement from pharmacare and hiring more doctors to hiking federal health transfers to the provinces.

Nobody seems to dispute that the system needs more money. The dispute that arises is about where that money comes from.

Smart said Canadians have an “illusion” that health care is entirely public but the reality is the system is already quite a mix of private and public. Most medical clinics and doctors’ offices and even some hospitals are private businesses where the fees are paid for by public health plans.

But public plans don’t cover everything and Canadians pay out of pocket for things like eye exams physical therapy dentistry some mental health treatments and prescription drugs. In 2019 30 per cent of the $266 billion spent on health care was privately funded.

The Canada Health Act prescribes the conditions provinces must meet to get their full federal transfers for health care. If provinces charge patients for those services their transfers can be clawed back.

In the last few years claw backs have been made to British Columbia Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick after patients were charged for services covered by the act.

The next target is likely to be a Saskatchewan policy to allow private MRI clinics to charge patients for scans as long as they provide scans to an equal number of patients off the public waiting list free of charge. The policy has been in place since 2016 but the Liberals updated the Canada Health Act in 2018 to add diagnostics specifically and that change takes full effect in 2022.

Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has opened the door to allowing provinces to do more of what Saskatchewan did praising that policy during the Tory leadership race last year and promising more “public-private synergies” in health care.

This past week he declined to be more specific about what services he thinks Canadians should be allowed to pay for directly saying only he fully embraces Canada’s public health care system will increase transfers to the province to pay for it and let them decide how to innovate.

“If Saskatchewan Alberta Ontario or Quebec want to innovate to provide better health care I support that” he said Aug. 24. “Why? Because it gives Canadians more choice. The more choices Canadians have in health care the better.”

Trudeau said Friday what O’Toole means by “choice” is “that people who are wealthy should be able to pay and cut ahead of the line and get private services” which he said would just increase wait times in the public system.

“Conservative politicians like (Saskatchewan Premier) Scott Moe like Erin O’Toole are totally fine with a health care system for the rich and a health care system for everyone else but I’m not OK with that and I know Canadians are not OK with that” Trudeau said.

Dr. Shoo Lee a pediatrician and professor of public health policy at the University of Toronto co-authored a paper published in February which looked at whether greater use of private financing improved either accessibility or quality of health care in other countries and concluded it did not.

“Private financing (both private for-profit insurance and private out-of-pocket financing) was found to negatively affect universality equity accessibility and quality of care” the paper concluded. “Increased private financing was not associated with improved health outcomes nor did it reduce health expenditure growth. Therefore increased private financing is not the panacea proposed for improving quality or sustainability.”

In an interview Lee said private for-profit health care means some of the funding for health services is diverted to profits ultimately costing more money in the end.

Smart said public systems can be innovative without charging patients if they are properly funded and given the room to do it.

Virtual care is among the new innovations which exploded during the pandemic out of necessity but which Lee said could have a long-standing impact on overall health delivery.

Doctors in most provinces can now be paid for virtual office visits and phone calls. Before the pandemic those services were unpaid if they were provided at all. And Lee said not every consultation with a doctor needs to be in person. Prescription refills for example often require little more than a conversation and virtual care allows that to happen more efficiently.

Smart said virtual care could also be a major improvement to access for people in places where certain specialists don’t exist or are in short supply. But she said the provinces and Ottawa need to do more to allow national recognition of medical credentials so a doctor in one province can provide virtual care to a patient in another.

Or said Smart maybe instead of sending patients across provincial borders to see specialists the specialists can travel to them. Unless a doctor is accredited in more than one province they currently can’t do that said Smart.

Smart said there also needs to be a national conversation and agreement on how many more doctors and nurses Canada needs. The growth in new doctors has been outpacing population growth for years but Canada still has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the OECD.

Table 2 Characteristics of participants interviewed using Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) Full size table

Application of the UPG model to the study findings

In this section of the paper we present data based on the six stages of the UPG model.

1. Transfer of productive assets

Asset transfer is ideal for those CHVs who desire to run their own business. This is what the CHVs in this study preferred could be offered in the form of cash or in-kind.

“Apart from giving us money there are things that we can benefit from… If he [benefactor] gives us dairy cattle individually that gives me milk…. that will benefit me…” (R3 FGD 6 Kaloleni).

The KIIs likewise agreed with one stating that the benefit would serve the community as a whole.

“…I can also think of…a boda-boda [motor bike]… used for referrals to the facility…that will boost health…if they have their own they will maybe charge less” (KII 02).

CHVs would appreciate some asset transference in the form of a tangible asset as capital e.g. a motor bike to ferry passengers for a fee or in the form of poultry or livestock from which they could increase their earnings. Although this is the most capital intensive aspect of the programme previous studies showed that an increase in the total asset-value index led to a positive impact on poverty alleviation [35]. The sustainability of this core component of the UPG model over time has however been criticised [36]. Seen through the lens of risk and vulnerability the provision of tangible productive and household assets is considered sustainable when firstly a minimum acceptable level of consumption is provided secondly protecting those considered vulnerable are protected from shocks and adverse events that would require them to sell their assets and thirdly this vulnerability is prevented in the long-term [37]. The policy implication includes determining the threshold for “acceptable” consumption level vis-à-vis how sustainable this is.

2. Weekly stipends/consumption support

Food security is a key concern and may hinder CHVs from taking risks on long-term livelihood activities. Providing a safety net that meets the basic needs of the CHVs such as a monetary compensation for the time they provide their services will allow them to engage better in programme activities as well as enable them to focus on building self-sustaining livelihoods. The CHVs in this study requested for allowances and other support to conduct their duties. This was echoed by the KIIs.

“..[As] has been said….is that token… be increased….they should look at what they will give the CHVs so that they can be well motivated.” (R3 FGD 5 Kaloleni). “…if there could be some arrangement that they get some payment… I would support that…at least something that can make someone to feel that at the end of the month… he can move on.” (KII 01). “….what can give us the morale is they think about us at least every month…someone will know even if I lose that way [lost opportunity to earn while volunteering] when a certain day reaches I will get something.” (R4 FGD 3 Kaloleni).

The need for financial incentives was reiterated repeatedly. For the CHVs in this study it appeared that a fallback plan provided regularly such as a wage/salary would cushion them on the days they forfeited personal businesses to conduct their CHV-related activities. The aim of consumption support through weekly stipends in the UPG model is to ensure stabilisation of consumption and deter the risk of sale of productive assets for immediate consumption needs [27]28. It is thus provided until the asset begins to yield an income [27]. It is a relatively simple process and less labour intensive however concern arises when the stipend amounts are standardised rather than customised based on household needs creating an issue with equity [26]. Estimating consumption needs and justifying distribution based on these needs are among the policy implication aspects of this incentive.

3. Intensive hands-on training

The CHVs requested technical and vocational training to equip them with skills required for self-employment. Training is tailored to their unique needs and structured to link to a specific livelihood activity. The CHVs in this study requested for enhanced training in the informal sector in entrepreneurship and best practice in agricultural farming and livestock rearing.

“…We need…training about rearing [livestock] so that we can know how to keep chicken…and also those drugs that are used when chicken have been affected by any disease and the feeds.” (R7 FGD 9 Kaloleni). “… Projects…require good management…if it would be possible to help us in bringing leadership training so that we… [are] able to manage those projects that we are even given without difficulty so that we can succeed.” (R1 FGD 2 Rabai).

The KIIs participants also felt that training was important. They suggested that it should accompany the health education training provided for the CHVs to perform their community health activities.

“…if they are taught about health they should also have trainings teaching how to start their own businesses.” (KII 04).

Additionally some businesses were not productive because basic training on running core businesses was lacking.

“..Of their dairy cattle… but they are not producing simply because they haven't been held their hands and told this and that should be done.” (KII 03).

Responses from the CHVs pointed to technical or entrepreneurship enhancement that most felt would enable them improve their financial capacity and in this way empower them economically. The hands-on training within the UPG model is designed to provide transferable skills that will enable users to maximise the income-generating asset they are provided [27]. Provided before and after provision of the assets beneficiaries are usually able to outpace their peers in per-capita income based on the training they receive [26]. Additionally they also benefit from increased access to new labour markets and unlocking access to new job opportunities [35]. Hands-on training however requires significant human resource more supervision is time-intensive and requires adaptability to the local context [26]36. In resource-poor settings this can be a huge limitation.

4. Savings

Learning to save one’s income and resources is an integral tool and doing so consistently helps instil a saving culture while expanding ones’ assets. The CHVs in this study expressed desire to save including a need for education on how to save. The KIIs participants also shared these sentiments.

“…Help us…. save money that can be capital…….so [we] can do something and return with interest…that money can sustain…and the group continues.” (R8 FGD 10 Kaloleni). “…Give them [CHVs] some allowance….then out of this allowance they will be able to save something and….appreciate…and [be encouraged].” (KII 08).

Building up their savings pool was seen as a way of enhancing economic freedom. The cash would subsequently be ploughed into their businesses to grow their investments. Saving groups were the preferred option as they promote wealth accumulation and boost household resilience [36]. Additionally when pooled the savings may be used for joint business developmental projects just as proposed by the CHVs in this study. Over time however from the studies that have used the UPG model this has had negative results with participants saving less towards the end of the intervention [26]. The likely reason for this is the elastic relationship between increasing income and savings whereby possibly as a result of business expansion borrowing and the need to save decreases [27].

5. Healthcare

CHVs are community champions of health yet they had limited access to healthcare services. The financial burden of meeting their own healthcare needs was also enormous. They expressed desire for direct access to healthcare services including tokens for themselves and their family members thereby enabling them to focus on the healthcare needs of their fellow community members.

“My request is for our hospital XXX they should stock the drugs for us because there are those who can go to the chemist and there are those who cannot….Our people suffer… She was taken there… told there is no medicine she has to go and buy she returned and stayed at home with her illness.” (R4 FGD 2 Rabai).

The CHVs believed that they at the very least deserve access to basic/essential medical services at no additional cost. They were sometimes unable to afford even cheap medications. Some left medical facilities unattended to due to lack of finances. The UPG model recognises health support through two strategies the first being education and information dissemination the second being healthcare provision [27]. However sustainability is a concern. Physical infrastructure such as water and sanitation facilities and healthcare infrastructure and resource where limited impede sustained progress at the household levels particularly where UPG intervention beneficiaries remain vulnerable to macro-level and ecological shocks [26].

6. Social integration

The CHVs in this study emphasised a consistent thread of a need for community engagement acceptability and identity. CHVs are the social link between communities and the healthcare system. A lack of recognition by and integration into the community is a major challenge at meeting their programme-related duties. The CHVs in this study requested that they get some form of recognition provided by the government or CHV programmes within the community. They also asked for formal introduction to the community leaders and consideration for engagement or inclusion during governance meetings that concern the communities they serve.

“…If we…can be recognized…we can get a badge t-shirt so when we get in the community they know these are the CHVs….there are places [where] we are despised…we go just with our clothes…if you tell them to dig a toilet they tell you go tell the doctor who sent you to come and dig that toilet…but if we have the apparels…they will give us the respect and even our work will continue on well”. (R5 FGD 2 Rabai). “We would like to have uniform…bags… then people will respect us they will say these women are working at the hospital.” (R7 FGD 6 Kaloleni).

On social integration the KIIs had this to say:

“…If we gave them space in our facility… [then] they can have a central place where they can come and discuss their things with us.” (KII 06).

In this way they are suggesting some shared space and partnership with the CHVs in form of community embeddedness. This is the final stage of the UPG model by which time through the model the social capital social wealth and developments of beneficiaries is believed to have grown through the intervention [27]. This creates a sense of social prestige [26]. In our study the desire for community embeddedness was similar to other studies where CHVs reported that recognition by their communities built social capital for them strengthening their motivation to continue working and increased their accountability to the communities they served [3] 38. In addition self-worth is cultivated among individuals due to improved visibility and empowerment within their communities providing a sense of control over their livelihoods. Interventions such as the UPG model in this regard has social and economic policy inclusivity implications whereby the economic empowerment it provides gives the poor an opportunity to voice their needs and reduces discrimination [35].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZG90LmxhL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtdHJhdmVsLWNvdmlkLTE5LTI2NTQ4MjAwMzkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could the EU's Universal COVID Passport Serve as a Blueprint for the US?,Keerthi Vedantam is a bioscience reporter at dot.LA.

""When I was working in psychiatry a patient cancelled his appointment with me three times because he didn't want to be treated by a 'foreign doctor'"" 30-year-old practitioner Navid Ghan told AFP.

""In the end he didn't have any choice I was the only doctor available.

During the appointment even though he saw that I spoke Swedish without an accent he told me 'you foreigners you don't understand anything'"" Ghan said.

Ghan whose name has been changed at his request to protect his identity is not even a 'foreigner': he was raised and earned his medical degree in Sweden.

""Now my colleagues and I joke about it in the lunch room. The nurses arrive and say 'they cancelled again when they saw your name'.""

Since 2010 as part of a broader reform to Sweden's universal healthcare system that opened up primary healthcare to private actors patients have been allowed to choose their own doctor and clinic.

Prior to the reform Swedes were assigned a clinic based on where they lived.

But as tensions smoulder over rising immigration in traditionally homogeneous Sweden the reform has made it possible for patients to refuse to be treated by non-ethnic Swedes.

Sweden has seen its immigrant population double in the past two decades statistics show and support for the far-right Sweden Democrats has surged to 20 percent to make it the third-biggest party.

'Fair-skinned'

Lars Arrhenius is the head of Sweden's Equality Ombudsman a government agency that promotes equal rights and combats discrimination.

He said that choosing a doctor based on ethnicity is a ""worrying development"".

At the end of March 1011 doctors and medical students signed an appeal in daily newspaper Expressen calling on ""the responsible authorities to act against racism"" in their field.

In July the country's largest broadsheet Dagens Nyheter published an investigative series exposing the scope of the problem.

Journalists posing as patients who had recently moved to a new city or town called 120 healthcare clinics and asked that their new doctor be an ethnic Swede.

A total of 51 clinics agreed to the request 40 refused. Only a handful explicitly said the request was unacceptable.

""We have Maria Sanna and Elsa. Three fair-skinned women"" one medical secretary told a journalist.

Gender Equality Minister Marta Stenevi whose brief includes the fight against discrimination told AFP the practice was ""totally unacceptable"" after meeting various actors in the healthcare sector to address the issue.

The head of the Swedish Junior Doctors' Association Madeleine Liljegren said clinics often consented to the requests because of ""competition between healthcare clinics over patients.""

The more patients a clinic has the more state funding it gets.

Lack of support

""The nurses likely think 'I'll agree to their request' -- as shocking and horrible as it is -- just to keep the patient"" said Liljegren noting that some clinics do not have enough patients to stay afloat financially.

Makih Fatelahi a hospital doctor in the southern Swedish county of Kronoberg whose name has also been changed says some patients are concerned about communication issues.

""The problem is that they only see your name when the appointment is made.

You don't get a chance to establish an in-person contact before you get rejected"" the 28-year-old tells told AFP.

The number of cases of discrimination against doctors of foreign origin is not known.

In 2020 more than 3500 general discrimination complaints were filed to the Equality Ombudsman 1146 of which concerned ""ethnicity"".

Sweden's health care system relies heavily on immigrant workers who are often employed as nursing assistants. In 2020 2401 doctors received medical licences in Sweden almost half of whom earned their degrees abroad.

Navid Ghan said he doe not feel supported by his superiors even though they have seen the discrimination he has faced.

Many doctors with foreign names complain about a lack of internal procedures at their workplaces for how to respond in such situations.

""You end up not paying any attention to (the discrimination). I use an algorithm to not let my emotions get the better of me: Does this patient really need my help? If yes I take care of the patient and ignore the comments. If not I ask a colleague to take my place"" Ghan said."

El presidente de la Cámara de Industria Comercio y Servicios (ICAM) Ramón Daza dijo que esta actividad ilícita ocasiona que las compañías locales “presenten una caída en sus ventas de entre 30 y 40% lo que pone en riesgo cientos de empleos y la estabilidad en las operaciones (…)”.

Alertó que la venta de estas mercancías ilegales se normalizó en Cochabamba “al punto de comercializarse a través redes sociales y deliverys”.

La gente se inclina por estas ofertas porque por ejemplo el azúcar harina de trigo fideos y otros alimentos importados de manera ilegal cuestan 25% menos que los productos nacionales.

El presidente de la Cámara Nacional de Industrias Ibo Blazicevic añadió que de un tiempo a esta parte la mercadería de contrabando no solo es ofrecida en los centros de abasto de la metrópoli cochabambina sino también en el Trópico.

Solo en Cochabamba Daza estimó que el contrabando alcanza los 500 millones de dólares anuales.

IMPACTO Daza explicó que hay siete productos principales que ingresan de manera ilegal: alimentos bebidas textiles muebles productos farmacéuticos calzados y ropa usada.

Detalló que el impacto en el rubro alimenticio varía. En el caso de la molinería la disminución va entre un 30% y 40%; lácteos gira en torno al 40%; para productores o importadores de otros alimentos en promedio es de 12%.

Añadió que más de dos terceras partes del contrabando están vinculadas con los puertos del Pacífico. Chile -incluyendo ZOFRI- es el país desde donde ingresa la mayor cantidad de mercancías ilegales seguido de Brasil Argentina Perú y finalmente Paraguay.

ANÁLISIS Jaime Yapur expresidente de la ex Cámara Departamental de Industria de Cochabamba lamentó que hasta ahora “no se ha hecho mucho por frenar el contrabando en Bolivia.

Llamó a las autoridades a tomar conciencia sobre la importancia de las empresas legalmente establecidas ya que generan impuestos empleos formales y una cadena de ventas.

Verizon and our vendor partners were able to restore fiber to the Hammond area and deploy portable assets to the Raceland area so at this time there are no longer any significant gaps in service anywhere throughout the storm-impacted areas in Louisiana. While we take a moment to celebrate this milestone we are far from mission complete.

With commercial power restoration still potentially several weeks out we will continue to maintain massive refueling and maintenance operations to ensure our permanent and temporary generators remain fully operational.

While cell towers are processing traffic there is still minor repair work to displaced antennas and damaged equipment. Our engineers have dispatched teams throughout the market to make those repairs and customers will continue to see an improvement in speed and throughput as those repairs are made.

We have dozens of temporary assets deployed throughout the storm-impacted areas. Some are providing temporary connections to cell sites while we work towards permanent fiber repair while others are serving EOCs first responders and shelters. Those assets will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

There is a long road ahead for the storm-weary residents of Louisiana and Verizon will remain here with you keeping you connected to friends family and the resources you need as you rebuild.

Network update

While the vast majority of Verizon’s network is up and serving customers throughout Louisiana we are beginning to see some overnight impacts from power restoration and debris clearing efforts. As teams replace poles and clear debris such as trees downed lines and rubble from buildings fiber lines can accidentally be cut severing service to a cell tower. Our EOC is monitoring for these impacts and we retain Verizon fiber crews and vendor partners in the market to respond immediately as those issues arise.

With crews working around the clock Verizon service has been largely restored to the coastal markets including the hardest hit Grand Isle community. Satellite connections and generators are keeping those sites on air. Meanwhile several portable assets are still deployed to the coastal markets to support FEMA the EOC and first responders.

Areas of challenge remain in Raceland and Hammond.

In Hammond severe debris has caused multiple fiber cuts. Fiber crews have been working for days and while they have repaired numerous fiber breaks several still remain. The crews will continue their fiber repair work throughout the day today but in the meantime Verizon engineers are deploying satellite assets to provide temporary connection until that fiber work is completed.

In Raceland extensive fiber damage is also slowing recovery but temporary satellite assets are being deployed to those markets today as well.

Entergy estimates full power restoral could take another 2-4 weeks so Verizon’s teams continue massive refueling and maintenance operations for permanent and portable generators. For sites that are still inaccessible because of residual flooding teams are using airboats and recreational vehicles to ensure generators are refueled keeping first responders and customer connected to critical resources friend and family.

Over 700 site surveys and assessments have been completed and tower crews are actively climbing towers to replace or repair antennas coax cable and other equipment that may have been damaged by the record winds of Ida. As equipment is repaired both coverage of the cell site and the capacity of traffic those sites can handle will continue to improve.

Relief crews have arrived in Louisiana and Verizon team members are rotating shifts to ensure the safety and well-being of our teams while maintaining our rigorous recovery schedule. We remain committed to providing continued critical communication services to this storm-weary community.

Network Update

Restoration and repair work continued overnight with Verizon teams bringing additional sites back into service. The significant areas of focus remain the coastal areas and just outside of Hammond. Fiber restoration crews are actively working to repair the fiber ring that serves the sites in and around Hammond and we anticipate restoral of service soon in that area. In the coastal areas we have deployed temporary mobile equipment and will be sending additional portable satellite links there today to provide service. The storm caused significant structural damage to a dozen cell towers many in the coastal markets which will need reconstruction work to restore service to those permanent sites. While we are already in the process of getting that work started we expect those sites to take an extended period of time to rebuild and turn back up. We will however continue to move in satellite link assets to those locations and provide service through those temporary designs until the original infrastructure can be returned to service.

Verizon teams have deployed 65 portable generators to supplement the numerous permanent generators built into the design of our network. Refueling efforts will continue throughout the day today to keep our facilities running until permanent power is restored. Maintenance on generators which have been running since the beginning of the storm will continue throughout the day as well.

Network Update

Restoration efforts are moving at a brisk pace this afternoon with the engineering team recovering several more sites throughout Louisiana. Specifically Orleans Parish Jefferson Parish and St. Helena Parish now have ubiquitous coverage. Fiber instability issues in Hammond are resulting in some service fluctuations in that area. Teams also continue their focus on restoration work and deploying temporary network infrastructure in Lockport Raceland Plaquemine and Port Sulphur. Significant structural damage in many of those areas are causing longer timelines for restoral. Temporary network assets are in place or are in the process of being moved to those locations.

Verizon engineers are working with FEMA to provide connectivity for a mobile housing unit moving into the area. Additionally to support FEMA efforts the Verizon tethered drone flew near Golden Meadows to provide LTE coverage from the sky.

Refueling efforts and site surveys to determine damage and recovery plans are ongoing. Safety remains our top priority for all Verizon team members working on recovery efforts so as emergency team members who have been working since before the storm made landfall rotate out of the market new team members rotate in to continue the hard work. In lieu of physical command centers our virtual command center in Louisiana remains activated (in accordance with recommended social distancing policies) and our employees are using additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as they engage in recovery efforts.

Louisiana

Verizon network teams made tremendous progress overnight bringing cell sites back online and restoring service in storm-impacted areas. As fiber lines are repaired allowing data to travel back to the core of the network we are able to redeploy the temporary satellite assets to other locations still in need of temporary fiber relief. To date we have removed and redeployed almost a dozen satellite assets. Also overnight we were able to secure an additional satellite link which will allow for increased data traffic to be managed by the portable satellite assets we have on the ground.

We have completed over 600 site surveys to determine the extent of damage and repair needs to network facilities and are actively working restoration plans for those sites. Additional antennas radios and other equipment are being shipped in to make repairs to damaged towers and bring service back to pre-storm levels.

The engineering team continues to focus on the most impacted areas of our network.

In Hammond the core of the community has been restored with restoration work still being required in the outer lying areas. Crews are working with fiber providers to make permanent repairs and are moving in satellite assets in that area.

We are still seeing some service impact north of Houma. A portable tower is en route to supplement coverage there today.

Metairi has almost fully restored and we will work to optimize service in that area to manage the volume of data traffic there.

The coastal areas remain the hardest hit areas. Verizon engineers have been able to restore service to some sites south towards Grand Isles and in Plaquemine towards Venice but complete devastation of those areas has slowed restoration. Today we will be deploying a drone that will provide cell service from the sky to help search-and-rescue teams in those areas and we will continue to move satellite assets and portable generators to that area as accessibility allows.

With countless permanent generators and almost 70 portable generators providing power to our facilities massive refueling operations continue today. Teams will also begin the work of generator maintenance for those generators that have been running since the beginning of this recovery effort.

Northeast:

The command center in Scarsdale that was damaged by massive flooding is now fully restored and back online. Wireline customers with fiber services have full services restored. Our teams will be reaching out to customers on older copper technology in the coming days to restore their services either through an upgrade to fiber technology or with an alternative voice connection. All wireless cell service in the area is fully restored. This will be the final update on network recovery and performance for the northeast area.

Refueling of permanent and portable generators continues with teams coordinating access to restricted roads through local emergency management teams. With commercial power outages stretching into the coming days and weeks Verizon has mobilized additional portable generators from surrounding markets.

Fiber teams continue to work on repairs to fiber lines. Until those repairs are complete Verizon engineers continue to deploy satellite links to use as an interim solution to restore service to cell sites.

We continue to deploy mobile satellite-linked cell sites in support of first responders and are providing service to numerous police departments fire departments and Emergency Operation Centers. Additional assets are being deployed throughout the evening to supplement coverage in Golden Meadow Lockport Larousse and the southern coastline of Lake Pontchartrain.

Northeast

The devastating rainfall in the northeast left a central office in Scarsdale NY flooded causing copper fiber and wireless service interruptions from White Plains down to Mount Vernon. Teams have been working throughout the day to pump water out mitigate water damage remove debris clean equipment remove and replace unrecoverable equipment and restore service. Those efforts continue and we expect to see service begin to restore for fiber and wireless customers overnight. Quick restoration is one of the benefits of using fiber optics or wireless connections to deliver service to homes and businesses. Repairs for some customers primarily those connecting to the network with legacy copper technology will require more time.

Throughout the rest of the Northeast Verizon engineers continue refueling efforts to keep generators running in the midst of commercial power losses and are conducting extensive site inspections at network facilities. The Verizon network is designed for reliability and many redundant systems such as secondary fiber links back-up power and backup cooling systems are running as designed to keep the network in service for the community and first responders.

As Ida continued her trek across the US tornadoes and flooding impacted the Northeast yesterday evening and overnight as record rainfall was reported in New Jersey and New York City. Meanwhile recovery efforts continue in Louisiana where there is still widespread power outages massive flooding and widespread debris.

Louisiana:

Overall the Verizon network remains strong in Louisiana however recovery efforts changes in commercial power and flood waters continue to create a dynamic environment for our field teams. Most customers in areas that have cell sites out-of-service are receiving service from nearby sites. However there are still a few areas with service gaps including St. James Parish the coastal communities Hammond and the southern coastline of Lake Pontchartrain. Our teams are focusing efforts on site restoral and moving mobile assets into these areas as quickly as they are able to access them.

Overnight teams completed an additional 150 site surveys uncovering additional damage or displacement to antennas. As tower crews climb to repair those both coverage and capacity on those towers will be improved.

To date Verizon engineers have mobilized and activated 19 mobile cell sites and satellite trailers to assist first responders and provide coverage to residents in the impacted area.

Over 32 portable generators have been moved into the area and refueling efforts to keep both the portable and permanent generators running until commercial power is restored continue. Verizon teams are confident we have the fuel and processes in place to keep those generators running.

Our Verizon Response Team remains deployed across the impacted areas and working 24/7 to coordinate with first responders. The team is in contact with federal state and local emergency management teams and is coordinating communication needs and efforts with these agencies. The Verizon Response Team has now deployed more than 900 Verizon Frontline solutions to support more than 38 public sector organizations including hospitals emergency operations centers multiple public safety agencies and federal state and local government offices.

The Verizon Response Team is expected to remain on scene as long as needed to assist public safety agencies as they continue to conduct search and rescue operations and deal with widespread power outages flooding and catastrophic storm damage.

Northeast:

In the northeast a central office in Scarsdale NY was flooded causing copper fiber and wireless service interruptions from White Plains down to Mount Vernon. Engineers are currently pumping water out and moving mobile equipment to that central office to restore service. While there are scattered impacts in other areas of the Northeast overlapping coverage (coverage from nearby network facilities) is providing service to most customers. Teams will begin site surveys and damage assessment this morning of poles towers and other network facilities.

Backup generators are running keeping network facilities online in the areas with commercial power outages. Refueling operations will begin as needed to keep those facilities online until commercial power is restored.

Verizon Network teams continue to make strong progress in our restoration efforts especially in the hardest hit areas of LaPlace Port Sulphur Thibodaux the Southern coastline of Lake Pontchartrain Hammond St. Helena Parish and Houma. Overnight Verizon engineers were able to restore partial service to many of those areas.

Despite flooding downed power lines and debris blocking access to many locations our teams have completed over 100 site surveys some completed with airboats. As site surveys are completed our engineers are identifying power outages broken fiber lines (which carry data from the cell site to the switch and core locations of the network) and numerous antennas that are broken or misdirected as a result of hurricane force winds. Engineers are activating recovery plans to address each of these issues.

Antennas:

If an antenna is not working or is pointing towards the ground or sky as opposed to towards customers even if the cell site is on air it will not carry optimized levels of cellular traffic. Verizon has teams of tower climbers and repair crews mobilizing today to fix the damage to antennas to optimize coverage and capacity at each of our sites that were damaged by the storm.

Fiber:

Verizon fiber teams are deployed throughout the market today to assist in repairing fiber connections. Meanwhile our engineering teams are deploying satellite links and temporary microwave connections which will help bring cell sites back online until permanent fiber repairs can be made.

Power:

Commercial power outages continue so refueling efforts for permanent and temporary generators continue in earnest. Verizon crews have also mobilized portable generators to restore power to areas without commercial power or permanent generator backup.

Verizon crews have deployed a dozen mobile assets such as temporary satellite-connected cell sites to assist emergency operations centers fire departments search and rescue FEMA and others in LaFourche Parish St. Charles Parish Jefferson Parish St. John the Baptist Parish and more. Deployments continue today as we work to provide coverage to the hardest hit areas where cell sites are still off air and where rescue and recovery teams are hard at work.

In lieu of physical command centers our virtual command center in Louisiana is activated (in accordance with recommended social distancing policies) and our employees are using additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as they engage in recovery efforts.

Despite the widespread flooding commercial power outages and structural devastation caused by Hurricane Ida currently 85% of Verizon cell sites that were in the path of the storm are in service. About half of our out-of-service sites have overlapping coverage from nearby sites meaning most customers are able to get a signal. Many hard hit areas that were experiencing loss of service yesterday are now fully or partially restored including Morgan City Thibodaux Houma and Port Sulphur. We are still seeing some gaps in service in coastal areas of Louisiana LaPlace St. Helena Parish and the southern coastline of Lake Pontchartrain.

Additionally we have responded to numerous requests from first responders deploying mobile satellite linked cell sites to local and state emergency operation centers and sheriff’s departments. Numerous more mobile assets are in process of being deployed to support shelters hospitals 911 centers FEMA parish command centers and other support organizations.

Our Verizon Response team is deployed in the impacted areas and working 24/7 to coordinate with first responders. We are in contact with federal state and local emergency management teams and are coordinating communication needs and efforts with them. The Verizon Response Team has deployed more than 200 Verizon Frontline solutions to support more than 20 public sector agencies conducting emergency response operations in Southeastern Louisiana. First responder customers with wireless priority service should utilize *272 when placing calls.

Throughout the day our engineers and technicians have been using multiple means of transportation - including air boats - to complete site survey work in inaccessible areas and restore service to impacted cell sites. They will continue to deploy mobile assets as needed work with our fiber vendors to repair broken fiber and continue massive refueling operations to keep generators running until commercial power is restored. There are some impacts to fiber connections in the area (fiber transports data from our cell sites to network switch and core locations) so teams set up satellite backhaul trailers to provide temporary connection to macro towers until fiber is restored.

In accordance with recommended social distancing policies Verizon has activated a virtual command center in Louisiana and our employees are using additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as they engage in recovery efforts.

Verizon Foundation donates $100000 to support Hurricane Ida relief efforts in Louisiana

In light of the devastation left in the wake of Hurricane Ida the Verizon Foundation is making a $100000 donation to the Foundation for Louisiana. Verizon’s donation will support the Hurricane Ida Relief Fund for Evacuation and Recovery to help Louisiana communities that were impacted by this week’s storm.

“The communities where we work and live are the lifeblood of our business. Supporting our customers neighbors and friends during a crisis is what we do best” said Ronan Dunne executive vice president and CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. “We are committed to helping Louisianans recover from this catastrophic storm.”

“For 16 years the Foundation for Louisiana has been a mission-critical philanthropy that ensures all Louisianans are included in designing an effective recovery in disaster and strengthening communities out of disaster time” said Flozell Daniels Jr. CEO & President Foundation for Louisiana. “Verizon has been a stalwart partner in resourcing these efforts and holding a true commitment to Louisiana’s people. This is our second time working with Verizon to respond to our communities and we appreciate the consistent support.”

Network Update

Less than 24 hours after Hurricane Ida moved out of the gulf Verizon’s network team is deep into recovery and support efforts. Despite extensive flooding and debris preventing access to some facilities site surveys to assess damage to cell sites and network facilities are ongoing – some being completed with airboat reconnaissance. The team has prioritized restoration efforts focusing on first responders and search and recovery efforts.

In downtown New Orleans and Baton Rouge there are a few scattered cell sites experiencing issues but the majority of Verizon customers are experiencing minimal service interruptions thanks to overlapping coverage (service from nearby cell sites.) Our teams are focused on assessment and recovery plans for the areas with gaps in coverage which include the coastal areas of Louisiana Thibodaux Morgan City Houma Slidell Hammond La Place and the southern coastline of Lake Pontchartrain.

We are continuing a massive refueling operation to keep our generators at our cell sites and network facilities running for our customers until commercial power is restored. Our engineers are confident we have the fuel and crews we need to keep that operation running 24x7 until that happens.

Last night Verizon engineers began deploying mobile assets (temporary mobile network equipment) bringing up one cell site in Morgan City using satellite links to connect the cell site and deploying two mobile cell sites in support of government and fire department staging areas.

Today’s recovery efforts include an aggressive plan for further deployment of mobile assets to support local shelters state and local emergency operations centers 911 centers hospitals sheriff departments and fire departments. With flooding still a significant barrier our teams will be using highboy trailers and airboats to assist with these deployments and activations. We will also focus on fiber restoration or temporary replacements for fiber (which provides the connection between cell sites and the rest of the network) using satellite links or microwave links.

Network Update

As the most severe hurricane to make landfall in this storm-weary area in years continues inland it has left commercial power outages extensive flooding and significant structural damage throughout the area in its wake. Despite the extensive devastation Verizon’s network remains resilient and our teams are actively assessing the situation to engage rapidly in recovery efforts.

While we are seeing sites out of service in the heaviest hit areas overlapping sites are offering some coverage to residents and first responders who remain there. Our backup generators and batteries are running to keep many of our cell sites and facilities in service in the midst of extremely widespread commercial power outages.

Once the storm subsides and it is safe to do so our crews will begin site assessments to prioritize repairs move mobile assets into place as needed and activate a massive refueling operation to keep sites running until commercial power is restored. Our mobile cell sites generators drones and satellite links are moving into the area from the safe zones where they were pre-staged before the storm. We will prioritize assistance for first responders emergency operation centers and search and rescue efforts.

Our Network teams and vendor partners are staffing our 24x7 virtual wireless command center and we are in contact with federal state and local emergency management teams and are coordinating communications needs and efforts with them.

As Hurricane Ida makes its way to the Gulf Verizon teams in the storm-weary markets prepare to once again provide critical communications before during and after the storm. The likelihood of potential flooding is high and accompanying commercial outages are expected. Verizon engineers are topping off generators and pre-staging trucks with fuel readying mobile network assets for rapid deployment preparing satellite and microwave equipment as redundancy connections if fiber is impacted and activating response teams to keep customers and first-responders connected. Despite numerous mobile assets being deployed in support of wild fire efforts in the west flooding in Tennessee assisting in processing Afghan refugees and ongoing support for the pandemic response Verizon has pre-staged numerous emergency assets outside of the storm’s projected path.

“We are actively preparing for Ida and our Verizon team is ready to support the community as yet another major storm impacts this area” said Kyle Malady Chief Technology Officer at Verizon. “We know our customers count on us especially during tough times and we will be there with them every step of the way to provide reliable connections to critical resources colleagues friends and family.”

Verizon is ready.

Many new vehicles sold today come with integrated wireless modems allowing Wi-Fi connectivity in the vehicle via traditional cellular networks. The catch is that typically you can't simply add your car's hotspot to your existing plan; you have to pay an additional fee through the vehicle manufacturer. However Volkswagen has now announced that it is the first automaker to work with both Verizon and T-Mobile to offer car buyers choice on the provider for their mobile data plan.

The best part of the announcement is that owners who are on Verizon or T-Mobile will be able to add their vehicle to existing mobile data plans. VW says its Carrier of Choice service will launch in late September for model year 2020 and forward vehicles that feature Volkswagen Car-Net capability.

The benefit to adding your vehicle as a hotspot is that while you're driving devices that don't have their own integrated wireless data plans can still get online and play games check email and stream other content. Connectivity in the car is particularly important to people who work a lot from the road and need to be able to send and receive emails and do other tasks no matter where they are.

VW reminds that Car-Net offers significant levels of connected technology and has an updated mobile app and multiple free features for the first five years of ownership on most models. The service also offers a subscription option. Some features include remote access parking information and more directly from an iPhone or Android device.

VW buyers who don't use Verizon or T-Mobile can choose an unlimited data plan for their vehicle through either carrier for $20 per month plus fees and taxes. Car-Net is standard equipment on most 2020 model year and newer Volkswagen vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvMDgvMjkvc2F2ZS1zdHJlYW1pbmctdGhyb3VnaC15b3VyLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWNvbXBhbnktd2lyZWxlc3MtY2Fycmllci81NjAyODQ0MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save on streaming through your credit card company or wireless carrier,"Rob Pegoraro

Special to USA TODAY

With competition between streaming video services growing ever more intense the contestants in this crowded category are taking their marketing pitches to some unusual places.

They’re trying to win new subscribers with cash-back discounts on some credit cards and offers of free service on some wireless plans opening new ways for cost-conscious customers to trim their entertainment budgets and offset recent rate hikes.

“The partnership activity has just ramped up” says Steve Nason research director with Texas-based tech consultancy Parks Associates. Even though some customers will drop a service after its deal expires enough subscribers do stick around: “There’s a lot of value in bringing them in.”

Certain credit cards – not only high-end rewards cards but no-annual-fee options – have increasingly featured streaming services among their merchant-specific cash-back deals for customers who opt into these deals.

At the end of July for example my American Express account listed an offer of $20 back off $60 or more spent at the sports-centric service FuboTV good for up to three times plus $25 back on $99 or more spent on an HBO Max annual subscription.

► Streamline your streaming expenses: 8 proven ways to lower monthly internet cable and streaming bills

At various points this year I’ve seen comparable cash-back deals via Amex and Chase from Discovery+ Disney+ Paramount+ Peacock and Showtime.

“Streaming services is an easy category for issuers to offer high rewards since it seems exciting/young and has easily built-in limits as to how much people can spend there” writes Chuck Sithe senior editor at the Doctor of Credit blog.

Sithe added that some cards now offer their own credits and bonuses for streaming expenses; Chase’s no-fee Freedom Flex for example has once again made streaming one of the categories eligible for 5% cash back this quarter for customers who opt in.

(Doctor of Credit often recommends particular cards but unlike many rewards-cards blogs does not collect affiliate payments from card issuers.)

The three nationwide wireless carriers represent another route to get streaming services for free or discounted. AT&T throws in HBO Max with its highest-end plans; T-Mobile provides the basic (as in non-HD) version of Netflix on plans with two or more lines; Verizon offers six or 12 months of Discovery+ and either provides 6 months of Disney+ or bundles it outright depending on the plan.

Nason points to the Verizon-Disney deal as an example of effective promotion: “Disney+ would not be where it’s at without Verizon.”

Because streaming services almost never impose the contracts that remain common (and poorly documented) in cable TV subscribers can take advantage of these discounts and freebies to binge-watch a series they like and then cancel.

That represents a real risk for these firms. The market-research firm Screen Engine-ASI’s Diffusion Group subsidiary surveyed 644 people currently on free trials from various subscription streaming services and found that 45% said they were likely or certain to drop the service after the trial ended 38% said they’d pay and 17% weren’t sure.

Nason however suggests that customer churn would be less likely to limit future streaming deals than potential media mergers between some of these rivals especially now that so many media companies have already launched streaming services.

“The playing field to a large extent has been set” he says. “If there’s a lot of consolidation then the big guys will just get bigger and they may not need to rely as much on these partnerships.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vbmV3cy9pcGhvbmUtMTItbWluaS1kZWFsLWJlc3QtYnV50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save $300 on the iPhone 12 Mini in this massive Best Buy deal,"It's not every day that you get a $300 saving on the latest Apple gear but that's exactly what this Best Buy deal offers.

“Hearst Magazines and Verizon Media may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.”

Both Drew Barrymore and her fans are feeling very overwhelmed with her ongoing kitchen renovation.

On Sunday the 46-year-old talk show host shared a five-minute clip of herself walking through the center of her kitchen upgrade project. As she explained Drew is painting her walls in shades of green and beige using her own Flower Home paint in Palm Leaf Green and Flower Home paint in Toasted Almond. She is also aiming to layer in art and incorporate more brass details into the space.

Though The Wedding Singer star assured her fans that everything was going ""very well"" Drew did have an oh-so relatable freakout moment toward the end of the clip after showing fans the messier side of her renovation project. At one point Drew starts screaming as she glances into nearby rooms which were full of stuff that had been moved from the kitchen.

""What have I done to myself?!"" Drew shouts at one point. ""If you have that feeling too — oh god!""

Thankfully Drew seemed much calmer at the end of the clip. Even still some of Drew's fans were clearly feeling for the actress after seeing how visibly overwhelmed she was during the kitchen tour. ""This would give me so much anxiety but I love the colors"" one fan wrote. ""Honestly this stresses me out! I hope you will get your kitchen back soon!! So exciting!!❤️"" another said. ""I can’t wait to see finished work!!! Hope you aren’t living in this… I did and nearly lost my mind… highly do not recommend 😂"" someone else remarked.

Of course we're more than confident the end result will be worth all of the chaos. After all Drew does have an amazing home collection that hopefully will make the process easier. See a few of her amazing pieces from Flower Home below:

In the meantime we'll be refreshing Instagram until Drew posts more updates from her renovation process. Who knows maybe we'll see the finished product when The Drew Barrymore Show is back on starting September 13. Either way we'll be cheering Drew on from afar!

The Alice test officially includes two steps. But these are highly correlated steps. Thus if a claim fails step one it usually fails step two as well. In this case the court appears to borrow heavily from typical step two analysis in order to make its step one conclusion:

Universal Secure Registry v. Apple and Visa (Fed. Cir. 2021)

The district court dismissed USR’s patent infringement complaint holding of all four asserted patents were ineligible under the abstract idea test incorporated into 35 U.S.C. § 101. On appeal the Federal Circuit has affirmed. U.S. Patent Nos. 8856539; 8577813; 9100826; and 9530137.

The patents here are directed to technology for securing electronic payment transactions. This is an area of technology that the Federal Circuit has previously addressed. Here the court notes that cases “often turn[] on whether the claims provide sufficient specificity to constitute an improvement to computer functionality itself.” Slip Op. Note that this statement from the court has two specific requirements: (1) that the claims be drafted with specificity; and (2) that the element claimed by an “improvement to computer functionality.” Generic claims are not enough; neither are specific claim limitations directed toward elements already well known in the art.

Secured Mail Solutions LLC v. Universal Wilde Inc. 873 F.3d 905 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (use of conventional generically claimed barcode to communicate information about the object being mailed was an abstract idea).

Electronic Communication Technologies LLC v. ShoppersChoice.com LLC 958 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (requirement of input storage and use of generically claimed authentication information was abstract).

Solutran Inc. v. Elavon Inc. 931 F.3d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (use of well known check verification method did not save the claims from being abstract).

Prism Technologies LLC v. T-Mobile USA 696 F. App’x 1014 (Fed. Cir.

2017) (receiving and authenticating identity data to permit access was abstract since they were claimed generically rather than offering a “concrete specific solution”).

Here the claimed method enables a merchant transaction. The merchant is given a time-varying code instead of a credit card number. That code is then set the credit card company servers for authorization including any restrictions on transactions with the merchant. The company then either approves or denies the transaction. This approach allows for purchases without actually providing the merchant with the “secure information” such as the credit card or account number.

The district court identified the abstract idea here of “obtaining the secure verification of a user’s identity to enable a transaction.” On appeal the Federal Circuit suggested that analysis wasn’t entirely correct but did agree that the claims are directed to an abstract idea.

In our view the claims “simply recite conventional actions in a generic way” (e.g. receiving a transaction request verifying the identity of a customer and merchant allowing a transaction) and “do not purport to improve any underlying technology.” Solutran. Accordingly the claims are directed to an abstract idea under Alice step one. [T]he asserted claims are directed to a method for verifying the identity of a user to facilitate an economic transaction for which computers are merely used in a conventional way rather than a technological improvement to computer functionality itself.

Slip Op. The court found this case “closer to the demarcation line between what is abstract and non-abstract” than some other cases but still on the wrong side of the line.

As you’ll see the court’s conclusions in Alice Step One (conventional actions in a generic way) fully answer Alice Step Two as well. The court particularly notes that time-varying codes were already well known in the field. Further this case of using a third-party intermediary is also well known and an abstract idea itself.

Invalidity Affirmed.

The Somerset Athletic Hall of Fame was established in 1984 and held its first induction in 1986. Inductions were held annually for the first 20 years and every other year since then.

The 2021 induction class will be inducted on Saturday night May 7 2022 at The Fall River Country Club.

And yet even with his 14-5 record in games where he starts and plays more than half the game Garbers gets little love from the experts who rate the best in the conference. USC’s Kedon Slovis and Arizona State’s Jayden Daniels are typically considered the headliners and the Cal senior is often an afterthought.

He wasn’t a candidate to make our list of Top-5 all-time Cal quarterbacks and he has yet to write the final entries in his resume that will determine whether he even fits in among the Top 10.

Although he has been competent his record to a large degree has been a function of Cal’s strong defense under coach Justin Wilcox. Compare that to the environment Jared Goff played in under Sonny Dykes where the Bears were helpless on defense and Goff’s gaudy passing numbers added up to a three-year record of 14-23.

During the height of coach Jeff Tedford’s coaching reign Nate Longshore (20-9 as a starter from 2005-09) and Kevin Riley (20-13 from 2008-10) became the only two quarterbacks in recent Cal history to accumulate at least 20 wins as starters.

Aaron Rodgers (2003-04) was 17-5 while Mike Pawlawski (1988-91) compiled a ledger of 17-6-1 as a starter. Both were obviously talented but they also had strong supporting casts.

With seven victories this season — an ambitious but reasonable goal — Garbers will have 21 career wins more than any Cal starting quarterback in a half-century. How will we judge him at that point?

Our ranking of the Top-5 Cal quarterbacks:

1. AARON RODGERS (2003-04)

(Jeopardy Productions)

Credentials: Where to start? Rodgers was a revelation in his two seasons at Cal posting a 150.3 pass efficiency rating (using the college formula) with 43 touchdowns and just 13 interceptions. In 2004 he tied an NCAA record by completing 23 consecutive passes in a single game — against USC no less — and led the Bears to a 10-2 record. In the NFL his passer rating is the highest in history among players with at least five seasons. He has won a Super Bowl and last season claimed his third league MVP.

One more reason we picked him No. 1: This isn’t really close. But if we needed another piece of evidence to secure Rodgers’ spot at the top it was his superb two-week run as the celebrity host of “Jeopardy!” Rodgers took the assignment seriously paid homage to the late Alex Trebek and seemed entirely capable of taking on the job full time.

2. STEVE BARTKOWSKI (1972-74)

Credentials: Bartkowski was good enough at Cal that future NFL draft pick Vince Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska. After passing for 2580 yards and completing 56 percent of his attempts as a senior in 1974 Bartkowski’s big arm made him the No. 1 pick in a 1975 NFL draft that also included Randy White and Walter Payton. He had more interceptions than touchdowns in each of his first five seasons with the Atlanta Falcons but Bartkowski was a Pro Bowl selection in 1980 and ’81 when he totaled 61 TDs (39 picks) and threw for more than 7300 yards.

One more reason we picked him No. 2: A legit two-sport star Bartkowski was an All-America first baseman in 1973 after batting .329 for the Bears.

3. JOE KAPP (1956-58)

Credentials: Kapp was far from an elite passer as evidenced by his career totals of seven touchdown passes and 28 interceptions with the Golden Bears. But he also holds Cal’s record for career rushing yards by a quarterback and as a senior led the Bears to the Pacific Coast Conference title and a berth in the Rose Bowl. Cal hasn’t been back in the 62 seasons since then. NFL teams were so unimpressed that Kapp was an 18th round pick in the 1959 draft. He opted to play in Canada where he led the B.C. Lions to consecutive Grey Cup appearances winning the title in 1964. He finally made it to the NFL in 1967 and in ’69 he threw seven touchdowns in a game while leading the Minnesota Vikings to a Super Bowl.

One more reason we picked him No. 3: Before winning his Big Game coaching debut with “The Play” in 1982 Kapp flexed his acting muscles alongside Burt Reynolds in “The Longest Yard” in 1974 and “Semi-Tough” in ’77.

4. JARED GOFF (2013-15)

Credentials: Goff arrived on campus from Marin County just as pass-happy Sonny Dykes took over as coach and the pairing allowed Goff to almost entirely rewrite the Bears’ record book. He threw for 96 touchdowns and more than 12000 yards in three seasons as a starter including a Pac-12 record 43 TDs in 2015. The No. 1 pick in the 2016 NFL draft Goff threw for 32 touchdowns and nearly 4700 yards in his third season helping the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl. His efficiency slipped the past two seasons and he was traded to the Detroit Lions.

One more reason we picked him No. 4: After going 0-7 as a rookie starter Goff compiled a record of 42-20 the past four seasons.

5. CRAIG MORTON (1962-64)

Credentials: A starter for most of three seasons with the Bears Morton was a first-team All-America pick as a senior when he passed for 2121 yards and completed 60 percent of his attempts. He left Cal having set a Pac-8 record with 4501 career passing yards. Picked No. 5 in the NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys Morton shared the starting job with Roger Staubach or Don Meredith for years but quarterbacked the team to a Super Bowl appearance after the 1970 season. In ’77 with Denver he was voted the NFL’s Comeback Player of the Year while leading the Broncos to the Super Bowl.

One more reason we picked him No. 5: On a 3-7 Cal team Morton finished seventh in the 1964 Heisman Trophy voting ahead of both Joe Namath and Gale Sayers.

About me: I was born and raised on Detroit's Westside in the hard working blue-collard Polish neighborhood of Warrendale. I'm a Detroit Public School graduate who fought hard to earn my education. My aspiration into journalism came as a young kid when I began following the corruption scandal of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. My first break in to the journalism world began with the opportunity to work at the Michigan Journal where I primarily reported on campus and local news throughout Dearborn community. I eventually worked my way to news editor. In correlation to work in journalism I had an amazing opportunity to study and write about many different cultures and backgrounds at the Past Institute which also helped me prepare for this role. So with first-hand experience growing up in a tight-knit neighborhood I know the importance of delivering news and telling stories that impact local communities. And as a breaking news editor at Patch for Metro Detroit it's my job to deliver that news. So feel free to contact me about news tips or your own unique experiences at dylan.siwicki@patch.com

Perhaps that’s not surprising since nearly all of the first generation came from Walt Disney Productions 20th Century Fox David O. Selznick Studios and MGM.

Everything unfolds like a movie with dissolves as you move from place to place. Even the music fades from one land to the next. Like a movie your theme park experience starts with a type of opening credits. They start just past the turnstiles above the famous floral Mickey head and just under the clock on the Main Street USA Railroad Station.

Just as his films would fade up to the words “Walt Disney Presents” you can find the Old Maestro’s name as if he were the head of the Walt Disney World Railroad Office. The tag line reads: “Keeping Dreams on Track. Walter E. Disney.”

Walt Disney's window on the Main Street USA Railroad Station at the Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World (Copyright 2021 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)

The tribute to Walt was not something he intended. As best I can tell it was added between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Just as you enter Town Square atop the Confectionary is a nod to Walt’s older brother partner and the financial genius who made Walt Disney World happen: Roy O. Disney.

Enough cannot be said about his impact and legacy. When Walt passed away Roy put off retirement to keep the company going and the dream alive. He died in December 1971 just two months after opening day. His window reads: “If We Can Dream It - We Can Do It!” - Roy O. Disney - Dreamers & Doers Development Co.”

If you gave Walt or Roy’s windows a glance they were probably quickly forgotten as your eye magically drew you to keep strolling down Main Street toward the hub Cinderella Castle.

However if you pause and study it the architecture of each block of Main Street helps tell a story of a small town that is turning into a bigger deal around the turn of the last century. The second-story windows tell tales of their own in cryptic ways.

Don Tatum's window on Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World (Copyright 2021 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)

One of my favorite tales involves Don Tatum a broadcaster with a business mind recruited by Walt in 1956. Tatum became Roy Disney’s right-hand man when it came to building Walt Disney World. By the time construction began Tatum had been named president of Walt Disney Productions and served as chairman and CEO after Roy’s death in December 1971. Officially retiring in 1980 he was a driving force in expanding “The World” and building EPCOT Center.

The story I love learning about is hinted at by the window’s caption. It reads: “M.T. Lott Co. Real Estate Investments - ‘A Friend in Deeds is a Friend Indeed’ - Donn Tatum President - Subsidiaries: Tomahawk Properties Latin American Development Ayefour Corporation Bay Lake Properties Reedy Creek Ranch Lands Compass East Corporation.”

“M.T. (Empty) Lot” was one of the shell companies used to secretly snap up the 27000 acres of scrub marsh and swamp land Walt Disney World was built on. As you might expect Tatum played a starring role. I’ll tell more about that story as we draw closer to Oct. 1. Tatum’s window is above Crystal Arts.

Dick Nunis & Ron Miller's window on Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World (Copyright 2021 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)

Above the Main Street Bakery (aka Starbucks) you’ll see a nod to “The Original Gym - Turkish Baths – Massage Parlor - Supervisor Dick Nunis Night Manager Ron Miller Masseur O. Ferrante.” These three gentlemen are all Disney Legends who first played college football together at University of Southern California.

Orlando Farrante graduated served in the Navy then played offensive guard for the Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers in 1960-61. Not long after he went to work for what is now Walt Disney Imagineering helping oversee projects from 1963′s Enchanted Tiki Room to Tokyo DisneySea in 2001.

Ferrante was recruited by Dick Nunis whose ambition to become a professional football player was cut short however when he suffered a broken neck while playing ball. He graduated in 1955 in time to start on the lowest rungs as Disneyland was getting ready to open. He retired as chairman of Walt Disney Attractions in 1999 and also told some of the best stories of getting Walt Disney World off the ground.

Nunis learned about Disneyland through Ron Miller who went on to become president and then CEO of Walt Disney Productions. Here’s how:

During his college football days Miller went on a blind date with a young lady named Diane. They married in 1954. After college Miller served in the Army then played for the Los Angeles Rams in 1956. That career was cut short by his father-in-law who happened to be Walt Disney. In the documentary “Walt: Man Behind the Myth” Ron says Walt “saw me play in two football games when I was with the Rams. In one of them I caught a pass and... (a player) knocked me unconscious. I woke up in about the third quarter. At the end of the season Walt came up to me and said ‘You know I don’t want to be the father to your children. You’re going to die out there. How about coming to work with me?’ and I did.”

In addition to supporting the theme parks and EPCOT Center Miller pushed Disney animation and live-action films back into innovative territory to mixed success founded The Disney Channel and Touchstone Pictures.

Ron and Diane Disney Miller went on to found the Silverado Vineyards Winery in Napa Valley. Diane was instrumental in taking a jewel of Los Angeles The Walt Disney Concert Hall from dream in 1988 to opening in 2004. Her passion project was the Walt Disney Family Museum which opened on The Presidio in San Francisco in 2009.

Their window which also mentions their children reads “Lazy M Cattle Company of Wyoming – Ron & Diane Miller & Partners Christopher Joanna Tamara Jennifer Walter Ronald Jr. and Patrick.”

Diane’s younger sister Sharon Disney Lund was an art lover and philanthropist. Sharon her then-husband and children are honored nearby with “William & Sharon Lund Gallery -- Exhibiting only Authentic Works of Art -- Genuine Antiques Selected by Victoria Bradford and Michelle.”

Roy E. Disney's window on Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World (Copyright 2021 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)

Across the street you can find a window honoring Roy E. Disney. He was an accomplished sailor Walt’s nephew Roy’s son and the man who managed to get his cousin’s sister’s husband ousted from Disney in 1984.

Miller was replaced by Michael Eisner and Frank Wells. Roy E. Disney went on to save Walt Disney Animation and nurtured the renaissance that led to classics including “The Little Mermaid” “Beauty and the Beast” “Aladdin” “The Lion King” and many more. His window also honors his wife and children: “Roy E. Disney – Specializing in the Gentlemanly Sport of Racing at Sea – Aboard the Ketch Peregrina - Patty Disney First Mate & Gourmet Cook – Sail Maker: Roy Patrick Abigail – Sail Lessons: Susan Timothy.”

Most windows don’t honor the family however.

I previously wrote about Disney legend and Imagineer Joyce Carlson. She was famous for her work on “It’s a Small World” “The Enchanted Tiki Room” “Pirates of the Caribbean” “Country Bear Jamboree” and “The Haunted Mansion” among others. Working with another legend John Hench Carlson also styled the colors for the horses for Walt Disney World’s Carrousel in Fantasyland.

There are two tributes to her in the Magic Kingdom: A Joyce Carlson doll near the Eiffel Tower in “It’s a Small World” and her window above the Main Street Emporium. Fittingly it reads “Dolls by Miss Joyce Dollmaker for the World.”

Other Disney legends with well-deserved windows on Main Street include one-of-a-kind publicist extraordinaire Charlie Ridgway. While his window reads: “No Event too Small” Ridgway and his team masterminded media coverage for hundreds of major events from the opening of Pirates of the Caribbean in 1967 and Walt Disney World in 1971 all the way through Disneyland Paris in 1992.

The newest window on Main Street was unveiled on Aug. 11 with a quartet of notables being recognized.

They are (from left to right): Trevor Larsen former executive vice president of Facilities & Operations Services Walt Disney Parks & Resorts; Jim MacPhee former Walt Disney World operations executive; Phil Holmes former vice president of Disney’s Hollywood Studios; and Djuan Rivers former vice president of Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

A special word about Holmes. His ties to Walt Disney World started as an assistant to construction teams and was an opening day butler at The Haunted Mansion in 1971. While he retired as head of Hollywood Studios and helped shepherd the park’s transformation he’s probably best known for a long run as vice president of The Magic Kingdom. There’s even a portrait of him inside “Bonjour! Village Gifts” in Belle’s Village.

Born in Ormond Beach MacPhee retired in April 2021 after a 40-year career that started in 1978 as a watercraft pilot. He eventually served as vice president for Epcot from 2007-2010 and for his work was put in charge of the $1 billion+ “NextGen” project that resulted in Magic Bands and FastPass+. He was also key in the transition and expansion from Downtown Disney to Disney Springs.

Larsen may be the least well-known among outsiders but his 29-year Disney career saw him as a behind-the-scenes force in Ride-Show Engineering design mechanics and safety systems. Later his position put him in charge of essential arms of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts across the globe including construction manufacturing horticulture utilities textiles and environmental operations. He takes pride in being part of the design team for the Tower of Terror at Disney’s Hollywood Studios and for his role helping open Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

Animal Kingdom’s most recent Vice President Djuan Rivers retired in January after a 30-year career that took him from entry level to general manager of Disney’s Wilderness Lodge to key roles with Disney Cruise Line Disneyland Paris and Downtown Disney (now Disney Springs.) Rivers became one of the top African-American executives in the company in 2008 when he was named vice president of Disney’s Aulani Resort and Spa in Hawaii. In that role he oversaw construction and opening of the $800 million project while helping it keep close ties to Hawaiian culture and its native population. At Animal Kingdom he oversaw the addition of nighttime activities and the construction and opening of Pandora: the World of Avatar.

Their window advertises “The Academy of Talent Education & Training.” Current Walt Disney World Resort President Jeff Vahle posted those pictures of the ceremony on Instagram adding: “It was a great morning celebrating four remarkable leaders who made an impact on @waltdisneyworld.... Next time you’re on Main Street U.S.A. look up to see their names alongside others who left a lasting legacy in the construction and operation of our resort. Congratulations to them on this amazing honor!”

A further honor: Their window is adjacent another Disney trailblazer Meg Crofton who is former president of Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Parks & Resorts.

Disney 50

To all who come to this happy corner of ClickOrlando.com welcome! Walt Disney World is counting down to its 50th Anniversary and so are we. With 50 days until 50 years we are taking a daily look back at the past how Disney’s opening shaped Central Florida’s present and a peek at what’s in store for the future.

We’re also looking to hear your memories of Walt Disney World: What do you love? What do you miss? What are some of your magical moments? You can share them with us by sending us an email and we’ll post them all for everyone to enjoy. Some might even be featured during our News 6 TV coverage of Walt Disney World’s 50th.

Whether the refurbishments were long or short there have been a handful of attractions such as The Hall of Presidents at Magic Kingdom which has seen major change come to them.

However there is one attraction that has not seen Guests aboard since 2018. The Walt Disney World Railroad is an iconic Disney attraction that always feels like a classic must-do especially knowing Walt’s love for locomotives. At Disney World the Walt Disney World Railroad transports Guests around the many lands in the theme park with its main station at the tip of Main Street U.S.A. where Guests enter the Park.

We saw the attraction shut down when the TRON Lightcycle/Run construction began as part of the railroad had to be moved around to make room for the attraction. Although it has not been confirmed it seems that the Walt Disney World Railroad will not return until construction ceases for TRON Lightcycle/Run. To get the latest TRON update click here.

As the attraction closed down on December 2 2018 it has officially been shut down for 1001 days with no sign of reopening in the near future. As the 50th anniversary celebration is around the corner it seems that Guests will likely not be able to ride the train at the start of the celebration. Perhaps as the 18-month party rolls along we will see the ride open up once again to Guests.

Disney describes the attraction as:

All Aboard!

Listen to the clamor of the engine the chug of the wheels and the call of the whistle as you travel aboard the Walt Disney World Railroad.

Take your seat on 1 of 4 meticulously restored vintage narrow-gauge steam trains—originally built between 1916 and 1928—and enjoy a relaxing 20-minute 1.5-mile scenic round-trip tour.

You can board or disembark at any of 3 stations: Near the entrance to the park on Main Street U.S.A.

A noted train enthusiast Walt Disney built his very first railroad in his backyard. The Carolwood Pacific Railroad a 1/8-scale train debuted in 1950 and featured a custom-built steam powered locomotive that encircled his property.

Delighted with his miniature backyard railroad Walt decided to share his love of trains with the whole world. The result was the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad a favorite of Guests since the park opened in 1955.

We have recently seen the refurbishment on the Main Street Station facade revealed so there is progress!

As the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World approaches we’re taking a look back at history and one of the first attractions that people could visit at the Florida theme park resort.

After years of anticipation Walt Disney World opened to the public on October 1st 1971. Tens of thousands of guests entered Magic Kingdom the first park to open at the resort for fun and fantasy with family and friends.

Since then three more theme parks two water parks dozens of resort hotels and a massive retail dining and entertainment district opened at Walt Disney World Resort.

However before all this was the opening of the ‘Walt Disney World Preview Center’ on January 16th 1970. This was said to be the first location to welcome guests onto Walt Disney World property and it featured scale models and artist renderings of the experiences coming to the company’s Florida resort.

Disney said that one million people visited this attraction before the gates to Magic Kingdom were even opened in 1971. The center was already under construction when it was announced in October 1969. Sneak previews for it began on January 10th 1970 while public tours officially began six days later. It operated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily until September 30th 1971 — the day before Walt Disney World opened its first park in Florida.

Out of hundreds of applicants the theme park company said that only 14 applicants were selected to serve as Disney tour guides. One of them was Debby Dane Browne who was later selected as the first Walt Disney World Ambassador in October 1970.

""During our interviews we did not know what to expect as none of us had visited Disneyland"" Debby told DisneyParks Blog. ""We knew however Walt Disney World was going to be the most incredible and best thing to happen to Florida.""

With guidance from Disneyland cast members Disney said that the 14 tour guides underwent two months of intense training learning anything and everything about the Walt Disney Company and the upcoming Florida resort.

""We were surprised at how many people came to see us"" Debby reportedly continued. ""Families along the east coast were longing for a place to have magical vacations. The center gave them a first taste of Disney. More than 5000 people visited us opening weekend and it was wonderful sharing pixie dust with them.""

During the tour provided by the trained guides the theme park company said that guests spent 12 minutes viewing a short film in a room that housed a 625-square-foot model of phase one of the resort — representing about 2500 acres. Guests were then escorted down a hallway lined with concept artwork. At the time no photography existed because everything was still being built. Afterward guests could shop for souvenirs or enjoy soft drinks and freshly squeezed orange juice at a refreshment station.

Walt Disney World’s 50th-anniversary celebration dubbed the ‘The World’s Most Magical Celebration’ begins on October 1st 2021 as Disney’s Magic Kingdom opened to the public that day in 1971. It lasts for 18 months and includes new experiences throughout the entire Walt Disney World Resort.

The local store in the Oaks mall at 350 W. Hillcrest Drive will close by Sept. 15 according to company information and on-site signs.

Disney had announced in March it would close nearly 40 North American stores. The number has since expanded with the additional closures appearing in recent updates made to the company's online store locator tool according to USA TODAY.

The move will leave about two dozen full-size stores. Another 600 or so Disney shops inside Target stores and at Disney theme parks and other locations won't be affected.

Officials have said the closures reflect a consumer shift to online shopping. The company has also announced it is adding more locations inside Target stores.

On Saturday shoppers waited in line at the Thousand Oaks location in view of a freestanding sign announcing the impending closure. The phrase ""Now it's time to say goodbye..."" floated above the announcement which said the site would be closed on or before Sept. 15. It also encouraged customers to shop online.

Visitors had varied reactions to the news.

""I'm devastated"" said Summer Noland 21 noting she shops there frequently.

Noland and her friend Jonathan Farhat both Thousand Oaks residents learned of the closure when they arrived and saw the sign outside the shop. Inside aisles bustled with activity as shoppers picked through available merchandise.

""I love Disney"" said Noland a CSU Channel Islands student. ""I'm really sad to see it go. It really sucks.""

Farhat 20 said he and Noland also noticed signs announcing a 30% off sale.

""We'll probably buy a few things"" said Farhat a student at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. ""So it's good for now but sad in the long run.""

Henry Zavala 35 of Oxnard said he didn't particularly care about losing the retail site.

""I don't really shop here too much"" he said. ""But when we go to kids' birthday parties it's convenient to come to a store like this for presents.""

Setting up incinerator plants is “illogical” in the Indian scenario according to several experts. Most cities including Gurgaon are facing a huge challenge in handling waste as they are following a “flawed” system of waste disposal and management they said.According to experts waste management in Indian cities is solely based on collection and transportation methods which leaves out the opportunity for segregation and recycling.While producing energy from waste is a crucial element of solid waste management as it reduces waste volume and also helps in converting it into renewable energy WTE plants should ideally come into the management model after segregation collection and recycling experts pointed out.Dr Shyamala K Mani senior advisor at the Centre For Environmental Health Public Health Foundation of India said 6.2 crore metric tonnes (MT) of solid waste are generated in urban areas in India annually which will occupy 340000 cubic metres of volume or 1240 hectares of area in landfills per year. “This is not feasible as there is no spare land for dumping garbage and the existing ones are in a critical state” Mani who was formerly a professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs said.Out of the 6.2 crore tonnes of waste only 4.3 crore MT (70%) is collected 1.2 crore MT is treated and 3.1 crore MT is dumped in landfills experts said. The remaining waste is dumped haphazardly. Asked why waste is not segregated Mani said “Since most concessionaire contracts state that the civic body has to pay Rs 1700 to 1800 per tonne to the concessionaire for collection transportation and dumping of solid waste at the dumpsites this leads to the practice of mixing waste and dumping it.”Why WTE plants don’t do well in IndiaWTE plants in India handle a vast quantity of mixed waste. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 however only segregated non-recyclable waste having a calorific value of 1500 kcal/kg or more should be utilised for generating energy or refuse-derived fuel.“But as much as 50% of the waste that most WTE plants receive in our cities is low-calorific waste so it ends up in dumpsites instead of being used to produce energy” said Ruchika Sethi founder of Citizens for Clean Air a Gurgaon-based citizens’ group.“India’s experience with WTE plants has been unsatisfactory. The country’s first WTE plant was set up in 1987 in Timarpur Delhi. It was shut down in 21 days due to poor quality of incoming waste” said Ranjit Devraj a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on waste management set up in 2018. Since then 14 more WTE plants of a total capacity of 130 MW have been set up in the country. Out of these half have already been closed and the remaining are under scrutiny for environmental violations he added.Incineration should be the last consideration for any city said Swati Singh Sambyal an independent expert. “WTE plants are like boilers they take tonnes of resources which could otherwise be recycled or recovered” she said.Experts also pointed out incinerator plants are already being phased out in Western countries. “The US has not set up a single incinerator-based WTE plant since 1997” said Sibhu Nair India coordinator for the Global Alliance for Incineration Alternatives.How garbage can bebetter handledComposting biogas installation and bio-methanation and recycling of dry and electronic waste can help reduce waste sent to landfills by 80% to 90% experts said. Only around 10% of waste which can’t be composted or recycled should be sent to a waste processing site they said. “Whether waste will be incinerated recycled or composted depends on its quality. Bio-methanation technologies for segregated wet waste from large kitchens restaurants slaughterhouses and market waste have proved to be more viable in India” said Mani.“Rather than having a WTE plant in every city we could have one in a cluster of a few cities or a larger area which is still a more sustainable approach” Sambyal said.Government officials however defended the plan to set up a WTE plant in Bandhwari. “WTE plants and landfills are not completely unscientific methods. It depends on what kind of waste is dumped in landfills and what is incinerated in the plant. Many countries are using landfills and WTE plants effectively. We need to follow their pattern” said S Narayanan member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board.Despite repeated calls by TOI there was no response from Mukesh Kumar Ahuja commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbXlyZXB1YmxpY2EubmFnYXJpa25ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvcmVzb2x2aW5nLWthdGhtYW5kdS12YWxsZXktcy1zb2xpZC13YXN0ZS1wcm9ibGVtcy_SAVxodHRwOi8vbXlyZXB1YmxpY2EubmFnYXJpa25ldHdvcmsuY29tL2FtcC9yZXNvbHZpbmcta2F0aG1hbmR1LXZhbGxleS1zLXNvbGlkLXdhc3RlLXByb2JsZW1zLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Resolving Kathmandu Valley’s solid waste problems,"The waste collectors can make a schedule for waste collection. They can collect only biodegradable waste on one day and non-biodegradable waste on another day. It will help in maintaining a proper waste segregation system; otherwise this becomes only a propaganda campaign. No formal municipal waste recovery and recycling programs are practiced at present.

Solid waste management is one of the major challenges for municipalities of Nepal including the ones facing the Kathmandu Valley's municipalities due to haphazard urbanization fast-growing population absence of basic facilities for integrated solid waste management and deeply rooted misperception about waste management. About 3.32 million people in 18 municipalities of the Kathmandu Valley generate more than 1200 tons of municipal solid waste daily most of it ending up in landfills dumped in the open or burnt at sources.

According to the records maintained by the Kathmandu Metropolitan City more than 800 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) every day ends up at the Sisdole dump landfill site. Of the total collected waste about 79% of the Kathmandu Valley’s solid waste is collected and transported by the private sector. However this service is frequently disrupted due to many reasons. Based on an analysis of ADB (2013) in the Valley the highest waste fraction is biodegradable (54%) followed by plastics (19%) and papers (17%). Despite a relatively high solid waste collection ratio in the Kathmandu Valley compared to other cities in Nepal 17 municipalities including two metropolitan cities dump their solid wastes at the Sisdole dumpsite which has already turned into a highly vulnerable dumpsite while Bhaktapur dumps its waste on the banks of the Hanumante River. Hence Solid Waste Management (SWM) presents a major threat to the livability of the Kathmandu Valley and also contributes to pollution and public health hazards at final disposal site i.e. Sisdole landfill site due to lack of infrastructures for treatment and recovery of solid waste.

Key issues and problems

Over the last 30 years though there have been significant changes in people's perception of sanitation and solid waste management the general attitude of the Nepali society is yet to change. Now everyone can understand the problems and opportunities of solid waste but never wants to translate their perception into behavior and action. Many people think that waste has to be thrown anywhere but not in ‘my backyard’.

Similarly the metropolis describes solid waste as a major problem. However it has received less attention from the federal government and municipalities and in their plans and programs as compared to other urban utilities and infrastructures. The concept of waste as resources with legal provisions of sorting waste at sources has been introduced in Nepal since 2011. As a result waste management strategies are shifting from waste disposal to recycling and recovery and people are considering waste as a potential new resource. However it doesn't mean that there is no waste to be landfilled and no land is required for waste management and everything can be managed at the source.

The fact is if you follow the waste management hierarchy appropriately i.e. reduce reuse recycle and recover the significant amount of waste can be diverted from landfilling and used as resources. However there should be significant efforts on soft intervention like activities for people's behavior change capacity building of all stakeholders promotion on 3R activities as well as investment in SWM infrastructures for treatment recycling and recovery such that very less amount of waste needs to be landfilled. Resource recovery from MSW not only reduces the use of virgin raw materials and energy but also creates fertilizers and renewable energy and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by reducing the amount of waste to be disposed of at landfills.

Waste management thus is more than crisis management linked to the collection and dumping of wastes which only transfers problems from one place to another place. Municipality authorities and few so-called experts think that if the waste segregation is carried out at the sources a significant amount of biodegradable waste i.e. more than 60 percent of the total waste can be managed at source. But it is not true for haphazardly urbanized cities like Kathmandu where many families live in a single house with limited open space and the city produces a huge amount of waste.

If the municipality makes significant efforts in soft intervention about five percent of households can manage their organic waste at sources. However other organic wastes have to be collected transported and treated properly. Mandatory segregation provision doesn't only help to solve the current solid waste management problems but also requires that all operational components of the integrated SWM system including separate collection and transportation of source-segregated waste be followed and if the collected waste is treated properly to recover as resources as much as possible only a limited amount of waste will go to the landfill site. For this the waste collector can make a schedule regarding waste collection. They can collect only biodegradable waste on one day and non-biodegradable waste on another day. It will help in maintaining a proper waste segregation system; otherwise this becomes only a propaganda campaign. No formal municipal waste recovery and recycling programs are practiced at present.

However informal recycling practices within low-income groups exist in the Kathmandu Valley where more than 50 percent of dry recyclable materials are collected through these informal waste pickers and sold to local scrap shops for income generation and livelihood. But recycling of organic waste is almost negligible in the Valley due to the lack of infrastructures for organic recycling and recovery which has rather created serious environmental problems at the disposal site. Before the promulgation of the new constitution there was a central government organization - the Solid Waste Management Technical Support Centre (SWMTSC) to provide technical support for technical capacity building policy and plans related to SWM in municipalities although SWM operation was the main responsibility of municipalities. At present there is no dedicated unit at the federal and provincial levels to provide technical support to local governments in all aspects of SWM.

The Way Forward

To provide safe sustainable and environmentally friendly solid waste management services at the municipal level proper SWM strategies and action plans should be developed based on a pragmatic approach. The essential steps to make the city clean and optimum recovery of resources from waste include extending collection to all municipalities of the Kathmandu Valley and implement both waste management hierarchies (5R-refuse reduce reuse recycle and recovery) and planned transformation of open dump to an engineered landfill site. A new engineered landfill site at Banchare dada is reported to be almost ready to dispose of solid waste from the municipalities of the Valley. However it doesn't again solve the solid waste problems of the Valley if we don't invest in other SWM infrastructures like treatment recovery and recycling facilities.

The metropolis should also encourage the proactive participation of all stakeholders (communities private sector enterprises women youth and other stakeholders) through incentives encouragement rewards and punishment.

These initiatives help to change the Not Action Talking Only (NATO) behavior to the Action Before Talking (ABT) behavior of the metropolis leaders city planners and the general public. If we start the action before talking with will power clear vision and confidence a sustainable solution for SWM can be achieved. SWM service should be made self-sustaining within a planning period by resource recovery and cost recovery approaches such as service charges from beneficiaries and revenue from reusable and recyclable products. Those responsible for causing pollution or generating solid waste should pay the cost for dealing with the pollution or managing the solid waste to protect public health and the environment (polluters pay principle) and the producers’ liability should be extended in a concerted manner.

We have to keep in mind that SWM problems for all cities are common but it doesn't mean that a single solution works perfectly for all. The waste-to-energy technology that is working perfectly in Europe and Japan doesn't work in our context without customization. The composition calorific value of waste and other factors affect the selection of technology. The customization in technology and site-specific solutions to address local issues only gives a sustainable solution. The decentralized solution will be appropriate for small and less urbanized cities. However; the centralized solution will be an appropriate solution for the more urbanized and highly populated city like Kathmandu where the availability of land for ISWM facilities is very crucial. As an alternative to recover the resources from organic waste in the Valley the waste-to-energy (biogas plant) for treatment of source-segregated biodegradable waste can be established to generate energy in the form of methane gas. This option also provides compost fertilizers.

In addition to source segregated biodegradable municipal waste other feeding materials such as cow dung waste from poultry farms biomass and solid part of fecal sludge can be added to run large-scale anaerobic biogas plants in full capacity. For non-degradable dry waste increasing the recycling rate is the most preferred option but this requires more investment into waste sorting processing and recycling infrastructure. If we want to promote the recycling of waste only recycling campaigns and trading of particular recycling materials is not a solution but we must find an end solution in our own country. Private sector participation and investment in such businesses need to be encouraged in the Valley.

There are several technologies we have already piloted in the Valley over many years. For example a biomethanation plant at the Teku transfer station to convert three tons/day bio-waste into electricity in 2017 and compost plants at different places of the Valley were successfully piloted but the technology is not scaled up and not improved for site-specific solutions depending upon the nature of waste and the resources available. Therefore the technique and technology used in SWM should be scaled up with time and the waste management sector should also be taken as an urban infrastructure like roads drainage water supply etc. To manage massive amounts of solid waste in a sustainable manner we need bigger investors with big commercial vision. This is where the private sector and investors should step in.

Finally a competent federal unit should be in place for providing technical support in all aspects of SWM especially in policy formulation developing SWM standards and guidelines capacity building for local government. It also is beneficial if there are responsible SWM units under the provincial governments for providing technical assistance in the design of SWM infrastructures coordinating with different bodies and identifying and developing regional SWM facilities to participate in many municipalities.

Kanye West's record album apparently released the long-awaited album ""Donda"" prematurely with Apple Music subscribers able to listen to tracks from the album for a few hours before it got pulled.

Quietly surfacing on Sunday morning Kanye West's ""Donda"" album is now playable on Apple Music. Appearing with a monotone black album cover the album is West's tenth studio album released through West's GOOD Music label and Def Jam Records.

Lasting 1 hour and 49 minutes the album is spread across 27 tracks offered as Lossless and as an Apple Digital Master. The tracklist starts with a 52-second ""Donda Chant"" before the first full track plays titled ""Jail.""

The album's release has repeatedly slipped starting from July 23 to August 6 before speculation on August 13 said a launch would happen on August 22.

West's promotion for the album has been unusual consisting of multiple streaming listening parties in July and August. The listening parties held in stadiums and attracting thousands of people were simultaneously streamed on Apple Music leading to West shattering other Apple Music event records.

It seems that the decision to release the album was made for Kanye by the record label rather than by the artist himself.

According to an Instagram post by West on Sunday as reported by Variety Def Jam parent company UMG released the album without West's approval. West also claims the initial unavailability of the track ""Jail 2"" was due to UMG blocking it.

""Jail"" and counterpart ""Jail 2"" are controversial due to featuring Marylin Manson and DaBaby with the former accused of sexual assault and the latter making homophobic comments. Both artists appeared at West's fourth listening event on Thursday.

Some East coast US AppleInsider staffers are unable to listen to the album as of 5PM ET Sunday though not all are affected. International staffers had availability throughout Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxlZWRzLTU4MzY5MTYw0gE2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtbGVlZHMtNTgzNjkxNjAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ossett postie paints digital Sean Lock portrait tribute,

Brian Shreves the director of the Upshur County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management resigned his position to accept a new job as the director of the Office of Emergency Medical Services within West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Public Health.

This development meant the commission had to find a new director for the UCDHSEM.

Upshur County Commissioner Sam Nolte said their office had experience with emergency management because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

“The one thing I realized especially with COVID because it’s still ongoing and something that OEM has been directly in contact with security and testing and whatnot … is that pretty much everything was running through our office” Nolte said at the commission’s Aug. 26 meeting. “Everything Brian did the folks in our office Carrie and Tabatha [county administrator Carrie Wallace and assistant county administrator Tabatha Perry] did.”

“I would like to see our office take over OEM” Nolte added. “I think these two ladies would be excellent and would be able to handle a situation like that.”

Retired Buckhannon Fire Chief Mitch Tacy said the commissioners were giving Wallace and Perry too much to handle with the additional responsibilities on top of their jobs as county administrator and assistant county administrator respectively.

“It’s too much – it is a full-time position – and you need someone that knows that they’re doing” Tacy said. “I just don’t think they will have the time and I don’t mean to be facetious but I don’t think they have the expertise.”

Nolte disagreed saying three people will split the workload and they do have experience in the field.

“We have three people in our office – Carrie Tabatha and Sheila (Adams) – so the duties are going to be split up” Nolte said. “My idea would be an OEM director assistant director and someone to help with administration. These ladies can get trained and take the proper courses. We’ve been going through a global pandemic for the last 18 months something that nobody in this room has lived through and during that time everything has gone through our office so to say that we can’t handle it is untrue.”

Former part-time OEM director James Farry said they do not have experience planning for potential emergencies in advance.

“You’ve been handling it but you have done so in a reactive way” Farry said. “You have to take into consideration that you will have to plan for snow floods major fires mass evacuation and it’s just too broad. I agree with Mitch I have a great amount of respect for these ladies and what they’re doing but I think you’re asking too much of them.”

Volunteer at the DHSEM Communications Office Dirk Burnside said emergency management is a unique field and requires special training.

“First of all I have never had any desire to be an OEM director. It’s not something I want to do; I’m 67 years old and retired” Burnside said. “Besides that I’ve been doing emergency management volunteer work for over 40 years. I know what it takes. I’ve studied emergency management I’ve been an EMT instructor and I’ve been a 911 operator. I’ve done a lot of things but it’s not the same thing [as serving as OEM director].”

He said emergency management requires constant communication receiving updates and making changes to procedures when necessary.

“There should have been a hot wash [immediate ‘after-action’ discussion and evaluation of an agency’s performance following an exercise] after each of these events at the high school and the armory” Burnside said. “You have to get together and evaluate what worked and what didn’t and then everybody takes those notes and they look and say ‘here’s how we can change our plan.’ These are all things that we need to understand with emergency management. It’s an ongoing plan and [making] sure your communications capabilities are good enough to handle disaster – it’s all a big big job.”

Burnside said he was glad the office was willing to do such an important job.

“I appreciate that you’re taking a very very serious look at this position and I’m really tickled that the group you have working for you in this office would agree to take this big task on themselves because it’s a big big big responsibility” Burnside said. “I know you’re trying to do the best but I just don’t know if you really understand the whole situation with what’s going on.”

Nolte said he had faith in his staff and made the motion to make Wallace the OEM director and Perry the assistant director.

“Brian’s last day is tomorrow (Friday Aug. 27) at 4 p.m. so it will be effective then and of course we will look at the appropriate training for pretty much everyone in the office to make sure we are up to the standards of what is required” Nolte said.

For many of the corporate clients of London-based private jet management company FlyEliteJets private aircraft are not so much a luxury as the best way to squeeze the maximum value from each minute of their time.

“These are fast-growing companies and the executives have to be in multiple places at once” explains Chris Williams-Martin founder of FlyEliteJets. “It increases their productivity if they can jet out of a smaller airport go to two or three cities and jet back. They’ve done a day’s work on the plane and in meetings there are no hotel costs and they’re still home in the evening.”

“They’re picked up by limo there’s a 15-minute check-in they’re taken to the jet steps and take off within minutes so there is no dead time there. Moreover private jets are quicker than scheduled jets; they fly at a different altitude [usually higher where there is less traffic] and much more directly again saving time.”

For other clients considerations such as privacy security and convenience are equally important. “[They] are typically time-short with many balls in the air at any one time but they are also very private — they don’t want to be delayed and they don’t want to be seen publicly” says Williams-Martin.

Different owners use their aircraft in different ways. Some treat their jet as a luxury flying from time to time and in some cases making it available for charter. Others are airborne 400 or 500 hours a year using it as their office. They see a private jet as a necessity.

“If you’re using your plane in a smart way it becomes hard to get rid of because you gain so much time flexibility and convenience — it can make you so much more productive” observes Chris Marich co-founder of jet spend management platform MySky.

The uncertainty at scheduled airlines during the pandemic has turbocharged the attractions of private jet travel. Passengers need not set foot in crowded airports because these planes typically fly from small airfields minimising waiting times. Clients travel with their own small group on a sanitised plane and may be able to reach countries where commercial flights have been restricted.

Growth in demand for private jets has soared and the indications are that many former business- and first-class passengers are embracing them. Aviation industry market research company WingX reports that global business aviation activity for the first half of 2021 was up 42 per cent on the same period last year compared with an upturn of less than 10 per cent for scheduled airlines. Moreover it is gathering momentum with record business aviation activity globally in June up 10 per cent up on the pre-pandemic high point of June 2019. Similarly FlyEliteJets reported a 150 per cent rise in bookings since the Covid-19 outbreak despite the disruption from measures such as border closures and quarantine requirements.

Demand for these flights has been growing despite widespread concerns about the disproportionate impact of private jets on climate change. In just one hour a private jet can emit two tonnes of CO2 according to Transport & Environment which campaigns for sustainable transport. That compares with the 8.2 tonnes each EU resident emits on average per year.

“Decarbonisation is extremely topical in the wider industry” says Sam Cook an aircraft financing specialist at US bank JPMorgan. “Developments are still at a very early stage but advances in areas like sustainable aviation fuel are becoming increasingly important to manufacturers and operators and to us as financiers.”

Some owners are airborne 400 or 500 hours a year. They see a private jet as a necessity

The pandemic has also fuelled a surge of demand to own private jets particularly among ultra high net worth individuals — in the Americas especially according to Chad Anderson president of private jet broker Jetcraft. He puts that demand into context: in a typical balanced market he says 8-10 per cent of the global total of private jets (some 22000 according to MySky) is available for sale. “Currently 5.2 per cent is available; that’s the lowest level of supply we’ve had in almost 30 years.”

Prospective owners need however to understand the web of costs involved and not just in purchasing but in running a jet warns MySky’s Marich. His company has created online products to make budgeting and payments smoother and more transparent. “For too long there has been a knowledge gap for private jet owners about the real cost of aircraft ownership” he says.

So how do costs break down? Marich suggests that a decent 20-year-old jet could be acquired for $5m-$6m but operating costs will amount to $2m-$3m a year. “Over say a 10-year ownership that’s the really big expense so it’s important to understand what you’ll be paying to keep and use your jet quite apart from the purchase cost. It’s often not emphasised enough to new owners.”

Anderson identifies three elements to the total cost: acquisition “the easiest to define”; direct operating costs that apply to every flying hour including fuel catering and crew; and fixed costs that must be covered whether the plane flies or not — such as hangar rental and insurance. Costs can also be affected by taxes which vary dramatically between jurisdictions.

The purchase of a jet itself is a complex process involving third parties and usually carried out with a broker such as Jetcraft. “We operate as a general contractor” says Anderson. “We oversee the lawyers the market intelligence the pre-buy facilities the interior design the regulatory inspectors the insurance and so on — there are many groups involved and it’s our job to pull everything together. Otherwise it can become overwhelming for the client.”

It is possible to fund the purchase (or release equity on a jet you already own) through a loan secured against the aircraft. Cook says JPMorgan will typically lend 70-90 per cent of the aircraft’s value though some finance providers will lend up to 100 per cent.

Some might ask why ultra high net worth individuals fund purchases by borrowing. “It varies from client to client but these aircraft can be extremely expensive assets (up to $75m or $80m in some cases) so it can be very useful to be able to extract that liquidity from an illiquid asset — for example to invest tactically in the financial markets or make some other purchase” says Cook.

Private jet owners generally engage a management company such as FlyEliteJets to run the aircraft. Some big corporate owners such as Google or Volkswagen have set up their own internal flight management department.

This is a fragmented industry comprising thousands of potential suppliers and service companies says Marich. “To put that into context in a single flight there will be 10-15 different providers involved from cleaners to caterers refuellers and maintenance crew.”

The management company’s job is to streamline operations accepting invoices from suppliers. The process is complicated by the fact that there is no standardisation of invoices or fees coming from different countries often causing administrative bottlenecks of weeks or months. “There are management companies that exploit that lack of transparency to maximise their profits which has impacted our industry negatively” says Marich.

If you need to charter the plane a certain amount in order to afford your costs don’t buy it

One option for owners to reduce costs is to make their plane available for charter. Marich suggests around 40 per cent of owners do so. Typically charters are managed by the management company as part of the package. “Management companies structure their charges differently but it’s usually on a cost-plus basis say cost plus 10 or 15 per cent” says Anderson. “The big variable is whether or not the owner wants to utilise the aircraft for charter in which case it will bring in some revenue and the management fees will be a bit lower.”

He suggests charter fees may cover some fixed costs such as the hangar insurance and maybe a pilot. But he cautions that “owners will never cover the cost of the aircraft through charter unless that was their whole rationale for buying it in the first place”.

Marich puts it more bluntly: “You can reduce your fixed costs through chartering but you’ll never cover them completely. If you need to charter the plane a certain amount in order to afford your costs don’t buy it.”

An alternative model that could suit smaller budgets or prospective purchasers is fractional ownership. “It’s been popular over the past five years and grown in popularity during the Covid pandemic particularly among new users who may previously have been flying first class” says Cook. NetJets the biggest fractional ownership operator says new owner numbers in 2020 were up by 350 per cent on 2019 with similar growth so far in 2021 though it declines to give the underlying numbers.

Fractional ownership involves buying a share in an aircraft entitling clients to a specific number of hours of flying time per year in their own plane or a better one typically over a five-year term. “It’s a good choice for individuals to dip their toe in the private jet market or for users who maybe only fly 50-100 hours a year which is not enough to warrant full ownership of an aircraft” adds Cook.

“Our owners have access to over 760 aircraft that fly to over 5000 airports in more than 200 countries” explains Patrick Gallagher president of sales and marketing at NetJets. “Owners can also travel with greater flexibility and reliability as an aircraft is always available for them.”

NetJets will not say how fractional ownership costs stack up relative to outright ownership but in addition to the one-off cost of buying a share owners pay a monthly management fee plus a per-hour levy for flight activity and a fuel charge. According to SherpaReport which provides information on the “shared luxury” market the outlay for a 1/16th share of a light jet starts at around $350000 for 50 hours a year of flying time with total costs over five years amounting to well over $1m.

Travel by private jet whatever form it takes is always going to involve complex charges. Few new jet owners are likely to have the time or the inclination to scrutinise each individual invoice. Even so anyone looking to join the jet set needs to understand the real costs they will face and to feel confident those costs are being transparently managed.

Twitter had its 15th anniversary in March and a lot has changed since the company first began.

Back in 2005 the ex-Googlers Evan Williams and Christopher ""Biz"" Stone teamed up to form the podcasting platform Odeo with Jack Dorsey and Noah Glass.

The company went south after Apple launched its own podcasting platform inside the iTunes store so Williams and Stone pivoted to a project created by Dorsey: a text-based messaging app called Twttr.

A national school driver shortage may leave some students stranded,"School buses parked in Helena Mont. ahead of the beginning of the school year on Aug. 20. Read more

A national school bus driver shortage worsened by the pandemic has left school districts around the region scrambling to find transportation for thousands of students the ripple effect widening as the start of the year rapidly approaches.

The driver shortage has led to significant school schedule changes in the Philadelphia School District that have drawn ire from parents teachers and city leaders. Bus driver shortages have roiled Pittsburgh public schools too forcing them to push their start date back.

The Camden school system has notified about 850 families that the district has not lined up transportation for their children when school starts Sept. 7 said Superintendent Katrina McCombs. The district provides transportation for about 2500 students.

“We are working around the clock and will continue to do so” McCombs said. “However at this point there may be some students who are without transportation for their first day of school.”

The shortage has put drivers in high demand with districts and bus contractors offering lucrative bonuses and incentives — some to parents — in the hopes of recruiting new hires or luring retirees back into service to fill routes.

“There are so many routes out there not covered” said Chloe Williams president of the New Jersey School Bus Contractors Association. “If 10 good people walked in today we could hire them and get them on the road.”

Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said the start-time changes were necessary to streamline bus operations. Prior to this year there were dozens of different bell schedules across the city. Now the district is moving to just three start times.

“We have to guarantee that we can transport children and get them to school on time” Hite has said.

In New Jersey districts are required to provide transportation for elementary and middle school students who live more than two miles from their school and high schoolers who live more than 2½ miles from school. Statewide about 800000 students are transported to and from school by bus on a typical day according to the state Department of Education.

In a letter to parents Deptford School Superintendent Arthur E. Dietz said the Gloucester County district had little choice but to change the start time at its middle and high schools because of the driver shortage. The district has been unable to hire new drivers or acquire a contract with local bus companies he said.

“While we know changing the times is not ideal this was the best solution to ensure all students will be transported to and from school” Dietz wrote.

After being dropped by its longtime bus contractor Burlington Township schools solicited bids for routes and rental buses in August but received no response Superintendent Mary Ann Bell wrote to parents. The district plans to get approval for an emergency contract to temporarily rent 24 buses she said.

Bell said the district also plans to hire a dozen additional bus drivers and set up a dispatch office which was previously handled by the contractor. She believes the district will be able to cover 20 of its 24 routes with drivers transporting three to four groups of students doubling back or adjusting pickup and drop-off times.

Bell said the district is also trying to figure out transportation for its athletic teams and for students who participate in extracurricular activities. Several coaches hold the required commercial driver’s license and may be asked to transport teams if the district is able to acquire bus vehicles she said.

Beth Jaworski who has two sons in Burlington Township schools said she plans to drive them to school before rushing to her job as a school nurse in Hamilton. The district previously provided busing as a courtesy because the boys live just outside the mileage requirement.

“I think it is outrageous that this is happening at the eleventh hour” said Jaworski 46. She said her sons eighth and 10th graders will have to walk home from school just under two miles because she will still be at work at dismissal.

For the first time this fall the Philadelphia School District will pilot a program paying parents up to $1500 per household per school year for driving their children to school in lieu of district-provided transportation. Camden offers up to $1000 but it is unclear how many will do that because they must have a $1 million auto insurance liability McCombs said.

Williams who heads the contractor-owned school bus association which has about 11000 members said contractors across the country have struggled to fill vacancies despite offering paid training and signing bonuses up to $2500. Since 2019 school bus driver salaries have increased about 20% she said.

When the pandemic hit some drivers who are typically older retirees stopped working because of health concerns Williams said. Some returned after getting COVID-19 vaccinations she said.

“Some are hesitant to come back” said Williams. She said her family-owned bus company B.R Williams Inc. in Woodstown has been able to cover its routes in Salem Gloucester and Cumberland Counties.

Williams said it typically takes about 50 to 60 days for a bus driver applicant to complete a lengthy written test practice driving and take a road test. A drug test and background exam are also required.

In Pennsylvania some drivers aren’t coming back to work because they don’t want to mask and others are concerned about the health ramifications of being around large numbers of people said Ryan Dellinger executive director of the Pennsylvania School Bus Association.

“We’ve taken an already somewhat limited driver pool and shrunken it further to make things worse” said Dellinger who estimated that 1.5 million children in Pennsylvania rely on yellow buses to get to school.

West Berlin Bus has enough drivers for its 25 routes mostly transporting special-needs students in South Jersey but had to turn down new service requests said Vinny Marziano operations manager. The company had about 90 drivers before the pandemic and has about 55 currently. The company has offered retention bonuses.

“I don’t have any more employees to put anywhere else” Marziano said. “There are no new employees coming.”

The Cheltenham school district has seen a 25% decrease in available bus drivers since the pandemic said Derek Platt the district’s director of transportation.

“That has just a really big impact on our day-to-day operations” Platt said. “We still have 100% students going to all of the schools but 25% fewer drivers” to transport them.

To solve for fewer drivers the district has had to rework all of its routes putting kids on buses for longer stretches and assigning buses at maximum capacity despite COVID-19. Students are required to wear masks on buses and the vehicles will be sanitized Platt said.

“People are concerned about social distancing on the bus but the reality is there is no possibility of social distancing on the vehicles” said Platt. “If you want the students to get to school on time there’s no option to do that.”

There may be fewer buses but they will exist. Williams issued a public appeal to motorists to look out for the sight they’ve barely seen in more than a year: “Please pay attention for the big yellow school bus.”

The Dakota Range 1 & 2 wind farm under construction near here will sport the largest turbines of any of Xcel Energy's many wind projects — and even bigger turbines are on tap for southwestern Minnesota.

The yet-to-be built Plum Creek project will feature turbines 655 feet tall when their blades are fully extended about 160 feet higher than Xcel's new South Dakota project and roughly the height of a 60-story building.

""They could easily have a position on the Minneapolis skyline"" John Tuma a member of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) said during a review of Plum Creek.

And they are the future. Bigger blades capture more wind energy. Bigger turbines require less overall space because fewer are needed for the same amount of energy.

Plus bigger turbines can generate more power at lower wind speeds turning some uneconomic projects into profitable ones.

""This really opens up possibilities"" said Kim Randolph Minneapolis-based Xcel's vice president of energy supply projects. ""The high-wind areas are filling up with wind farms.""

Still there are potential drawbacks to the big new turbines if you live close to them. Bigger blades can increase ""shadow flicker"" or shadows cast on nearby properties already a complaint about wind farms.

And while Plum Creek's towering heights sparked no significant opposition from its soon-to-be neighbors the visibility of larger turbines could become an issue industry observers say.

""They are certainly more visible from far away"" Mark Bolinger a renewable energy research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.

Bigger turbines will help reach goals

Minnesota and the Dakotas — already big wind-power producers — will likely be hosting a lot more turbines if long-term clean energy goals are to be met.

Minnesota in 2020 got 21% of its electricity from wind a figure that does not include power produced in the Dakotas that is consumed here.

""There is still a good 8 to 10 percent left for wind to contribute to our power sector"" said Aditya Ranade the Minnesota Department of Commerce's deputy commissioner for energy resources.

Bigger turbines will help reach that goal more efficiently sweeping up more wind with each turn of their blades.

""We expect to see the cost reduction driven by the size"" Ranade said. ""You can get more energy on the same footprint.""

Wind farm levelized costs fell much more than experts anticipated between 2014 and 2019 — 28% to 36% — and the adoption of larger turbines was a key factor according to a study by several authors published recently in Nature Energy a scientific journal.

Regardless of any federal tax credits costs will continue falling substantially as individual wind turbines' production capacity increases from an average of 2.5 megawatts in 2019 to a forecast of 5.5-megawatts by 2035 the study said.

At Dakota Range most turbines will be 4.2 megawatts and boast a 446-foot rotor diameter — the cross section of the circle swept by its blades. They will produce about 70% more energy than a 2-megawatt turbine with a 393-foot wingspan.

Even with the bigger blades the towers holding the turbines at Dakota Range are about the size of those at current large Xcel wind farms. But at Plum Creek the blades are longer than those at Dakota Range so the wind towers themselves must be taller.

""At some point you have to increase tower size or you won't have adequate space on the blade's downswing"" Bolinger said.

Turbine visibility already an issue

In one way bigger turbines can help countryside aesthetics because developers need fewer of them (if a project's total size is held constant). But because they are taller they tend to stick out more.

""Which do people prefer — more or bigger? Probably either if you are a [wind] supporter and neither if you are detractor of building on the landscape"" said Beth Soholt head of Clean Grid Alliance a St. Paul group that represents renewable energy developers and advocates.

Turbine visibility is a sticky issue for the proposed Big Bend Wind project in southwestern Minnesota. Its proximity to the Jeffers Petroglyphs site near Comfrey has alarmed the Lower Sioux Indian Community and the Minnesota State Historical Society.

The rock carvings date back 7000 years and are considered sacred to several tribes. The tribes and historical society argued Big Bend's turbines would be too close to the petroglyphs marring the landscape and thus diminishing the historic site.

Big Bend's developer Apex Clean Energy responded by reducing the number of planned turbines from 64 to 56 and moving some farther out. But to maintain the wind farm's total production capacity Apex swapped in bigger turbines. At a height of 655 feet they will be 85 feet taller than what was in the original plans.

Now both the proximity and the height of the turbines is a contested issue.

Big Bend would be one of the biggest wind farms in Minnesota with the capacity to generate 308 megawatts of electricity; Plum Creek with individual turbines of up to 6.2 megawatts would be by far the largest at 414 megawatts.

Plum Creek which would sit between Westbrook and Walnut Grove was approved unanimously by the PUC earlier this month.

However Tuma the PUC commissioner struck one wary note on the new breed of wind turbines at developments like Plum Creek.

""I love them. I think we should build them"" Tuma said. ""But the one thing that is going to be a problem for these communities that was never a problem with [the turbines] we built before is that the shadow flicker is greater.""

The expected shadow flicker at several sites in Plum Creek's footprint could well exceed the 30 hours per year threshold that's considered an industry best practice. Those sites are all owned by ""participants"" — property owners who are leasing their land to the wind farm's developer National Grid.

The PUC required Plum Creek to come up with a shadow flicker plan or get agreements or consent waivers from participating landowners so they know how much flicker they might experience.

Size makes construction trickier

The bigger the turbine the longer the blades and the heavier the components.

Foundations for the largest new turbines contain up to 1000 cubic yards of concrete double the amount needed for more conventionally sized machines said Tim Maag vice president general manager for wind energy at Golden Valley-based Mortenson one of the largest U.S. wind farm builders.

Mortenson is constructing Xcel's Dakota Range. On a recent day about 160 union workers — crane operators iron workers millwrights and laborers — were raising turbines on the slightly rolling fields north of Watertown.

For a smaller turbine they would have assembled its ""nacelle"" — the tower-top housing for all of the generating components — on the ground. But because the bigger turbine's drivetrain and generator weigh considerably more Mortenson's crew needed to assemble the nacelles ""in the air"" a trickier task for the workers.

Each component was lifted individually by a 400-ton crane and set atop the tower instead of lifting the nacelle in one piece. The crane made eight or nine ""picks"" as opposed to four or five before assembly was completed.

But the biggest challenge for building larger turbines is transportation from stuffing giant blades onto ships to hauling them to remote sites like Dakota Range by truck. Most blades at Dakota Range are 73 yards long leaving a truck driver with a harsh turning radius.

The sheriff's office said a tornado touchdown report near Lennox is unconfirmed.

The National Weather Service in Sioux Falls is sending someone down to the Lennox area to survey the damage.

""We do know that we have damage down in those areas and some indications on radar that this was caused by a tornado but we really want to get some people down in the area to make sure of it” meteorologist Matt Dux said.

Lennox without power

The entire city of Lennox is without power as of 6:30 p.m. almost two hours after storms hit Lincoln County emergency manager Harrold Timmerman said.

They take turns reading out of a textbook going paragraph by paragraph.

But what's peculiar about this scene is that the textbook is written in Spanish — and about two-thirds of the class are not native Spanish speakers.

Pagan’s class is part of Columbine Elementary dual language immersion program. The students in the program spend half of the day learning in Spanish and the other half in English. About 200 students from first to fifth grade are participating in the program that is in its fifth year.

Principal Nicolas Ng said the fifth-graders have been in dual immersion since the first grade and the school has really hit its stride.

“We’ve learned from some sister schools but we’ve also learned from mistakes” Ng said. “The implementation I would say now is running super smooth. We’re very proud of it.”

The program is a rethinking of how non-native English speakers learn language. Rather than putting them in an English-as-a-second-language program dual immersion is designed to put all students on an even playing field academically including native English speakers. The long-term goal for this program is that both cohorts of students will be bilingual and biliterate by the time they graduate high school.

Program is designed to challenge students through grade years

When Columbine Elementary was chosen for the program Ng said a lot of parents expressed initial concern. The curriculum is different than the standard English and they wanted to know how it compared. Parents were also worried about the difficulty in the beginning.

“Parents would say how does it compare to the traditional curriculum” Ng said. “They would ask ‘Will our children fall behind … will they be struggling?’ And the answer was yes. Yes it is harder.”

All the students felt the struggle at first. Ten-year-old Amreen Cheema said she had a hard time during the first year.

“In first grade I only knew English so whenever the teacher asked us something in Spanish I was confused” Amreen said. “And I remember doing this project where we had to write something in Spanish. So I was confused but I got help.”

Ng said that’s how the program is designed — the first year is a struggle but students and teachers start to see the results by the third grade.

Students who are bilingual and biliterate outperform those who speak only one language

Studies have shown numerous benefits to these programs. One study that followed more than 27000 students in Portland Oregon from kindergarten to high school graduation found both cohorts had stronger English reading scores than peers in English-only curricula.

This ties into previous research done on the benefits children reap when they’re bilingual and biliterate — studies have shown that bilingual children outperform their monolingual peers in focus and reading comprehension. And another benefit of the program are the strong bonds the students build with each other.

“What I anticipate happening is through their educational careers these children are going to have a very strong bond” Ng said. “And those kids by default they’re going to find themselves in a lot of classes together. They don’t have too much say in this one but they’re going to be good friends for a long time.”

Of the 410 students in the school roughly half of them are in dual immersion. The program has become so successful that there’s even a waiting list to be part of it.

“This is where we wanted to be in this position” Ng said. “It’s a wonderful opportunity for our community and it’s free.”",,,,,,

YUM,Yum! Brands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL3ZlZ2FuLWZyaWVkLWNoaWNrZW4ta2ZjLXRoYWlsYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KFC Thailand Is Now Serving 'Meat Zero' Vegan Fried Chicken,"3 Mins Read

KFC has just made another move to expand its plant-based options this time launching vegan fried chicken in Thailand. Partnering with Meat Zero the Yum Brands-owned fast food chain will begin rolling out 100% plant-based fried chicken across its Green Stores in the country and possibly extend distribution in the coming months.

KFC Thailand has just added plant-based fried chicken to its menus in two of its Green Stores. The dishes Plant-Based Chicken Pop and Spicy Rice Bowl with Plant-Based Chicken Pop which will be available in 6 different combos and meal sets in the two outlets are made using the vegan analogue made by Meat Zero a homegrown plant-based brand launched by Bangkok-based food giant CPF.

While the popcorn chicken alternatives alone are confirmed to be 100% vegan it is unclear whether KFC Thailand will be cooking the product in the same fryer with other animal-based menu items or whether the sauce or dips contain other non-vegan ingredients as reported by Root The Future. Meat Zero’s own range of products while completely meat-free are not 100% vegan such as its chicken nugget substitute which contains eggs and is vegetarian-friendly.

‘Attracting new generations’

According to KFC Thailand the latest menu additions is part of the QSR chain’s plans to capture the growing numbers of mainstream flexitarians and vegans.

In June 2020 Mintel data showed that over half of urban Thai consumers are now looking to reduce meat consumption—and 45% of this group are specifically aiming to follow a strictly vegetarian or vegan diet.

In a statement KFC Thailand said the new offerings were “aimed at attracting new generations who become more conscientious about their health and sustainable consumption.” It has worked with Meat Zero to create dishes tailored to the local Thai market to “present an alternative” to mass consumers.

“Consumers will barely notice that the chicken they are eating is made from plants” said Yum Brands’ Thailand general manager Waewkanee Assoratgoon. “Whenever they want to skip real meat they can come to us and they will still enjoy the familiar delicacy.”

While initially only available in KFC Thailand’s Green Stores in Saengsom Building and Wanachai Depot Chachoengsao KFC described its latest move as part of its ongoing plant-based “roadmap” in the country suggesting that more outlets will serve vegan chicken in the future.

The chain’s fast food rival Burger King has also added plant-based options recently working with Aussie food tech v2food to launch the Plant-Based Whopper across 100 locations.

KFC’s alt-protein push

KFC Thailand’s plant-based expansion is aligned with the fast food chain’s global shift towards alternative proteins in a bid to keep up with increasingly conscious consumers.

It recently launched a meat-free burger in Singapore rolled out vegan chicken nuggets in China and is even working on developing lab-grown chicken nuggets in Russia.

But perhaps the biggest move KFC has made so far is the global partnership between food tech giant Beyond Meat and the chain’s operator Yum Brands which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The two firms are set to co-create new plant-based protein menu items exclusive to all three QSR brands which together have reach of over 50000 restaurants in 150 countries.

Tools adopted by large enterprises like traditional SIEM systems are actually decreasing the efficiency of security teams rather than delivering on their promises. SOC's leverage 4 or 5 security platforms to defend their enterprise but costs continue to rise and attacks happen more frequently. The reason for this is that traditional tools require thousands of hours of human training and tuning to attempt detection of previously known threats while constantly displaying unnecessary alerts. Solutions like SIEM NDR NTA and UEBA ultimately have become ""additive"" in terms of overall cost infrastructure and human labor while contributing to an unnecessary increase in data migration redundancy and latency. Leveraging a tool like MixMode that provides an AI layer that is self-supervised learns and adapts over time on its own without human input and is aware of context is the solution. By enabling real-time and accurate anomaly detection MixMode provides the same functional benefits of all of the traditional tools combined at a fraction of the cost without the extra noise and allows security teams to focus see the entire attack surface and catch attacks before damage is done.",,,,,,,,,,,,
