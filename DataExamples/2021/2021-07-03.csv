The Premier League club have also negotiated a 20 per cent sell-on clause for the Poland Under-21s international.

Why has he left Liverpool?

With fellow backup keepers Caoimhin Kelleher and Adrian both signing new long-term contracts at Anfield recently Grabara decided the time was right to move on in pursuit of first-team football.

What did Grabara do at Anfield?

He leaves Liverpool without making a senior appearance.

Grabara joined Liverpool for £250000 from Polish club Ruch Chorzow in January 2016. He previously had two loan spells at AGF in Denmark separated by a stint at Huddersfield Town in 2019-20.

Why has he joined Copenhagen?

FC Copenhagen sporting director Peter Christiansen pushed hard to secure Grabara’s services having previously worked with him at AGF.

Grabara enjoyed his time in Denmark previously and believes this move can help him stake a claim for senior international recognition.

What is Liverpool's goalkeeping situation?

Liverpool will go into next season with Kelleher as the No 2 behind Alisson and Adrian providing further cover.

They also have high hopes for teenage Brazilian keeper Marcelo Pitaluga who was signed from Fluminense in October 2020.

Grabara joined the Reds from Ruch Chorzow in a £250000 deal in 2016 and was a regular on the fringes of the first team throughout his time with the club.

After a loan spell with AGF Aarhus in 2019 the Pole spent a campaign with Huddersfield in the Championship before returning to AGF in the Danish Superliga for the 2020/21 season.

There he caught the eye of their rivals FC Copenhagen who moved to complete a permanent transfer for the goalkeeper worth £3 million.

Liverpool negotiated a 20 percent sell-on clause in the deal which could prove lucrative in the future if Grabara is able to cement himself as an option for the Poland national team.

Grabara failed to make an appearance for the first team at Liverpool but was named on the substitutes’ bench for the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in the League Cup in 2018.

An outspoken character with strong reflexes and command of his penalty area Grabara was a popular figure at AGF and the club were keen to extend his stay.

Instead he will be playing against them next season having committed to Copenhagen on a five-year deal.

“I am really looking forward to being part of FCK which is not just a big club in Denmark and Scandinavia but also in the rest of Europe” he told the Danish club’s official website.

“I know the club from my time in Denmark and I have been in Parken as an opponent. It is a great place to be a football player and I look forward to trying it out here as an FCK player.

“I arrive ready to win titles and play with the best in the world at F.C. Copenhagen but I also come to be a better goalkeeper.

“I know the competition is tough at this club but I am ready to work hard on the training ground and be part of the team so that we all develop.”

All the best Kamil!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy9jb3B5LWRlY2xhcmF0aW9uLWluZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1mb3VuZC1zY290cy0yNDQ0ODU2MNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy9jb3B5LWRlY2xhcmF0aW9uLWluZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1mb3VuZC1zY290cy0yNDQ0ODU2MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Copy of US Declaration of Independence found in Scots loft sells for more than £3m at auction,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A copy of the United States Declaration of Independence discovered in an attic in Scotland has sold at auction for more than £3 million.

The signer's copy is a representation of the original 1 776 docume nt that declared the independence of Britain's 13 American colonies.

It was presented to Charles Carroll of Carrollton a Founding Father who was one of the signers of the declaration and later a United States senator.

He gave it to his grandson-in-law John MacTavish (1787-1852) a Scottish-Canadian diplomat and it descended in the Scottish family.

It was discovered in the attic of a Scottish ancestral home by Edinburgh-based auctioneers Lyon & Turnbull who passed it to their sister auction house Freeman's in the US.

The rare document sold on July 1 for 4420000 US dollars (£3210000) the second highest ever paid at auction for a copy of the Declaration of Independence.

Cathy Marsden who works at Lyon & Turnbull discovered the document which was unaccounted for for nearly 180 years.

She said: ""I was looking through a pile of papers which had been brought down from the attic amongst which was a folded up vellum document. Opening it up I could see was a copy of the Declaration of Independence.

""When I got back to the office and started doing some research I became really excited as its significance became clearer.

""After extensive research we confirmed it was indeed one of the 201 copies made by William Stone of which only 48 of them are known to still exist. Being able to identify to whom the copy belonged made it even more exciting and rare.""

Paul Roberts vice-chairman of Lyon & Turnbull and president of Freeman's in Philadelphia said: ""This was a great effort from both teams on both sides of the Atlantic a very proud moment for me personally - an international team working in perfect harmony to achieve a wonderful result on behalf of an extremely appreciative and supportive client.

""When Cathy Marsden first showed me this document on Christmas Eve I knew it was interesting but today's outcome - achieving 4420000 on the eve of Independence Day weekend nearly 4000 miles away - is extraordinary.""

The seller of the document has chosen to remain anonymous.

Arsenal star Reiss Nelson sparks transfer exit speculation as winger puts luxury £3m mansion up for sale

ARSENAL ace Reiss Nelson has sparked speculation of a Gunners departure by putting his £3million mansion up for sale.

The winger's plush pad in Barnet North London is up for grabs suggesting the 21-year-old is on the move.

But it is said to be with the view to sending him out on loan next season.

The England Under-21 striker has two years left on his current deal but has not broken through under Mikel Arteta.

And CBS Sports' James Benge claims the Gunners want the Londoner to develop his senior experience elsewhere.

With this seemingly in mind Nelson is flogging his swanky home.

The Georgian-style gaff is discreetly located in an exclusive gated development of just five detached houses.

It's directly off the hugely desirable Camlet Way in the London suburb of Hadley Wood.

The six-bedroom palace is described as having state-of-the-art contemporary fittings as well period sash windows and a beautiful oak central staircase.

It is spread over three storeys and has a total floor space of 4738-square-feet.

The listing also notes: ""Two vast loft bedrooms on the top floor could also be utilised to create a home cinema a gym an office space or a children's playroom.""

Hertha Berlin wanted Nelson on loan early in 2020-21 after his impressive temporary spell with Hoffenheim two years earlier.

But he was keen to forge a way into Arteta's plans as the Spaniard struggled to revive Arsenal.

Now though the academy product might have to accept the only way he can progress with the Gunners is to spend time away.

It is claimed German clubs as well as long-term admirers Olympiacos are again keen on the Arsenal academy product.

Greg Abbott in Republican primary,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbmV3cy9kYWlseS1jb21tZW50L2dyZWctYWJib3R0cy1yYWRpY2FsLXRlcm0taW4tdGV4YXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greg Abbott's Radical Term in Texas,"Donald Trump’s declaration that he was going to build a “great great wall” at the southern border and that Mexico was going to pay for it a pledge he repeated hundreds of times was one of his most easily debunked 2016 campaign-trail whoppers. His Administration struggled to construct about fifty miles of new barrier at a cost of billions of dollars to U.S. taxpayers which some migrants managed to scale with handmade wooden ladders. But that didn’t stop Greg Abbott the two-term governor of Texas who is seeking reëlection next year from vowing last month to build a wall of his own. Texas he said would contribute two hundred and fifty million dollars from the public treasury and use crowdfunding to help pay for the rest. The idea is as illogical and unaffordable as ever but Abbott isn’t as interested in building a wall as he is in constructing a winning campaign message.

This past week Trump joined Abbott on a trip to the Rio Grande Valley where they were briefed by law-enforcement leaders and visited a section of the border with Mexico before joining Fox News’ Sean Hannity for an interview in front of an energized crowd. At one point Trump claimed that had his plans not been thwarted by Democrats the wall could have been completed “in a couple of months.” “We were just about finished” he said. Abbott who is facing at least one Republican opponent to his right in next year’s primary for governor sees little downside to declaring his fealty to Trump. He called the former President “a great friend of mine” and said that securing the border was “a job that you did but a job the Biden Administration is completely failing us on.”

Emboldened by the unexpectedly strong showing by the Texas G.O.P. in the November elections Abbott and his allies in the Republican-dominated statehouse turned this year’s biennial legislative session into a conservative dreamscape. They passed a slate of hard-line measures that included a law prohibiting abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected with no exceptions for rape or incest and empowering private citizens to sue anyone they believe may have helped a person avoid the ban. Another new law allows most Texas residents to carry a handgun without a permit—never mind that according to a Quinnipiac poll released in late June seventy-four per cent of Texans said that they opposed the idea of carrying a handgun without a license or training. (In the same poll only thirty-nine per cent of respondents said that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.) And there is the law that bans schools from requiring “an understanding of The 1619 Project” produced by the Times. According to the law due to take effect on September 1st teachers may not tell students that “slavery and racism are anything other than deviations from betrayals of or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the United States.”

One piece of unfinished business is Abbott’s determination to pass restrictions that will make it harder for some reliably Democratic voters to cast ballots. The proposed measures some of the strictest in the country would limit early-voting hours make it more difficult to vote by mail and allow a judge to overturn a result based on a challenger’s unsubstantiated assertion that fraudulent votes changed the outcome. On May 30th Democrats slipped out of the House chamber to deny the Republican leadership the quorum required to pass the new rules which the G.O.P. has presented as a matter of “election integrity.” (According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in May sixty-one per cent of Republicans still believe that the election was stolen from Trump despite the fact that more than fifty lawsuits have been thrown out and Trump’s own Administration dismissed the claim.) The Democrats’ victory will be short-lived however should Abbott as expected push the measures through a special session scheduled to begin on Tuesday. The anticipated law according to James Henson the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin will put Democrats “at a significant disadvantage.”

Abbott is accustomed to being an anti-Democratic combatant. As the state attorney general he sued the Obama Administration more than two dozen times targeting the Affordable Care Act the Voting Rights Act and environmental regulations designed to limit climate change. He entertained audiences by telling them “I go into the office in the morning I sue Barack Obama and I go home.” He tacked modestly toward the middle two years ago after Democrats flipped twelve seats in the Texas House two in the State Senate two in Congress and gave Senator Ted Cruz a scare. But in the decisive 2020 results Abbott saw a distinctly red future.

Abbott’s own favorability ratings are mixed with only forty-four per cent of Texans approving of his performance according to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll last month. He endured a rough spot earlier this year when a winter storm knocked out power to large parts of the state. After thermal power plants powered by natural gas froze the state’s passion for deregulation and a determination to operate independently left its utilities without a backup plan. For days Texans shivered and went without water. Many electricity customers whose contracts were tied to fluctuating wholesale prices saw astronomical spikes in their bills. Abbott tried to shift blame falsely implicating wind turbines and saying that the calamity “shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America.” As Abbott and Trump made the rounds this past week Vicente Gonzalez a Democratic congressman whose district encompasses the border city of McAllen reminded voters of the power grid’s collapse. “Wasting taxpayer dollars to promote the construction of a border wall instead of correcting the failed power grid” he said “is bad leadership that is further putting Texans’ lives at risk.”

There is no denying that Biden is facing trouble on the border. In May U.S. Customs and Border Protection took a hundred and eighty thousand people into custody along the Mexico border. Nearly forty per cent of the stops involved individuals who had been stopped at least once in the previous twelve months the agency reported. Abbott is not the only Republican governor using the situation to project toughness. This past week Ron DeSantis Florida’s governor and a prospective Presidential candidate made a show of sending fifty law officers to Texas to help out. Kristi Noem the governor of South Dakota followed with an announcement that she was sending up to fifty National Guard members to the southern border on a mission underwritten by a private donor. The governors of Iowa Nebraska and Arkansas said that they too would send personnel. On Hannity’s show Abbott said that what’s happening at the border is nothing less than “the erosion of the social fabric of the United States of America.”

Trump who spoke at each of three events with Abbott during his border visit pinballed between praise for Texas sheriffs and the state G.O.P. leadership and a familiar litany of complaints and boasts many only loosely connected with reality. He lit into Representative Ilhan Omar the Minnesota Democrat who fled Somalia with her family when she was eight. “How’s her country doing by the way? And they’re telling us how to run our country right now.” Trump also bragged that he had won Texas last year “in a landslide.” (In fact Trump’s margin of victory—5.6 per cent—was smaller than that of any winner since Bob Dole in 1996 and more than three points narrower than in 2016.) “They were saying ‘Well Texas is going to be close.’ I said ‘Well I’m in favor of oil I’m in favor of God and I’m in favor of guns. And they’re not.’ ”

Mustafa Tameez a Democratic strategist in Houston sees Abbott as a “mini-Trump.” “He’s given up on the middle” Tameez said. “He’s given up on moderation and any idea of what used to be the big-tent G.O.P.” If Democrats who have what Tameez called a “bad brand” in Texas hope to flip the state they must continue to find ways to appeal to independents and suburban moderates. “The kinds of things that Abbott is doing” Tameez told me “are really losing those independent voters.” Abbott seems to be wagering that if he rallies the Republican base while making it harder for Democrats to turn out their voters he can withstand any losses he might suffer among moderates. It doesn’t help that Democrats are still searching for a gubernatorial candidate. As Henson at the University of Texas said Abbott and the Republican legislators are operating in “an environment where they don’t perceive a lot of threats.” Craig Murphy a Republican strategist who has worked with Abbott told me “He’s going to win his primary easily and he’s going to win the general election easily. I’ve taken polls recently and I’ve seen it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDcvMDQvZ292LWFiYm90dC1yZWJvdW5kcy1hZ2FpbnN0LXBvc3NpYmxlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItbWF0dGhldy1tY2NvbmF1Z2hleS1oYXMtcmF6b3ItdGhpbi1lZGdlLW92ZXItYWN0b3Iv0gGmAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9nb3YtYWJib3R0LXJlYm91bmRzLWFnYWluc3QtcG9zc2libGUtY2hhbGxlbmdlci1tYXR0aGV3LW1jY29uYXVnaGV5LWhhcy1yYXpvci10aGluLWVkZ2Utb3Zlci1hY3Rvci8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Abbott rebounds against possible challenger Matthew McConaughey has razor-thin edge over actor,"AUSTIN — Gov. Greg Abbott after trailing potential challenger Matthew McConaughey in the spring has rebounded and now has a slight — but not statistically significant — lead over the movie star in a hypothetical matchup in next year’s race for governor according to a poll released Sunday by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler.

Abbott a two-term Republican is favored by 39% of Texans of all political stripes while McConaughey who hasn’t picked a political party or even committed to running draws backing from 38%. Nearly a quarter of Texans said they’d vote for someone else.

The poll conducted June 22-29 surveyed 1090 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. It surveyed Texas voters on wide range of state and political issues.

It showed that since April Abbott has improved his standing with all voters though he’s still behind among independents. He is likely to handily dispatch fellow Republican and former state Sen. Don Huffines of Dallas in their tussle for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. Among Texans who say they’ll vote in the Republican primary Abbott leads Huffines 77% to 12%.

While no major Democrat has announced against Abbott former El Paso congressman and presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke hasn’t ruled out another bid for statewide office.

If O’Rourke tosses his bandanna in the ring he starts out behind: While about two-thirds of Democrats support O’Rourke 78% of the more numerous Republicans back Abbott. And Abbott’s edging O’Rourke among independents (35%-28%) for an overall lead of 45%-33% in their general-election showdown.

McConaughey has said he’s giving “honest consideration” to running for governor in his home state. Politics is “a broken business” and it’s time for someone with his “aggressively centric” approach he told the Austin American-Statesman in March.

Poll respondent Richard Schiller of Sunnyvale though a fan of McConaughey’s acting said he’ll stick with Abbott.

Abbott “has done a damned good job on the border” is wise to want to tighten election laws and shouldn’t be blamed for the February electricity and water outages which were the grid manager’s fault said Schiller 64 an information management official at Bank of America.

While Schiller said he disagrees with some things the two-term Republican incumbent has done such as recently signing a law that removes background checks and required training for carrying handguns he strongly opposes an O’Rourke proposal to confiscate assault-style weapons.

“I know what Abbott stands for; I have no earthly idea what Matthew stands for” Schiller said of McConaughey.

Retired teacher Vicki Lococo of Friendswood who is Hispanic and said her family has been in the U.S. for several generations many having served in the military said she also strongly supports Abbott and his border policy.

Lococo 61 said liberals and leftists have “ulterior motives” in welcoming asylum-seekers and other migrants hoping to convert them into Democratic voters though they lack appreciation of America’s history and traditions. She repeated Abbott’s assertions last winter that migrants were bringing COVID-19 into Texas.

More generally Lococo likes Abbott’s conservative policies.

“He gives a lot back to the family and family rights as far as education of our children” she said.

Cracks in Abbott’s support

Abbott continues to show weakness however among suburban swing voters. Some poll respondents who are independents said they are repelled by the governor’s recent rightward tack on legislation his warnings that migrants are vectors for disease and his push to block public schools’ instruction on systemic racism.

“I will vote for anyone but Abbott at this point” said former Republican voter Jonah Hanft of Saginaw.

“I don’t know if he’s governing or if he’s just ... repeating what’s on Twitter” said Hanft who teaches AP European and world history in the Arlington school district.

“It’s almost like he wants to say there’s a danger ... the immigrants are bringing COVID. And I am 47 OK? I’ve heard this before. You’re switching memes around. And living by fear is not my thing.”

Pollster Mark Owens who teaches political science at UT-Tyler noted that Abbott improved his standing with potential GOP primary voters with 67% of them picking him over McConaughey in June compared with just 59% in April.

Simultaneously Abbott nearly doubled his admittedly small support among Democrats to 15% in the latest poll. Among independents McConaughey continued to lead Abbott though by 39%-29% compared with 44%-28% in April.

“Signing new laws and optimism of new jobs across the state has given a renewed context for Governor Abbott to regain support from conservative voters who were disaffected by pandemic restrictions” Owens said.

“Abbott’s ability to bring Matthew McConaughey’s popularity back to his stratosphere comes after an endorsement by former President Trump and a time when Matthew McConaughey has been quiet about his political ambition.”

Advertisement

Still not everything is coming up roses for Abbott. His job approval rating is respectable with 50% approving of his performance and 36% disapproving.

But that pales next to the 61%-23% split in his favor in April 2020 as Texans rallied around him in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic.

Also Texans’ assessment of Abbott’s response to the devastating February winter storm has soured at least slightly. For the first time though it’s within the poll’s margin of error more said Abbott responded not well or not well at all than said he performed well or very well.

And amid continued calls for conservation of electricity Texas voters are losing confidence that the state’s electricity grid can withstand heat waves and spiking demand this summer the poll showed.

Only 39% said they trust the grid to deliver power without blackouts this summer.

Pollster Owens noted that recent calls for state residents to lower thermostats while electric-generating plants were offline for maintenance have increased skepticism about the grid — and tugged at Abbott’s storm-response approval numbers. In April 54% said Abbott responded well or very well compared with just 47% in the latest survey.

Texas’ own border wall

The poll part of an ongoing collaboration between The News and UT-Tyler’s Center for Opinion Research brought mixed results for Abbott’s latest big ventures — building a state barrier at the Texas-Mexico border and calling lawmakers back into an overtime session that begins Thursday.

Even though Abbott has called for crowdsourcing much of the wall’s cost a majority of voters (56%) are unlikely or definitely will not donate to the wall the poll found. On the other hand 30% plan to donate and 14% are not sure.

Last month Abbott and GOP legislative leaders agreed to raid the state prison system’s budget for a $250 million “down payment” toward the state’s border-wall effort.

That’s marginally popular. By 43% to 35% a plurality of voters would support more revenue being used to complete the barrier at the border.

Respondents who were “not sure yet” if they would donate often added that their concern was primarily trust in how the funds would be managed. The respondents would be more likely to donate if they were assured all of their donation went to construction of the wall.

John Cerruti of Sachse a corporate IT administrator tentatively praised Abbott’s plan to build a border barrier.

Cerruti 39 a recent transplant from Northern California said he likes Texas’ low taxes and quality of life. The father of two young boys said he’ll back Abbott for reelection “because I just don’t know any policies that McConaughey is standing for what his agenda would be.”

As for the wall Cerruti said while he favors its construction “to actually go and donate money for it? I don’t think I’m probably doing that.”

Of using taxpayer funds Cerruti said “It’s worth investing some state funds towards that. I wouldn’t want to see other things critical areas where the state has needs get sacrificed for it. But if there is the opportunity to put some money towards it I’d be in favor of that.”

‘Election integrity’ bill

For the special session the poll shows some useful developments for Abbott and state GOP leaders.

Abbott promised to call the special session after House Democrats in late May defeated a GOP-backed elections bill — by breaking a quorum and stalling business in their chamber as the regular session neared its end.

While most Texans continue to believe there is not widespread voter fraud in the state’s elections June’s poll was the first by The News and UT-Tyler to detect less than a majority of registered voters agreeing with that: 46% said there’s not widespread fraud in Texas elections while 26% said there is.

As pollster Owens noted “A belief that elections are not secure sets a different paradigm in which the public sees the importance of an election integrity bill in the special session.”

While 40% of Democrats said the election bill being debated by the Legislature would reduce fairness 61% of Republicans said it either would preserve or restore fairness.

Asked whether the hours a polling location is open for early voting should be set by the state or county election officials all registered voters deadlocked: 37% said the state 39% said county officials and 24% said they don’t know enough to answer.

But when sorted by party and beliefs about how widespread voter fraud is in Texas there was no contest: A majority of Republicans (54%) and believers in widespread fraud (59%) favored having the state set polling-place hours during early voting. 51% of Democrats and 53% of those who said fraud isn’t widespread said county officials should set the hours.

Doug Hurstell who said he’s a “semi-active member” of the Bacliff Republican Party in north Galveston County said former President Ronald Reagan built a growing GOP. But today’s leaders such as Abbott are “infested with Trumpism” a philosophy that tends to fixate on election rules because it can’t win over new supporters he said.

“It’s all perpetuating the big lie” he said of state GOP leaders’ election bill referring to Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged.

“He told a story it failed he doubled down on it” said Hurstell 47 an inspector of piping and pressure vessels at refineries and pipeline systems. “The bigger the lie the more people that will believe it. There’s a thing going on here and preventing people from voting is like the most unAmerican thing I can think of.”

Critical race theory transgender athletes

The poll also tested sentiments on two other issues that might come up during the special session — restrictions on what public-school teachers can say about “critical race theory” and which sports transgender youth can compete in.

In the regular session lawmakers passed and Abbott signed a bill that seeks to discourage teaching about critical race theory. The theory — recently co-opted by conservative pundits — is a decades-old academic framework that explores how racism is embedded in U.S. policies and systems.

Last month the governor pledged to do more to stop such instruction during the special session.

Asked if they agree or disagree that K-12 teachers should be permitted to discuss how historical examples of discrimination in our laws apply to inequalities today 51% of registered voters supported allowing K-12 teachers to teach about historical examples of discrimination and 27% opposed. Among college-educated voters support was higher at 58%. Among voters with a high school degree or less it dipped to 45%.

While 78% of Democrats want teachers to be free to link past discrimination to current inequalities only 32% of Republicans did and 48% of Republicans opposed.

On transgender sports 56% of voters said it is fair to pass a state law that assigns a student to a sports team that matches what was listed on the student’s birth certificate not the gender the student identifies with. An additional 17% said it’s not fair and 26% said it depends. A bare majority (52%) of those under 45 support the policy compared with 59% of those 45 and older.

Jazzmin Wilson of Humble 25 who earned a law degree and a master’s in history and is studying for the state bar exam said Abbott wants to “cripple the education system” in Texas.

“I have no problem with conservative politics but this is not even like conservative because for someone who doesn’t want the government involved in overreaching in people’s lives he’s really overreaching in people’s lives” she said.

Vaccine Paxton Dreamers

The poll also found:

55% of respondents have received the COVID-19 vaccine up from 44% in April and 21% in February. As in the year’s previous two polls 26% continue to say they would not take the vaccine or are unlikely to. Hesitancy among Blacks is especially notable. Among the 23% of all respondents who haven’t been immunized but haven’t completely ruled out getting the shots 60% haven’t tried to make an appointment. Among such procrastinators African Americans are twice as likely as Latinos and whites to cite concern over possible side effects.

A plurality of all voters continues to say Attorney General Ken Paxton accused by former associates of misuse of office has the integrity to be the state’s top lawyer: 33% say he does and 25% say he doesn’t. “These numbers are likely to soften” pollster Owens said as Paxton’s two opponents in next year’s GOP primary for attorney general Land Commissioner George P. Bush and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman begin pounding on him. Among likely primary voters Paxton has support from 42%; Bush 34%; and Guzman 4%. A Trump endorsement could shake up the race though not push any of the three clear of a probable runoff Owens said.

Asked if they support or oppose granting permanent legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally when they were children 47% said they favor easing the so-called Dreamers’ fears of deportation. However that’s down from 53% in October. While 24% oppose the overall debate on border security and immigration may be softening support Owens said.

Methodology

The Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler Poll is a statewide random sample of 1090 registered voters conducted between June 22-29. The mixed-mode sample includes 256 registered voters surveyed over the phone by the University of Texas at Tyler with support from ReconMR and 834 registered voters randomly selected from Dynata’s panel of online respondents. The margin of error for a sample of 1090 registered voters in Texas is +/- 3.0 percentage points and the more conservative margin of sampling error that includes design effects from this poll is +/- 3.4 percentage points for a 95% confidence interval.

The online and phone surveys were conducted in English and Spanish using information from the 2020 Current Population Survey and Office of the Texas Secretary of State. The sample’s gender age race/ethnicity education metropolitan density and vote choice were matched to the population of registered voters in Texas.

PolitiFact's ruling: False

Here's why: BRACKETTVILLE — In April the local elected officials of Kinney County felt that they were under siege. Their expanse of rocky borderland located 100 miles west of San Antonio had become a perilous crossing ground for migrants who had made their way across the Rio Grande.

So Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan took an unprecedented measure. He issued a local state of disaster a statutory procedure typically invoked by communities experiencing hurricanes floods or wildfires.

“On April 21 1836 Texas won her independence during the battle at San Jacinto the final and decisive battle of the Texas Revolution” Shahan a Republican wrote in the disaster declaration. “Today 185 years later Texas is once again under siege as thousands upon thousands of illegal aliens invade our State through our border with Mexico.”

The move caught momentum. Over the next month similar declarations were issued by another 14 counties — some located along the border others more than 200 miles away.

By May 31 the issue culminated in Gov. Greg Abbott issuing his own disaster proclamation citing a “humanitarian crisis in many Texas communities along the border.” Then he took his border response one step further when on June 16 he announced that Texas would undertake border wall construction using a combination of state dollars and crowdfunding to stave off what he and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called an invasion.

""What has changed is the carnage that is being caused by the people coming across the border"" Abbott said in a press conference announcing his border wall plans. ""Fences of ranchers along the border are being completely decimated causing border ranchers to lose their livestock or border farmers to lose their crops. Homes are being invaded. Neighborhoods are dangerous and people are being threatened on a daily basis with guns.""

Later Patrick added that “this is a fight for our survival.”

The crush of migrants crossing into Texas has spiked by 360% so far this year compared with the first half of 2020 according to federal data. The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has recorded nearly 400000 migrant encounters in Texas this year although a large portion of this total up to 38% in some months is due to migrants re-entering the country after at least one prior expulsion.

The surge is a product of drastic changes in immigration policy between the previous and current presidential administrations combined with a worsening set of economic circumstances in migrants’ origin countries — primarily Mexico Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador.

When asked by a reporter if Abbott has any intention to address the humanitarian needs of those entering the U.S. seeking a better life he instead emphasized the humanitarian needs of Texans.

“I'm focused on the humanitarian crisis that Texans are suffering through” Abbott said. “Texans on the border are suffering through a humanitarian crisis by having their lives disrupted with guns and gangs and being riddled with crime.”

So what does the invasion of Texas borderlands look like in places like Kinney County? And to what extent are these migrants causing “carnage” a word that by all definitions denotes violent killings?

Violent crime in the borderland

Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe’s small department oversees 1360 square miles of hardpan terrain and 16 linear miles of the Rio Grande. And in Coe’s 35 years of law enforcement in the region never has he seen the current level of activity.

“We're going non-stop” he said. “There's no end in sight.""

The types of calls his deputies repeatedly respond to relate to the migrants trespassing through private ranches. The fences they cut aggravate ranchers for allowing livestock to escape. The water lines they slash for hydration can drain ranchers’ reservoirs.

Then there are the cases of migrants breaking and entering into empty ranch houses or deer blinds often leaving places disheveled and pantries ransacked. Occasionally firearms will turn up missing.

“They always take water and they take food but one (rancher) reported they took various other things lying around the house — binoculars knives things like that” Coe said.

But there hasn’t been an increase in violent crimes in Kinney County Coe said. And the same appears to be true for many counties within the state’s border region. Among all rural border counties that have submitted violent crime data to the state’s Unified Crime Reporting program violent crimes are occurring at a similar if not slower pace this year compared to 2020.

The same is generally true for the border’s urban areas according to the Unified Crime Reporting data which was obtained through an open records request. Among the border’s largest cities El Paso Brownsville and Edinburg are all on pace to match last year’s violent crime numbers while Laredo is on pace to reduce its annual crime rate. Only the city of McAllen is on pace to exceed last year’s violent crime totals.

Rather it’s property crimes and migrant rescues that have law enforcement agencies working overtime.

In the heart of the Chihuahuan Desert the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s Office has responded to brush fires set by desperate migrants hoping to be found by authorities. They’ve reported a rash of cut fences cut water lines and break-ins of empty ranch houses.

""They're not stealing anything per se that's of any value but they are breaking in and getting food and water and stuff like that"" Hudspeth County Sheriff Arvin West said.

The same goes for Terrell County whose sheriff’s department is now mostly occupied with migrant-related calls.

“The takings (from break-ins) are not necessarily televisions and stereos or anything like that it's mostly travel things — clothing shoes boots food water” said Terrell County Sheriff Santiago Gonzalez. “The kinds of things you would carry when you're out camping or out walking.""

But violent crimes and murders? ""Oh no. Definitely not” Gonzalez said.

To Pam Rivas a landowner with several acres along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo County the only major change in her community resulting from the border crisis is the ubiquity of state troopers. In May Abbott deployed 1000 state troopers and national guard members to the border region to combat drug smuggling.

Rivas spent her childhood growing up on the river-front property but today she can't travel the roads without being closely tailgated by a state trooper or having her car searched.

Although she has seen some migrants make their way through the area it's law enforcement that makes her feel harassed. Recently her car was searched by state troopers after she was observed by Border Patrol driving on her own land.

""Just because I go and take a cruise on my property I'm guilty of something?"" she said.

Car thefts

Although the border crisis hasn’t had a major impact on violent crime rates so far this year one crime statistic that has spiked in some areas is car thefts.

In Lavaca County which is over 230 miles from the border the sheriff’s office has recorded more than 10 stolen vehicles so far this year which is about five times higher than what the county has recorded in years prior.

“Several of those vehicles have been recovered during vehicle pursuits with human cargo between here and the (Rio Grande) Valley” said Lavaca County Sheriff Micah Harmon. “We know that that’s the reason they’re being stolen and what they’re being used for.”

And one sheriff in Goliad County reportedly found a site on a ranch that was being used to strip stolen vehicles “for the purpose of human trafficking.”

But surging car thefts isn’t occurring everywhere. While state data shows that the number of car thefts in El Paso in the first half of 2021 is already close to last year’s total other cities — like McAllen and Laredo — have low car theft incidents so far this year.

Nonetheless stolen vehicles and high-speed pursuits have become increasingly common in the border’s rural areas. While the incidents themselves aren’t considered a violent crime high-speed pursuits of smugglers with human cargo have often resulted in crashes which have left many migrants seriously injured or killed.

“Personally I consider that when a driver of a stolen vehicle flees from us and he crashes into a tree and injures nine or 10 people and fails to stop and render aid to those people — I call that pretty violent” Harmon said referring to a recent pursuit involving his deputies that began in the city of Hallettsville.

Migrant deaths

Harmon’s point underscores a theme that is wound though many sheriff’s experiences of the border crisis: The people who are encountering death in the borderlands are the migrants themselves — contrary to Abbott’s claim that it’s the migrants who are bringing “carnage” upon Texans.

Emergency call centers routinely receive calls from lost migrants asking to be rescued. In Hudspeth County a drought-stricken desert expanse the sheriff’s office sometimes responds to 15 rescue calls per day. Other migrants have poorer luck.

""I've had 20 dead ones since September” West said. ""They're in canyons. They're on mountains. They could be seven eight 10 miles from any closest road.""

“They just don’t realize how much water it takes to come across the desert like this” he said.

The growing tally of deceased migrants is much the same elsewhere. Terrell County has recorded 10 — the most migrant deaths “this county has seen in I don’t know how many years” Gonzalez said.

Kinney County has recorded around seven which is two or three times the county's totals of previous years. Some succumb to heat exhaustion; others are found drowned in the river.

“The words ‘invasion’ and ‘carnage.’ What does that depict? That depicts horrific violence that has no place here” said Karla Vargas an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project representing several landowners fighting government land seizures. “If you want to talk about carnage let's talk about the carnage that these people are fleeing.”

Our ruling

According to Abbott the border crisis is causing Texans to suffer by disrupting their lives “with guns and gangs and being riddled with crime.” And it's the people who are crossing the border that are causing “carnage” in the state he said.

But this violent rhetoric is an exaggerated depiction of what law enforcement agencies are encountering on the ground.

If we take carnage to mean criminal violence and killings state and local crime data doesn’t back that up. Although various law enforcement agencies in border communities have recorded a rash of property crimes attributable to traveling migrants — like break-ins cut fences and car thefts — violent crime is relatively steady compared to last year.

We rate this claim False.

Editor's note: An earlier version of this article failed to indicate with punctuation that Abbott's statement was a partial quote. The story has been updated with the full statement.

Adobe released its Acrobat Reader DC app onto the new Windows 11 Microsoft Store.

The app is a full-featured x86 viewer for signing and sharing PDFs.

Acrobat Reader DC is just the latest of many ""classic"" Win32 apps appearing in the new store thanks to Microsoft's relaxed policies.

With Microsoft's new Store for Windows 11 comes looser restrictions on the types of apps allowed to appear. Even though it has only been a few days since the Store went live in the latest Insider preview for Windows 11 several classic apps have already appeared including OBS Studio Zoom Canva Microsoft Edge extensions and WinZip.

Now as spotted on our Discord channel Adobe has brought its full x86 Acrobat Reader DC app to the Microsoft Store.

Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)

Acrobat Reader DC is a free full-featured app for ""viewing printing signing sharing and annotating PDFs"" and is considered the gold standard if you deal a lot with PDFs. While Adobe has other apps like Adobe Reader Touch on the store for Windows 10 it is a bit more basic and much older going back to the Windows 8 days back in 2012.

Even though Acrobat Reader DC goes back years for Adobe it is also regularly updated usually for security and continuous support with the latest appearing on June 8.

Because of how the new Microsoft Store works the version listed is the latest from Adobe as it comes from the company direct. Indeed updates for this app won't go through the Microsoft Store at all. Instead it is all handled via the app as it can ping Adobe's servers just as if you had installed it from their website.

There are still at least four months before Windows 11 is released which leaves plenty of time for even more apps to appear. It'll be interesting to watch to see which other ones show up in the coming weeks.

Microsoft has relaxed restrictions on apps that can be submitted to Windows 11’s app store. As a result companies like Zoom and Adobe are now publishing their full-fledged desktop apps to the Microsoft Store.

With Windows 10 Microsoft Store has become more user and developer-friendly. For users Store is seeing a major redesign making it much easier for you to download large apps and games on your device. Similarly Microsoft has redesigned the homepage of the store to help you find their apps easily.

Instead of searching for your favourite apps on Google or Bing you’ll be able to find them in the redesigned Microsoft Store. As we reported recently several well-known apps are already available on the new store. For example OBS Studio and Canva have published their desktop apps in the Store.

Earlier today Adobe’s free PDF reader also appeared in the Microsoft Store. Adobe is a full-desktop app and it isn’t the most lightweight download but all features are offered and Microsoft is not limiting the functionality of the app.

If you already use other Adobe products you can always connect the Store version of Acrobat Reader DC to the company’s storage cloud and sync your activities.

The Microsoft Store version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is a simple port of the app already available on the company’s website. It’s free and it can handle opening multiple large files and you can also annotate documents in this program using the app’s in-built controls or Windows 11’s inking feature without worrying that it will crash on you.

More desktop and web apps coming to the Microsoft Store

From Win32 to web apps Microsoft’s renewed focus on Windows Store has been welcomed by the developers. In addition to Adobe Zoom OBS Studio Canva TikTok and the web app ClimChamp are also available in the Microsoft Store.

Canva confirmed that their desktop app will be available for download when Windows 11 comes out. On the other hand ClimChamp’s web app is now available for everyone.

The launch of Windows 11 is expected in October but a wider rollout is not expected until early next year. Fortunately Microsoft has already confirmed that the new Store won’t be exclusive to Windows 11 and these apps will also arrive for Windows 10 users later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudHJpYnVuZTI0Mi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2p1bC8wNC9icGwtc2t5Z3VhcmQtdHJvcGljYWwtY3ljbG9uZS1zZXZlcmUtd2VhdGhlci1idWxsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BPL | SkyGuard Tropical Cyclone Severe Weather Bulletin,"Adobe Flash player 9 is required to view this video

Photoshop is a quite popular tool when it comes to editing pictures not only among professionals but even for a common user. This photo editing program provides you with many tools to improve the quality of your photos. This means that you can also adjust your images in Photoshop therefore is no need to be completely dependent on optimal environmental conditions.

Users can correct any image tones and color values to get the desired photo effects. Further we can also change the brightness with the help of the gradation curves to raise or lower the general impression of light in a picture. We can add new objects by using different types of brushes to paint almost digitally. Features list of Photoshop is vast thus leave that here and let’s talk about the main topic i.e how to use Photoshop on Ubuntu Linux?

Install and use Adobe Photoshop on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

The steps given here will also work for Linux Mint 20.1 or other Linux operating systems based on Ubuntu 20.04 such as MX Linux and POP!OS and more. As we cannot install Windows applications on Linux directly thus the only way is the WineHQ and here we will use the same.

Requirements:

Wine

PlayOnLinux

Adobe Photoshop CS6 setup

Ubuntu Linux

1. Enable 32-bit Architecture

Well there are lots of applications that still support the 32-bit CPU architecture. The good thing is that WineHQ supports both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Thus if you are using 64-bit Ubuntu then enable 32-bit support with the help of the below command.

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

2. Add Wine GPG Key

Next add the Wine GPG key that will allow us to install the verified packages from the Wine’s repository. So here are the commands- one is to download and the next one to add it.

wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key

sudo mv winehq.key /usr/share/keyrings/winehq-archive.key

3. Add Wine repository in Ubuntu 20.04

Once the GPG key is on your Ubuntu Linux the next step is to add the official repository of Wine meant for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Linux.

wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/focal/winehq-focal.sources

sudo mv winehq-focal.sources /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

4. Setup Wine to install Photoshop on Linux

Run the command to get the stable version of Wine on your system. This will install the required packages to properly set it up on Ubuntu Linux.

sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable

5. Also install PlayOnLinux

The problem with Wine is without any graphical user interface it becomes complicated for new users to easily install the dependencies required by the Windows application such as Photoshop on Linux. Hence to solve this problem we can use PlayOnLinux a GUI front-end for Wine. It makes the installation of Win apps easier than the command line. And the good thing its packages are available on the official repository of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS thus with one command we can install it on our system.

sudo apt install playonlinux

6. Install Adobe Photoshop on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Now go to the Application launcher of Ubuntu and search for PlayOnLinux when it appears click the same to run.

Click on the Install button.

7. Select Photoshop Program to install

Click on the Graphics option that will show the Wine-compatible applications available under it to install on Linux. Thus select it and then Adobe Photoshop Cs6 followed by the Install button.

Browse executable file

Click on the Browse button and go to the setup folder of Adobe Photoshop that you have downloaded to install on Windows. There select its Set-up.exe file to install.

Note: From here you have to wait for some time because the PlayOnLinux Wizard will download the required packages and for them it will give some pop-up. Just followed them and whenever it asks for your permission to install some packages give it the same.

Once the dependencies installation is completed the Welcome screen to install Photoshop will appear. If you have the Serial key then click on the Install otherwise hit the Try button.

8. Photoshop Linux Desktop shortcut

The installation is completed now there will be a shortcut on your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS desktop. Right-click on it and select “Allow Launching“ this will make the shortcut executable and turn the gear icon into Adobe Photoshop.

Double-click on the Shortcut to start this Image editor program on your Linux.

9. Start editing pictures using Photoshop on Ubuntu 20.04

Finally start using the application to edit your pictures. Well congrats we have successfully installed and configured it. However still there is no guarantee that the method will work for other Linux as well. Hence you can try out the popular Adobe Photoshop alternative for Linux if you like.",,,

Britney Spears recently testified in a hearing asking for an end to her conservatorship. Her little sister Jamie Lynn Spears spoke out in her defense. Now Jamie Lynn is saying she and her family are receiving death threats.

""Hi I respect that everyone has the right to express themselves"" she wrote on her Instagram Story. ""But can we please stop with the death threats especially the death threats to children."" She shares children Maddie Briann 13 with ex Casey Aldridge and Ivey Joan 3 with husband Jamie Watson.

It's never okay to send someone death threats. It's unclear which ""camp"" these comments are coming from because there are some fans who are unhappy with Jamie Lynn (she recently addressed this in a series of Instagram videos.

""Since the day I was born I've only loved adored and supported my sister. I mean this is my freaking big sister before any of this bullsh*t. I don't care if she wants to run away to a rainforest and have a zillion babies in the middle of nowhere or if she wants to come back and dominate the world the way she has done so many times before because I have nothing to gain or lose either way.""

""This situation does not affect me either way because I'm only her sister who's only concerned about her happiness. Maybe I didn't support the way the public would like me to with a hashtag on a public platform but I can assure you that I support my sister long before there was a hashtag and I'll support her long after.""

""If ending the conservatorship and flying to Mars or whatever the hell else she wants to do to be happy I support that 100% because I support my sister; I love my sister. Always have always will. As long as she's happy. So let's keep praying. That's all.""

Sending love to the Spears sisters!

Fox – who first found mainstream fame in 2007’s Transformers – has previously spoken out against the pervading misogyny that impacted her career.

“I think there has been a pervasive perception of me as a shallow succubus if that makes any sense for at least the first decade of my career” she told The Washington Post.

“And then that started to change more recently as people revisited my interviews listened to me speak and started to see me in a different way.”

Because of her physical appearance Fox said: “I was never really established as having been talented.”

The 35-year-old added that she noticed “people were surprised” to find she was funny when she starred in the hit comedy series New Girl as Reagan.

“More than being overlooked for my ability to handle comedy sometimes I’ve always been surprised by how easy it was for people to overlook that I’m relatively intelligent” she said.

“I was like how does that get so lost when there’s ridiculous amounts of material that can educate you otherwise?”

The This if 40 star reflected on her early career stating: “I was so lost and trying to understand like how am I supposed to feel value or find purpose in this horrendous patriarchal misogynistic hell that was Hollywood at the time.

“Because I had already been speaking out against it and everyone including other women received me in a very negative way for doing it.”

Elsewhere in the interview Fox said that she would like to see her 2009 horror film Jennifer’s Body rebooted as a TV series.

Despite an initial negative critical reception the film – directed by Juno’s Diablo Cody – has since become a cult classic.

The Spider-Man: Far From Home co-starts were spotted sharing a kiss in Los Angeles yesterday. In photos obtained by Page Six which you can see here the two were seen kissing in an Audi while stopped at a red light.

According to Page Six at one point the two were seen making silly faces at each other before Holland leaned in and caressed Zendaya's chin.

The pair were also photographed in the Silver Lake neighborhood where Zendaya's mother lives. Pictures show the two and Zendaya's mother leaving a residence together while the other are wearing casual clothes and Zendaya has no makeup on (still looking gorgeous of course).

Rumors about Zendaya and Holland dating have been floating around since they starred in Spider-Man: Homecoming together in 2017. Zendaya denied the 2017 rumors in a Variety interview that year saying ""He's literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we've had to do press tours together. There's very few people that will understand what that's like at 20 years old.""

The two have since worked together on two more Spider-Man movies with the third ""No Way Home"" set to release this December. They've also been rumored to date separate people with Zendaya being photographed often with her Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi.

In an April interview with British GQ Holland said that Zendaya helped him deal with his growing fame and strangers asking for his autograph in public. ""I used to come across sometimes as a bit of a dick to fans"" he said. ""Zendaya spotted this and quickly told me that this sort of reaction was going to be more aggro than just smiling and taking the picture. She totally changed the way I am able to be more comfortable in public.”

All human samples were obtained surgically from BC patients from whom we received informed consent at the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. The selected patients had not received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Fresh breast tumor and adjacent normal tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C before being used for microarray analysis. Our study was approved by the ethics committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University.

Human BC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 MCF-7 BT549 MDA-MB-468 and HCC1937) a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) HEK293T and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from the Cell Bank Type Culture Collection Committee Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai China). Cell lines were maintained using standard media and conditions. MDA-MB-231 MCF-7 MDA-MB-468 HEK293T and HUVECs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS Gibco). BT549 and HCC1937 were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI Gibco) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Finally MCF-10A was grown in DMEM/F12 (Macgene) medium containing 5% horse serum 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Macgene) 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone (Macgene) and 10 μg/ml insulin (Macgene). All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 cell culture incubator.

LncRNA microarray analysis

Total RNA of six paired sets of tissue from BC and adjacent normal tissues were extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies USA) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Germany). RNA quality and quantity were measured by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The microarray analysis was carried out by Agilent technologies Inc. at Sinotech Genomics Corporation. Briefly total RNA was checked for RNA integration by the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies USA) and RNA samples were synthesized to biotinylated cRNAs for the Sino Human ceRNA array V3.0. Next the biotinylated cRNAs were hybridized with the slides and the processed slides were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent technologies USA). The acquired array images were analyzed by the Feature Extraction software 10.7 (Agilent technologies USA). Finally raw data and heatmaps were produced using the R software package and the aberrant genes were selected by fold change >2 or <0.5.

Tissue microarray (TMA) and in situ hybridization (ISH)

The expression level of AC073352.1 in tissues was detected by ISH using a specific digoxigenin-labeled AC073352.1 probe on TMAs which contained 137 paraffin-embedded BC samples and 67 paired adjacent normal samples. The tissues of BC patients were obtained with detailed clinicopathologic features including age gender tumor–node–metastasis stage etc. (Qutdo Biotech Shanghai China). All of these tissues were sliced at a thickness of 4 μm and the diameter of each tissue core is 1.5 mm. Further the quantitative scanning approach was taken to analyze the staining and expression of AC073352.1 using a Nikon microscope. The ISH score was calculated by multiplying the value of intensity of positive staining by the proportion of positively stained cells. An ISH score of <0.5 represented low expression while ≥0.5 indicated high expression. The sequences for the probing of AC073352.1 are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection

Three individual siRNAs were used to knock down AC073352.1 and YBX1 these were designed and synthesized by Gene Pharma (Shanghai China) and the two with the best efficiency were selected for use intransient knockdown experiments. And siNC was used as a negative control. The siRNAs were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Lentivirus packaging and infection

For overexpression full AC073352.1 cDNA was inserted into the lentivirus expression vector pLent-EF1a-FH-CMV-GFP-P2A-puro and an empty vector was used for a transfection control group. For knockdown a lentivirus short hairpin RNA expression vector targeting the same sequence as siAC073352.1-1 was constructed by Obio Technology (Shanghai China). Next HEK293T packaging cells were transfected using a retroviral mechanism. Culture supernatants were harvested at 72 h after transfection and infected of BC cells. Stably transfected cells were established using 1 μg/ml puromycin treatment for 2 weeks and were bulk cultured for subsequent assays.

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Dalian China). Real-time PCR analyses were performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). The sequences for the gene-specific primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. β-Actin was used as an internal control.

Cell migration and invasion assays

Cell migration and invasion assays were performed using a 24-well plate and 8-μm pore size chamber inserts (Corning USA) which were precoated with or without 50 μl Matrigel (BD Biosciences USA). In both assays cells harvested in 200 μl serum-free media were seeded into the upper chamber and 600 μl medium supplemented with 20% FBS was added to the lower chamber. For migration assays 5 × 104 cells were seeded into the upper chamber without Matrigel. In addition for invasion assays 1 × 105 cells were suspended in the upper chamber with Matrigel. After 36 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO 2  the cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained by Giemsa’s stain. The images were captured with an inversion microscope (Zeiss Germany) and counting was undertaken using the ImageJ software.

Wound-healing assay

To investigate their metastatic ability cells (2 × 105 per well) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 12 h until the confluency of monolayers reached 90–100%. Further a 200-μl sterile pipette tip was used to scratch across the center of each well before the medium was replaced by new medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After incubating for 0 and 24 h images of cells in the wells were captured by an inversion microscope (Zeiss Germany). The wound area was calculated to estimate the cell’s migration efficacy.

Cell viability assay

Cell proliferation efficacy was determined using the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8; Bestbio Shanghai China). A total of 3000 cells with corresponding treatment were seeded in 96-well plates. Cell viability was measured every 24 h whereby 10 μl of CCK-8 solution was used for incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and the spectrophotometric absorbance at OD450 was determined by the SpectraMax i3X (Molecular Devices USA).

EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) incorporation assay

The transfected BC cell lines were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h and the EdU Kit (RiboBio Guangzhou China) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. DAPI (4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was applied to stain cell nuclei (Solarbio China) and images were obtained to identify positively proliferative cells by use of a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Germany).

RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization

An AC073352.1 probe was obtained from Shanghai Qutdo Biotech. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for cells on coverslips was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly the cells were washed fixed and treated by 0.5% Triton. Next cells on coverslips were incubated with each specific probe overnight before the slides were stained with DAPI. Finally fluorescence images were captured by a confocal microscope (Zeiss Germany). The sequences of the AC073352.1 probe for FISH is listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Western blot

Cells were harvested and lysed with Western/IP lysis buffer (Beyotime Haimen China) containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride fluoride (Beyotime). The protein concentration was determined using the Enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). Proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to 0.22 mm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Merck-Millipore Darmstadt Germany). The membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat milk and 1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were subsequently washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature. Finally the signals were detected by standard analysis of HRPO-induced chemiluminescence. Details of the antibodies used in western blot are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

RNA pull-down assay

In vitro full-length sequences of AC073352.1 were transcribed from their corresponding plasmids using Riboprobe Combination Systems (Promega USA) before being purified using the RNAclean Kit (Qiagen DP412) and labeled with desthiobiotinylation overnight (Magnetic RNA-Protein Pull-Down Kit Thermo). Next 1 mg protein extracted from MDA-MB-231 cells was incubated with biotin-labeled RNA and streptavidin magnetic beads for 6–12 h at 4 °C. After elution of lncRNA-associated proteins they were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Furthermore the retrieved proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (Novogene Tianjin China).

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay

A RIP assay was performed by using the Imprint RNA Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief 1 × 107 MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed with RIP lysis buffer and the lysates were incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to 5 μg anti-YBX1 (Abcam) anti-SNRP70 (positive controls) or anti-lgG (negative controls) for 3–6 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated RNA was eluted purified and dissolved in RNase-free water which was further measured through qRT-PCR analysis of YBX1. Specific primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Exosomes isolation characterization and treatment

Exosomes were isolated from BC cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation. BC cells were initially cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% exosome-free FBS. Cell supernatants were collected after 60 h and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min 2000 × g for 10 min and 10000 × g for 30 min all at 4 °C. The obtained supernatant was filtered through 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) followed by ultracentrifugation at 110000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and exosomes pellets were washed with PBS before a second ultracentrifugation was performed at 110000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C.

The purified exosomes were subjected to the following experiments:

Morphological images of exosomes were analyzed using transmission election microscopy (TEM) at 100 keV and the size distribution of exosomes was analyzed by the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) software.

To monitor exosome trafficking a PKH67 Green Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma Aldrich St Louis USA) was used to label exosomes according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The staining was terminated by addition of 1% bovine serum albumin. The PKH67-labeled exosomes were washed in PBS precipitated by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS. Next exosomes were added to HUVECs and incubated for 12 h. The nuclei were stained with DAPI and images were obtained by using a Zeiss confocal microscope system.

Endothelial tube-formation assay

HUVECs were treated with exosomes (MDA-MB-231-vector or MDA-MB-231-AC073352.1) for 12 h. Then pretreated HUVECs were seeded onto a 96-well plate coated with reduced growth factor Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 for 6 h. Tube-like structures formed by the HUVECs were imaged using a light microscope and total junction numbers were calculated automatically using the angiogenesis analyzer plugin in the ImageJ software.

Xenograft model

Five-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Weitonglihua (Peking China) and housed in pathogen-free conditions. For experimental lung metastases assays in the xenograft model MDA-MB-468 cells were stably transfected with shAC073352.1 or shNC lentiviruses and a total of 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.1 ml sterile PBS before being injected into mice via the lateral tail vein (n = 7 in each group). After 6 weeks these mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the resected lung tissues were harvested fixed and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently the number of metastatic foci in the lung was determined using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with safe guidelines and regulations and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and the Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University.

Statistical analysis

All the measurement data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V6.0 (GraphPad prism Inc. La Jolla CA United States) and SPSS V19.0 (SPSS Chicago IL United States). The significance of differences between groups were assessed using Student’s t test or χ2 test as appropriate. The results are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) of three independent experiments. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,

So when he bought a house on Tucson's west side three years ago — which came with its own detached cabin brought down from Montana and reassembled by a previous owner — he knew he wanted to open its doors to other people.

""You can tell by my murals. I'm a huge fan of the Sonoran Desert so it's really cool to let people stay in a space that's this close up"" the famed local muralist says.

Pagac listed the cabin on Airbnb and now welcomes out-of-towners and Tucsonans to stay in the space. He's just one out of dozens of Tucsonans who have done the same with their unique places.

Here are 9 interesting local spots to consider for your next staycation.

All the cabin vibes

A normal cabin might open up to pine trees and weather cooler than Tucson's. But right outside of Pagac's cabin are saguaros and a pool perfect for the hot weather.

""I love traveling and when I can't travel it's really cool to have people around the world drifting around the property"" says Pagac who co-hosts the cabin with Arielle Alelunas. ""Or locals you get to meet. Or people seeing saguaros for the first time. It's a perfect spot to explore the desert from.""

Inside the cabin is custom furniture plus furniture that came from a former lumberjack in Wyoming.

""It has that smell of a 100-year-old cabin — in a good way"" he says.

Pagac also put in a patio on the west side of the cabin where he says many creatives will sit all day with their laptops or guitars seemingly inspired by the desert views.

Stay in an Instagram-worthy space

Sometimes people book Chelsey Gaines' rental just to take photos. And browsing the listing it's obvious why.

The home is charming with its bright white walls original wood touches and paintings of cacti on the walls inside and out. There's also an artsy wall of colorful doors in the backyard perfect for Instagram selfies.

The home which is west of downtown also has a lot of history. It was built in the late 1920s once serving as home to a silversmith. Gaines left a lot of the original wood and beams in the home as a nod to its history.

Gaines also features embroidery by local artist La Bandita Embroidery in the home. Guests staying at the house are able to buy the art right off the wall.

Bask in the history of the Ball-Paylore House

Last year the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation acquired the Ball-Paylore House fearing that the home could be put on the market and destroyed.

The home was built in the 1950s by local architect Arthur T. Brown for University of Arizona faculty members Phyllis Ball and Patricia Paylore.

Brown received praise for the home's unique design that includes a hexagonal floor plan floor-to-ceiling windows and a back patio shaped as a semi-circle that features moveable shades. Brown also built the home with a passive solar design keeping sustainability in mind.

Demion Clinco executive director of the preservation foundation called the home a ""jewel box of a house.""

Open the doors to cacti

Sara and Rich Combs started The Joshua Tree House a lifestyle brand with vacation rentals in Joshua Tree California. The couple later brought the experience to Tucson.

The Tucson space includes five beautiful suites near Saguaro National Park overlooking the cacti and palo verde trees.

The couple began their journey around 2013 when starting a freelance design career for themselves. When traveling around the country they visited Joshua Tree Park and wanted to find a space of their own there.

""We had initially craved a creative retreat for ourselves and found that others were craving the same once we listed it on Airbnb while we were out of town"" the couple said in a statement. ""Since then The Joshua Tree House has grown as a brand that has the goal of offering the time and space for people to reflect reset and create.""

The Cottage at Sanctuary Cove was first listed on Airbnb three years ago but the space was rentable prior to that mostly through word of mouth. It's mostly suited for a couple — not so much families. Managed by the organization All Creeds Brotherhood The Cottage at Sanctuary Cove is one way the nonprofit is able to bring in an income (in addition to donations).

""The thing people mostly remark on when they stay here is how remote it feels even though we're really pretty close to everything"" says one of Sanctuary Cove's current caretakers Alison Boelts. ""The back patio faces Safford Peak and looks west from our property. You feel very isolated and out in nature.

""The property is on 80 acres but of course we're just a 3-minute drive from Safeway"" she says.

Mountain views from this Oro Valley space

In 2003 Reed and Kathaleen Snell built a guest house that shared several uses from an office to a space for friends and family who came to visit to a home for Kathaleen's grandmother to stay.

Several years ago though a friend of the Snells stayed at an Airbnb in Michigan and suggested that Airbnb would be a good avenue for the guest house.

And so they did it.

The home which features adobe walls and golden tones throughout is near lots of local restaurants in addition to Tucson icons like Tohono Chul Park.

Reed Snell says many guests especially love the outdoorsy feel.

""We have some windows where a lot of birds and wildlife come and hang out"" he says. ""So (guests) can sit in the front and watch that plus a great view of the mountain.""

Immerse in a space with mid-century modern touches

This space has to the cutest retro kitchenette and little touches that guests rave about.

""We got this kind of vintage refrigerator that's round-looking and right out of 'Mad Men'"" says host Joseph West. ""We designed the kitchen around that. The architecture of the house is mid-century.""

The space is an attached guest house which boasts a pool and hot tub and is centrally-located. But beyond those perks West says most of the comments he hears from guests are about the little touches throughout the space such as consistent decorations or additions of things like flowers.

Guests also like the sustainability of the home as most of the energy comes from solar panels on the roof. West is also looking into water harvesting.

The TikToker who goes by Phoenicopterus Ruber or @phoenruber on the platform shared pictures of a bed and breakfast that was supposedly listed on the Airbnb website and then compared them to what she actually found. The TikTok has received over 134000 views.

https://www.tiktok.com/@phoenruber/video/6979467575193390341?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow9avPnBrmvncteEIJN2f6k7LqcJgC0RipfeSt8FJRbrYsGfmWGP6gcfuLDKcbmYKRGgA%3D&checksum=7db61055987c1e93da8055d5da1fa6006bffddabaa33ca45d960ea80db48a714&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAiGlf5kWR_bkxL4NUswUaYEFrTSSkvho1LfvuPiIolI90cGbjDI8lhaNk_qvK12p4&share_app_id=1233&share_item_id=6979467575193390341&share_link_id=C2ACB478-27F1-4A19-BAD4-23D967EEF404&source=h5_m×tamp=1625287789&tt_from=copy&u_code=dbgcc799lddb6h&user_id=6809297842311037958&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy&_r=1&is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6893174052191438341

Although she admittedly thought the pictures of the listing looked “sparse” Ruber was reassured by the five-star rating and reviews. Her previous experiences with Airbnb were fine she shared in a comment so she trusted the listing. She also stated that there weren’t many affordable options in the area she was visiting near Edinboro Pennsylvania.

Once she arrived she was shocked at what she found.

“Someone save me from this nightmare” she said.

The living area appeared completely filled and overrun with random items boxes and extra furniture and the air conditioning and shower were both broken according to Ruber. She was scheduled to stay for ten weeks.

It’s unclear if the house can be labeled as a hoarding situation but there seemed to be signs that could match the description.

Hoarding is a disorder that causes persistent difficulty in discarding or parting with possessions regardless of their actual value according to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America. The behavior usually has deleterious effects—emotional physical social financial and even legal—for both the hoarder and their family members.

Viewers thought it was definitely hoarding.

“On today’s episode of hoarders” one user commented referencing the reality TV show Hoarders that documents what having the disorder is like.

In addition to the possible hoarding Ruber said she works night shifts as a nurse and the owner of the location kept latching the screen door at night. She’s had to call them to let her in because they didn’t give her a key.

TikTok viewers said 10 weeks was far too long to stay in such a place.

“I watched a weird movie once about a couple that buried their guests in the walls and honestly this has similar vibes. Time to go!” one user commented.

Others were eager to hear what Airbnb had to say for themselves.

One person said “What did Airbnb say? You can’t blast them if you’ve not let them know & ask for a different host!”

In a video response to the comment Ruber admitted that she wasn’t even going to ask for a refund or change.

“I was just going to suck it up and live with it” she said.

Once her original TikTok about the experience gained so much attention she realized she needed to stand up for herself.

In a follow up TikTok Ruber revealed that she “escaped from the hoarder’s house” and apparently moved to a hotel complete with a working shower.

She captioned the video “I can’t thank you guys enough for pushing me to stand up for myself.”

Viewers were happy to see her in a new place but wanted to know what happened with the Airbnb and its owner.

Ruber said she “hightailed it out of there” and fortunately didn’t have to explain herself to the owner.

As for the company Airbnb itself Ruber said in follow-up videos that she still has not received a refund or even much communication despite her numerous attempts to communicate with the company.

Neither Airbnb nor Ruber immediately responded to the Daily Dot’s request for comment.

Or follow us on Google News

I reported yesterday on Tesla’s record quarterly production and deliveries (aka sales). It’s another stunning feat. Tesla’s the first company in the world to sell more than 200000 electric vehicles in a quarter.

But one unfortunate thing about Tesla’s official stats is that it groups the Model 3 and Model Y and also groups the Model S and Model X. So we can’t very easily track sales and identify trends on a model-specific basis.

That said “Troy Teslike” does this as obsessively as anyone I know and I’m going to use his numbers just slightly modified to match the official totals in order to create some charts that break out Tesla’s official figures for the 3 + Y more finely. (Troy also doesn’t break out the S and X at this point.) As a quick note of reference at the beginning of the 2nd quarter Troy predicted 195000 Q2 deliveries for Tesla and I predicted 210000. With the total coming to 201250 (206421 produced) Troy’s estimate was slightly closer than mine (3500 units closer to be exact). Our forecasts might diverge a bit more this quarter but I’ll get to that later in another article.

The general story is clear — Tesla Model 3 and Model Y sales are through the roof while Model S and Model X sales dropped to nearly zero as the company has launched revamped versions of the vehicles and struggled to get mass production rolling. That said the 3 and the Y are clearly the mass-market products. Combined they are approaching a production rate of a million vehicles a year which is quite stunning.

We assume that the Model Y is getting closer to the Model 3 in terms of production and deliveries and that a crossover is coming in time — maybe later this year. However as noted above there is not much official insight from Tesla on the exact split. Perhaps we’ll get some clues in Tesla’s next shareholder letter.

In the meantime what do you think is in store for these four models?

Below you can also see interactive versions of the charts above but note that they may not display well on a mobile device.

Or follow us on Google News

A few weeks ago NIO put out a news release that its ES8 “smart electric SUV” had received European Whole Vehicle Type Approval (EWVTA) meaning that it can sell the ES8 in Europe. In particular the ES8 is starting its European exploration in Norway.

That’s interesting news especially to those of us who have been wondering for years when successful Chinese EV producers would start selling their electric vehicles in Europe and/or the United States and Canada. But the big question is: how will NIO do in Europe? How will it do in Norway the big test market where almost everyone buys EVs now?

Also the ES8 is the vehicle NIO is testing the waters with but the ES6 and EC6 are more mass-market vehicles that I’m more curious about. How will they do in Europe presuming that they get sold there as well?

Unfortunately I don’t have answers and that’s why I have this posed as a question in the title. I’m curious what you all think.

Some things to consider are how NIO will be pushing these vehicles out. It is fond of its own stores and entire lifestyle ecosystems. That has been a central part of its sales process in China. Will this work in Europe? Or are buyers going to be hesitant to jump into bed with a new automaker and a Chinese one no less? There are a lot of established auto brands in Europe that are already selling a high number of electric vehicles and then there’s Tesla for those who want to venture into exotic markets. Is there an opening for Chinese “smart EV” companies too companies that have similar infotainment systems but are not Tesla?

The NIO ES8 will start being handed over to customers in Norway in September. The European Whole Vehicle Type Approval though permits NIO to sell the vehicle across Europe. Are there any markets that are especially well suited for NIO’s cleantech ecosystem which entails NIO House NIO App for European users Power Swap Stations and NIO Life?

Note that much more information on the ES8 can be found here or on NIO’s website. We do not yet know the price of the NIO ES8 in Norway but the ES8 starts at about $65000 in China (and the smaller NIO EC6 and NIO ES6 start at about $55000 in China).

Country superstar Tim McGraw has had the opportunity to share the stage with many iconic artists throughout the years but nothing was more special than the moment he got to step on stage with country supergroup Alabama in Nashville on Saturday evening (July 3).

McGraw attended the second show of Alabama’s two-night run in Music City which marked the group’s first arena performance in Nashville in nearly two decades. Surprisingly this was his first time seeing the legendary country group live even though he’s been a longtime fan.

“It’s been 482 days since they’ve had a show at Bridgestone Arena and it’s Alabama” McGraw shares in a clip on social media. “And I’m here… I’ve never seen Alabama live. I know every song off of every album I could probably do the whole show.”

With a huge smile on his face McGraw continues and says “I’m getting to go on stage with them tonight this is the first time I’ve ever seen them in concert and I get to go on stage.”

The clip goes on to show video from his time on stage with Alabama as they sing the 1983 hit “Lady Down On Love” together.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tim McGraw (@thetimmcgraw)

“Alabama has been one of my favorite bands for as long as I remember…. Finally got to see them for the first time last night on their 50th Anniversary Tour” McGraw captioned the video. “Thanx for letting me sing “Lady Down on Love” with you boys!! I remember this song going #1 when I was in high school….full circle moment I’ll never forget.”

Alabama’s 50th Anniversary Tour consists of nearly 30 arena and amphitheater dates running throughout 2021 and into early 2022. Special guests on the tour include Martina McBride Tracy Lawrence The Beach Boys Jake Hoot and more.

“We are very thankful that we can play our music for our loyal fans of the past 50 years and introduce our songs to a new 3rd and 4th generation of new fans” says lead singer Randy Owen. “We have rehearsed an all-new show that we are having fun performing but you never know we might even take requests from time to time. There’s nothing like the roar of the crowd and we can’t wait to get back on the road.”

“This tour that we are blessed to have has the most amazing group of musicians and vocalists that we have ever had on the road” adds bass player and vocalist Teddy Gentry. “In addition we wanted to bring along some special friends to join us on tour each night. From The Marshall Tucker Band to Travis Tritt and Martina McBride to The Beach Boys what a party we are going to have. I can’t tell you how ready we are to see and play for you.”

We all watched the Buckeyes go 12-1 that season and defeated Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl. The record books tell a different story though as Ohio State is shown as going 0-1 during the 2010 with the only game counted being a loss to Wisconsin.

I totally understand that at the time what Ohio State’s players and head coach Jim Tressel did was against NCAA rules. Terrelle Pryor Dan Herron DeVier Posey and others were found to have signed autographs in exchange for tattoos as well as selling memorabilia that was given to them by the university. Tressel was aware of these violations and failed to report them to the NCAA. Tressel eventually ended up resigning as head coach.

After a little more than a decade it has become even more evident just how much of a joke the punishments were. Now players can become a “Barstool Athlete” or shill for College Hunks Hauling Junk but trading your ink on a picture for some ink on your body a decade ago is still apparently a no-no. Want to sell those Gold Pants that you earned on the field? Better think twice about that.

I know the biggest problem with the whole “scandal” was Jim Tressel lying to Ohio State and the NCAA about what he knew. Let’s not pretend that college coaches haven’t claimed ignorance on worse matters since then. Bobby Petrino hired his mistress and gave her $20k and we probably only found out about it because he crashed his motorcycle when they were out riding. Petrino was fired from Arkansas but he somehow has coached at three schools since then.

Now if Joe Paterno can get 111 wins restored there’s no reason why Ohio State can’t have 12 wins from 2010 given back to them. Paterno knowingly employed Jerry Sandusky who sexual abused children and did nothing to stop Sandusky even when presented with concerns from many others over the years. Instead I guess because Paterno was a senile old man he gets the benefit of the doubt.

Aside from the Michigan game and the Sugar Bowl it’s not even really about the wins being restored. What I just don’t want to see is Tressel Pryor and others vilified for their actions. While it was all technically illegal in the eyes of the NCAA then now it’s fine for players to profit off their name image and likeness. Really the Buckeyes were just ahead of the curve.

What has been the toughest thing that came out of “Tatgate” has been that Terrelle Pryor really hasn’t gotten the recognition that he deserves from the university. All Pryor did in his three years in Columbus was lead the Buckeyes to three BCS bowls winning two of them. Prior to Justin Fields there could be an argument for Pryor being the best quarterback in school history. It’d be interesting to see how things would have played out if Pryor hadn’t been suspended heading into the 2011 season and decided to enter the NFL’s Supplemental Draft instead.

One of the biggest “What ifs?” in college football could be what would have happened had there been NIL regulations in place a decade ago. Ohio State lost six games in 2011 by seven points or less. The Buckeyes were a shell of what they could have been as they started Joe Bauserman to open the season before eventually handing the starting quarterback job over to Braxton Miller. Had Pryor and Tressel been back in 2011 there’s a real possibility that the Buckeyes would have challenged for a national title. Ohio State might also hold a 16-game winning streak over Michigan right now.

It’s not that the Buckeyes were severely setback by the “scandal” since they went on to hire Urban Meyer and win a national title. In fact “Tatgate” might be one of the best things to happen to Ohio State as strange as it sounds since who knows how long Tressel stays at Ohio State how recruiting shakes out and who takes over after “The Sweatervest” decides to retire. It just shouldn’t be a mark on the legacy of Tressel Pryor and all those that were involved anymore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nanNlbnRpbmVsL25hbWUvZ2VyYWxkLWNhbGxpc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzMzQ5Nzg50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerald Callison Obituary (1934 - 2021) - Grand Junction CO - The Daily Sentinel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/gjsentinel/name/gerald-callison-obituary?id=33349789 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nanNlbnRpbmVsL25hbWUvZ2VyYWxkLWNhbGxpc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzMzQ5Nzg50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc3RjZW50cmFsb25saW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zaGFyaW5nLXdlc3QtY2VudHJhbC1jb25uZWN0aW9ucy1hcy1jYW5hcnktc2VlZC1iZWNvbWVzLW9mZmljaWFsLWdyYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sharing West Central Connections as Canary Seed Becomes Official Grain,"Back in early June it was confirmed that Canary seed will soon be designated as an official grain under the Canada Grain Act. This recent ruling comes following many calls for change and consultations among stakeholders across the country. Chief Commissioner of the Canadian Grain Commission Doug Chorney spoke on the decision that will come into effect this upcoming August 1st.

“After successive licensee failures where canary seed growers were left empty handed it was clear we needed to extend regulatory safeguards to the sector. We’re very pleased to be able to offer canary seed growers the rights and services provided by the Canada Grain Act and help ensure they are fairly compensated for their deliveries.”

Canary producers will soon benefit from the same rights services and protections on their canary seed crop as they do on other regulated grains and it is something that hits close to home for a man with ties to the west central area in Elbow resident Bob Nunweiler.

“My father brought Canary seed to Canada and with 2 partners from Eston and Kindersley and contracted the sale of it with area farmers. I started farming myself in 1975 with my brother Ed and father Reinhold” shared Nunweiler in an email “We planted about 2500 acres of Canary Seed that year and the rest is history.”

Nunweiler shared his family’s story with West Central Online shortly after the official news that the largest volume grain not protected under the Canada Grain Act would soon become a regulated seed in the country. What he also shared was a news piece by B.C Business Magazine on the Allstate Grain Company founded back in 1969 detailing the companies upstart between three men in Ron Butterly Bill Stevenson and the sources connection in Reinhold Nunweiler.

grade at harvest Canary producers will now benefit from payment protection with the soon to be introduced ruling. A grade determinant table along with a moisture chart will be added to the Grain Commission website in July as the work has been done to officially bring Canary seed under the Canadian Grain Act starting in August.",,,

Check out pics here | Mint,"Silicon Valley should be one of the first places to spring back to life as the pandemic eases in the U.S. Nearly three-quarters of eligible people have been vaccinated and more than 80% have gotten at least one shot—a milestone San Francisco reached faster than any other city according to the mayor.

And yet many tech industry offices are sitting nearly empty. Only 19% of office workers in the San Francisco metro area had returned as of June 23 the lowest share of 10 major U.S. metro areas tracked by building security provider Kastle Systems. The region's tech giants among the first to send their office workers home when coronavirus pandemic deepened last year may be among the last to coax them back.

In New York Wall Street banks are urging workers to get back to the office—and in some cases requiring it. Tech companies’ efforts have been more halting. Uber Technologies Inc. said that staff can plan on working from the office just 50% of the time starting in September backtracking from its earlier minimum of three days a week. Alphabet Inc.’s Google relaxed its rules to allow some staffers to work permanently from their homes. Meanwhile Coinbase Inc. said it plans to shutter its San Francisco headquarters declaring itself “remote first.""

While traffic is reappearing intermittently on the region's highways and bridges and weekend reservations at hot restaurants are tough to come by Silicon Valley’s reopening is moving slowly. People are itching to return to a life beyond their computer screens but not necessarily to return to their desks. Many executives are out of town or are spending significant stretches of time in to Los Angeles. Contacted for this story they had a common request: Could we do this interview over Zoom? A few others though have started the return to tech’s one-time hotspots.

The Ferry Building

Siri Srinivas a principal at the venture capital firm Draper Associates sipped a glass of rosé on the patio of the Ferry Building on a weekday afternoon in May. Last year during the peak of the pandemic the iconic marketplace and nexus of commuters and technology professionals was often near-vacant. That day though it was again buzzing with visitors. Some were clearly tourists. Others could pass as locals reacquainting themselves with the city they withdrew from over the last year.

The outing was among the baby steps Srinivas has been taking to return to a more normal life. In the Before Times her day involved back-to-back breakfasts and coffees with founders happy hours and dinners with other investors and techies. When she moved to a new San Francisco apartment during the pandemic she decorated partly based on how things would look over Zoom the virtual world in which she spent most of her time.

But the video calls officially started to wear her out in March when the pandemic turned a year old. “I would have to lie down on the floor because I was so mentally exhausted"" she said.

For Srinivas now there’s no going back to exactly the way things were even with San Francisco reopening. She’s spending part of the summer in New York and will soon visit Europe where her sister lives. As the Bay Area staggers out of quarantine New York City has been open for weeks. She expects that post-vaccine life in Manhattan will be “extra exciting.""

SoMa

Standing in a plaza in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood famous for its cluster of startup headquarters Jack Mardack wondered aloud about how much things had changed. Before the pandemic this small courtyard would be bustling full of silver tables and chairs occupied by employees from companies like Social Finance Inc. LinkedIn and DoorDash Inc.—all based about a block away. But that afternoon it was empty. The tables and chairs were stacked up in a corner.

Mardack is the co-founder of the human resources startup Oyster HR which he and his co-founder launched in April 2020 just as the pandemic was gripping the U.S. Now in search of coffee and a place to sit he and this reporter walked north passing three coffee shops along the way that had been temporarily boarded up after their office-dwelling clientele fled during the pandemic.

Mardack spent most his time in lockdown working on his startup out of his nearby one-bedroom apartment. Finally seated with a Pacifico at the Financial District’s Uno Dos Tacos restaurant Mardack explains that the last time he saw his co-founder in person was in late 2019.

Oyster which provides an HR platform for remote teams launched with a fully remote workforce from the beginning. “The pandemic made things easier for us"" he said because not going into an office “was everyone’s normal."" In a funding round in June Oyster sextupled its valuation from a few months earlier to $475 million.

Gradually Mardack said he’s reintroducing some face-to-face interaction into life at the company. In May he had lunch al fresco with a handful of his colleagues some of whom he had never met. And he’s planning a companywide trip as Oyster approaches 100 employees. The startup is setting aside money for group outings and experiences Mardack said. But he’ll still be working from home for the long haul.

South Park

The center of San Francisco’s venture capital universe is an oval-shaped park with a quiet playground at the center. Firms with offices that abut its close-cut lawn include Kleiner Perkins Index Ventures and Accel.

On a Tuesday afternoon in late June Patreon Inc. co-founder Sam Yam sat nearby at a table outside Blue Bottle Coffee sipping from a bottle of watermelon-infused Hint water.

Yam had brought his fruit-infused water from Patreon’s office about a mile south. It’s part of an effort to lure employees back to the office. Patreon a platform for fans to fund podcasters and other creators recently plowed a few million dollars into its physical space creating more meeting places and of course upping its snack game. Yam said he snacked through lunch that day sampling some of the new offerings: beef jerky dried pineapple and puffed bean crisps.

But despite the efforts of Yam and other nearby companies the park that’s normally buzzing with meetings between venture capitalists and techies is quiet. That afternoon Blue Bottle had only a few customers and almost no line. South Park’s benches were mostly vacant.

Patreon’s office is open at 25% capacity Yam said and fewer people than that are showing up. The office is “pretty quiet"" Yam allowed “but it’s also delightful hanging out with people."" The entrepreneur said he’s craving in-person encounters and hopes that employees will soon start to fill back into the office at least a few days a week.

Right now the majority of Yam’s meetings are over video or phone calls. But he says little by little people have started to suggest meeting up for coffee in person.

Palo Alto

A few miles south of San Francisco the headquarters of companies like Facebook Inc. Google and Apple Inc. sit within a short drive from Stanford University’s palm tree-lined campus by Palo Alto. Wendy Gonzalez chief executive officer of digital training platform Sama lives nearby. Every day she used to make the long drive to San Francisco to Sama’s headquarters in the Mission neighborhood.

Now Gonzalez walks just a few yards to be at her desk by 6 a.m. a leafy green plant and a small painting behind her. Based on her Zoom background you’d never know she’s working out of the Airstream RV she purchased for family trips during the pandemic that’s parked in her driveway.

Over coffee at Palo Alto’s popular tech meeting spot Coupa Cafe Gonzalez said she cherishes the roughly three hours a day she saves by not driving into the city. Still she expects to return to the office about once a week by the end of the summer. As for her team she is leaving it up to them to decide whether to work from home indefinitely. The office will also be changed: When the Sama staff goes back nobody will have assigned desks anymore and everyone will be given a locker to store items they want to use while they’re there.

At the moment Sama is raising money. Gonzalez has done a few outdoor walks and coffee meetings with investors but she estimates that fewer than one in 10 of those conversations have been in person.

The Rosewood

When visiting tech dignitaries make their pilgrimage to the Bay Area they often stay at the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel. Its sprawling lawn and generous lounges are typically teeming with tech personas who flock there to be close to the world’s preeminent venture capital firms which are clustered along the olive- and oak-lined highway outside.

Maha Ibrahim a general partner at the VC firm Canaan returned to the Rosewood last summer during the pandemic after a long hiatus. She recalled taking a walk around the hotel grounds only to find the typically manicured gardens and hedges overgrown an ominous sign of the times. “It was dead"" she said.

In June a few Rosewood diners ate under yellow umbrellas on the patio of its restaurant. But its library a living room-like area with couches and large windows was empty. In the olden days Ibrahim said the place would have been packed on a Thursday afternoon.

The Rosewood was a regular haunt for Ibrahim before Covid. At the time she mostly spent her workdays doing in-person meetings or traveling between them in cars or on planes. Then in lockdown virtual meetings only quickened her pace: Ibrahim was sometimes so back-to-back booked that it was difficult to find time to use the bathroom she said let alone to take a shower.

Now that much of the Bay Area has eased Covid-era restrictions Ibrahim is adding a few in-person dinners and lunches to her calendar. But she’s not in a rush to go back to the way things were.

“It’s going to be this crawl walk run"" back to normalcy Ibrahim said. “On the social side I’m definitely on walk. Workwise? Crawl.""

The region's tech giants among the first to send their office workers home when coronavirus pandemic deepened last year may be among the last to coax them back.

In New York Wall Street banks are urging workers to get back to the office—and in some cases requiring it. Tech companies’ efforts have been more halting. Uber Technologies Inc. said that staff can plan on working from the office just 50% of the time starting in September backtracking from its earlier minimum of three days a week. Alphabet Inc.’s Google relaxed its rules to allow some staffers to work permanently from their homes. Meanwhile Coinbase Inc. said it plans to shutter its San Francisco headquarters declaring itself “remote first.""

While traffic is reappearing intermittently on the region's highways and bridges and weekend reservations at hot restaurants are tough to come by Silicon Valley’s reopening is moving slowly. People are itching to return to a life beyond their computer screens but not necessarily to return to their desks. Many executives are out of town or are spending significant stretches of time in to Los Angeles. Contacted for this story they had a common request: Could we do this interview over Zoom? A few others though have started the return to tech’s one-time hotspots.

The Ferry Building

Siri Srinivas a principal at the venture capital firm Draper Associates sipped a glass of rosé on the patio of the Ferry Building on a weekday afternoon in May. Last year during the peak of the pandemic the iconic marketplace and nexus of commuters and technology professionals was often near-vacant. That day though it was again buzzing with visitors. Some were clearly tourists. Others could pass as locals reacquainting themselves with the city they withdrew from over the last year.

The outing was among the baby steps Srinivas has been taking to return to a more normal life. In the Before Times her day involved back-to-back breakfasts and coffees with founders happy hours and dinners with other investors and techies. When she moved to a new San Francisco apartment during the pandemic she decorated partly based on how things would look over Zoom the virtual world in which she spent most of her time.

But the video calls officially started to wear her out in March when the pandemic turned a year old. “I would have to lie down on the floor because I was so mentally exhausted"" she said.

For Srinivas now there’s no going back to exactly the way things were even with San Francisco reopening. She’s spending part of the summer in New York and will soon visit Europe where her sister lives. As the Bay Area staggers out of quarantine New York City has been open for weeks. She expects that post-vaccine life in Manhattan will be “extra exciting.""

SoMa

Standing in a plaza in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood famous for its cluster of startup headquarters Jack Mardack wondered aloud about how much things had changed. Before the pandemic this small courtyard would be bustling full of silver tables and chairs occupied by employees from companies like Social Finance Inc. LinkedIn and DoorDash Inc.—all based about a block away. But that afternoon it was empty. The tables and chairs were stacked up in a corner.

Mardack is the co-founder of the human resources startup Oyster HR which he and his co-founder launched in April 2020 just as the pandemic was gripping the U.S. Now in search of coffee and a place to sit he and this reporter walked north passing three coffee shops along the way that had been temporarily boarded up after their office-dwelling clientele fled during the pandemic.

Mardack spent most his time in lockdown working on his startup out of his nearby one-bedroom apartment. Finally seated with a Pacifico at the Financial District’s Uno Dos Tacos restaurant Mardack explains that the last time he saw his co-founder in person was in late 2019.

Oyster which provides an HR platform for remote teams launched with a fully remote workforce from the beginning. “The pandemic made things easier for us"" he said because not going into an office “was everyone’s normal."" In a funding round in June Oyster sextupled its valuation from a few months earlier to $475 million.

Gradually Mardack said he’s reintroducing some face-to-face interaction into life at the company. In May he had lunch al fresco with a handful of his colleagues some of whom he had never met. And he’s planning a companywide trip as Oyster approaches 100 employees. The startup is setting aside money for group outings and experiences Mardack said. But he’ll still be working from home for the long haul.

South Park

The center of San Francisco’s venture capital universe is an oval-shaped park with a quiet playground at the center. Firms with offices that abut its close-cut lawn include Kleiner Perkins Index Ventures and Accel.

On a Tuesday afternoon in late June Patreon Inc. co-founder Sam Yam sat nearby at a table outside Blue Bottle Coffee sipping from a bottle of watermelon-infused Hint water.

Yam had brought his fruit-infused water from Patreon’s office about a mile south. It’s part of an effort to lure employees back to the office. Patreon a platform for fans to fund podcasters and other creators recently plowed a few million dollars into its physical space creating more meeting places and of course upping its snack game. Yam said he snacked through lunch that day sampling some of the new offerings: beef jerky dried pineapple and puffed bean crisps.

But despite the efforts of Yam and other nearby companies the park that’s normally buzzing with meetings between venture capitalists and techies is quiet. That afternoon Blue Bottle had only a few customers and almost no line. South Park’s benches were mostly vacant.

Patreon’s office is open at 25% capacity Yam said and fewer people than that are showing up. The office is “pretty quiet"" Yam allowed “but it’s also delightful hanging out with people."" The entrepreneur said he’s craving in-person encounters and hopes that employees will soon start to fill back into the office at least a few days a week.

Right now the majority of Yam’s meetings are over video or phone calls. But he says little by little people have started to suggest meeting up for coffee in person.

Palo Alto

A few miles south of San Francisco the headquarters of companies like Facebook Inc. Google and Apple Inc. sit within a short drive from Stanford University’s palm tree-lined campus by Palo Alto. Wendy Gonzalez chief executive officer of digital training platform Sama lives nearby. Every day she used to make the long drive to San Francisco to Sama’s headquarters in the Mission neighborhood.

Now Gonzalez walks just a few yards to be at her desk by 6 a.m. a leafy green plant and a small painting behind her. Based on her Zoom background you’d never know she’s working out of the Airstream RV she purchased for family trips during the pandemic that’s parked in her driveway.

Over coffee at Palo Alto’s popular tech meeting spot Coupa Cafe Gonzalez said she cherishes the roughly three hours a day she saves by not driving into the city. Still she expects to return to the office about once a week by the end of the summer. As for her team she is leaving it up to them to decide whether to work from home indefinitely. The office will also be changed: When the Sama staff goes back nobody will have assigned desks anymore and everyone will be given a locker to store items they want to use while they’re there.

At the moment Sama is raising money. Gonzalez has done a few outdoor walks and coffee meetings with investors but she estimates that fewer than one in 10 of those conversations have been in person.

The Rosewood

When visiting tech dignitaries make their pilgrimage to the Bay Area they often stay at the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel. Its sprawling lawn and generous lounges are typically teeming with tech personas who flock there to be close to the world’s preeminent venture capital firms which are clustered along the olive- and oak-lined highway outside.

Maha Ibrahim a general partner at the VC firm Canaan returned to the Rosewood last summer during the pandemic after a long hiatus. She recalled taking a walk around the hotel grounds only to find the typically manicured gardens and hedges overgrown an ominous sign of the times. “It was dead"" she said.

In June a few Rosewood diners ate under yellow umbrellas on the patio of its restaurant. But its library a living room-like area with couches and large windows was empty. In the olden days Ibrahim said the place would have been packed on a Thursday afternoon.

The Rosewood was a regular haunt for Ibrahim before Covid. At the time she mostly spent her workdays doing in-person meetings or traveling between them in cars or on planes. Then in lockdown virtual meetings only quickened her pace: Ibrahim was sometimes so back-to-back booked that it was difficult to find time to use the bathroom she said let alone to take a shower.

Now that much of the Bay Area has eased Covid-era restrictions Ibrahim is adding a few in-person dinners and lunches to her calendar. But she’s not in a rush to go back to the way things were.

“It’s going to be this crawl walk run"" back to normalcy Ibrahim said. “On the social side I’m definitely on walk. Workwise? Crawl.""

Last summer amid a hiring spree at Amazon so gigantic it left historians struggling for comparisons Karen Weise a Times reporter who covers the company from Seattle brought up a puzzling question to her editors. Approaching the million-worker mark Amazon was on track to becoming the largest private employer in the United States. Yet in spite of solid wages and generous benefits it was quickly cycling through employees. Why?

Executives had an “almost palpable fear of running out of workers” she said later.

In August she got a call from Jodi Kantor a Times reporter in Brooklyn who was talking to workers from a variety of industries who were struggling with strict rules about time and attendance during the pandemic. She wanted to look more closely at “time off task” or T.O.T. Amazon’s practice of monitoring workers by the second and disciplining them for too many unexcused pauses.

One hot day in a New York City park Ms. Kantor met with Dayana Santos an employee who had been repeatedly praised by her bosses but fired for too much T.O.T. during one bad day filled with mishaps she said were beyond her control. Ms. Santos’s story raised fairness questions and a business one: Why would Amazon voracious for workers fire a good employee?

Those questions led to a recent Times investigative report on the company that revealed systemic problems in its model for managing workers such as unbridled turnover minimal human contact an error-plagued leave system delayed benefits and mistaken firings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTU3NzA0NDc50gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNTc3MDQ0NzkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Bezos steps down as Amazon boss,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLXRocm93cy1hd2F5LW5ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy13YXN0ZS10aGlyZC1wYXJ0eS1zZWxsZXJzLXByb2ZpdGFibGUtMjAyMS020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Amazon Throws Away Thousands of New Products Every Week: Explainer,"A worker packs a customer order at the Amazon fulfillment center in Romeoville Illinois.

A recent report said one Amazon warehouse in the UK marks 130000 items for ""destroy"" every week.

A former worker from that warehouse said half those items were still in their shrink-wrap.

A retail analyst told Insider why it's more profitable for Amazon to junk them than sell them.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A recent report on a UK Amazon warehouse throwing away thousands of products every week has exposed the company's disposal practices to intense scrutiny.

ITV News reported that one warehouse in Dunfermline Scotland marks 130000 items per week for ""destroy."" The article echoed a 2019 French report which said Amazon threw away 3 million items over nine months in France.

One former Amazon employee told ITV that roughly half of the products marked for ""destroy"" are brand new and still in shrink-wrap. The rest are mostly returns and in good condition.

So why does Amazon throw away new products it could still sell?

Patrick O'Brien a retail analyst at analytics firm Global Data said it's because Amazon specialises in selling products for third-party sellers.

A huge chunk of its retail business comes from its Amazon Marketplace platform. In February analysts at Marketplace Pulse estimated that third-party products made up $300 billion out of $490 billion of total sales on its site in 2020.

""More of Amazon's business is becoming the sale of third-party stock"" O'Brien told Insider. ""While Amazon charges commission on sales it also charges for a range of services."" This includes a cost per unit to store items in warehouses return them to sellers or dispose of unsold items he said.

This means if a product isn't selling on Amazon the cheapest option is to pay Amazon to get rid of it.

O'Brien said: ""The problem for many sellers on Amazon is that if their goods don't sell they are faced with the possibility of having to continue to pay rent for them or to make a one-off payment for their return or their disposal.""

Retailers wouldn't usually have items returned to them unless they planned to dispose of them O'Brien explained. ""In which case it makes more sense to pay Amazon to dispose of them than to pay to have them returned and still have to dispose of them themselves"" he added.

An Amazon spokesman told Insider that ""domestic returns costs for all products for sellers are lower than disposal fees"" but there isn't a big difference between those costs. In the UK it's only 4 cents more expensive to pay Amazon to dispose of a product under 200 grams (seven ounces) than to return it.

Once any additional disposal costs are factored in getting Amazon to dispose of it might still work out cheaper.







ITV's report garnered negative press for Amazon including from activist Greta Thunberg.

""Amazon is getting some very negative publicity but it should be remembered that it is responding to the failure of retailers to sell their goods on their platform O'Brien said ""and it is these third-party retailers who are making the decision to have items disposed of.""

In a statement to Insider at the time Amazon did not dispute ITV's numbers but said the Dunfermline warehouse handles disposal of products for the entire UK. An Amazon spokesperson said no items are sent to UK landfill but are recycled and donated – with donation being its preference.

Dr Teresa Domenech Aparisi a sustainability expert at University College London told Insider that products sent to recycling plants could still end up being incinerated. ""Not sending anything to landfill doesn't mean that those products are being recycled"" she said.

Joao Diogo sought a safe place for his family after violence ended his father’s life in Brazil. Patricia Guerra a new college graduate came for career opportunities when the economy of her native Venezuela had none to offer.

Starting a new life in a new country is hard. But Diogo and Guerra each found careers—and life opportunities—at Amazon’s Air Hub in Lakeland Florida.

“I had butterflies in my stomach and was very anxious about the move” said Diogo. “I had to put my kids and my family first even though I was nervous. Now I know I was right to come to the U.S.”

In celebration of Independence Day we’re sharing Diogo’s and Guerra’s stories of coming to America and finding a home at Amazon Air.

Joao Diogo finds a safe haven and an exciting career

Brazilian Immigrant Finds Safe Haven at Amazon

Violence in his native Brazil drove Joao Diogo to move his family to the U.S. His father had been murdered at age 47.

“We had some problems in Brazil in terms of public violence and it was getting worse” Diogo said. “My dad was a victim of murder while working in his shop. After this I decided to move to the U.S. with my wife and my three kids.”

Despite his 22 years of experience working at South America’s largest airline Diogo struggled to find work in his new country.

“The beginning was so hard” he said. “I applied for many aviation jobs—probably more than a hundred—and nobody called me for an interview. I did some jobs in construction before I applied for Amazon and got the job as an aviation security specialist.”

Less than three years after arriving in the U.S. Diogo is finding success in his new career at the Amazon Air hub in Lakeland Florida. He earned a promotion to aviation security manager less than a year into his work at the company and he continues to enjoy the new life he’s built for his family in the U.S.

“I’m so proud of my journey because now my family is safe and my kids are very happy” Diogo said. “I’ve believed in my dream since the very beginning. Believe in yourself believe in your potential and never give up.”

Patricia Guerra jumpstarts her career in the land of opportunity

Venezuelan Immigrant Finds Opportunity in U.S. at Amazon

When Patricia Guerra graduated from college five years ago the economy in her native Venezuela was in shambles. Her education was in environmental engineering and computer science yet her job search led to a dead end. She decided to expand her search outside of her home country and she found opportunity in the U.S.—and at Amazon.

“I kept applying to jobs online and eventually found Amazon” she said. “The company welcomed me with arms wide open.”

With a new opportunity Guerra traveled 1763 miles (roughly 2837 kilometers) to kick start her career in Florida. The travel was the easy part—starting a new job in a new country was the true challenge.

“It was a bit scary at first” said Guerra. “English was hard at the beginning because we are alone. But the longer I’ve lived here the more of the language I’ve learned.”

Guerra utilizes her educational background in her job as waste coordinator at the Amazon Air hub in Lakeland Florida. She has earned three promotions since joining Amazon and recently purchased a new home. She is thriving in a fulfilling career—and happy she moved to the U.S.

“I'm very thankful that it allowed me to get a higher position” Guerra said.

We hope you enjoy the holiday with your loved ones celebrating the diversity and freedoms of Americans from coast to coast. Happy Fourth!"

The most recent trips were simple and domestic which eliminated any logical suspicion around the airline needing to confirm covid-19 testing or visa restrictions before allowing me to check in.

Based on a few extra factors it’s lead me to believe that I might be flagged for hidden city ticketing a term more commonly known these days as skiplagging. The short catch up is that it’s a risky but often rewarding game where people try to save money on a flight sometimes even getting a better cabin for less than coach.

How could American possibly flag me? Probably because I’ve done it. I don’t mind admitting it in large part because American has no miles they can take away from me and it’s been years. It’s hardly been in a widly abusive way and I didn’t create the rules for airline pricing or the prices. I just buy tickets which serve my needs.

There’s no one at my coffee shop saying “you must finish every one of those croissants or we’re going to charge you more” so why American thinks they can make people fly every segment they buy is a topic of discussion.

Flagged For Hidden City Ticketing?

I recently had a simple flight from a New York airport to the Miami area. I wasn’t able to check in online yet again which I found odd. The last few times I wasn’t able to I was traveling with my wife and infant so I thought it could be something to do with the our little one. Flying solo before then I just assumed erroneous issues.

But this time it was just me a frequent flyer hoping to get my mobile boarding pass ahead of time so I could zip through the airport and directly to the TSA PreCheck line without speaking to a soul. I love contactless flying.

Instead as a Oneworld Emerald member with another airline I went through Flagship checkin where I presented my ID and made the usual small talk. I said I was surprised I wasn’t able to check in online and it seemed to be happening more frequently. It was just a statement perhaps angling for insight.

This is when I saw the nice check in person look at their colleague with a furrowed brow point to the screen and say “oh that’s why”. I sensed a change in warmth but didn’t prod further. American has been known to curb online check-in for suspected skiplaggers since it gives agents an opportunity to look for anything “suspicious”.

The trip was a simple point to point without any intrigue or connections so I received no further questioning and the team couldn’t have been any nicer. A boarding pass was issued and I was on my way. I found it odd and within minutes my brain recalled “why”.

I mentally jogged back to being directly accused of skiplagging by an American Airlines lounge agent back in 2019. At the time I wasn’t even!

My Skiplagging Backstory

Again I didn’t create airline pricing matrixes leisure fares or any of the things which dictate a price. I just book tickets utilizing the savvy I’ve picked up over the decades. An airline sets the price we pay not us sadly. Sometimes their complex pricing systems work in their favor and other times they can be seen as a liability.

I was once a frequent flyer between New York and Los Angeles and American for what I’m sure was a decent reason used to price business class between Los Angeles and Puerto Rico — via New York — much cheaper than Los Angeles to New York alone.

I’d buy the one way business class tickets from LA to Puerto Rico and hop off in New York after enjoying a flat bed across the continent at prices similar to coach. Since I’ve never used American Airlines AAdvantage as my primary loyalty program it never raised any flags. Ultimately I was a customer – just not a wildly profitable one.

Business travel eliminated most of my gamesmanship and I took flights as booked for many years thereafter often on incredibly expensive tickets paid for by clients. Read as: American profited greatly from me over the years just maybe not as much as they could have.

But during a unique promotional trip in the USA I had some very complex itineraries which seem to play a part even today. An American plane filling with smoke at the gate meant that I needed to change my multi-city trip plans on the fly and during rebooking an agent examining my ticket at the lounge outwardly accused me of skiplagging.

It was around the same time American apparently gave agents all the kool-aid to go after any people they even remotely suspected of circumventing their draconian ticket rules.

American Airlines Boeing 737

After the plane filled with smoke and was disembarked I had to cancel a promotional event in one city since I’d be delayed arriving until past midnight missing the event. I had to be in the next city for a stop by 1PM the next day and had an onward flight with American the next morning.

The AA agent refused to help and seemed to press some buttons perhaps sending flares to a few channels. They refused to help change my ticket and said to take it up with central customer service. I did and finally got in touch with someone able to help who was happy to accommodate but I (now) think the damage had been done.

After all those years I think I finally got flagged while flying on a legit ticket. I think the agent pressed the “I’ve got one(!)” button and it lives on with me to this day. The irony is not lost on me.

It’s the only logical way to explain a series of furrowed brows at check in and the complete inability to check in online for my AA flights. Oh well. I’ve got zero American Airlines miles I’ve got top tier elite status with other airlines and there are many other options.

If anything not being able to check in online will just cause American to lose more money from me since I’ll fly with a competitor to avoid the hassles of manual check in.

Hidden City Ticketing Risks

The only way American could ever prove that I engaged in skiplagging as a deliberate act would be the previous sentences in this piece. Anything – truly anything – from a change of heart to a dodgy stomach or rescheduled meeting is a valid excuse for not getting on a flight.

People inadvertently do things which may look like skiplagging constantly so it creates a very high bar for American or any airline to prove it as such. If you have miles elite status perks or upgrade certificates though getting flagged can put those at risk.

Naturally it’s only when American feels they have lost money that they care. If you buy a more expensive flight via another city than the one you end up in I really don’t think American blinks an eye. It’s certainly not flagged!

For example if I buy a ticket from Lexington Kentucky to London via JFK for $1000 and get sick and can’t continue I don’t think American will accuse me of hidden city ticketing. The Lexington flight to JFK would’ve probably been around $300. They’re thrilled that a seat opened on the London flight and they got $1000 for nothing.

If however I buy a Los Angeles to Puerto Rico ticket just to go to New York and it’s hundreds less than Los Angeles to New York it’s all against policy. Ok then.

Business travelers will often book a few dummy flights just to have locked in options for changing plans. A multi leg sales trip might end early no longer requiring the last few cities so they ditch the rest. A person may suffer from food poisoning en route and abandon the trip.

All these things happen. All are legit.

There are a variety of risks and rewards to skiplagging but these are largely mitigated when you aren’t easy to track. Being a frequent American Airlines flyer who skips a flight every time they fly with American is going to make someone an easy target. That was never me.

I guess that’s why I find it kinda funny that after all those years of actually doing it being an actual skiplagger a 100% legitimate trip is likely the one that got me flagged – I assume I am – and why I can’t check in online anymore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWp1bXBzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1leGl0LXBsYW5lLWNoYXJsb3R0ZS0yMDIxLTfSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qdW1wcy1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktZXhpdC1wbGFuZS1jaGFybG90dGUtMjAyMS03P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines passenger arrested after jumping out of plane amid delay,"The flight to Baltimore was cancelled due to severe weather.

An American Airlines passenger jumped from an emergency exit after a 30-minute delay.

People were told to remain onboard temporarily after the flight's cancellation but one man refused.

He reportedly crawled over passengers. A spokesperson told Insider he was immediately detained.

An American Airlines passenger was detained on Friday after leaping out of a plane's emergency exit while it was still at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

The flight to Baltimore was cancelled due to severe weather after 172 passengers and six crew members boarded the plane.

After the cancellation passengers were instructed to remain on board for at least 30 minutes according to Brandon Goldner a reporter at Charlotte's WCNC who was on the plane.

""So a passenger had enough and crawled over us in the exit row and let himself out. They got him by the jet bridge"" Goldner said in a tweet with a photo of the open emergency exit.

Instead of waiting for the jet bridge to be repositioned ""a passenger opened the over-wing emergency exit and jumped onto the ramp"" an American Airlines spokesperson told Insider on Saturday.

The airline said the passenger was ""immediately detained"" by American team members then placed into custody by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police.

The customer has since been placed on American's internal refuse list pending further investigation.

Currently premium transcon flights like New York JFK – Los Angeles and San Francisco continue to get hot meals along with some Miami – Los Angeles and New York JFK – Orange County flights. And non-premium cross country flights longer than Charlotte – Los Angeles get cold ‘Fresh Bites’ boxes instead of wrapped sandwiches.

I asked American Airlines whether in addition to flights of 900 miles or more there would be shorter ‘exception markets’ getting these meals. Some shorter routes have traditionally received received meals despite their distance like Chicago O’Hare – Washington National. That’s a competitive route hub-to-hub and a business heavy market in normal times.

American has just announced a sizable expansion in Miami this winter which includes new routes and increased capacity in existing markets.

Miami is becoming a more competitive market

Historically American faced little competition in Miami at least domestically though that’s something that has been changing in recent years and in particular during the pandemic:

It’s interesting to see the trend of airlines moving a bit further south from Fort Lauderdale to Miami since historically airlines only chose one airport or the other.

American’s new routes & frequencies out of Miami

American has this weekend put flights on sale that help the carrier grow its footprint in Miami. This includes two new international routes six new domestic routes and added frequencies in existing markets. When you add it all up American will operate up to 341 daily flights out of Miami this coming winter.

All of these new flights should already be bookable on aa.com. Let’s go over the details.

Two new international routes out of Miami

While they’re not long haul American is adding year-round flights from Miami to:

Chetumal Mexico (CTM) as of December 1 2021; the flight will operate 2x weekly with E175s

San Andres Island Colombia (ADZ) as of December 4 2021; the flight will operate 2x weekly with E175s

With these updates American will serve 28 destinations in Mexico and seven destinations in Colombia which is quite impressive. I find the San Andres Island addition in particular to be quite interesting — has anyone been?

Six new domestic routes out of Miami

American is adding domestic routes from Miami to:

Albany (ALB) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Burlington (BTV) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Madison (MSN) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Salt Lake City (SLC) between December 16 2021 and April 4 2022; the flight will operate daily with 737-800s

Syracuse (SYR) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Tulsa (TUL) year-round starting November 6 2021; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

I’d say the only truly significant addition here is the Salt Lake City flight (which is clearly targeted at Delta) since it’s a daily flight with a 737. The other flights are cool too but with a once-weekly service using a regional jet it’s hard to get too excited. The other routes definitely give me the vibe that American is trying to keep Breeze Airways away.

Increased frequencies on existing routes out of Miami

As of November 2 2021 American will be increasing frequencies from Miami to the following destinations:

Baltimore (BWI) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Cleveland (CLE) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Detroit (DTW) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Guatemala City (GUA) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Jacksonville (JAX) is increasing from 5x daily to 7x daily

Nashville (BNA) is increasing from 3x daily to 5x daily

New Orleans (MSY) is increasing from 4x daily to 5x daily

Orlando (MCO) is increasing from 6x daily to 10x daily

Raleigh-Durham (RDU) is increasing from 4x daily to 5x daily

San Juan (SJU) is increasing from 5x daily to 6x daily

San Jose (SJO) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

San Pedro Sula (SAP) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Santo Domingo (SDQ) is increasing from 4x daily to 6x daily

Tampa (TPA) increasing from 5x daily to 8x daily

Those are some pretty significant frequency increases particularly on the flights within Florida. For example Orlando is getting an extra four daily flights while Tampa is getting an extra three daily flights.

American is increasing frequencies in existing markets

Bottom line

American Airlines is expanding even further in Miami with the addition of eight new routes and increased frequencies in existing markets. Clearly this is intended as a competitive response to all the new routes that have been added to Miami in recent months.

What do you make of American’s expansion out of Miami?"
AEP,American Electric Power,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIwMjEvNy8zLzIyNTYwNjkxL3Bvd2VyLWdyaWQtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtaGVhdC13YXZl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recent heat waves show the US power grid is not ready for climate change,"In Portland Oregon this week the recorded official temperature reached 115 degrees Fahrenheit power cables for the city’s streetcars melted sagging overhead wires forced the light rail to shut down and more than 6000 people lost electricity.

But it’s far from the first time extreme weather has caused serious problems with the power grid in recent months. During the winter storm that hit Texas in February nearly 5 million people lost power. In June California suggested that residents charge their electric vehicles during off-peak hours to save energy. And for the first time ever after power outages hit several neighborhoods during this week’s heat wave New York City officials sent residents an emergency mobile alert urging them to conserve energy.

It’s abundantly clear that the power grid in the United States is not ready for the effects of climate change including the extreme weather events that come with it. After all climate change isn’t just increasing the demand for energy to keep people cool or warm amid heat waves and winter storms. It’s also damaging the grid itself. The country is now in a race against time to shift its energy supply toward renewable sources like wind and solar while also needing more and more electricity to do everything from powering more air conditioning to boosting the number of EVs on the road.

“I would probably give our power grid maybe a C minus” Kyri Baker an engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder told Recode. “It’s like this perfect storm of extreme temperatures more electricity consumption and aging infrastructure.”

Having a reliable power grid can be a matter of life and death. In the most severe power outages during the winter storm in Texas this past February 700 people are estimated to have died according to BuzzFeed. Hundreds of people died during this past week’s heat wave in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. Meanwhile the effects of heat waves have been disproportionately worse for historically marginalized brown Black and Indigenous communities. People who are elderly very young who have certain medication conditions or who work outdoors are also more likely to feel the impacts of extreme heat.

Climate change means that extreme weather events are becoming more intense and common which is worrisome not just because the power grid is aging. The grid is woefully unprepared for an imminent and disturbing future.

How the US power grid works

Last year about 40 percent of the country’s electricity generation came from natural gas. While the grid still relies on a good amount of coal-based power a growing share of power is coming from renewable sources like solar and wind power which will hopefully make the grid more sustainable. But while some of these sources are a lot worse for the environment than others they all contribute electricity to the grid a giant engineering system full of high- and low-voltage wires sensors poles and transformers that work together to transport electricity to your home.

Electricity travels across the grid moving from high-voltage lines that carry the electricity across long distances to low-voltage lines a process known as “stepping down.” The low-voltage lines distribute that electricity to buildings and then individual appliances and electronics. But there are hurdles. Right now the country is still facing problems with the congestion of transmission lines that have maxed out on the amount of electricity they can carry. In Vermont solar and wind energy have stalled because the grid is already too constrained.

“So it’s not like you can just set up a wire from point A to point B and everything will be fine” Sam Gomberg a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists explained. “You need to set up little steps along the way to guide that electricity in the direction that you want it to go so that it ultimately ends up at your home.”

The US power grid is actually made up of several regional grids or interconnections that are tied together and operate on a synchronized frequency of 60 hertz. While these systems are very large oversight of the grid is somewhat patchwork. Generating power for the grid are more than 10000 power plants in the country. But the grid itself including transmission and distribution systems is operated by a mix of state-owned and private entities including some public-private collaborations. Then local utility companies like Con Edison in New York City and PG&E in San Francisco ultimately deliver electricity to peoples’ homes.

“The unique thing about the power system versus any other type of infrastructure is that it’s almost instantaneous” Baker of UC Boulder told Recode. “So if I turn on a light in my house there is an instantaneous mismatch in supply and demand. And the power plants actually respond almost in real time to that increase in demand.”

At the same time that means not being hooked up with a broader system can cause problems. Texas for instance has opted to operate its own electric grid which is largely independent from other regional power systems. While this has given the state more autonomy some have argued that Texas could have avoided such devastating outages this past winter if the state’s grid had been able to draw from other power sources. Notably nearby Oklahoma was able to turn to other states to keep its power on during the same storm.

Why the heat makes things worse

Summer heat can interfere with the US power supply in many ways.

Hot weather can drive up energy demands often to power air conditioners which can overload the electric grid and cause brownouts — partial outages that reduce the overall power available. At the same time high temperatures can make power plants less effective limit the amount of energy power lines can carry and make failures more likely in transformers which help control the voltage throughout the power grid.

That’s why during the summer months you might receive an alert telling you to cut back on electricity usage like delaying vacuuming until the evening. If the problem gets bad enough utilities might even use rolling blackouts — when a utility company temporarily shuts down electrical power for different areas in order to avoid overloading the entire system — in order to protect the grid. Of course while officials might deem these steps necessary rolling blackouts can be inconvenient and even risky for residents who need power to stay cool during heat waves. This past week New York’s power company Con Edison distributed dry ice to some residents of Greenpoint Brooklyn who were left without air conditioning during a power outage.

The heat can cause problems for the electric grid beyond overcapacity. If the weather gets hot enough power lines start to sag — a result of the metal inside them expanding — and risk striking a tree and starting a fire. At the same time power plants are highly dependent on water which they need to cool down their systems. This means that as hot and dry weather drives up demand for air conditioning the increased need for energy is also driving up the power grid’s demand for water which is often in short supply during periods of drought. Cooling systems need electricity too adding even more demand for energy.

“We’re trying to project the weather two years from now or five years from now and climate change is making it more difficult” Anjan Bose an electrical engineering professor at Washington State University told Recode. “If you can’t project the weather you can’t project the load demand.”

Eventually individual energy users become aware of these problems. This summer California’s state power grid operator warned that people should prepare for temporary power outages. Last week Portland had to shut down streetcar service. And in areas where there’s a high wildfire risk utility companies might order rolling blackouts to lessen the risk of an overloaded grid causing additional fires.

What Biden wants to do to fix this

Fixing the power grid can’t be done in one fell swoop. Instead the grid will need to be updated by transitioning to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar adapting grid and energy storage infrastructure to adjust to these new types of power and changing our approach to energy consumption in general.

The system also needs to predict and respond to changes in energy demand. One part of the solution is smart grid technologies which use internet-connected sensors on various parts of the grid to collect a lot more detailed data about how well those parts are working. That real-time data can also help utility companies quickly resolve potential problems before they become widespread. The Biden administration supports deploying this tech which could be key to making power grids more resilient.

In April the White House also freed up $8 billion in order to boost the grid’s capacity to support renewable energy and committed to making it easier for new renewables-focused transmission lines to be approved. Joe Biden is now pushing to modernize the grid as part of his massive infrastructure plan. Through that plan the president is hoping that the government will be able to spend at least $73 billion on improvements including building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to expand renewable energy. This will be key to making renewables more feasible. As Vox’s Umair Irfan and Rebecca Leber explain:

Transmission lines can link areas that need energy with places where wind and solar power are cheap which can be separated by thousands of miles. This would help boost the business case for wind and solar power. The proposal calls for a new grid authority to facilitate clean energy transmission and an infrastructure financing authority to help come up with the money to pay for it.

But changes have to go beyond the federal government. Equipment needs to be updated on the regional and local level too. Whether Biden will succeed in addressing the complex challenges of updating the grid remains to be seen. Without government action private companies may be left with the job of fixing the grid and there’s no guarantee they’ll put the long-term protection of the US power supply ahead of their profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZ3Jpc3Qub3JnL2J1aWxkaW5ncy9zY2hvb2xzLWVuZXJneS1lZmZpY2llbnQtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtYW1lcmljYW4tam9icy1wbGFuLW5ldC16ZXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fixing America's school buildings could help stop climate change,"This story about school buildings was produced by The Hechinger Report a nonprofit independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic made airflow a life-or-death issue ventilation experts rarely tested the air inside U.S. schools. That was probably a mistake said Kevin Thomas the business representative for the union representing ventilation workers in the Seattle area.

“You don’t feel the CO2 levels going up you just start to get tired” said Thomas of Sheet Metal Workers Union Local 66 which represents heating ventilation and air conditioning or HVAC workers. “The temperature rises and you just take off your sweatshirt.”

Similar findings have been recorded by HVAC experts across the U.S. — perhaps not surprising in a country where about 36000 schools have ventilation systems in need of attention. But replacing aging ventilation systems with new versions of the same out-of-date technology won’t be enough warned Tony Hans an engineer specializing in green buildings.

“Most districts are still putting in HVAC systems that were invented and designed in the 1970s and those are not going to get you to your health and wellness goals or your carbon and energy-efficiency goals” Hans said.

And the systems that regulate airflow are just one of the dozens of facility improvements Hans thinks schools are about to have a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to fix. He sees the anticipated influx of federal funding through President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan infrastructure proposal as a rare chance for most districts in America to make their buildings both greener and cheaper to operate.

“It’ll be the last time they get to touch their schools for a major overhaul for 40 or 50 years” Hans said. “This is the opportunity to really do it right.”

Judged by annual spending in public dollars America’s K-12 school facilities are the second largest infrastructure expense in the country — only roads rail lines and other transportation systems cost more — and repairing or improving them may offer a clear path to broad reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Taken together school facilities emit about 72 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year the equivalent of about 18 coal power plants or 8.6 million homes according to the climate advocacy organization Generation180.

But much as the pandemic forced a reckoning about the physical condition of America’s classrooms it may also have cleared a way for the federal government to rebuild them.

U.S. Representative Bobby Scott a Virginia Democrat is the lead sponsor of the Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools Act which would send $130 billion in federal money — $100 billion in grants and another $30 billion in bonds — to schools in need of repair over the next decade. Until the infrastructure compromise between Biden and moderate Congressional Republicans took it out on June 24 Scott’s bill had been incorporated into Biden’s mammoth American Jobs Plan. Scott said that funding is badly needed because otherwise school districts are essentially “on their own” to build and renovate buildings.

“If we’re going to do anything about the school construction problem the federal government is going to have to step up” said Scott who chairs the House Committee on Education and Labor. In an effort to stimulate a long-term shift in how schools are built and maintained states would be required to kick in some money too. The grants would be apportioned based on need. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosihas said the Democrat-controlled House won’t take up the bipartisan deal until the Senate passes the spending bill that could include funding for school facilities.

Beyond guaranteeing that American students and teachers have good air federal funding could help protect the planet that today’s students will inhabit. Rehabbing or rebuilding worn-out school buildings particularly those that run on fossil fuels so that they need less energy to operate would cut greenhouse gas emissions.

It would also cut costs. At present energy is second only to personnel when it comes to schools’ budgets said Laura Schifter a senior fellow with the Aspen Institute leader of the group’s K-12 Climate Action initiative and a lecturer on education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. As much as a quarter of the energy districts pay for is wasted primarily by inefficient HVAC systems and drafty buildings. Schools spend billions more than they need to on energy that doesn’t actually heat or cool classrooms or power light bulbs computers cafeteria refrigerators or copy machines. It’s simply lost to leaky windows badly set thermostats and the like wasted like water spraying out of a gash in a garden hose.

Though poor record-keeping makes it hard to quantify school facilities’ contributions to climate change Schifter said schools could reduce their carbon footprint if they had government help with the upfront costs of efficiency improvements. Some fixes like installing more efficient light bulbs are relatively cheap but bigger fixes like switching from gas to electricity or adding geothermal heating are beyond the reach of most communities without federal support. And yet those are the solutions that could get a school building to carbon neutrality or even zero out energy consumption.

“There’s this huge opportunity” Schifter said. Rehabbing schools creates jobs reduces long-term costs and moves the United States toward meeting its climate commitments without reining in industry she said. “This is just an investment that makes sense for the federal government.”

Currently there is no significant school facilities funding stream at the national level. School districts in nearly every state have to pay for new buildings or renovations independently relying almost exclusively on bonds to be paid back with property taxes. Just 17 states help pay to maintain their schools while 36 states make some money available to replace or build facilities. Aside from a handful of small specialized programs the federal government doesn’t help. Districts where property values are low which disproportionately serve students of color simply can’t raise the money.

Federal money could correct the structural problem with school facilities financing and clear the way for healthier more efficient school buildings said Jeff Vincent director of public infrastructure initiatives at the University of California Berkeley’s Center for Cities + Schools. In states like California where the state matches local money dollar for dollar high-wealth districts get about eight times more state money per student than low-wealth districts Vincent said.

“The education community has been far more tolerant of terrible building conditions than they should be” Vincent said. “There’s a little bit of a martyr syndrome that a good teacher should be able to teach in a shoebox. And I appreciate that but why should you have to? Why should children be forced to learn in those environments?”

That American school buildings aren’t in good shape shouldn’t be news. A 1995 study by Congress’ research arm the Government Accountability Office found that 63 percent of students attended schools that needed an overhaul. Twenty-five years later little had changed. A 2020 study by the same body found 41 percent of school districts reporting that most of their schools’ ventilation systems needed to be repaired or replaced. And many schools had critical structural problems: 10 percent of districts reported that most of their schools have walls or foundations that need work.

Among the buildings federal investigators examined was a school in Rhode Island that was running a ventilation system using 100-year-old parts. Investigators found a New Mexico school that had spent $150000 to replace a fairly new boiler burned out by mineral-heavy water but couldn’t afford to buy a filter to soften the hard water likely dooming the newest boiler to the same fate as the one it replaced.

In Michigan investigators found a school still being heated by a boiler from the 1920s. The school had to keep an engineer on site to make sure the boiler built when some students’ great-grandparents were children didn’t explode. Because of the way school facilities are funded — maintenance is covered by some state and federal dollars while renovations and new construction are not — the district can afford to employ the engineer but not to replace the boiler.

In some districts school buildings are plainly dangerous. A 2018 Philadelphia Inquirer investigation found asbestos and lead paint exposure to which has been linked to illness and brain damage were prevalent in city school buildings. District leaders estimate it would cost billions to repair and replace broken buildings a sum far beyond what the district could afford with no federal money forthcoming at the time. (Three years later federal dollars might be the only money forthcoming as the state legislature’s Republican majority recently blocked another effort by its Democratic governor to send more money to schools via a tax on wealthy residents.)

Aside from on-the-ground investigations like the one pursued by the Inquirer information about school building quality is hard to come by. That’s because in most of the country no one is even trying to track it said Anisa Heming director of the Center for Green Schools at the U.S. Green Building Council a nonprofit that develops standards for building efficiency. As a result there isn’t even an accurate count of the total square footage of classroom space in the country Heming said. The best assessments of the physical conditions facing American schools come from the Government Accountability Office or the American Society of Civil Engineers she added.

The civil engineers recently gave America’s schools a “D+” in the trade organization’s 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure and estimated that an additional $38 billion a year is needed to maintain the nation’s schools. The funding in the Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools Act which would represent the largest infusion of cash into the nation’s school buildings in more than 50 years wouldn’t come close to fully meeting those needs.

At tens of thousands of schools simple steps can be taken toward efficiency Heming said. Replacing incandescent and fluorescent lights with LEDs cuts electricity use while improving the lighting. Adding insulation patching walls and fixing leaky windows can reduce heating costs as can calibrating the existing systems so they work as designed.

Thomas the trade union rep said most problems found by the workers surveying airflow in Seattle-area schools are easily fixed. Often it’s as simple as correcting mistakes made by well-intentioned maintenance workers who’ve jammed air intake valves open or shut.

Hans the green buildings engineer who thinks now is the moment to invest in upgrading America’s school buildings works for CMTA an engineering firm in Kentucky that won international acclaim for building the nation’s first net-zero energy school in 2015. The firm is currently constructing an elementary school in Washington D.C. that will have net-zero carbon emissions and energy use while meeting industry-leading health and safety standards. The new schools have an airy futuristic esthetic with lots of right angles strategic shade and solar panels. They also look expensive.

But Hans a former member of a private school board in his hometown of Louisville said school leaders looking to finance efficiency can now borrow against long-term utilities savings to defray up-front construction costs. They can basically use some of the money they’ll save on smaller utility bills to pay back the borrowed money during the first years of a school’s greener operations. And as taxes or surcharges are placed on fuels that contribute to climate change limiting the volume of fossil fuels a school district consumes should result in even larger long-term savings.

In some cities students have led the charge to make schools “greener” and more efficient. Pushed by the student body the school board in Salt Lake City Utah recently committed to using 100 percent clean electricity by 2030 and to going carbon neutral by 2040.

Salt Lake City is surrounded by mountains which trap air pollution produced in the city. The city’s air is among the worst in the nation on par with Los Angeles California. And the burden of pollution falls more heavily on neighborhoods in the Valley that are home to more students of color who represent a majority of the local school district’s enrollment. The district’s shift away from fossil-fuel powered heating and buses will help clear the skies for everyone said Mahider Tadesse an 18-year-old senior at the city’s East High School who advocated for the changes.

“Once these schools adopt carbon neutrality it’ll be cleaner air both for the kids living up in the rich white neighborhoods and for the kids living in the more industrial half of Salt Lake” Tadesse said.

Greg Libecci the school district’s energy and resource manager couldn’t be more excited by the carbon-neutrality pledge.

“I mean holy mackerel it’s why I got into this business” said Libecci a former AT&T salesman who joined the district in 2010.

Salt Lake schools have been adding solar capacity for years; Libecci is excited to use the cost savings from those projects to further shrink the district’s environmental footprint. He’s particularly enthused about electric school buses that will park under a canopy roofed with solar panels.

“This is happening” he continued. “We have tremendous momentum. There’s very little that I see that can really trip this up.”

Salt Lake and any other district in need of a little federal help may soon get it if Representative Scott has his way.

Having just marked his 74th birthday Scott noted that the elementary school he attended — Booker T. Washington Elementary in Newport News Virginia — remains in use. “It’s been renovated but I mean really?”

The stately brick building built in 1928 is now a magnet school with a focus on marine sciences. Scott hopes that his former school building along with thousands of others will soon be “brought up to educational standards.”

“It’s an equal-opportunity action” Scott said of the Democrats’ plan to set aside money to improve school facilities. “Money will go to the areas that are chronically under-resourced…. As Martin Luther King said ‘The time is always right to do what’s right.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb21hcmtldC5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9oaXN0b3J5LWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1kZWFscy1tb25vcG9saXN0cy1tYXJrZXQtcG93ZXIv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJvbWFya2V0Lm9yZy8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2hpc3RvcnktZXhjbHVzaXZlLWRlYWxzLW1vbm9wb2xpc3RzLW1hcmtldC1wb3dlci8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American History Provides a Valuable Lesson on How Monopolists Use Exclusive Deals to Fortify Their Market Power,"Since the Civil War dominant firms have widely and repeatedly used exclusive agreements to exert expand and fortify their market power. History shows that the law can be used to ban these agreements.

Editor’s note: The current debate in economics seems to lack a historical perspective. To try to address this deficiency we decided to launch a Sunday column on ProMarket focusing on the historical dimension of economic ideas. You can read all of the pieces in the series here.

Throughout history monopolists have been able to implement a myriad of unfair tactics that fortify and extend their dominance. Among those exclusive deals have been a critical legal tool for dominant firms to obtain and maintain control over a market.

Exclusive deals are contracts implied agreements or asserted practices that force dependent firms to engage exclusively with a firm. These contracts restrict the freedom of customers distributors and suppliers to conduct business with a corporation’s rivals. Rather than arising from an equal bargaining process these agreements are often the result of a dominant firm imposing exclusivity on a smaller company merely because of their superior bargaining position and market power. Consequently exclusive deals can block or marginalize a dominant firm’s rivals and permit them to unfairly perpetuate their market position.

Today judicial policy favoring increased deference to corporate conduct has eroded so much of Congress’s efforts to limit exclusive deals that a company like Google can control 95 percent of the mobile search market predominantly through the use of exclusive contracts preventing smartphone manufacturers and wireless service providers from installing rival search engines. Dominant firms like Apple can use exclusive deals to limit the availability of parts for their products to inhibit the ability of third-party repair shops or consumers to be able to repair their products. Mylan the maker of EpiPens has used exclusive deals as a means to entrench its monopoly and prevent new and cheaper EpiPen-like devices from entering the market.

Exclusive deals have been particularly nefarious since the dawn of America’s industrial age. Since the Civil War dominant firms have widely and repeatedly used exclusive agreements to exert expand and fortify their market power. These legal instruments were also an essential mechanism for some corporations to monopolize an entire industry and exert their economic dominance to impair abuse and destroy smaller firms.

For example Western Union the dominant 19th-century telegraph provider that controlled over 90 percent of the US market by 1866 took advantage of anemic federal policy and embraced exclusive deals as its primary weapon of choice to monopolize the telegraph market. Western Union’s extensive usage of exclusive deals in the late 19th century and the emulation of its business practices by other dominant firms like cigarette manufacturing and telephone service can illustrate why exclusive deals need to be prohibited.

Beginning in the 1840s and ‘50s various states began to enact laws (known as incorporation laws) that specifically encouraged the creation of telegraph companies to harness and experiment with a technology that could potentially change every facet of society. Similar to modern technologies such as operating systems or social networks the electromagnetic telegraph was significantly affected by scale economies. In general the larger the network the harder it was for rivals to enter and compete in the market.

Because loose state incorporation laws lowered the legal requirements to create a telegraph company they were an affirmative policy by states to create a high degree of competition in the industry. However Western Union throughout the late 1800s inked hundreds of exclusive agreements with railroad companies the other industrial titans of that era to be able to exclusively erect telegraph lines along railroad tracks (known as rights of way). Western Union realized that these exclusive right of way agreements radically scaled its operations to crush rivals and subverted the intent of loose state incorporation laws by increasing barriers to entry for rival telegraph companies. Western Union’s agreements prevented and deterred competition since many rivals were not able to obtain sufficient economies of scale to be a viable business.

After acquiring the corporation archetype robber baron and financier Jay Gould boasted to a Senate Committee in 1883 that Western Union’s exclusive contracts made it “perfectly impracticable” for any competitor to subvert the company’s dominance. Prominent members of Congress like Senator John Sherman who would eventually write the nation’s first antitrust law in 1890 viewed Western Union’s dominance as a result not of its investments in research and development or its technological superiority but of its prolific usage of exclusive agreements. Congress did enact federal regulation that ostensibly made such deals illegal but courts struggled for decades to condemn these exclusive agreements. Western Union would continue to use exclusive agreements well into the 20th century.

During the 1850s Western Union would also use exclusive deals with the Associated Press to monopolize Americans’ new hunger for breaking news after the Civil War.

The New York Associated Press (NYAP) was America’s most powerful news broker during the 1850s. The organization was a related predecessor to the modern Associated Press. It provided news reports to more than 30 percent of all newspapers four times more than its closest rival.

Western Union saw an exclusive deal with the NYAP as a means to prevent rival telegraph operators from accessing a large user revenue stream and economies of scale. The NYAP saw exclusivity with Western Union as a means to insulate itself from competition and provide itself with an immense competitive advantage to widely distribute its news to the public that in practical terms could not be replicated. In 1856 the companies entered into an exclusive agreement that provided the NYAP the exclusive use of Western Union’s wires and other facilities to transmit news in its geographic operating area.

Western Union would also enter into sweeping exclusive contracts with other Associated Press affiliates. Western Union’s 1867 contract with the Western Associated Press another predecessor to the modern AP even included a clause that required restrictions and removal of news-based criticisms of Western Union. The exclusive pacts effectively allowed the corporation to act with impunity without public oversight and anointed Western Union as an “overlord” of the news. The agreement allowed the two corporations to dictate the terms for the content and telegraph rates for any new rival newspaper.

These agreements were enormously successful for Western Union and were destructive for the welfare of both industries. Newspapers that did not adhere to Western Union’s or AP’s demands were quickly excluded from using their systems—many went out of business. An 1874 Senate investigation bluntly concluded that Western Union’s exclusive agreements “amalgamate[d] rival [telegraph] lines and thereby end[ed] all competition and reduce[d] the press to entire subjection to its power.”

“exclusive agreements were by no means limited to the telegraph railroad and news industries. Other dominant corporations in the tobacco and telephone industries also extensively used exclusive deals to cement and extend their monopoly power.”

During this time exclusive agreements were by no means limited to the telegraph railroad and news industries. Other dominant corporations in the tobacco and telephone industries also extensively used exclusive deals to cement and extend their monopoly power. American Tobacco a monopoly with control over almost every aspect of the cigarette industry (and eventually broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911) used exclusive deals in 1890 with machine manufacturers to maintain its dominant position. American Tobacco’s exclusive deals were so critical they were called “the principal factor in the extraordinary success” of the company by the Bureau of Corporations a predecessor of the FTC in 1909.

In 1881 AT&T entered an exclusive deal to purchase only Western Electric equipment in exchange for Western Electric to exclusively sell to “Bell-licensed companies.” United Shoe had its coercive agreements upheld by the Supreme Court in 1913 and 1918. In 1917 the largest first-run exhibitors with 100 theaters formed a cartel and used their bargaining power to impose exclusive deals on movie producers.

Despite the known adverse effects of exclusive contracts federal courts routinely permitted them until Congress decided to explicitly intervene opening legal avenues for aggrieved parties and changing how businesses operated. Congress enacted the Sherman Act in 1890 as well as the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914. Importantly Section 3 of the Clayton Act prohibited exclusive deals for goods that “may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.”

These statutes represented Congress’s affirmative steps to restrict and inhibit certain corporate conduct so that a firm’s operations are properly aligned with publicly acceptable values and structure the marketplace so that firm rivalry is based on investments in operations and the creation of high-quality products rather than exclusionary contracts or other unfair tactics. After 1914 a gradual crackdown on exclusive deals began. In particular the deferential language from Section 3 of the Clayton Act which prohibited exclusive deals if they “substantially lessened competition” became critical to restraining the dominant power of monopolies from enacting exclusive deals and significantly enhanced the ability for litigants to challenge the usage of these agreements to the present day.

But it took until a 1949 case known as Standard Stations for the Supreme Court to fully enact Congress’s command to limit the use of exclusive deals. The court did this by enacting a rule stating that an exclusive dealing arrangement would be illegal when a plaintiff demonstrates “proof that competition has been foreclosed [by the defendant] in a substantial share [of the market].” In this case the court deemed a substantial foreclosure of competition existed with an exclusive dealing agreement from a firm with 23 percent market share closing off almost 7 percent of the geographic market to rivals. Although Congress limited the application of Section 3 of the Clayton Act to the sale of goods or commodities the Supreme Court’s rule inhibited the usage of exclusive deals by dominant firms by simplifying the litigation process.

However in a series of decisions between the 1960s and 1980s the Supreme Court abandoned strict stance on exclusive deals it established in Standard Stations and adopted a complicated “rule of reason” test that incorporates a multitude of factors and economic analysis that it previously disowned in Standard Stations and was in fact never intended by Congress.

While there have been notable victories against monopolists using exclusive deals since the Supreme Court changed its analysis the Court’s shift away from its Standard Stations holding caused the use of these agreements even by monopolists to enjoy a very defendant-friendly legal standard. Even when monopolists use exceptionally nefarious exclusive deals public and private antitrust enforcers are required despite the historical record showing the clear harms of these agreements to engage in repeated and protracted lawsuits.

Despite the Supreme Court’s decisions to recede from the rule it established in Standard Stations the FTC still has broad powers that can fix this situation without the need for intervention from Congress. In 1914 Congress granted the FTC broad rulemaking authority. Congress granted the FTC such broad powers as an explicit means to create an adaptive agency capable of utilizing its expertise to protect the public from dominant corporations and harmful business practices that prevent firms from competing fairly.

In the spirit of revitalizing the Supreme Court’s Standard Stations holding the FTC should prohibit dominant firms from using exclusive deals by using its broad rulemaking authority to interpret “unfair methods of competition” in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. By employing congressionally delegated powers the FTC under the new Biden administration can use existing law to prohibit an essential tool of monopolization and create a fairer marketplace.

Left unchecked dominant firms will continue to use exclusive deals to entrench their market position supplant competition and coerce smaller firms into working exclusively with them. There are legal mechanisms available to restrict and prohibit these legal instruments. History shows that the law can be used to ban these agreements. The FTC can take action to do so now.

The potential of the sea as a vast untapped and sustainable reserve of lithium for a world increasingly focused toward renewable — and rechargeable — sources of power got a shot in the arm last week.

News that automotive giant General Motors has invested millions to be first in line to receive lithium hydroxide and carbonate from Controlled Thermal Resources’ Hell’s Kitchen project at the Salton Sea was a welcome development when it hit business wires and went out in multiple press releases on Friday morning July 2.

Yet it was a lesser-known development that happened quietly by comparison on the afternoon of June 24 that cleared the path for a future that allows Controlled Thermal Resources’ project and many others to develop the geothermal-energy facilities key to the lithium-extraction process.

“Any new geothermal power development at the Salton Sea will enhance the potential for lithium development and the ancillary businesses that support lithium production” said Rod Colwell chief executive officer of Controlled Thermal Resources in an interview prior to Friday’s announcement.

He was responding to the California Public Utility Commission’s procurement order of 11500 megawatts on energy during its meeting on June 24 which required that 1000 megawatts of that order be from new geothermal resources by 2026.

Ryan Kelley Imperial County District 4 Supervisor and vice chair of Lithium Valley Commission

It’s the announcement and signal that many Imperial County officials have been waiting for after prior unsuccessful attempts to compel the state to adopt legislation that requires geothermal energy development from the bountiful subterranean Salton Sea stores.

“This is a tremendous win for Imperial but also for this (Lithium Valley) Commission. We now have a path for putting new geothermal online and the accompanying brine that will allow us to recover lithium” texted Imperial County Supervisor Ryan Kelley just hours after the decision came down on June 24.

“Now the hard work: permitting and financial incentives to make the Lithium Valley a reality” continued Kelley who represents District 4 which includes the Salton Sea.

Kelley is vice chair of the 14-member Lithium Valley Commission a creation of Assembly Bill 1657 introduced by Assembly member Eduardo Garcia D-Coachella.

CPUC Puts in Its Order

Two weeks ago when the California Public Utilities Commission rendered its long-awaited decision on a plan to address mid-term reliability needs of the electricity system within the California Independent System Operator’s interconnected “grid” it created an “in” Imperial County had been seeking.

“I think it’s significant” Kelley said during an interview last week. “It’s something we’ve been advocating for for a long time recognizing geothermal as a renewable energy resource in Imperial County.”

It’s significant because it’s a mandate for all Cal ISO and it could mean doubling or even tripling the number of geothermal-energy plants in Imperial County Kelley said which he added will lead to high-paying jobs coming to the area and the tax-base increases so the county can provide more services for the community.

There are other areas in the state that have geothermal production but Kelley said to his knowledge the capacity is limited in those areas. At the Salton Sea there is a huge resource of geothermal potential so the vast majority of those 1000 megawatts could come from Imperial County if the procurement order is finalized in a vote expected later in the year.

CPUC’s order does bring up a double-edged sword of trying to get the geothermal plants in Imperial County’s queue streamlined and permitted before the 2026 deadline.

“We always said we should have such a problem” Kelley mused. “It will be on our own responsiveness to see how we’re going to position ourselves to make sure that development occurs and make sure it passes all the guidelines environmental etc.

“We’ve been wanting that challenge and now we welcome it” he added.

There are presently 10 geothermal-energy facilities operated by CalEnergy in what is referred to as the Salton Sea Known Geothermal Resource Area and those plants are generating around 327 net megawatts according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

For the CPUC’s needs by 2026 there is still more than double the megawattage in “mean capacity” of unused and untapped geothermal energy around the sea listed around 2210 megawatts according to a 2008 study of the area by the U.S. Geological Survey.

What does that mean for companies working on developing geothermal power at the Salton Sea?

“Increased opportunity for power development from the Salton Sea geothermal field” said Controlled Thermal Resources’ Colwell.

Others are waiting to get their geothermal plants online as well along with their lithium extraction facilities a process that goes hand in hand with geothermal-energy production because the lithium — often referred to as “white gold” due to its color value and conductivity — is extracted from the super-heated brine drawn from the earth as a byproduct of energy production.

“EnergySource Minerals is focused on the commercial development of its minerals recovery project” said Vincent Signorotti vice president of resources and real estate assets for EnergySource. “These efforts are advancing in earnest. The recent CPUC decision can help elevate the geothermal industry at large and that is a potentially good thing for all.”

Although Controlled Thermal Resources’ project tends to get the press according to county officials some months back EnergySource’s project is further along in the process to fruition. Last year a groundbreaking had been expected for some time in 2021.

Supervisor Kelley explained that a CPUC decision earlier in the year included 1000 megawatts of geothermal to be acquired by 2025 but that definition was changed slightly to be firm zero pollution-emitting resources by 2026 on June 24.

“To qualify in this category resources must be able to deliver firm power” according to the revised decision what is often called “base load” or the kind of renewable source that is consistently producing as opposed to cyclical producers like wind or solar.

“This means that the resource must not be subject to use limitations or be weather dependent. The resource must be a generating resource not storage able to generate when needed for as long as needed”

The decision would impact Cal ISO utilities not independent utilities like the Imperial Irrigation District.

However Kelley said IID has already been purchasing geothermal power and has had a legacy of being in favor of developing geothermal along the sea. In fact Kelley’s older brother the late Kevin Kelley a former IID general manager was a main proponent.

Some utilities like San Diego Gas and Electric used to also support geothermal power but have since walked back their use of the energy source Ryan Kelley added.

“We’re reviewing everything and we’re always not taking anything for granted” he said. “This order will be adopted at the end of the year. We’ll make sure nothing siderails any objective.”

More About CTR-GM Agreement

The Controlled Thermal Resources and General Motors announcement was big news on Friday morning for both companies.

On the local front it was significant for CTR in that it was the first major investor that would bring its Hell’s Kitchen Lithium and Power Development to fruition after several years of planning and outreach in Imperial County.

“We are very pleased to establish this strategic relationship with GM moving forward” Colwell stated in a press release. “GM has shown great initiative and a real forward-thinking strategy by securing and localizing a lithium supply chain while also considering the most effective methods to minimize environmental impacts.”

But it also spoke to the promise of Assembly Member Garcia’s AB 1657 passed in 2020 which was put together as a roadmap to build out lithium development around the Salton Sea.

AB 1657 created the Assembly Select Committee on California’s Lithium Economy and the “blue-ribbon” Lithium Valley Commission. Garcia is chair of the Assembly committee and Supervisor Kelley is vice chair of the commission.

Other notable commission members include Imperial Irrigation District board President James Hanks CTR’s Colwell Luis Olmedo of Comite Civico del Valle and Manfred Scott of the Quechan Indian tribe among other regional tribal state environmental and industry representatives.

“Our efforts to galvanize a thriving robust lithium economy in our Salton Sea region are becoming a reality more and more each day” Garcia stated in a press release sent out Friday afternoon. “With the ability to meet one-third of the global lithium demand our Imperial County Salton Sea area can take center stage in the future of our domestic lithium supply chain.

“After years of laying the groundwork we are ready to move forward pedal to the metal on our cleaner air electric vehicle and climate goals while utilizing these economic development opportunities to bring vital resources improve public health and uplift overall circumstances in our region” Garcia continued.

“More than ever we must continue to elevate our community engagement efforts to ensure local stakeholders and residents are in the driver’s seat as we set this new course. Our work last year (AB 1657) to establish the Lithium Valley Commission will help ensure that” he added.

For GM it was a major announcement in that it was part of a $35 billion global strategy to expand its electric and autonomous vehicle footprint and the CTR investment ensures a reliable and sustainable supply for its lithium-ion batteries in a supply-chain with some problematic global practices and availability.

‘Lithium Valley’ Offers Solution

By most estimations the global demand for lithium — which is primarily fueled by the battery sector and the electric vehicle industry — is predicted to more than double by 2024.

Production of the battery metal is set to almost triple by 2025 to more than 1.5 million metric tons according to S&P Global but much of the world’s supply chain of lithium is wrapped up in practices that are questionable for the environment and the competition to secure access to the resource is fierce.

A sustainable environmentally conscientious and secure pipeline for American companies is necessary.

Perhaps for some of these reasons the inclusion of the environmental justice community has been an important aspect of membership on the commission. Representing that end has been members Frank Ruiz of Audubon California and Olmedo of Comite Civico.

Luis Olmedo executive director of Comite Civico Del Valle and member of the Lithium Valley Commission | COURTESY PHOTO

“The United States has laws in the books at all levels that can make lithium extraction to market-ready product more sustainable and safer than open mining happening around the world” Olmedo said recently. “This can only happen if the Valley’s people become engaged in the planning and Lithium Valley Commission is a good place to start.”

The main buyers of the lithium carbonate used in the manufacture of so many in-demand high-tech components from overseas were South Korea at $483 million (U.S. equivalent) Japan at $312 million and China at $240 million according to December 2020 data from Diálogo Chino a United Kingdom-based independent journalism project.

And the lion’s share of the world’s production of those supplies is happening in what is called the “Lithium Triangle” of South America — Bolivia Argentina and Chile where the USGS estimates 47 million tons exist or 65 percent of the planet’s total stores — and in quarries in Australia where many mining operations and supplies are controlled by China.

In both locations extracting the metals can take its toll on the environment. In Australia it’s primarily hard-rock mining but in South America the process is the brine extraction that would occur around the Salton Sea but in an open-air leaching process that is lengthy damaging to the land and is using incredible amounts of water.

To extract 1 ton of lithium some 500000 gallons of water is required in the brine leaching process used in the Lithium Triangle an amount estimated by Diálogo Chino to be enough water for 3500 people for a year.

In one example noted by the report Chile’s Salar de Atacama was using 65 percent of the region’s water for an area that gets just over a half of an inch of annual rainfall per year.

And that process used in the Lithium Triangle involves drilling into the earth and allowing the mineral-rich brine to surface into large evaporation pools where it is left for months. What forms is a crust of manganese potassium borax and lithium salts which have to be moved to another evaporation pond.

After 12 to 18 months the lithium carbonate can then be extracted and through that timeline toxic chemicals are used in the separation process such as hydrochloric acid that can leak from the evaporation pools into local water supplies and also affect air quality according to Diálogo Chino which has documented the displacement of indigenous peoples of those areas due to dwindling or poisoned water supplies.

Comite Civico’s Olmedo said lithium in the Imperial Valley is a public resource that can be “extracted safely and benefit the region.”

Conceptually the process around the Salton Sea does use the same earthen mineral-rich brine but the extraction of lithium occurs in a closed loop that is a secondary process to the primary function of creating geothermal energy from the super-heated liquid.

That liquid has traditionally been reinjected into the earth around the Salton Sea or any geothermal plant where energy production occurs but in the commercial-grade process that brine would run through a second facility to recover the various minerals that have worth and use.

CONTROLLED THERMAL RESOURCES VIDEO

Imperial County had two mineral recovery developments in the past according to county officials. In the early 2000s CalEnergy developed and operated a zinc-extraction facility. That project was successful but closed after five years.

More recently Simbol Materials developed a demonstration plant to extract lithium in the late 2010s a county spokesperson said. Simbol Materials did become a commercial-scale operation but closed in 2015 due to bankruptcy.

Now is the time to strike according to Olmedo and why stop with extraction?

“California aims to ban all fossil-fuel vehicle production by 2035. Localizing the lithium extraction product manufacturing and possible vehicle assembly locally is not at all unreasonable given the region has all the logistics to support the entire assembly line” he said.

In this issue Olmedo indicated there exists not only the environmental factor but social justice and equity that can be achieved in realizing the potential of the Salton Sea’s resource.

“The Imperial Valley is rich in natural resources and it’s inexcusable the wealth gap that exists” Olmedo added. “The biggest risk we face is allowing decisions being made locally (the) way it’s always been done. And we cannot make this happen without community being engaged in the entire planning and envisioning process.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvYm9va3MvbGF1cmVuLWJlcmxhbnQtZGVhZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lauren Berlant Critic of the American Dream Is Dead at 63 (Published 2021),"Lauren Berlant an influential scholar best known for exploring the effects on people of declining economic prospects and fraying social bonds in the 2011 book “Cruel Optimism” which spoke to the frustrations of Americans reeling from the financial crisis of the late 2000s died on June 28 at 63 in a hospice facility in Chicago.

Professor Berlant’s partner Ian Horswill said the cause was cancer.

Professor Berlant (pronounced burr-LANT) — who used the pronoun she in her personal life but they professionally Mr. Horswill said — taught in the English department of the University of Chicago and wrote books and essays that focused on a grab bag of Americana from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Anita Hill seeking in history and current events broader lessons about nationalism sexuality and power.

The professor’s signature phrase “cruel optimism” referred to “when something you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing.” That state of being is widespread in the United States Professor Berlant argued where the tools we depend on to achieve “the good life” — a safety net job security the meritocracy even “durable intimacy” in our romantic lives — have degenerated into “fantasies” that bear “less and less relation to how people can live.”

In a profile in The New Yorker the staff writer Hua Hsu said that Professor Berlant’s thought illustrated how despite “a gut-level suspicion that hard work thrift and following the rules” no longer “guarantee a happy ending” many people “keep on hoping.”"

Under the new rules Amex Platinum card holders will be charged a $50 fee for each lounge guest children would no longer be permitted free of charge but those who charge a minimum of $75k/per year to the card will retain lounge access privileges for two guests.

American Express has heavily expanded their lounge portfolio in the last two years which included expansion of existing space and the opening of new lounges mostly throughout the U.S..

ADVERTISEMENT

As I wrote two days ago American Express in the U.S. has modified the Platinum Card to make it more of a lifestyle product and raised the annual fee to US$695.

As a follow up policy Amex now apparently tries to conquer another issue: Overcrowding!

According to the Terms & Conditions of the Centurion Lounge network there are new rules that kick in two years from now on February 1 2023.

Platinum and Business Platinum Card Members U.S. Basic Platinum Card Members and Additional Platinum Card Members on the account and U.S. Basic Business Platinum Card Members and Additional Platinum Card Members on the account may bring up to two (2) guests per visit into locations of The Centurion Lounge in the U.S. at Hong Kong International Airport and at London Heathrow Airport for no per-visit guest fee (“Complimentary Guest Access”) through January 31 2023. Effective February 1 2023 Platinum Card Members Business Platinum Card Members and Additional Platinum Card Members on the account will be charged a $50 fee for each guest (or $30 for children aged 2 through 17 with proof of age). To receive Complimentary Guest Access at these locations after January 31 2023 the total eligible purchases on the Platinum Account must equal or exceed $75000 between January 1 2022 and December 31 2022 and in each calendar year thereafter. Guest access policies may vary internationally by location and are subject to change. Beginning February 1 2023 eligibility for Complimentary Guest Access will be processed within a week of the Platinum Account’s meeting the purchase requirement in most cases but may take up to 12 weeks to become effective. Complimentary Guest Access status will be reflected in the Benefits tab of your online account and in the American Express App. Once effective Complimentary Guest Access will be available for the remainder of the calendar year in which it became effective the following calendar year and until January 31 of the next calendar year (for example if Complimentary Guest Access becomes effective on May 1 2023 it will remain effective through January 31 2025). Eligible purchases made by any Additional Card Members on the Platinum Account will contribute to the purchase requirement. Eligible purchases to meet the purchase requirement are for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges cash advances purchases of travelers checks purchases or reloading of prepaid cards purchases of gift cards person-to-person payments or other cash equivalents. If a Basic Platinum Card Member upgrades or downgrades from a different American Express Card eligible purchases made on that Card Account will count toward the new Platinum Account’s Complimentary Guest Access purchase requirement. Platinum Card Members have unlimited complimentary access to all locations of The Centurion Lounge. Gold Card and Green Card Additional Cards on your Platinum account are not eligible for complimentary access. All access to The Centurion Lounge is subject to space availability. …

For families with children this will become a hardship. Amex Platinum members that don’t meet the $75000 spend threshold will be able to take their children up to 17years old into the lounge – BUT this will result in a charge of $30 per child rather than $50 per adult.

These limitations will not affect Centurion card holders and those who charge in excess os $75k per calendar year to their personal or business Platinum card. Also this only affects members of the U.S. based Platinum cards for now I assume nothing will change for international cardholders.

Authorized users will still receive their usual lounge access for the AU itself. You can add up to three AU’s to the Platinum account for a flat fee of $175/year. It doesn’t make any difference if you add one or three AU’s the cost is the same something I wish Amex would change and follow the example of the Chase Sapphire Reserve that charges per AU. The minimum age for an Authorized User is 13 years so it won’t be possible to add young children to get them their own lounge access.

I try to see this in a multidimensional non emotional way so here are some of the things that came to my mind when I read this:

Amex has issues with overcrowding at their Centurion Lounge locations to combat this is overdue;

Some people have taken advantage of the lenient guest access policies to the detriment of single travelers who often didn’t find space or couldn’t even get into the lounge;

Amex has already stopped admitting guests upon arrival of their flight and only allows entry three hours prior to the flight (except at transit points) both policies are being strictly enforced.

Cutting the guests from two + kids to zero is harsh. Amex is really pushing for the cardholder to issue and pay for AU’s

It’s simply not feasible that someone randomly issues AU’s for people simply for the purpose of traveling together 2-3 times a year. Especially when it’s not a relationship that usually includes shared accounts. Getting an AU also has credit reporting consequences regarding new/existing accounts.

Highly unlikely a family suddenly starts paying $30 per child that doesn’t consume anything of value at least nothing near the value of 30 bucks. It’s hard to justify that value even for an adult I personally value a lounge visit $15-20.

I’m not making this an issue of “do children belong into lounges or not” because I’m generally a money talks kinda person as long as the behavior is suitable I don’t see a reason for age restrictions. Most issues I had so far at Centurion lounges were with adults spreading their stuff out over multiple seats and using freehand speaker function on their phone.

The $75000 spend requirement will make these changes irrelevant for many especially Business Card holders. Quite a few people put a lot of spend on their personal Platinum as well irrespective of the fact that the card has a horrible ratio for points earning on anything other than airline tickets. I could think of a dozen cards where it makes more sense to spend with rather than the Platinum.

Conclusion

American Express has kicked off a massive overhaul of both the lounge system the Platinum card service portfolio and of course the fee as well. I still wonder about why they publish the changes to the lounge access system now when is still a bit less than two years out. The earliest it would make sense to publish it is like < 12 months prior so people know what they’re paying for. But I guess once it’s out there then they don’t have to open these can of worms again at a later date.

The Amex Platinum is a card that is mainly targeted for travelers given the Centurion Lounge network and travel insurance benefits and travel centered credit system behind the card. It’s important to constantly evaluate if a card is still suitable for the current situation. There is a vast market of premium card especially in the U.S. and sometimes other cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve are more universal than Amex Platinum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL21heGltaXplLXBvaW50cy1hbmQtbWlsZXMtZmFtaWx5LXRyYXZlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a family of 4 uses points and miles to maximize their travel experiences,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

It's no secret that travel is both a privilege and an expense — and with the increase in demand the cost of travel will continue to increase as more and more people begin to travel again. For a family of any size travel expenses can quickly add up and even the cost needed to redeem points and miles can be steep.

That's why my family of four uses a mix of points miles and cash to maximize our travel spending in the way that works best for us. We prioritize what's most important to us on a particular vacation and our points and miles goals vary from one trip to another. In this article I'm sharing exactly how my family does this and my one piece of advice to every family — any traveler really — that wants to use points and miles to travel more.

Redeeming points for hotel nights

Often times we choose to redeem miles for airfare or points for hotel rooms. Because there are four of us we sometimes just elect to pay cash for flights instead of redeeming airline miles for all four of us — plus I think those miles can be better spent in business and first-class which my husband and I don't fly when we're with our kids at this age (currently 1 and 3 years old). For the most part we prioritize a nice hotel over flying in the front of the plane — at least when we travel with our kids.

I stay mostly at Marriott hotels unless I'm saving my Bonvoy points for something extra special. I enjoy World of Hyatt on occasion as well because of their low points redemption rates depending on the hotel.

The reason why I love Marriott hotels is that — whether or not I'm staying at one of their luxury brand hotels like a St. Regis or a budget option like Springhill Suites — I trust that my experience will be positive and I will get what I need out of my stay. For example I know that at a Fairfield Inn and Suites I can expect a larger no-frills room and breakfast included in my stay — a clean and comfortable room that I probably won't spend much time in. And when I stay at a Ritz-Carlton I trust that I'm getting more amenities a restaurant room service probably a spa etc. No matter what type of hotel stay I need I can redeem Bonvoy points for the room and the fifth night is always free.

Some of my favorite hotel redemptions include the JW Marriott Venice Resort and Spa during our first trip to Italy and the Hyatt Regency Phuket over New Year's Eve. Next month we will spend a week at the JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort and Spa.

One reason why I prefer to focus my travel rewards accumulation on luxury hotel redemptions is because of the amenities and services available that make traveling with kids so much easier. After our stay at the Four Seasons Punta Mita when my son was 6 months old I knew that was the only way I wanted to travel from then on. Amenities like a baby welcome basket with sunscreen and face wipes a diaper genie in our room and even a Pack 'n Play for use at the pool made our first family vacation so much easier and enjoyable — they even had extra bibs and baby utensils for him to use at the restaurant.

Redeeming miles for flights

I've traveled with my children as lap infants for as long as I could and was lucky enough to travel to six countries and Puerto Rico with either one or both of my kids before the pandemic began. Traveling with a lap infant is a great benefit to take advantage of when your children are younger than 2 years old — and I will miss the savings greatly when my daughter turns 2 in September.

So now that we will soon need to purchase airfare for all four of my family members we will be redeeming our miles more often than we have in the past. Before now we stacked miles for dream trips in business and first-class that my husband and I planned to take sans kids. However after last year's dream trip to the Tokyo Olympics was canceled we've decided to make better use of them.

When traveling domestically we almost always pay cash for our flights unless we are traveling Southwest. Southwest has great redemption rates and I can transfer Ultimate Rewards instantly whenever I need to. When we travel internationally we redeem miles for at least two of us to reduce the cost of our cash out of pocket while not emptying our miles' banks.

Despite my infrequent travel on Southwest I have been loyal to American Airlines and Oneworld for as long as I can remember. Though not the largest airline alliance Oneworld member airlines include British Airways Cathay Pacific Qatar Airways Japan Airlines and more — all airlines that I have flown or plan to fly in the future.

Another caveat to whether or not my family uses miles or cash for flights also has to do with the airline we want to fly. Two summers ago when we traveled to France and Switzerland by way of London we flew Premium Economy on Virgin Atlantic and paid cash. We simply didn't have enough points or miles to redeem for the seats we wanted and decided that the cash rate was worth the comfort we'd have traveling with a then 18-month-old — not to mention I was very pregnant at the time.

Staying at home rentals

Home rentals from Airbnb VRBO and Marriott Homes and Villas are the most comfortable way to travel with a family in my opinion — and often the most cost-effective as well. You can elect to have more than one bedroom multiple bathrooms and even a yard or a pool for your kids to enjoy some outside space. I like that I can choose to rent an apartment in the center of a city or a larger space a little farther out — and is usually cheaper than renting a hotel room especially for the return on investment. We've been renting homes on Airbnb since 2015 our most recent being a home right outside of the French Quarter in New Orleans.

This year I opened the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card for the 75000 Venture miles sign-up bonus after $4000 spend in the first three months of card membership. And while I'm excited about new transfer partners and airport lounges being added this year I'm most excited about being able to use these miles to virtually cover the cost of my Airbnb stays by redeeming them for statement credits. The card also lets you use miles for statement credits on other travel expenses as well including train tickets and rental car purchases.

Utilizing perks from credit cards

I take advantage of a lot of perks that come with my cards. Even though The Platinum Card® from American Express has increased its annual fee to $695 (see rates and fees) Amex offers travel credits and Centurion Lounge access have more than made up for the annual fee for me and my family the last couple of years. I also get elite status at select rental car companies monthly Uber credits that we use for Uber Eats and I can book through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts through Amex travel for added benefits like late check-out resort credits and room upgrades at select properties.

I get Priority Pass with a few different credit cards so even if there isn't a Centurion Lounge at the airport I'm at my family and I can almost always relax and regroup in a lounge on travel days.

I exclusively use my Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant™ American Express® Card for 3x points for dining at U.S. restaurants and my Chase Freedom Flex for its rotating bonus categories. Almost all of my everyday spend currently goes on my Capital One Venture Credit Card for 2x miles.

My best advice for families traveling on points

I really only have one piece of advice that I would tell any family hoping to make the most of their vacations with points and miles: decide on the vacation you want and then earn the rewards you need to get there.

When you have a redemption in mind — whether it's flying 33 family members to Hawaii or flying one of the best luxury suites in the sky — find out what it takes to make that dream a reality and then start to accrue points and miles accordingly. By doing it this way you avoid what some call ""shiny sign-up bonus syndrome"" (I just made that up) where you sign-up for every credit card with a new big bonus and end up with points and miles in a bunch of different places but never enough in one place to actually be useful.

Bottom Line

Traveling with a family on points and miles isn't impossible — it just requires a little more planning and strategy than if you only traveled solo or with a partner. I like to stick to one hotel brand and one airline alliance — for the most part — so that I can earn as many points and miles as I can to redeem for free travel. I also don't exclusively travel on points and miles and sometimes use cash to pay for one or the other. I prefer using my travel rewards for nice hotel stays to flying premium airline cabins for the amenities and service I get at luxury resorts.

I also really enjoy home rentals and think that they are a great option for families that enjoy having more space. While home rental companies such as Airbnb and VRBO do not currently have loyalty programs you can redeem statement credits for travel expenses with credit cards like the Capital One Venture credit card.

And lastly my one piece of advice for families to best maximize their points and miles is to decide on the trip they want to take before starting to collect travel rewards. It's better to collect the right points and miles rather than having points and miles in too many places and not enough to use any of them for your family trips.

Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on Saturday on the 2nd hole at Mount Juliet Estate. Getty Images

Tiger Woods unfastened his white golf glove with the black strap from his left hand and dropped it into his right back pocket. It was there as he two-putted the 18th at Mount Juliet Estate to win the 2002 World Golf Championships-American Express Championship. It was there as Woods walked off 18 to sign for his victory and it was there as he came back to 18 to lift his trophy.

It was there as a 13-year-old from Northern Ireland snuck under the ropes to stand no more than a pitching wedge away from his idol.

Tiger Woods’ golf glove was right there.

“The last time I was on the 18th green here was during the prize ceremony when Tiger won and I remember I somehow sneaked my way like under the rope onto the back of the green and I was standing right behind him and his glove was still in his back pocket” Rory McIlroy shared earlier this week ahead of the Irish Open. “And like I could have reached and got it and ran; it would have been a good story to tell him but I obviously didn’t.”

It’s a good story nonetheless. From there of course Woods would win 48 times on the PGA Tour including seven majors. Mount Juliet would host the 2004 WGC-American Express that McIlroy also attended — “I remember being in the clubhouse and stuff and meeting Ernie [Els] after he won” — and the course in Kilkenny is this week’s Irish Open home.

And McIlroy would join Woods on the Tour win 27 times internationally including four majors — and wear a white glove that he this week at least drops in his left back pocket.

“It was the first time I ever watched Tiger play live” McIlroy said of the 2002 tournament. “I remember the first shot I ever saw him hit was a drive off the 5th hole the par-5 and he hit a 2-iron into the green. It was really cool. I idolized him growing up and to actually see the man in the flesh was pretty exciting. …

“But yeah really good memories coming down here watching. It’s amazing that it’s been 17 years and the tournament hasn’t been back since. Glad to be back and certainly a lot’s changed in the last 17 years since the last time I was here.”

Indeed. This week McIlroy is playing his first Irish Open since 2018 and because of the pandemic his first tournament in Europe since the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in late September of 2019. Entering Sunday’s final round at Mount Juliet he’s tied for 48th after rounds of even-par 72 67 and 73.

In two weeks he’ll play the Open Championship at Royal St. George’s. At the other majors this year he missed the cut at the Masters tied for 49th at the PGA Championship and tied for seventh at the U.S. Open and in May he broke a year-plus winless drought with a victory at the Wells Fargo Championship.

“Hopefully I’ll have a good day tomorrow and shoot a good score” McIlroy said Saturday. “My iron play is pretty good. I hit a couple of bad tee shots today that cost me four shots. … So I need to sort of just try to figure that out.”

Metals and mining can be a very profitable business for the individuals at the top but success can also come and go based on volatile commodity prices. The average time to make a billion dollars in the sector is 16 years compared to 21 years across all industries.

Although tech and bank CEOs get all the limelight eight of the 100 richest people in the world are in the metals and mining industry. Today’s graphic shows the top 20 metals and mining billionaires based on the Forbes Billionaires List.

Steel producers dominate the list followed by copper miners.

Russia’s Mining Billionaires

Russia’s huge geographic area is filled with rich mineral resources providing a fertile ground for mining billionaires. It is the largest miner of diamonds and palladium and the second-largest miner of platinum and nickel. It is no wonder this country hosts eight of the 20 richest people in the industry including the first few on the list.

Alexey Mordashov son of steel mill workers that had to use welfare coupons to raise the family is the first on the list. The 55-year-old businessman is the majority shareholder in steel company Severstal. In the Forbes ranking which takes into account the assets of the whole family Mordashov ranks first among all Russian billionaires.

Next on the metals billionaire list is Vladimir Potanin individually the wealthiest man in Russia and the owner of Norilsk Nickel the world’s largest producer of palladium and nickel.

Women at the Top

The first woman on the mining billionaires list in the fifth spot is Australia’s Gina Rinehart Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting. The 67-year-old executive is the only child of legendary explorer Lang Hancock who discovered the world’s largest iron ore deposit in 1952.

Hancock died in 1992 leaving a bankrupt estate to Gina. She rebuilt and expanded the company over the following decade. As a result she became a billionaire in 2006 during the iron ore boom.

“If you’re jealous of those with more money don’t just sit there and complain; do something to make more money yourself”

— Gina Rinehart

The list also includes the wealthiest person in Chile Iris Fontbona. Iris is the widow of Andrónico Luksic who built a fortune in the mining financial and beverages sectors including the top copper miner Antofagasta.

A New Era for Mining Fortunes

As demand for most minerals increases due to new technologies and the energy transition the world needs metals and mining more than ever and soon there will be a new list of billionaires who built their fortune on the minerals of tomorrow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIxL2p1bC8wMy9tb3VudC1ydXNobW9yZS1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtaW5kaWdlbm91cy1hbWVyaWNhbnPSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAyMS9qdWwvMDMvbW91bnQtcnVzaG1vcmUtc291dGgtZGFrb3RhLWluZGlnZW5vdXMtYW1lcmljYW5z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The battle for Mount Rushmore: ‘It should be turned into something like the Holocaust Museum’,"Mount Rushmore national memorial draws nearly 3 million visitors a year to its remote location in South Dakota. They travel from all corners of the globe just to lay their eyes on what the National Park Service calls America’s “shrine of democracy”.

Phil Two Eagle is not opposed to the fact that the giant sculpture of American presidents is a major tourist attraction but he thinks the park should have a different focus: oppression.

“It should be turned into something like the United States Holocaust Museum” he said. “The world needs to know what was done to us.”

Two Eagle noted what historians have also documented. Hitler got some of his genocidal ideas for ethnic cleansing from 19th and early 20th century US policies against Native Americans.

Two Eagle is Sicangu Lakota and a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. He directs the tribe’s treaty council office which fights to claim sovereignty over lost homeland. He is part of a growing indigenous movement across the US and Canada that is demanding the return of Native American territory seized through broken treaties. And ground zero for the movement is Mount Rushmore.

Opposition is already proving staunch. Yet while Native Americans have been fighting to get their lands back for centuries indigenous activists say real progress finally seems possible now that Deb Haaland a member of Laguna Pueblo is secretary of the interior. As the first Native American to hold a US cabinet position Haaland oversees 450m acres of federal land – all of it indigenous territory and much of it stolen through broken treaties.

“Having Haaland heading up the Department of Interior is a game changer” said Krystal Two Bulls who is Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne and director of NDN Collective’s Land Back campaign an initiative demanding that governments honor their treaties with Indigenous people. “It opens the door for beginning the healing process. Returning our land is the first step toward reparations.”

Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills a nearly 2m-acre expanse of fertile forests creeks and rocky outcrops that is sacred to the Lakota. The Black Hills is the place they call “the heart of everything that is”. After decades of fighting to keep European immigrants out of their homeland the Lakota Dakota and Nakota people reached a settlement with the US government and signed the Fort Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868. The agreements established a sovereign 35m-acre “permanent home” for the Plains tribes called the Great Sioux Nation that occupied the entire western half of South Dakota including the Black Hills.

But in 1874 Lt Col George Armstrong Custer led a survey party into the Black Hills without permission from the tribes and discovered rich gold deposits. Rather than abide by its treaties which the US constitution calls the “supreme law of the land” the federal government allowed gold prospectors and settlers to overrun the Black Hills and surrounding area.

Members of the Great Sioux Nation were forced to surrender most of their territory and move to much smaller reservations on what was deemed useless land by the US government. Decades later the busts of four US presidents – two slave owners and two who were hostile toward Native Americans – were chiseled into the holy mountain the Lakota called “Tunkasila Sakpe” the Six Grandfathers.

Based in Rapid City next to the Pine Ridge reservation the social media-savvy NDN Collective was energized by last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests and resolved to launch a similar campaign promoting the return of indigenous lands. That effort suddenly accelerated when Donald Trump showed up at Mount Rushmore on 3 July last year for a fireworks-studded re-election rally.

NDN Collective organized a protest that blocked the road to the park claiming the rallygoers were trespassing on sovereign lands of the Great Sioux Nation. Indigenous activists wore eagle feathers beat drums and faced off with a line of air national guard who were dressed in riot gear. No physical violence broke out but the assembly was deemed unlawful by the county sheriff and 20 activists were arrested. Videos of the protest went viral and so did the “#landback” hashtag along with NDN’s demands for returning the Black Hills and closing Mount Rushmore which the group described as “an international symbol of white supremacy”.

Meanwhile inside the park the former president told his cheering base what they wanted to hear. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history defame our heroes erase our values and indoctrinate our children” he said referring to the recent removal of Confederate monuments. The crowd chanted “USA! USA!” in response.

Elise Boxer who is Dakota and a professor at the University of South Dakota where she directs the Native American Studies program said the request for the return of homeland is largely misunderstood by non-indigenous people. “It is not about owning the land. It is about regaining a spiritual relationship to the land” she said.

The memories of frontier settlers engaging in bloody battles with Native Americans are still raw in South Dakota Boxer said. The Black Hills are the ultimate symbol of that racial tension. “If our land is returned there is the fear by non-indigenous people that they may be treated in the same way the early settlers treated us” she said. “And there is also a very paternalistic belief held by the government that Natives can’t take care of their own land.”

Deciding who has a rightful claim to the Black Hills is actually already settled according to a 1980 supreme court ruling in the case United States v Sioux Nation of Indians. “A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never in all probability be found in our history” stated the court’s majority opinion that agreed the Black Hills had been stolen from the Sioux. The court’s solution was to financially compensate the tribes for the land with an award of $2m. However the tribes insisted the Black Hills were not for sale and they refused the payment. The award has been held in trust and now totals nearly $2bn with interest but the Lakota and other Sioux tribes who live in some of the poorest areas in the United States will not accept the money in exchange for their sacred lands.

“We are poor because our resources were stolen from us and those resources made others billions of dollars” said Red Dawn Foster an Oglala Lakota and South Dakota state senator representing the Pine Ridge reservation. “But our connection to the Black Hills is not a monetary one. Our main concern is that the land not be desecrated and we be allowed to resume our role as stewards of the land – that is our purpose as Lakota.”

Foster said many of the “social ills” experienced by the Lakota are rooted in the loss of their spiritual connection to the Black Hills and being denied access to sacred sites for ceremonies. She said the Sioux tribes are simply asking for a “transfer of stewardship” so the Black Hills would no longer be managed by the US Forest Service or Park Service but by the Great Sioux Nation.

Putting Mount Rushmore along with the rest of the Black Hills under Native American management is a realistic first step for addressing the harms of colonization she said.

Corbin Johnson until recently the mayor of the tourist-dependent town of Custer located in the middle of the Black Hills is not thrilled about this idea. “Why don’t the people in other places give their land back?” he said of non-indigenous supporters of NDN’s campaign. (Johnson’s term ended 30 June.) “This whole country is on indigenous territory so where does returning land start and where does it end?”

Johnson has lived in Custer county his entire life and finds the Black Hills “magnetic”. His wife’s family moved to Custer in 1875 the year after the United States broke the treaties and allowed European immigrants to establish homesteads. “I understand the motivation for the land back thing but how do you make it work?” Corbin asked. “Figuring that out goes way beyond me or my town.”

With a Democratic president and Congress in power as well as a Native American woman overseeing federal lands Daniel Sheehan chief counsel for the Lakota People’s Law Project is hopeful steps will be taken to finally address broken treaties.

Since Haaland was sworn in in March her department has transferred 18800 federal acres comprising the National Bison Range in Montana to the Bureau of Indian Affairs where the land will be held in trust for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes. And Haaland has reportedly recommended to Joe Biden that the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument be restored to their original size in order to protect numerous Native American cultural sites.

Sheehan said there are various legal mechanisms for returning control of Mount Rushmore and the rest of the Black Hills to the Sioux tribes such as passing a bill in Congress or executive action under the 1994 Indian Self-Determination Act. Mounting public pressure also plays a big role. A petition sponsored by NDN Collective requesting the closure of Mount Rushmore and return of public lands in the Black Hills currently has more than 44000 signatures.

Meanwhile the staff at Mount Rushmore is attempting to carry out its mission of celebrating the “shrine of democracy” but also incorporate Native American culture as part of the visitor experience. “We strive to provide a broad spectrum of history and messaging” said the Mount Rushmore chief of interpretation Maureen McGee-Ballinger. She noted there is a “Lakota Nakota and Dakota Heritage Village” interpretive display along the park’s main trail. It is staffed by a fifth-generation grandson of the celebrated Oglala Sioux warrior Red Cloud. The current setup is a long way from what Phil Two Eagle envisions possible with a transformed monument that documents Native American genocide.

“After 500 years of injustice you can’t just put up a fake village manned by a token Indian and say ‘We’re good’ “ said Two Eagle. “We want to meet with Biden and ask him to honor the treaties. We want to find out what he will do to stop the ethnocide of our people.”

After the Fort Laramie treaties were abandoned in the wake of the Black Hills gold rush the Lakota called the US government “wasin icu” which means “takes all the fat”. Navajo author Mark Charles sees the current battle for the Black Hills as a chance for Anglo Americans to turn that paradigm on its head.

“The United States has historically viewed everything through the lens of exploitation and profit” he said. “But indigenous people are trying to teach a very young nation a different way of being. We want white Americans to learn that life has so much more meaning if they can just see past the dollar sign.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXJhdmVucy5jb20vbmV3cy9ndXMtZWR3YXJkcy10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZHJlYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gus Edwards: The American Dream,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9tb29yaXNoLXNvdmVyZWlnbnR5LXJpc2Utb2YtdGhlLW1vb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rise of the Moors is part of the Moorish Sovereignty movement,Early Saturday morning Massachusetts police in the town of Wakefield saw two cars parked on the shoulder of Interstate 95.

For many in Philadelphia’s suburbs not fluoride. Why?,"We wrote this story based on responses from readers and listeners like you. In Montgomery and Delaware counties what do you wonder about the places the people and the culture that you want WHYY to investigate? Let us know here.

Updated July 7

If you’ve been to a dentist in the suburbs of Philadelphia you may have heard complaints about the lack of fluoride in the drinking water. You may have even been sent home with toothpaste and mouthwash containing fluoride.

Philadelphia fluoridates its drinking water but that’s not the case in many of the towns surrounding the city. Why?

Seems like a straightforward enough question but it was surprisingly difficult to find an answer.

The science and the history

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found to some extent in all water. It strengthens teeth and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can prevent up to 25% of decay and ultimately block the formation of cavities in children and adults.

Fluoride’s beneficial effect on teeth was discovered more than 100 years ago.

“A dentist by the name of Fred McKay moved to Colorado Springs in the early part of the 20th century and he noticed that his patients there had this very vivid dark stain on their teeth. Local people said that it was caused by the water but there has been nothing identified in the water supply that indicated why people would have such a dark stain” said Catherine Carstairs a professor of history at the University of Guelph in Ontario.

It turned out the residents of Colorado Springs Colorado weren’t the only ones with stained teeth. In fact it was determined that this sort of thing was happening in a few other places and was caused by high amounts of fluoride.

By the 1930s however researchers had ascertained that lower levels of naturally occurring fluoride actually helped rebuild the surface of a tooth the enamel.

“The idea developed that if you just added small amounts of fluoride to the water supply you could bring about substantial changes especially for children in terms of the numbers of cavities that they had” Carstairs said.

In 1945 Grand Rapids Michigan became the first U.S. city to add fluoride to community drinking water. Slowly but surely more municipalities followed suit.

In 1999 the CDC declared the fluoridation of drinking water to be one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century alongside vaccines and the recognition that tobacco use was a health hazard.

By 2016 the CDC estimated that nearly 75% of people that were served by community water systems had access to fluoride.

The Philadelphia Water Department has been adding fluoride to the city’s drinking water since 1951. Initially the concentration of fluoride was 1.0 milligrams per liter. That was lowered in 2012 to 0.7 milligrams per liter at the recommendation of the U.S. Public Health Service.

“Community water fluoridation provides a consistent and optimized level of fluoride and is an inexpensive mechanism for providing its health benefits to all regardless of age income education or socioeconomic status” a Water Department representative said in a statement to WHYY News. “Fluoridation has traditionally been justified on the economic basis of a 40 to 65% reduction in dental caries; for larger communities the cost has been approximated at 50 cents per person to fluoridate water. The CDC estimates that in most cities every $1 invested in water fluoridation yields an approximate $38 in savings on dental treatment costs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL3VzYS13YXRlci1wb2xvLWFubm91bmNlcy11LXMtb2x5bXBpYy1tZW5zLXdhdGVyLXBvbG8tdGVhbS1ub21pbmVlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USA Water Polo Announces U.S. Olympic Men's Water Polo Team Nominees,"Courtesy: USA Water Polo

Irvine CA – July 2 2021 – U.S. Olympic Men’s Water Polo Team Head Coach Dejan Udovicic has announced the 13 athletes that will be nominated to represent Team USA at the upcoming Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 following a silver medal run at the FINA World League Super Final in Tbilisi Georgia. Team USA punched their ticket to Tokyo with a gold medal finish at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima Peru. Final approval of the selections is required by the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and will be announced at a later date.

Veteran Jesse Smith heads to his USA Water Polo record-tying fifth Olympic Games and joins four other returners from the 2016 Olympic Games in Alex Bowen  Luca Cupido  Ben Hallock and Alex Obert . It’s a squad with eight first-time Olympians bolstered by heavy professional experience over the last nine months.

A 2008 Olympic Silver Medalist Smith ties the record of retired Team USA great Tony Azevedo for most Olympic Teams ever made by a USA Water Polo athlete. A world-class defender Smith brings years of experience at the national team and international club level. Bowen has spent the last five years honing his skills abroad capping up for clubs in Hungary Croatia and Greece bringing a next level offensive game.

Hallock and Obert have evolved into the main options for Team USA at two-meters and both are coming off strong international campaigns. Hallock a NCAA champion took home the ultimate club title this year as the first American man to win Champions League taking top honors with Pro Recco. Obert also advanced to the Champions League Final 8 with Croatian power VK JUG. A physical force in front of the cage Obert brings important size up front. Cupido rounds out the returners as one of Team USA’s best scoring threats. A knack for clutch goals he’ll be counted on to find the back of the net regularly and spent time playing club ball in Italy earlier this year.

Eight newcomers join Team USA in Tokyo and while it may be their first Olympics they have no shortage of experience. Max Irving and Hannes Daube were teammates for Olympiacos this season reaching the Champions League Final 8 and will be two big pieces of the Team USA attack. There will be a brand-new look in goal for the United States in the Olympic Games as Alex Wolf and Drew Holland take on goalkeeper responsibilities. Both competed with clubs in Greece this season and have the ability to catch fire in the cage. Holland was most recently named the best goalkeeper at the 2021 FINA World League Super Final.

Johnny Hooper heads to his first Olympic Games adding a creative element on offense while Marko Vavic has the versatility to make an impact on both ends of the pool. Both spent time abroad with Hooper competing in Greece and Vavic in Italy. Dylan Woodhead  fresh off club play in Greece adds to the defensive rotation and with one less roster spot on gamedays lockdown defenders will be key to advancing. Nevada native Ben Stevenson rounds out the roster bringing another hard-working attacker with a host of international club experience in recent years most recently with Glyfada where he was on the same team as Woodhead.

The USA Men’s National Team is coming off a silver medal at the FINA World League Super Final earning their third second place finish at the event in program history. All silver medals at the Super Final have come in Olympic years with the prior results in 2008 and 2016. In 2008 the team would go on to win the silver medal at the Olympic Games in Beijing the program’s most recent Olympic medal.

19 athletes in the USA Men’s National Team program trained or competed with professional clubs in Europe a record for Team USA. Learn more about which athletes played where by clicking here.

Under a new format for the upcoming Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 each nation will declare 12 active players before each match of the competition. The reduction in gameday roster size from 13 to 12 was part of an expansion in the overall number of teams competing in the women’s tournament. The size of the women’s tournament is now at 10 countries up from eight while the men’s tournament stays at 12 teams.

THUNDER BAY -- The heat made Saturday's opening round at the AON District Open a bit of a slog.

But there was still some good golf to be played.

Evan Littlefield Jamie DePiero Casey Niemi and Matthe Cho-Chu all fired even-par 72s on Saturday at Whitewater Golf Course and hold a three-way tie for top spot at the first major of the local golf season one shot better than Jeremy Kirk and Barry Caland who survived 36 C temperatures to sit one back after Round 1 of the 36-hole event.

A strong start powered DePiero's even-par round. The Thunder Bay golfer birdied the first and third holes and after doubling seven birdied 12 13 and 14 to get to three under par for the day. However he gave the shots back with bogeys on his next three holes.

Littlefield's round was steady countering a bogey on the second with a birdie on the third settling for pars on each of his final 15 holes.Niemi playing out of the second flight eagle the third after a bogey on No. 2 and also birdied 16 and 17 to earn a share of the lead. Cho-Chu started in the fourth flight but fired an even-par round.

Round 2 goes Sunday at Fort William Country Club.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYm9uZC5lZHUuYXUvcnVnYnkvcnVnYnktbmV3cy9uZXdzL21hZGRpc29uLWZvbGxvd3MtcnVnYnktN3MtcGF0aHdheS10by1vbHltcGljc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maddison follows rugby 7s pathway to the Olympics,"The amazing elevation of Bond University Rugby 7s sensation Maddison Levi to the Australian Olympic team is a massive endorsement of the local representative pathway according to Setu Naseri who heads the Bull Sharks women’s rugby program.

Levi 19 a multi-sport phenomenon on Friday was named as part of the Australian Women’s 7s team who will defend the gold medal won in 2016 in Rio.

“First of all we are all so rapt for Maddi” said Naseri. “But also it is kudos to the local Gold Coast rugby community the Bond university rugby program and the regional representative pathway.

“It is a win win win situation.

“Maddi first came onto our radar as part of the Coomera Crushers rugby club’s Under 17 7s team. A large contingent of that club made up the Gold Coast Cyclones Under 17 squad that won the State 7s three years in a row.

“Bond’s current women’s 15s head coach Lawrence Faifua was heavily involved with the Crushers.

“Although she was then very young we invited Maddi into the Bond program back in 2019. She is an incredible player and I would say it got to the stage where the national selectors just couldn’t leave her out.”

There are so many riveting back-stories to the current ‘Levi to Tokyo’ headline.

Her sister Teagan 17 is also part of Bond rugby and is quickly following in her sister’s dazzling footsteps.

Maddison also plays for the Gold Coast Suns in the AFLW and has so far been able to tread a successful tightrope walk between the two codes.

And her 2021 highlight reel is already packed.

A standout was her performance for Bond in the Aon Women’s Uni 7s Series. The Bull Sharks were crowned series champions the first time Bond had achieved that honour.

The Levi sisters were named in the Aon Uni Sevens Dream team.

Maddison Levi continued to press her claims for national selection with the clincher coming at the Pacific Aus Sports Oceania Sevens held in Townsville last weekend.

She was part of the Oceania Barbarians team with Australia New Zealand and Fiji also fielding men’s and women’s teams.

“I was aware that Maddi was on the ‘long list’ then ‘short listed’ but then I think her performance in Townsville was so convincing. She was a real standout for Oceania” said Naseri.

“Any thoughts that she may have lacked experience … she obviously convinced the selectors otherwise.”

Three other members of the Australian Olympic 7s team - Shannon Parry Evania Pelite and Charlotte Caslick - have also played for Bond in recent seasons of the Aon Women’s Uni 7s Series. All three were part of an allocation system where members of the national 7s squad were allotted to teams during the series.

The women’s rugby sevens will be held at the Tokyo Olympics from July 29-31 at Tokyo Stadium. The Australian women have been drawn against the United States China and hosts Japan in their pool.



The Australian women’s squad is: Shannon Parry (co-captain) Sharni Williams (co-captain) Faith Nathan Dominique Du Toit Emma Tonegato Evania Pelite Charlotte Caslick Madison Ashby Tia Hinds Sariah Paki Demi Hayes Maddison Levi.

These companies have several positive catalysts in the months aheads and analysts say investors shouldn't underestimate them. CNBC Pro combed through the top Wall Street research this week to find some of the more underappreciated stocks for the remainder of 2021. They include: Caterpillar Apple  Performance Food Sysco  US Foods and Stryker. Stryker Stryker is poised for a second half surge JPMorgan said in a note this week. ""We continue to view Stryker as a standout within our large-cap coverage heading into 2H21 as it represents one of the few companies that has managed to pair a premium growth profile with consistent top-tier execution spanning the last few years"" analyst Robbie Marcus and his team said. The medical technology company is home to a diverse array of businesses including neurotechnology and orthopedic products but there's one area that investors may be overlooking Marcus wrote. The firm said Stryker's Medical unit known as MedSurg had ""value-creating tuck-in M & A sales specialization and market leadership in narrow high-growth markets."" Marcus wrote that a recent meeting with the company's management left him feeling more bullish about the unit which he called the ""underappreciated backbone of Stryker's premium growth profile."" The company continues to innovate as well and Stryker seems to be one step ahead of the competition Marcus added. ""With a better understanding of these key underlying markets and Stryker's positioning in them we are even more bullish on the company's ability to sustain growth at a premium"" he went on to say. Shares are up 8.3% this year. Performance Food Sysco and US Foods It's been a rough year for the big three food suppliers as the pandemic wreaked havoc across the companies' businesses. But now things may be looking up for Sysco US Foods and Performance Food according to Wells Fargo. ""We remain very optimistic on the post-COVID earnings power of the food service space overall and continue to see upside in all three stocks"" analyst Edward Kelly wrote. The firm said if recent management commentary is to believed investors could be in for a big rest of the year. ""PFGC recently indicated that total company sales in the most recent week were $100 million above 2019 levels USFD stated that both chain & independent volumes were above 2019 levels in April & SYY is serving 10% more independent doors than pre- COVID"" he said. Kelly also noted there were some silver linings as a result of the pandemic including cost inflation cost cutting and further share gains. ""Overall we continue to see potential for an underappreciated earnings recovery starting in the second half of 2021"" Kelly said. Shares of Performance Food are up 0.8% this year while US Foods is up 13% in the same time period. Sysco shares are up 3% this year. Caterpillar The time is right to buy shares of Caterpillar Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook said in a note this week. The construction equipment company was added to the firm's top picks list and Cook said he sees several positive catalysts coming up this year for the industrial ""bellwether."" ""We believe CAT's 2020 earnings are at a cyclical trough and see potential for most markets improving in FY2021"" he wrote. Cook noted that Caterpillar is a key beneficiary of what he called the ""cyclical bounce"" in oil and gas as well as increased construction activity. ""CAT should benefit from the North America Construction and Resource equipment replacement cycle which are recovering in tandem and both positive to mix"" he said. However don't overlook the power of a stronger commodities outlook according to Cook. ""Commodity prices including copper iron ore and nickel have been strengthening and the depressed mining business should begin to recover"" Cook said. Caterpillar has many other ""underappreciated"" attributes like strong cash flow generation and earnings power which should excite investors he added. Caterpillar shares are up 19.6% this year.

The bad news for those who prefer iPhones that fit in their hands and their pockets is that TrendForce reports that Apple has ended iPhone 12 mini production early due to low sales. The good news is that Apple is still expected to release an iPhone 13 mini later this year. Sadly the article also suggests that Apple plans to stop making 5.4-inch iPhones in 2022.

We hope Apple has sufficient stock to ensure a healthy iPhone 12 mini supply until the lineup refresh later in the year. But if you don’t want to risk missing out on a smaller iPhone you might consider grabbing an iPhone 12 mini now especially if you see any good deals. While reports indicate that we’ll see an iPhone 13 mini that’s far from a guarantee.

It feels as though the iPhone 12 mini was doomed to fail because Apple released the second-generation iPhone SE six months before and many iPhone SE diehards likely bought that model especially given its aggressively low price. That was exactly what happened to TidBITS co-founder Tonya Engst who would have preferred the iPhone 12 mini if she hadn’t just purchased a new iPhone SE.

While India has best in class R&D fixates focusing in on chip design it’s anything but a scanty number of fabless new businesses and organizations. But this was till now as India’s dream of becoming a major leading player in the manufacturing department of semi-conductor chips is now going to come true! With Apeiron Techno Ventures determination effort and help of world leading semi-conductor manufacturing companies and Indian great minds!

What Were The Roadblocks?

The Technical Experts say that Indian firms need to put in some more investment in chip fabrication plants than they have so far in mobile phone manufacturing. As a result these firms may also encounter with the need of more than a simple cash incentive. For instance India’s offer of zero customs duty on such components as well as in machinery in the past was not able to impress the firms much.

Experts also highlighted the gaps in infrastructure particularly with respect to uninterrupted availability of perpetual power supply and clean water and a big skill-gap in terms of trained workers all of which in the recent past needed to be fixed.

Apeiron Techno Ventures In Conversation With Applied Materials Inc.

Apeiron Techno Ventures is in continuous talk with Applied Materials Inc. the global leader in materials engineering solutions for the semiconductor for getting the plant and machinery to manufacture semi-conductors and chips in India.

The Internet of Things Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) demands drastic advancement in the semi-conductor chip power efficiency performance area cost and market time (PPACt). This particular challenge is the actual driving force behind our Indian industry’s new vision towards its fabrication; to meet these demands Apeiron Techno Ventures is striving hard to make the entire industry collaborate in a new way.

The Help From Great Indian Minds

The visionary Director of Apeiron Techno Ventures Anant Raj Verma is also in constant touch with the great minds of our country in leading technological institutions like- The Professors at The IIT Kanpur who will help in carrying out the technological part of building it and realizing the prolonged Indian dream. The department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur has a unit of Semiconductor Device Fabrication Laboratory which is continuously engaged in the rigorous research and technology advancement of silicon and organic based materials as well as devices.

The fabrication and personation of transistors diodes photo-diode solar cells OLEDs TFTs and alike devices can be easily carried out in the Lab. The basic materials required for the development are also developed. This capability will effectively help India in achieving the goal of becoming a leader in Semi-Conductor Chip Fabrication.

Revival & Relocation Of Closed Plants

Apeiron Techno Ventures is also striving to revive the closed plants of Oregon-USA Abu Dhabi-UAE & Chengdu-China to take them over and set them up in India. This strategy of reviving the pre-existed now closed fabrication plants will help India in many ways. It will reduce the cost of initial plant start-up and expertise; will encourage the development process with available experience of the industry’s ins and outs and much more.

The Benefits India Can Reap

Setting up such a high value manufacturing of semi-conductors and chips fabrications will tremendously transform India’s overall electronic industry. Chips are one of the most integral part of almost all electronic items so making them In India will massively escalate the country’s net value addition to the overall electronics manufacturing operation.

This year’s schemes of production linked incentive (PLI) will also help in driving its manufacturing which will also increase the value addition to 35-40% by 2025. In addition semiconductor manufacturing also possesses some strategic advantages as countries don’t directly want to depend on their imports for crucial infrastructure like defence and power.

The fabrication would effectively promote the manufacturing of indigenously designed chips and will also help India in reducing the dependence on other nations as well as on imports. It will also help in lowering the existing IT components cost for the Indian IT hardware manufacturers.

(AP) — As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5rYXRvZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvYXNrLXVzLWZyZWUtcHJlc3Mtd2lsbGluZy10by1yZXVzZS1wbGFzdGljLW5ld3NwYXBlci1iYWdzL2FydGljbGVfODIwYzA5NTItZDlkYi0xMWViLTlkZTAtNGZhMGRlYzVhNjJmLmh0bWzSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFua2F0b2ZyZWVwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2Fzay11cy1mcmVlLXByZXNzLXdpbGxpbmctdG8tcmV1c2UtcGxhc3RpYy1uZXdzcGFwZXItYmFncy9hcnRpY2xlXzgyMGMwOTUyLWQ5ZGItMTFlYi05ZGUwLTRmYTBkZWM1YTYyZi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask Us: Free Press willing to reuse plastic newspaper bags,"Mankato MN (56001)

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Le Wydad a gagné parce qu’il a été discipliné tactiquement durant toute la partie. On a rarement vu le Wydad ainsi. Il a également gagné parce qu’il a pris l’initiative dès le coup d’envoi jouant avec un bloc très haut une défense intraitable un milieu technique et mobile assurant la récupération et la transition avec fluidité et une attaque avec de la percussion. L’ensemble coulissait en bloc verticalement et horizontalement.



Le Raja a manqué de meneur



Cette cohésion coulissante a gêné le Raja dont les joueurs avaient des difficultés à transiter et à progresser. L’animation n’a pas marché. D’abord à cause du dispositif wydadi puis parce que le groupe a manqué de meneur et de relayeur. De ce fait les lignes étaient éloignées. Devant ce blocage les Verts ont eu recours aux longues transversales vers la tête de Malongo bien contrôlé par le duo Dari-Abouelfath. Quant à Rahimi il a été souvent privé du ballon avant même de le toucher.

Les 30 premières minutes wydadies



Il y a eu ce but à la 14ème minute sur corner d’El Amloud oublié par la défense se focalisant sur El Kaâbi. Ce premier but a donné confiance aux Wydadis qui sont restés concentrés et constants dans leur pressing. Le Raja ne s’est libéré de l’emprise que dans le dernier quart d’heure de la première mi-temps notamment grâce au flanc droit où Madkour a fait un excellent travail tout au long du match.



Le jeu s’équilibre avant la pause



On a vu alors le Raja plus menaçant et portant le danger dans le camp wydadi. Quant au Wydad il a maintenu son jeu dans les intervalles du côté droit grâce aux deux pistons Hassouni et Ellafi qui ont été étincelants. Les deux étaient à l’origine du penalty raté par El Kaâbi à quelques minutes de la fin de la première partie. Les occasions les plus nettes étaient du côté wydadi en première mi-temps



Retour en force du Raja



Après la pause le Raja s’est montré plus entreprenant et plus insistant. Le bloc a été avancé Zrida est monté d’un cran rapprochant les lignes et de facilitant les transitions. Le penalty transformé par Rahimi a remonté le moral. Le physique a suivi le mental. Les mouvements sont devenus plus élaborés et surtouts fluides. Des opportunités ont été créées mais sans danger sauf à une ou deux fois. Même après la rentrée de Metoualli l’efficacité n’a pas été parce au lieu de jouer entre les lignes on a privilégié les longues transversales vers Malongo placé au point du penalty ou vers Rahimi dans le dos des défenseurs du côté gauche. Or les deux étaient surveillés de très près. On ne leur laisser pas d’espace.



Hassouni El Kaâbi et Moutarajji font la différence



Jouant très haut à la recherche d’un deuxième but la défense et le milieu du Raja se sont dégarnis. Hassouni en a profité pour lancer Moutarajji en profondeur. En course il a servi El Kaâbi lequel en remiseur a replacé le ballon devant Moutarajji qui s’en est pris à deux fois pour inscrire le deuxième but. Zniti a repoussé le premier ballon mais le deuxième a trouvé les filets. Le score n’a plus changé. Au sifflet final la joie et la liesse chez les Rouges la consternation et la déception chez les Verts. Rouges et Verts étaient conscients que le titre a presque choisi son camp.



Le Wydad a fait le plus difficile



C’est bien parti pour le Wydad. Après sa précieuse victoire du samedi soir le bout du tunnel est dans l’horizon. Encore un total de six points et le voilà Champion de la saison 2020-2021. Le résultat du 130ème derby a été prépondérant. Il le fait approcher de son 21e titre. Samedi en battant son éternel rival pour la deuxième fois cette saison il s’est octroyé un match à 6 points et non à 3. Encore du chemin à faire mais ce samedi soir 3 juillet 2020 le plus difficile a été accompli. Le reste est à confirmer.

La croissance des centrales hydroélectriques dans le monde devrait ralentir considérablement cette décennie mettant en péril les ambitions des pays du monde entier d’atteindre zéro émission nette tout en assurant un approvisionnement énergétique fiable et abordable pour leurs citoyens selon un nouveau rapport de l’International Energy Agence.

L’hydroélectricité joue aujourd’hui un rôle clé dans la transition vers une énergie propre non seulement par les quantités massives d’électricité à faible émission de carbone qu’elle produit mais aussi en raison de ses capacités inégalées de flexibilité et de stockage. De nombreuses centrales hydroélectriques peuvent augmenter et diminuer leur production d’électricité très rapidement par rapport à d’autres centrales électriques telles que le nucléaire le charbon et le gaz naturel. Cela fait de l’hydroélectricité durable une base attrayante pour intégrer de plus grandes quantités d’énergie éolienne et solaire dont la production peut varier en fonction de facteurs tels que la météo et l’heure de la journée ou de l’année.

La capacité hydroélectrique mondiale devrait augmenter de 17 % entre 2021 et 2030 – menée par la Chine l’Inde la Turquie et l’Éthiopie – selon le rapport sur le marché spécial de l’ hydroélectricité qui fait partie de la série de rapports sur le marché des énergies renouvelables de l’AIE . Cependant la croissance projetée pour les années 2020 est près de 25 % plus lente que l’expansion de l’hydroélectricité au cours de la décennie précédente.

Inverser le ralentissement attendu nécessitera une série de mesures politiques fortes de la part des gouvernements pour relever les principaux défis qui entravent un déploiement plus rapide de l’hydroélectricité selon le rapport. Ces mesures incluent la fourniture d’une visibilité à long terme sur les revenus afin de garantir que les projets hydroélectriques sont économiquement viables et suffisamment attrayants pour les investisseurs tout en garantissant des normes de durabilité solides.

En 2020 l’hydroélectricité a fourni un sixième de la production mondiale d’électricité ce qui en fait la plus grande source d’énergie à faible émission de carbone – et plus que toutes les autres énergies renouvelables réunies. Sa production a augmenté de 70 % au cours des deux dernières décennies mais sa part dans l’approvisionnement mondial en électricité est restée stable en raison de l’augmentation de l’éolien du solaire photovoltaïque du gaz naturel et du charbon. Néanmoins l’hydroélectricité répond actuellement à la majorité de la demande d’électricité dans 28 économies émergentes et en développement différentes qui comptent une population totale de 800 millions d’habitants. « L’hydroélectricité est le géant oublié de l’électricité propre et elle doit être remise carrément à l’ordre du jour de l’énergie et du climat si les pays veulent vraiment atteindre leurs objectifs nets zéro » a déclaré Fatih Birol directeur exécutif de l’AIE. « Il apporte une échelle et une flexibilité précieuses pour aider les systèmes électriques à s’adapter rapidement aux changements de la demande et pour compenser les fluctuations de l’offre provenant d’autres sources. Les avantages de l’hydroélectricité peuvent en faire un catalyseur naturel de transitions sûres dans de nombreux pays alors qu’ils passent à des parts de plus en plus élevées d’énergie solaire et éolienne à condition que les projets hydroélectriques soient développés de manière durable et résiliente au changement climatique.

Le rapport spécial de l’AIE est la première étude à fournir des prévisions mondiales détaillées jusqu’en 2030 pour les trois principaux types d’hydroélectricité : réservoir au fil de l’eau et installations de pompage. Environ la moitié du potentiel économiquement viable de l’hydroélectricité dans le monde est inexploité et ce potentiel est particulièrement élevé dans les économies émergentes et les économies en développement où il atteint près de 60 %. Sur la base des paramètres politiques actuels la Chine devrait rester le plus grand marché de l’hydroélectricité jusqu’en 2030 représentant 40 % de l’expansion mondiale suivie par l’Inde. Cependant la part de la Chine dans les ajouts hydroélectriques mondiaux a diminué en raison de la diminution de la disponibilité de sites économiquement attractifs et des préoccupations croissantes concernant les impacts sociaux et environnementaux.

D’ici 2030 127 milliards de dollars – soit près d’un quart des investissements hydroélectriques mondiaux – devraient être consacrés à la modernisation de centrales vieillissantes principalement dans les économies avancées. C’est notamment le cas en Amérique du Nord où l’âge moyen d’une centrale hydroélectrique est de près de 50 ans et en Europe où il est de 45 ans. Pourtant l’investissement prévu est bien en deçà des 300 milliards de dollars que le rapport estime nécessaires pour moderniser toutes les centrales hydroélectriques vieillissantes dans le monde.

Alors que l’hydroélectricité reste économiquement attractive dans de nombreuses régions du monde le rapport met en évidence un certain nombre de défis majeurs auxquels elle est confrontée. Les nouveaux projets hydroélectriques sont souvent confrontés à de longs délais à de longs processus d’autorisation à des coûts et à des risques élevés liés aux évaluations environnementales et à l’opposition des communautés locales. Ces pressions entraînent des risques d’investissement et des coûts de financement plus élevés par rapport aux autres technologies de production et de stockage d’électricité décourageant ainsi les investisseurs.

Le rapport de l’AIE définit sept priorités clés pour les gouvernements qui cherchent à accélérer le déploiement de l’hydroélectricité de manière durable. Il s’agit notamment de verrouiller les structures de tarification à long terme et de s’assurer que les projets hydroélectriques respectent des directives strictes et les meilleures pratiques. Ce type d’approche peut minimiser les risques de durabilité et maximiser les avantages sociaux économiques et environnementaux.

Si les gouvernements surmontent les obstacles à un déploiement plus rapide de manière appropriée les ajouts de capacité hydroélectrique mondiale pourraient être 40 % plus élevés jusqu’en 2030 en débloquant les pipelines de projets existants selon le cas accéléré présenté dans le rapport. Mais pour mettre le monde sur la voie d’émissions nettes nulles d’ici 2050 comme indiqué dans la récente feuille de route mondiale de l’AIE pour un net zéro d’ici 2050  les gouvernements devraient augmenter considérablement leurs ambitions hydroélectriques. En fait la capacité hydroélectrique mondiale devrait croître deux fois plus vite jusqu’en 2030 que prévu dans les principales prévisions du rapport. Une approche politique beaucoup plus forte et globale serait nécessaire pour y parvenir.

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

""We're better than that"" Rivers said. ""Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9oZWFsdGgvYnJlYXN0LWNhbmNlci1zY3JlZW5pbmctbWFtbW9ncmFtLWd1aWRlbGluZXMtd2VsbG5lc3MvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mammograms are now recommended starting at age 40. Should you get one?,"CNN —

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

It was a frenzied moment of both nostalgia and hope that the past and present will collide to bring more triumphs with Pope as the coach at his alma mater.

On the one hand Pope has yet to win an NCAA Tournament game across nine total seasons as a coach at Utah Valley and BYU. Though his career 187-108 record is solid his resume pales in comparison to national-title winners such as Billy Donovan Dan Hurley and Scott Drew who were each connected to the UK opening at some level.

But on the other hand Pope knows firsthand what it takes to reach the pinnacle of college basketball while wearing a Wildcats uniform. Kentucky went 62-7 during Pope's two seasons under Rick Pitino earned a pair of No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament and won the trophy that Pope toted on his way off the bus.

Pope averaged 7.6 points 5.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 20.3 minutes per game for the 1995-96 title team earning him a spot in the lore of a proud program.

""Guys it is the greatest honor that I will ever have in my professional...career to be able to come back here and do this with you"" Pope said. ""The difference between Kentucky and every other program in the country is that this is not my team. It is not even our team. It is our team.""

Time will tell whether the passionate reunion between Kentucky and Pope yields the results UK fans are hoping for. They don't have to look far for an example of how a joyous reunion can go wrong. Kenny Payne won a national championship as a player at Louisville in 1986 but flopped as a coach posting a 12-52 mark in two seasons from 2022-24.

Recent history shows that coaches returning to the schools where they once played produce a mixture of results ranging from horrendous to triumphant. Here's the ranking of big hits big misses and a look at some of those who fell somewhere in between.

The coaches ranked are either active now or were hired by their former school within the past 15 years.

Big hits

1. Matt Painter Purdue (2005-present)

Painter spent one season as a college head coach at Southern Illinois before returning to Purdue to be the Boilermakers head coach in waiting in 2004. After one season working under Gene Keady his former coach Painter took over the head job. Now 19 years in his stardom has never been higher. The Boilermakers are coming off consecutive outright Big Ten titles and just reached the Final Four for the first time since 1980.

2. Fred Hoiberg Iowa State (2010-15)

With no collegiate coaching experience Hoiberg took over at Iowa State just a few years after retiring as a player. He produced stunning results for a program that had posted four straight losing records before his arrival. After going 16-16 in Year 1 Hoiberg took ISU to four straight NCAA Tournaments before he was hired as head coach of the Chicago Bulls.

3. Hubert Davis North Carolina (2021-present)

Davis is doing a nice job through three seasons as he navigates the unenviable task of replacing Roy Williams. He started by leading the Tar Heels to the Final Four in 2021-22. Although the 2022-23 season was a big flop UNC rebounded by winning the ACC regular season title and reaching the Sweet 16 as a No. 1 seed in 2023-24. Next year's squad is shaping up quite nicely as UNC stands at No. 3 in Gary Parrish's Top 25 And 1.

4. Jamie Dixon TCU (2016-present)

TCU had been to just two NCAA Tournaments since expansion in 1985 before Dixon took over in 2017. The former Horned Frogs guard has guided his alma mater to four appearances in the Big Dance and six 20-win seasons in eight years. TCU was a Big 12 punching bag before Dixon's arrival. Now it has made three consecutive NCAA Tournaments for the first time in program history.

5. Jon Scheyer Duke (2022-present)

Elevated to replace Mike Krzyzewski at just 34 Scheyer has kept the Duke standard high in his first two years by winning the ACC Tournament in his first season and reaching the Elite Eight in his second. Scheyer has another big challenge ahead as he builds his 2024-25 roster around No. 1 ranked freshman Cooper Flagg. His legacy is mostly undetermined at this point but he's been good so far.

Big misses

Kenny Payne failed to find the success success at Louisville that he had as a player. USATSI

1. Kenny Payne Louisville (2022-24)



After years as an assistant at Oregon Kentucky and with the New York Knicks Payne landed the head coaching job at his alma mater in 2022. His tenure an unmitigated disaster. The Cardinals lost an exhibition game to Division II Lenoir-Rhyne before Payne's tenure officially began and things never improved. He was fired after going 12-52 in two seasons.

2. Kim Anderson Missouri (2014-17)

Unlike many of the other busts Anderson actually entered with significant experience running a college program. His Central Missouri team won the 2014 Division II national title and that achievement catapulted Anderson to the top seat at Mizzou. But the Tigers never won more than 10 games in his three seasons and Anderson's tenure concluded with an 8-46 mark in SEC play.

3. Eddie Jordan Rutgers (2013-16)

Jordan starred for Rutgers' 1976 Final Four team and enjoyed a fruitful NBA playing and coaching career. But he couldn't replicate that success at Rutgers. Faced with the difficult task of navigating the Scarlet Knights from the Big East to the Big Ten Jordan posted a 7-25 (1-17 Big Ten) mark in his third and final season.

4. Patrick Ewing Georgetown (2017-23)

Ewing's tenure began in somewhat respectable fashion as the Hoyas finished 19-14 (9-9 Big East) with an NIT appearance in his second season. Then in Year 4 he led the Hoyas on a stunning Big East Tournament title run that resulted in a surprise NCAA Tournament appearance. But the bottom fell out during his last two seasons as Georgetown went 13-50 overall and 2-37 in the Big East which led to a change following the 2022-23 season.

A three-time Big East Player of the Year during his time in college Mullin landed the St. John's job in 2015 and steadily improved culminating with an appearance in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. But on the whole it was a struggle. The Red Storm never posted a winning record in Big East play during Mullin's four seasons as he finished just 20-52 in conference games.

Mixed bag

These prominent coaches who were hired by the schools where they played are a mixed bag of success and frustration.

Mike Woodson Indiana (2021-present)

Neither of Woodson's two most-recent predecessors at Indiana did anything worth mentioning in their first three seasons and by the time Archie Miller was fired in 2021 it had been five years since the Hoosiers reached the NCAA Tournament. Woodson came in and immediately got IU to consecutive NCAA Tournaments. Though IU regressed to 19-14 and missed the Big Dance in 2024 Woodson has a strong class of transfers entering. This one could still go either way.

Juwan Howard Michigan (2019-24)

Howard took Michigan to an Elite Eight as a No. 1 seed in his second season and led the Wolverines back to the Sweet 16 the following season. It ended in flames following an 8-24 season and plenty of drama. But his five-year roller-coaster of a tenure featured some highs that should be acknowledged.

Penny Hardaway Memphis (2018-present)

Memphis has won 20+ games in all six seasons of Hardaway's tenure which is impressive for someone who entered the job with no coaching experience beyond the high school level. But the Tigers have yet to reach the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Given the big game Hardaway talked early in his tenure the lack of postseason pop is disappointing.

Shaheen Holloway Seton Hall (2022-present)

Holloway just led Seton Hall to a 25-win season and NIT title after the Pirates were left on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble with a 13-7 Big East record. Normally that type of season would be a harbinger of big things to come. But the portal hit Seton Hall with force leaving Holloway on uneven footing entering Year 3 on the job.

Kevin Ollie UConn (2012-18)

UConn won the 2014 national championship in Ollie's second season as coach. Eventually amid diminishing on-court results and allegations of NCAA violations he was fired for cause. Ollie's six-year run featured the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.

“I stand here today and every day forward for the rest of my life in solidarity with the people of Palestine with an open heart in the belief that our collective liberation is at stake – that we all deserve freedom in this life of ours” Macklemore said in a short speech 40 minutes into his two-hour set.

“Yesterday [Tuesday] I put out a song called Hind’s Hall – can I play it for you guys?” he asked to a screaming reception from the audience.

As he performed the red white and green of the Palestinian flag flashed across the stadium. Behind him a video montage played showing student protesters in the US intercut with footage of politicians and Gaza.

The audience of 5500 raised their hands as he sang and multiple fans waved keffiyeh – the black and white scarf linked with Palestinian struggle.

Towards the end of the song Macklemore led a chant of “free free Palestine” which the crowd repeated back to him. Macklemore later called for an immediate ceasefire.

The artist released his song on social media and YouTube on Tuesday promising that once it hit streaming services all proceeds would be donated to the UN relief agency Unrwa.

The song gives robust support to Palestine as well as those protesting at US universities against Israel’s activities in Gaza. The title refers to Hamilton Hall a Columbia University building occupied by students last week and renamed Hind’s Hall by protesters in reference to Hind Rajab a six-year-old child killed in Gaza.

“If students in tents posted on the lawn / Occupying the quad is really against the law / And a reason to call in the police and their squad / Where does genocide land in your definition huh?” he raps referring to the police crackdown against protests.

Israel has said that it is following all international law and that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces.

Macklemore’s track addresses Joe Biden saying “blood is on your hands” and says he will not be voting for him later this year.

The rapper characterises Israel as “a state that’s gotta rely on an apartheid system to uphold an occupying violent history been repeating for the last 75 [years]” and says he has experienced support from Jewish people in solidarity with the pro-Palestine protests. “We see the lies in them claiming it’s antisemitic to be anti-Zionist / I’ve seen Jewish brothers and sisters out there and riding in solidarity and screaming ‘Free Palestine’ with them.”

As well as condemning Israel’s campaign in Gaza Columbia students are calling for their university to divest from companies linked to Israel – a call that has been repeated in other campuses across the US. Last week New York police arrested more than 100 people protesting at Columbia including some occupying Hamilton Hall. More than 2000 people have been arrested over US campus protests.

Macklemore fans Stacey and Matt Johnsen who had travelled from the bottom of the South Island to see him perform in Wellington praised the artist for taking a stand.

“I think it’s so cool that someone has finally spoken out” Stacey said. “He’s down to earth and human.”

“Like anyone else you’re allowed an opinion … nobody wants war nobody wants innocent people to die or get hurt” Matt said. “Some other people might be aggressive about it or lean a bit more towards a certain side but that’s not how Macklemore comes across to me.”

The couple felt proud their music hero was taking a risk and hoped Macklemore’s message would resonate with the audience and farther afield. “I would hope it would encourage more people to speak out” Stacey said."

Fourth of July celebrations in Carson Valley's three towns were well attended on Sunday morning. The Gardnerville Main Street Freedom 5K Fun Run and Walk drew 140 participants to the otherwise quiet town on Sunday morning. Main Street Director Jen Nalder said that most of the participants signed up in the last few days. Meanwhile Genoa Nevada's oldest town was bustling with activity as preparations for the annual American celebration were under way. Genoans started off their event at 10 a.m.with a pet bicycle and kazoo parade. Events will continue in the town with the Carson City Symphony performing at 4:30 p.m. today. They were cooking burgers in Minden Park for the free barbecue. Scores of children participated in the bicycle parade around the park while others enjoyed an inflatable slide bouncy house and the Minden Splash Pad. Very nearly the entire town was in evidence. The Battle Born Mounted Posse brought in the colors. The Carson Valley Pops performed in Heritage Park in Gardnerville at noon on Sunday for the Fourth.

Can it?,"“Some people refer to what we’re building as the Metaverse” David Baszucki CEO of gaming company the Roblox Corporation told the crowd that had assembled virtually to hear the company’s pitch to investors in February of this year. “We’re shepherds of the Metaverse.” When Roblox went public a month later it quickly found itself valued at $45 billion. That’s more than gaming giant EA as well as the might of Ubisoft Take Two and Square-Enix combined. Clearly there’s a significant amount of faith in Roblox’s promises. But can Roblox actually build a Metaverse?

The term originated in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash the story of a pizza delivery rider who spends his free time escaping his daily life by plugging into the Metaverse – a simulated world which allows its denizens to live as whoever they designed their avatars to be in a shared reality which is always on and beyond the control of any one user.

Technology circles have long believed some version of this vision can and will feasibly exist – Stephenson himself now works at augmented reality start-up Magic Leap – even if what that would look like exactly when transposed into today’s world is still quite unclear.

Matthew Ball – an investor and writer focused on the Metaverse – says that the easiest way to think of it is “as a quasi-successor state to today’s mobile internet. Except instead of accessing all the internet via separated 2D web pages or apps we’ll experience it via persistent interconnected virtual simulations.” It’s a wildly ambitious prize with unfathomably lucrative potential. Many contenders are circling the waters including Epic Games’s Fortnite Facebook’s Horizon VRChat Core Sansar Decentraland and – of course – Roblox.

Manuel Bronstein Roblox’s chief product officer says that the company’s journey began at the turn of the 1990s when eventual co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel developed the 2D Interactive Physics and the 3D CAD software Working Model. These were “simulated physics laboratories” which allowed users to design environments they could experiment within – by constructing destructible houses for instance or crashing two cars together at various speeds or maybe by taking the tools in altogether weirder and more unexpected directions.

“Witnessing the creativity and imagination of these players as they built and socialised together inspired the team to replicate it on a much grander scale” Bronstein says. “Their vision was to create a platform for shared experiences and usher in a new category (‘human co-experience’) that did not exist at the time.”

In 2006 Baszucki and Cassel launched Roblox Studio. It was in Bronstein’s own phrasing an “immersive creation engine” blending gaming creation and social networking. Roblox might have the veneer of a video game but it’s perhaps more accurate to describe it as a set of tools its users can wield to build their own video games (or “experiences” as the company sometimes refer to them) to be hosted on the Roblox platform. These creation tools are designed to be less daunting to the entry-level developer than professional game engines and fully customisable frameworks exist across numerous genres. These include maze-runners first-person shooters tycoon simulators and free-form “roleplay” genre where developers create worlds – schools cities historical eras sci-fi dystopias etc – for users to project their own stories onto informed by their interactions with the setting and other users.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 25000 past and present customers were surveyed in the United States.

Forbes expresses that local banks need to demonstrate their advantages in regards to customer service accessibility financial advice security and mobile offerings to compete with better interest rates online banks can offer on savings.

Institutions were scored based on several factors. According to Forbes out of the 4978 FDIC-insured banks in America just 135 banks or 2.7% made the cut. Renasant Bank ranked number 1 as Best-in-State for Georgia. Right behind Renasant was South State Bank and Bank OZK.

Renasant is headquartered out of Tupelo Mississippi and employees 2359 people.

From Renasant:

Renasant is pleased to announce that it has been awarded the Best Bank in Georgia on Forbes’ 2021 list of America’s “Best-In-State” Banks. Renasant was also named third best bank for the state of Mississippi. This prestigious award is presented by Forbes and Statista Inc. the world-leading statistics portal and industry ranking provider.

“At Renasant building relationships with our customers and communities by seeking to understand their needs and then meet them is embedded in mission vision values and core behaviors” said Renasant President and CEO Mitch Waycaster. “We’re proud to be acknowledged for serving our customers as part of providing an exception customer experience.

“We have an incredible team of people throughout the state who truly understand our customers and their financial needs. Renasant is unique because we have the resources of a regional bank but also have the culture and commitment to servicing our customers like a community bank” said Chris Torie President of Renasant’s North Georgia Banking Group.

Renasant was also proudly featured in the Forbes’ 2021 World’s Best Banks list and the 2021 America’s Best Banks list and was named by Time Magazine’s Money.com “Best Bank in the South” in 2019. “We are proud to be named Best Bank in Georgia by Forbes. We will continue to meet our customers’ needs with personal services and technical products and will continue to exceed their expectations as well” said David Durland President of Renasant’s South Georgia and North Florida Core Banking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3JpZGFidWxsZG9nLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA3L2d1bmRlcnNlbi1pZ25vcmVzLXRhaW50ZWQtYmFuay1kb2N1bWVudHMtdG8tanVzdGlmeS1mb3JlY2xvc3VyZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge Gundersen ignores tainted bank documents to justify foreclosures,"By Noreen Marcus FloridaBulldog.org

Broward Circuit Judge Andrea Gundersen who runs the court’s foreclosure docket often rules for banks and against homeowners even when the banks use sketchy documents a consumer watchdog charges in a recent report.

Released in May the report got scant attention until Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beatrice Butchko took the dramatic step of holding Bank of America the Bank of New York Mellon and their lawyer in contempt for failing to answer questions about possible fraud in a foreclosure case.

The Third District Court of Appeal in Miami tabled the case. If the banks eventually win nurse Julie Nicolas will lose her North Miami Beach home of nearly 30 years.

Broward foreclosure Judge Andrea Gundersen

The report by the nonprofit Floridians for Honest Lending (FHL) targets robo-signing the discredited and illegal practice of treating foreclosure papers like assembly line goods.

Endorsements that establish the lender’s legal right to foreclose are stamped and processed robotically. The “signer” a bank executive could not possibly know what’s in the papers and vouch for their validity as is legally required.

In 2012 findings of mortgage loan misconduct including robo-signing were supposedly resolved with a $25-billion settlement between the five biggest mortgage servicers and on the other side 49 state attorneys general and the Justice Department.

Robo-signing never ended

The next year a dozen U.S. mortgage lenders most prominently Bank of America and its subsidiary Countrywide Financial agreed to end robo-signing as part of a $9.3-billion settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

But the FHL report based on 2019-2020 South Florida court records shows that illegal robo-signing persists. For example stacks of mortgage loans originated by the notorious Countrywide bear the signatures of three bank executives–if the papers were legit a trio that could boast of superhuman powers.

“It’s the same shit now” said a foreclosure defense lawyer who practices in Broward and commented anonymously fearing retaliation. “It’s the same names over and over. Clearly from court records what’s on the documents are stamps. That’s the evidence right there.”

Laura Wagner

Consumer activist Laura Wagner executive director of FHL drew a connection between the predatory mortgage lending that fueled the 2008 economic meltdown and current practices.

“The banks got caught buying subprime loans at a discount. They made a bet on it and then they realized they made a bad bet but it was a whole lot of money” she said.

Now the banks are using all available means including robo-signing and other abusive tactics to tap into the enormous value of outstanding mortgage loans according to Wagner. “So they want everyone to turn a blind eye to it.”

Little media regulatory scrutiny

The report states “The banks’ reckless greed left millions of properties with mortgages and promissory notes corrupted and the chain of title on those properties broken putting trial judges in the uncomfortable position of either taking the banking industry to task for these forged documents or kicking a family out of their home.

“Unfortunately with little scrutiny from the media legislators or regulators our court system has heavily favored the latter.”

FHL researchers looked at foreclosure complaints filed in Broward and Miami-Dade state courts in 2019 and found 369 with one of a handful of names stamped on the endorsement line. Gundersen handled 217 of the cases in Broward closed 126 of them and never once ruled for a defendant homeowner.

Consistent with the numbers Gundersen treats bank lawyers much more courteously than homeowners’ lawyers who challenge suspicious documents according to the report. It describes how she sometimes orders boat-rocking defense lawyers to pay their wealthy adversaries’ attorney fees.

She doesn’t conduct foreclosure trials but oversees pre-trial maneuvers and then sends a relatively few cases to Senior Judge Barry Stone for trial. “I respect him and like him and he actually tries to follow the law” the anonymous Broward defense lawyer said.

The problem is that Gundersen skews discovery and other preliminary matters toward the banks the lawyer said. “You have to deal with her first and she’s awful to borrowers’ counsel.” No one knows how many arguable defenses Gundersen derails so that they never reach Stone.

JQC investigation of Gundersen?

The FHL report says in April alone Gundersen disqualified herself 19 times when she was accused of pro-bank bias. It says homeowners complained about her to the Judicial Qualifications Commission which investigates judges for ethics violations.

Confidentiality rules prevent Florida Bulldog from verifying the claim that the JQC is reviewing Gundersen’s actions.

Broward Chief Judge Jack Tuter speaking for the court and Gundersen responded to the FHL report. He did not address criticisms of her attitude and approach.

Broward Chief Judge Jack Tuter

Tuter said he’s unaware of any problems involving questionable mortgage paperwork but “this issue did arise some years ago during the foreclosure crisis. Several opinions from the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach regarding the trustworthiness of records custodians helped to give clarity to what judges could consider.

“I have every confidence Judge Gundersen is following that line of cases and if this is a significant issue again we would hope the Fourth District would once again render decisions if we are not getting this right” he said in a statement.

FHL also reviewed records in Miami-Dade Circuit Court where foreclosure cases are blind-filed and assigned to whichever civil division judge’s name comes up rather than going to a designated foreclosure judge.

The researchers found that since Jan. 1 2019 310 Miami-Dade houses with robo-signed endorsements were sold at auction — 21 of them during the pandemic according to the report.

The Bruce Jacobs problem

Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jennifer Bailey who heads the court’s civil division responded with this statement: “In each case where a house was sold a presiding judge reviewed the evidence in the case and entered judgment after which a foreclosure sale is set. If a party disagreed with the judgment and felt that the judgment was entered in error the remedy is an appeal.

“To our knowledge no error was demonstrated in any case that went to sale” Bailey said in her statement.

Bruce Jacobs

Miami-Dade judges who look to the Third District Court of Appeal for guidance on how to deal with foreclosure fraud may see the Bruce Jacobs problem instead.

Jacobs the Miami lawyer who represents Julie Nicolas in Butchko’s high-profile case has made it his mission to expose any loan-servicing flaws that hurt his foreclosure defense clients. He has accused Gundersen and other judges of pro-bank bias and fought to disqualify them from hearing his cases.

The organized Bar doesn’t like Jacobs’ confrontational style and may be on the verge of silencing him. In an ethics hearing Jacobs was found guilty of impugning the integrity of the courts; the referee will send a punishment recommendation to the Florida Supreme Court this month.

Conduct ‘beyond the pale’

Akerman the law firm that opposes Jacobs in the Nicolas case convinced the Third District to pause trial court proceedings while the firm attacks Butchko and her contempt order. Akerman lawyers were quick to note the fact that Third District judges have twice accused Jacobs of ethics violations.

This passage from the court’s 2018 opinion in Aquasol Condo Assn. vs. HSBC Bank suggests the judges will not listen dispassionately to his arguments in the Nicolas case:

“Mr. Jacobs’ conduct … violated not only the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar and the Rules of Appellate Procedure but the most elementary norms of civility and professionalism.

“While judges and attorneys over the course of their career are subjected to isolated instances of incivility the instant misconduct is beyond the pale different not simply in degree but in kind. It is egregious misconduct which can be neither excused nor ignored.”

One has to wonder if the outraged response to Jacobs’ combative approach obscures his message: Mortgage banks are using abusive and illegal tactics to separate homeowners from their homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA3LTA1L3pvbHRhbi1wb3pzYXItc2Vlcy1hLTEtdHJpbGxpb24tcHJvYmxlbS1mb3ItbW9uZXktbWFya2V0cy1haGVhZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zoltan Pozsar Sees a $1 Trillion Problem for Money Markets Ahead,"An explosive mix of excess cash sloshing in the financial system ongoing quantitative easing and a looming debt ceiling deadline could combine to create a headache for major money markets according to Zoltan Pozsar.



The Credit Suisse Group AG strategist and long-time Odd Lots guest has earned a reputation for predicting the repo madness of late 2019 and is once again forecasting volatility in a key funding market. At issue is the amount of money that could flow into the Federal Reserve’s reverse repurchase facility (RRP) as money market funds and banks reshuffle their existing holdings to take advantage of a recent increase in interest.



The Fed surprised the market last month by tweaking interest paid on the RRP from nothing to 5 basis points a move that’s been luring billions of dollars into a facility intended to help the central bank keep a floor under interest rates. Already Pozsar estimates that usage of the facility has jumped by $300 billion since the RRP rate hike as money market funds dump lower-yielding T-bills in favor of parking cash at the RRP.



Now he sees the possibility of more money flowing in:

In other words Pozsar argues that money market funds are incentivized to rotate out of Treasury bills and into the newly-lucrative RRP potentially leaving billions of dollars worth of bills that the market will need to absorb thereby draining reserves from the banking system.



So far that hasn’t been too much of a problem with shorter-term investors keen to snap up bills ahead of an expected crunch in supply. A reinstatement of the debt ceiling which was suspended during the depths of the pandemic is expected to hit supply as the Treasury will have to slash its balance at the Fed to $400 billion before July 31.



But ongoing QE from the Fed ($250 billion in the next two months) will leave some $400 billion that still needs to be drained according to Pozsar’s estimates. That could lead to market weirdness as banks retool their balance sheets:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8wMy91cy81MC1iaWxsaW9uLW1pc3Rha2VubHktZGVwb3NpdGVkLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC1sb3Vpc2lhbmEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvdXMvNTAtYmlsbGlvbi1taXN0YWtlbmx5LWRlcG9zaXRlZC1iYW5rLWFjY291bnQtbG91aXNpYW5h?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A bank accidentally deposited $50 billion into a Louisiana family's account,"CNN —

For four days Darren James and his family were multibillionaires.

The real estate agent from Baton Rouge Louisiana and his wife were doing a routine check on their finances last Saturday when they noticed $50 billion had been mistakenly deposited into their Chase Bank account.

“That’s not like a one zero error or a two zero error that’s somebody that fell asleep on the keyboard error” James joked. “I was excited for sure. Really surprised how it got there and wondered if I had a rich uncle that gave it to me.”

But to his disappointment it wasn’t an inheritance – just an incredibly unusual error.

Chase Bank restored the family’s account to its correct balance on Tuesday James said.

“We’re still trying to figure out what happened why it happened how it happened but we know we aren’t the only ones this happened to” he told CNN. “The concern is whether my account was compromised and the bank hasn’t even called me. We haven’t heard anything from anyone.”

Chase Bank acknowledged the mistake to CNN but gave a different timeline for when it was fixed.

“We had a technical glitch a couple weeks ago impacting a limited number of accounts. The issue was resolved one day later and all accounts are showing accurate balances” Chase Bank spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus told CNN.

People who spend money mistakenly deposited into their bank accounts can be made to return the funds pay fees and even be charged with crimes. In 2019 a Pennsylvania couple faced felony theft charges after their bank accidentally deposited $120000 into their account and the couple spent most of it instead of contacting the bank police said.

But James said he never considered spending any of the money.

“My moral compass only goes one way and that’s the correct way” he said. “There’s a big difference between morality and legality. Honesty and good moral character immediately kicked in we can’t do anything with the money. I didn’t earn it it’s not ours to spend.”

Still he quipped: “Unless it was a rich uncle or one of those emails I probably responded to from a Saudi Arabian prince who promised to give me $50 billion that’s a different story.”

James said if the family was able to keep the money they would have tried to “bless” others in need.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LWRvLWJhbmstc3RvY2tzLXBlcmZvcm0td2hlbi1pbmZsYXRpb24tYW5kLXJlY2Vzc2lvbnMtaGl0LTIwMjEtMDctMDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Do Bank Stocks Perform When Inflation and Recessions Hit?,"Inflation is at its highest level in about three decades and while some experts think that's a temporary surge others aren't so sure. And there's considerable fear among investors that we could see a recession in the not-too-distant future if interest rates rise and consumer spending slows. So where should you put your money to prepare?

In this Fool Live video clip recorded on June 21 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP and Industry Focus host Jason Moser discuss how bank stocks typically perform in inflationary environments as well as during recessions.

10 stocks we like better than Bank of America

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7 2021

Matt Frankel: TMF New Fool says ""What's the best kind of investment that I can make to hedge myself against inflation and/or recession? Are financial stocks a good way to go about it? I'm thinking Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Chase (NYSE: JPM) Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). Also is it a good time to invest in these stocks or are they too expensive right now?""

No one can tell you if they're too expensive right now. If you ask Jason and I what bank stocks are going to do over the next couple of weeks you'll get two different answers and they'll probably both be wrong. I see a piano I don't see a crystal ball back behind Jason. But generally speaking financial stocks are good ways to hedge against inflation if inflation doesn't get out of control.

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If inflation gets to the point where the Fed has to raise rates a few times that usually trickles down into higher rates on mortgages credit cards auto loans things like that for the banks. All three of the ones you mentioned have big credit card operations which are directly tied to the federal funds rate.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If the Fed hikes rates by 50 basis points credit card interest rates go by exactly 50 basis points. They make more money during mildly inflationary environments not when inflation gets out of control and people can't afford things and there's a lot of uncertainty. Then consumer demand falls and it's not good. It's really a fine line but banks tend to do well in mildly inflationary environments.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: As far as recessions go banks are bad investments. Banks are very cyclical in that sense in terms of -- you'll see housing demand drop you'll see auto loan demand drop dramatically. You'll see defaults increase dramatically during recessions. Banks can be bad investments during recessions which is why they plunged so badly during the first part of the COVID pandemic. A lot of those normal recessionary things like lower loan demand like higher defaults -- people feared that those are really going to hit it. In terms of inflation I would say yes but with a caveat. Recession I would say financials are a no. If you want recession-proof -- utility things that people will buy no matter what the economy is doing Apple.

Moser: What do you think about insurance in a time like that?

Frankel: Sure. Yeah. One of the reason Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) works in a recessionary environment. Geico -- people keep paying their auto insurance no matter what.

Frankel: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- people buy their iPhones no matter what the economy is doing.

Moser: Yeah. You're right. They do. The neat thing is they've come up with creative ways to finance those purchases. Like it's not just ""OK pay me $950 or pay me $1100.""

Frankel: Right. They are going to keep innovating with that.

Moser: Yeah exactly.

Frankel: Anything that sells things at a discounted nature is a good thing in a recession. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) -- Walmart was one of the very few stocks that actually went up in 2008 and it's because in tough times Walmart still has its loyal customer base that goes there because they have lower prices. But then people who normally shop at higher-end grocery stores who need to cut back will go to Walmart in tougher times. So they actually benefit in tougher times. Dollar stores are another one. Convenience stores things like that that people need -- those can actually benefit during tough times. But banks are not the best during recessions.

Broward Circuit Judge Andrea Gundersen who runs the court’s foreclosure docket often rules for banks and against homeowners even when the banks use sketchy documents a consumer watchdog charges in a recent report.

Released in May the report got scant attention until Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beatrice Butchko took the dramatic step of holding Bank of America the Bank of New York Mellon and their lawyer in contempt for failing to answer questions about possible fraud in a foreclosure case.

The Third District Court of Appeal in Miami tabled the case. If the banks eventually win nurse Julie Nicolas will lose her North Miami Beach home of nearly 30 years.

Broward foreclosure Judge Andrea Gundersen

The report by the nonprofit Floridians for Honest Lending (FHL) targets robo-signing the discredited and illegal practice of treating foreclosure papers like assembly line goods.

Endorsements that establish the lender’s legal right to foreclose are stamped and processed robotically. The “signer” a bank executive could not possibly know what’s in the papers and vouch for their validity as is legally required.

In 2012 findings of mortgage loan misconduct including robo-signing were supposedly resolved with a $25-billion settlement between the five biggest mortgage servicers and on the other side 49 state attorneys general and the Justice Department.

Robo-signing never ended

The next year a dozen U.S. mortgage lenders most prominently Bank of America and its subsidiary Countrywide Financial agreed to end robo-signing as part of a $9.3-billion settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

But the FHL report based on 2019-2020 South Florida court records shows that illegal robo-signing persists. For example stacks of mortgage loans originated by the notorious Countrywide bear the signatures of three bank executives–if the papers were legit a trio that could boast of superhuman powers.

“It’s the same shit now” said a foreclosure defense lawyer who practices in Broward and commented anonymously fearing retaliation. “It’s the same names over and over. Clearly from court records what’s on the documents are stamps. That’s the evidence right there.”

Laura Wagner

Consumer activist Laura Wagner executive director of FHL drew a connection between the predatory mortgage lending that fueled the 2008 economic meltdown and current practices.

“The banks got caught buying subprime loans at a discount. They made a bet on it and then they realized they made a bad bet but it was a whole lot of money” she said.

Now the banks are using all available means including robo-signing and other abusive tactics to tap into the enormous value of outstanding mortgage loans according to Wagner. “So they want everyone to turn a blind eye to it.”

Little media regulatory scrutiny

The report states “The banks’ reckless greed left millions of properties with mortgages and promissory notes corrupted and the chain of title on those properties broken putting trial judges in the uncomfortable position of either taking the banking industry to task for these forged documents or kicking a family out of their home.

“Unfortunately with little scrutiny from the media legislators or regulators our court system has heavily favored the latter.”

FHL researchers looked at foreclosure complaints filed in Broward and Miami-Dade state courts in 2019 and found 369 with one of a handful of names stamped on the endorsement line. Gundersen handled 217 of the cases in Broward closed 126 of them and never once ruled for a defendant homeowner.

Consistent with the numbers Gundersen treats bank lawyers much more courteously than homeowners’ lawyers who challenge suspicious documents according to the report. It describes how she sometimes orders boat-rocking defense lawyers to pay their wealthy adversaries’ attorney fees.

She doesn’t conduct foreclosure trials but oversees pre-trial maneuvers and then sends a relatively few cases to Senior Judge Barry Stone for trial. “I respect him and like him and he actually tries to follow the law” the anonymous Broward defense lawyer said.

The problem is that Gundersen skews discovery and other preliminary matters toward the banks the lawyer said. “You have to deal with her first and she’s awful to borrowers’ counsel.” No one knows how many arguable defenses Gundersen derails so that they never reach Stone.

JQC investigation of Gundersen?

The FHL report says in April alone Gundersen disqualified herself 19 times when she was accused of pro-bank bias. It says homeowners complained about her to the Judicial Qualifications Commission which investigates judges for ethics violations.

Confidentiality rules prevent Florida Bulldog from verifying the claim that the JQC is reviewing Gundersen’s actions.

Broward Chief Judge Jack Tuter speaking for the court and Gundersen responded to the FHL report. He did not address criticisms of her attitude and approach.

Broward Chief Judge Jack Tuter

Tuter said he’s unaware of any problems involving questionable mortgage paperwork but “this issue did arise some years ago during the foreclosure crisis. Several opinions from the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach regarding the trustworthiness of records custodians helped to give clarity to what judges could consider.

“I have every confidence Judge Gundersen is following that line of cases and if this is a significant issue again we would hope the Fourth District would once again render decisions if we are not getting this right” he said in a statement.

FHL also reviewed records in Miami-Dade Circuit Court where foreclosure cases are blind-filed and assigned to whichever civil division judge’s name comes up rather than going to a designated foreclosure judge.

The researchers found that since Jan. 1 2019 310 Miami-Dade houses with robo-signed endorsements were sold at auction — 21 of them during the pandemic according to the report.

The Bruce Jacobs problem

Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jennifer Bailey who heads the court’s civil division responded with this statement: “In each case where a house was sold a presiding judge reviewed the evidence in the case and entered judgment after which a foreclosure sale is set. If a party disagreed with the judgment and felt that the judgment was entered in error the remedy is an appeal.

“To our knowledge no error was demonstrated in any case that went to sale” Bailey said in her statement.

Bruce Jacobs

Miami-Dade judges who look to the Third District Court of Appeal for guidance on how to deal with foreclosure fraud may see the Bruce Jacobs problem instead.

Jacobs the Miami lawyer who represents Julie Nicolas in Butchko’s high-profile case has made it his mission to expose any loan-servicing flaws that hurt his foreclosure defense clients. He has accused Gundersen and other judges of pro-bank bias and fought to disqualify them from hearing his cases.

The organized Bar doesn’t like Jacobs’ confrontational style and may be on the verge of silencing him. In an ethics hearing Jacobs was found guilty of impugning the integrity of the courts; the referee will send a punishment recommendation to the Florida Supreme Court this month.

Conduct ‘beyond the pale’

Akerman the law firm that opposes Jacobs in the Nicolas case convinced the Third District to pause trial court proceedings while the firm attacks Butchko and her contempt order. Akerman lawyers were quick to note the fact that Third District judges have twice accused Jacobs of ethics violations.

This passage from the court’s 2018 opinion in Aquasol Condo Assn. vs. HSBC Bank suggests the judges will not listen dispassionately to his arguments in the Nicolas case:

“Mr. Jacobs’ conduct … violated not only the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar and the Rules of Appellate Procedure but the most elementary norms of civility and professionalism.

“While judges and attorneys over the course of their career are subjected to isolated instances of incivility the instant misconduct is beyond the pale different not simply in degree but in kind. It is egregious misconduct which can be neither excused nor ignored.”

One has to wonder if the outraged response to Jacobs’ combative approach obscures his message: Mortgage banks are using abusive and illegal tactics to separate homeowners from their homes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

Warren Buffett has donated about $2 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock to each of his three children's foundations over the past 15 years. Peter Buffett his youngest child has been using some of those funds to revitalize the city of Kingston New York he told The Wall Street Journal in a recent interview.

Buffett a billionaire investor and Berkshire's CEO pledged in 2006 to give more than 99% of his fortune to good causes. He reached the halfway point towards that goal last month helped by his contribution of 14 million ""B"" shares to Peter's NoVo foundation so far. Those shares would be worth nearly $4 billion today and represent the majority of the 17.5 million shares he's earmarked for his son's organization.

Peter has used his father's contributions to buy $13 million of farmland near Kingston and turn it into a local agricultural hub The Journal reported. He has also financed a festival where artists could swap their pieces for healthcare purchased an old Honda dealership and converted it into a home for a local food cooperative and turned a local radio station into an ad-free non-profit community broadcaster the newspaper said.

NoVo has also worked on other causes such as helping indigenous people and victims of domestic abuse and supporting affordable-housing projects. Peter a vocal critic of capitalism's shortcomings and a strong believer in workers' rights and community work wants Kingston to exemplify a more compassionate form of capitalism he told The Journal.

Peter and his father disagree on some subjects but the Berkshire chief told The Journal that he doesn't support ""unrestrained capitalism"" and he and his son are ""on the same page on the important things."" Indeed Peter told The Journal that he deeply respects his father's work and embraces his philosophy of doing something you love for a living or ""tap dancing to work.""

Beyond his philanthropic work Peter is best known as an Emmy-winning musician who missed out on an enormous fortune. When he turned 19 in 1977 he received $90000 worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock as his inheritance according to CNBC.

In a letter published June 23 Buffett – who is known for his philanthropy – advised rich families not to leave their children too much inheritance.

""Dynastic behavior is less the norm here than in most countries and its appeal will likely diminish"" Buffett wrote. ""After much observation of super-wealthy families here’s my recommendation: Leave the children enough so that they can do anything but not enough that they can do nothing.""

Timothy McGrath managing partner at investment advisory firm Riverpoint Wealth Management told FOX Business that he has observed a shift away from creating dynastic wealth among the country’s super rich.

""This is a newer trend amongst this group where the focus is on giving a large portion of their wealth away during their lifetimes or at death"" McGrath said.

Marianela Collado a financial planner at wealth management firm Tobias Financial Advisors told FOX Business that she has clients who worry about leaving too much to their children for a number of reasons including work ethic family values and family relationships.

She also noted that many wealth creators came to this country and worked to build their lifestyles. These individuals consequently worry about taking that same opportunity away from their children.

WARREN BUFFETT DETAILS TAX SAVINGS ON MASSIVE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

However among clients who McGrath would consider ""high net worth"" but not billionaires he hasn’t observed the same dramatic shift in estate planning strategies.

""Client preferences have remained similar where some clients prefer to pass along as much wealth as possible to their heirs while others have a limit on how much they would want to pass to heirs with the rest of their wealth being earmarked for charity"" McGrath said. ""We also see that client’s mindsets change as their wealth grows where at lower levels they are more focused on passing assets to their families and as assets continue to grow above their family’s needs they become more focused on providing additional dollars to causes they are passionate about.""

Collado said that all of her clients are different and have different values but among many giving back to their communities is a priority.

""It’s not just ‘does this go to Uncle Sam or my kids they’re also looking to make a difference in their communities"" she said.

Buffett announced last week that he was halfway to his goal of distributing more than 99% of his net worth to charity.

His net worth according to Forbes is $101 billion.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates like Warren Buffett is another ultra-rich philanthropist who believes in leaving his children enough – but not too much of his fortune.

It has been reported that the Gates’ intend to leave each of their three children $10 million.

""I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them"" Gates has said.

The Australian rapper attracted widespread criticism on social media following the release of her music video for “I Am the Stripclub” on Thursday (1 July).

In it Azalea – real name Amethyst Amelia Kelly – is seen wearing a black wig and face makeup that appears to be several shades darker than her usually fair complexion.

The video led to many people on social media accusing the 33-year-old of “Blackfishing” a term used to describe when someone alters their looks – for example through hairstyling and makeup – to appear either Black or mixed-race.

One fan drew the musician’s attention to the backlash writing on Twitter: “people are saying that you are black fishing and making up this fake narrative can you clear them up please because people are taking it too far and running with that lie.”

The 33-year-old responded to the fan yesterday (3 July) stating: “I don’t care… f*** those ppl babe lol.”

Responding to another fan who said: “I hope by those ppl u mean haters cuz they’re coming” the singer wrote: “I mean anyone online trying to reach and create an issue because I wore a black wig. Don’t even start.”

“I’m the same colour as I always am just in a dimly lit room with red lights” she wrote. “It’s the same makeup from a Smokey eye and different wig. Just ignore them who cares? Let em talk.”

I’m the same color as I always am just in a dimly lit room with red lights.

It’s the same makeup from every other part of the video just with a Smokey eye and different wig.

Just ignore them who cares?

Yup It’s darkly lit because it’s supposed to look like a nightclub 😹🤷‍♀️ ppl online are crazy. — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) July 2 2021

The award-winning artist later tweeted: “I don’t care about something that ridiculous and baseless. I’m wearing a shade 6 in armani foundation it’s the same shade I’ve worn for the last 3 years.

“It’s the same shade in every music video since sally Walker. Suddenly I wear a black wig in a club scene & its an issue.”

Azalea’s makeup artist defended the artist writing on Twitter: “She literally wore the same face makeup during every scene of the video… i would know i did it. Its a shade 6 from armani luminous silk (a light/medium olive undertone shade if you’re curious.)”

This is not the first time Azalea has been criticised for appropriating Black culture with many people accusing her of putting on a “blaccent” when she raps.

In a Complex 2013 interview the musician addressed the controversy stating that it would “feel weird” if she rapped in her native Australian accent.

“If you’re mad about it and you’re a Black person trying to start a rap career and give it a go too” she said. “Or maybe if you’re Black  starting singing like a country singer and be a white person. I don’t know. Why is it such a big deal?”

American billionaire Warren Buffett recently said that he believes that another pandemic was on the horizon which could be worse than that of COVID-19. In an interview with CNBC’s Buffett & Munger: A Wealth of Wisdom’ show the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said that even though these situations are manageable the world as a whole is not prepared for mass-scale prevention. He was quoted as saying “there will be another pandemic. We know that there is a nuclear chemical biological and now cyber threat. Each of them has dire possibilities…It doesn’t seem like it’s something that society is fully prepared to deal with”.

Buffett who ranks ninth in the Forbes billionaire ranking further went on to say that the main lesson coronavirus has taught him is that the world is not prepared to deal with emergency situations. He said that society has a hard time preparing for remote situations which are bound to happen sooner or later. He also voiced his views on the uneven impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on businesses as smaller businesses took the brunt of the blow.

The billionaire affirmed that the economic consequences of COVID-19 are falling disproportionately. He noted that many hundreds of thousands or millions of small businesses have been hurt terribly. Buffett said that the economic impact has been this “extremely uneven” and added that most of the big companies have “overwhelmingly done fine”. He noted that the pandemic ""is not over"" but that most companies are doing well.

Buffett's financial uncertainty

Further Buffett referred to the automotive companies and said that the virus was ""a fabulous success that they did not anticipate"". He recalled that the sector has registered record profits thanks to the reopening and reduction in supply derived from chip storage. It is worth noting that according to a report by CNBC with the shutdown of factories and global shortages of semiconductors the automakers and dealers saw a tremendous surge.

Buffett even made it clear that he also faced financial uncertainty of his own as no one was sure what was going to happen to his airlines BNSF Railway and NetJets in terms of demand. However despite all the uncertainty and chaos Buffett was determined to shift the focus to the industry and helping other companies stay afloat so that they did not have to rely on the government for aid. ""We remind them that they had a rich brother"" said the millionaire.

One of our favorite electric ranges the Samsung NE59J7850WS is currently on sale from $1799 to $1399 grabbing you an impressive $700 in savings. We liked this 5.9-cubic pick for its split-cavity design which allows you to cook two different meals at two different temperatures at the same time. In short? It will be perfect for when you’re caught preparing a large feast for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

If you’re willing to shell out a little more cash you’ll love the Electrolux EI30EF45QS which was awarded the honor of being our favorite electric range on the market.

We adored the sleek countertop which includes five burners to cover a wide range of temperatures—anywhere from 85 degrees Fahrenheit to 770 degrees Fahrenheit.

Our all-time favorite top-load washer the GE GTW720BSNWS is currently on sale at Best Buy down from $764.99 to $699.99 saving you $65. We loved its normal cycle which lasted just 45 minutes and did an even better job at cleaning clothes than the deep cleaning cycle did. This laundry essential comes packed with features too though it was surprisingly easy to use. Not to mention the added Tide Pod dispenser stain removal guide and sanitize options allowed this machine to handle any kind of laundry we threw at it. Both the normal and delicate options were also gentle on clothes so we never had to worry about wear and tear.

Listed below are some of our favorite washers with options available for every budget.

Dryers

A good washer needs an equally effective dryer. Lucky for you our team has tested a ton of different brands and options—and some of our favorites are on sale.

It was able to remove 100% of water from our clothes in just 55 minutes in our tests making it quicker than the average one hour and eleven minutes other machines offer. If you're in a rush you can also hit the 15-minute quick-dry cycle which got our clothes about 65% dry (other dryers take 27 minutes to hit the same mark).

The freezer also maintained a steady temperature at just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit which helps to prevent freezer burn. It’s also enabled with Bosch Home Connect so you can regulate the refrigerator temperatures adjust lighting or run diagnostics all from your smartphone.

The average price of a used car has skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic according to data from automotive resource site Edmunds.

However its latest option freshly released to the US market is a little less sober: Navy. This new shade is available on Best Buy's website as an unlocked or Verizon device.

4 Reviews

The vast majority of Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra units sold through retail stores might ship in its Phantom Black colorway although its Gray (and Silver if the company in question is lucky) equivalents might also be on the cards. However it is now available in a new shade that might interest some wavering potential customers: Navy.

The premium 108MP main camera-toting Samsung phone is now listed on Best Buy's website in this color. There is also a Phantom Navy style that was only available via the OEM's own website at the Galaxy S21 Ultra's launch; however the ""new"" color appears to vary in that it lacks the carbon-fiber accent for the flagship's epic camera hump that graces the initially exclusive marketing theme.

Best Buy now stocks the 'plain' Navy S21 Ultra as either carrier-unlocked or Verizon-specific Snapdragon 888-powered 8GB RAM/128GB internal storage SKUs. They are priced at US$999.99 for the former or $100 extra for the latter. This is $200 or $100 off the phones' starting prices.

Alternatively buy an unlocked S21 Ultra on Amazon for $1000 (albeit without Navy options)"

The Quirk Creek plant is connected to the Plains Midstream Pipeline by a company-owned 34-mile pipeline capable of transporting natural gas to market in Fort Saskatchewan Alberta as well as the TC Energy Gas Transmission Pipeline with routing through Southern Alberta the interior of British Columbia and the Western United States terminating in the Sacramento/San Francisco.

Zoltan Nagy Chief Executive Officer of Black Rock commented on the announcement “Caledonian Midstream is a great fit for Black Rock. Demand for natural gas continues to grow in Alberta and across North America and the Quirk Creek property is perfectly situated to service those markets. Current production levels are good but our engineers have looked at the property’s historical production records and analysed recent reserve evaluations and I am confident we have the expertise technology and resources to materially increase production and in turn the cash flow of the site.”

In Asia excluding Japan managed sustainable fund assets have almost tripled to US$36.7 billion in March 2021 from a year earlier.

Assets focused on companies that strive to protect the environment promote good social values and adhere to good corporate governance or ESG in short have climbed in four straight quarters according to fund tracker Morningstar. They amounted to US$185 billion in the first quarter this year driving the total size to almost US$2 trillion globally.

Sustainable and responsible investing is gaining momentum globally. The money flowing into funds that invest on such non-traditional criteria has eclipsed one record after another in recent years yielding emphatic returns in some cases for investors along the way.

Here’s what asset owners need to know about ESG investing and its processes.

Does ESG investing enhance returns for investors?

Such dedication has paid off especially for smaller funds based on studies by universities and investment banks.

Some 19 of 26 ESG-focused exchange-traded funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index in the 12 months since March 5 2020 shortly before the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic S&P Global Ratings said in a report last month. It showed how some smaller ETFs outperformed those managed by titans like BlackRock and Vanguard.

In Hong Kong the Securities and Futures Commission has published a table of 56 green or ESG funds that meet its criteria and thus qualify to be marketed as “sustainable” funds to investors. The results among Hong Kong-listed stocks  however have been less than encouraging.

What strategies do fund managers use to allocate funds for ESG investing?

Many traditional funds use the exclusion method to filter companies in undesired sectors from their portfolios. They include tobacco and casinos and those stained by corruption and labour rights abuses.

ESG investing has gained ascendancy as society’s expectations on such ethical issues have increased globally. Tougher official regulations also mean companies performing poorly on these issues constantly face risks of penalty or loss of business.

Investors pushing for higher standards on climate change  pollution and labour practices have demanded their money managers to incorporate such issues into their fund allocation processes. Many global fund houses have now integrated ESG issues into the investment processes.

How is ESG performance assessed by external ratings providers?

Major ESG ratings providers include MSCI S&P Global Ratings Sustainalytics Moody’s ESG Solutions and Refinitiv. They typically rate thousands of companies on which they collect data from official filings news reports and market surveys.

There are also niche players like MioTech which focus on Chinese firms and California-based physical climate risks provider known as Four Twenty Seven part of Moody's ESG Solutions. Most of them employ artificial intelligence technology to automate data collection and calculations. Moody’s Investors Service also separately provides ESG ratings to describe how sustainability considerations affect their creditworthiness.

BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager with US$9 trillion runs a risk management platform called Aladdin. It gives wealth managers insurers and corporate treasurers access to ESG databases from several providers and allows them to customise their own analysis.

How does ESG scoring work?

Within each pillar of ESG factors multiple metrics are typically assigned different weightings for companies in different sectors.

The ratings providers will score a company for each metric within the three ESG pillars. They are later summed up for an overall score and assigned a grade akin to credit-rating scales.

For example MSCI ranks a company’s ESG performance based on seven colour-coded ranges from AAA for industry leaders to CCC for laggards. Miotech assesses companies based on a 12-step ranking from the best at AAA to the worst at D while Sustainalytics grades them based on five risk levels from negligible to severe.

What do fund managers do with external ESG scores?

ESG scores and ratings are only for reference and are just the start of the evaluation process. While they are helpful for peer comparison and investing guidance the learning process will take time for investors and money managers alike.

“It is very difficult to reduce the complexities of all the ESG factors of a business to a single number or letter although such scores [and grading] do help us to benchmark a company against its peers” said William Ng an ESG engagement analyst at HSBC Asset Management. “What is more important is how material ESG factors impact a company’s capital allocation supply chain business strategy earnings and capital market valuations.”

To bridge the knowledge gap fund managers engage with companies to find out key information that has big implications on their long term sustainability outlook. Analysts at Fidelity International for example conduct both fundamental and ESG analysis in their global stock coverage.

“ESG analysis needs to be fundamental and needs to be dealt with via engagement with the companies” said Gabriel Wilson-Otto sustainability investing director at Fidelity. “We need to be much more granular to make sure we get the more insightful set of issues that we are trying to address.”

How do fund managers use ESG data?

Global asset management firms typically collect thousands of ESG scores from multiple providers and use their own methodologies to pick the metrics most relevant to each industry’s financial performance.

How they narrow down industries into sub-sectors for customising their ESG investing models will differ in complexity. HSBC splits the investible universe into 24 industries while Fidelity breaks it down to 99 sectors and BNP Asset Management classifies them into 20 sectors.

Fund managers typically do not place much attention to the ESG scores from the data providers. Instead they feed raw ESG data into their proprietary models to supplement other financial performance metrics to guide their investment decisions.

“It is okay to use third-party data for reporting or measuring purposes” said Tomomi Shimada lead strategist on Asia-Pacific sustainable investing at JP Morgan Asset Management. “But for research and actually making an informed investment decision we want it to be driven by our own framework.”

The firm prefers forward-looking data such as annual changes in carbon footprint management’s commitment against country-level goals as well as those committed by nations under the Paris Agreement  Shimada added.

For certain the ESG analysis process is not a straightforward numeric exercise or an exact science as the process is subject to a lot of discretionary elements and fine-tuning along the way.

“For companies with weak ESG scores we can still invest in them” said Paul Milon head of stewardship in Asia-Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “But this must be subject to additional ESG analysis and engagement with the firms to make sure there are no red flags.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtZXhpdHMtZ3VyYmlyLWdyZXdhbC13aGl0LW1heW8tc2FtYW50aGEtdG9ydG9yYS0yMDIxLTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Hires and Exits: Gurbir Grewal Whit Mayo Samantha Tortora,"Must-know promotions exits and hires at firms like KKR Morgan Stanley and BlackRock

A CLASSIC Premier Minor Hurling Championship clash saw Na Piarsaigh defeat Blackrock with a late flurry of scores to end a titanic battle.

There were many stars on both sides but the performance of Na Piarsaigh’s Ross O’Sullivan deserves a special mention as he accumulated 2-11 of his side’s tally.

The Rockies have now lost two games in the group while the Barrs have two victories. Bride and Na Piarsaigh have a win apiece so will vie for a semi-final spot when the final round of games take place in August.

In a do-or-die game for each side both teams began at a frantic pace with Na Piarsaigh’s Ross O’Sullivan and John O’Sullivan exchanging points in the opening three minutes.

The shooting from both sides was a little wayward but the hurling was crisp and the Farranree side edged ahead with points from Michael Sheehan and O’Sullivan.

The Rockies were unfazed and continued to win the majority of dirty ball and consecutive long-range points tied the game in the 14th minute just before the water-break.

O’Sullivan missed two scoreable frees for Na Piarsaigh but he got his confidence back when striking over a classy point on the restart.

Na Piarsaigh were now in ascendancy and they increased their lead to three but some poor defending in the 23rd minute allowed the Rockies full-forward Mikey O’Connell guide a tame shot to the empty net.

Na Piarsaigh responded in style and O’Sullivan showed a lovely touch when billowing the back of the net five minutes from the interval.

In added time a terrific run by O’Sullivan saw him fire a pinpoint pass to Sheehan and despite hitting a terrific shot the Rockies goalkeeper Eoin Coughlan produced a stunning save.

Leading 1-7 to 1-5 at the break the northside club were the happier of the two sides as they now had a stiff breeze behind them for the second half.

Sheehan once again showed his class on the restart with a riveting run and shot that was once again superbly by Coughlan.

Although Na Piarsaigh were dominating the white flags the Rockies were dominating the colour green and consecutive goals from substitute Oliver McAdoo and O’Connell put them back in pole position.

In fairness to both sides they responded in style but the striking of O’Sullivan helped Na Piarsaigh command a one-point lead in the 43rd minute.

Piarsaigh’s coaching staff made a few alterations in defence following their disastrous start to the second half.

When the game hung in the balance the winning of the tie was their ability to hold Blackrock scoreless for 15 minutes.

Another Na Piarsaigh sweeping move saw the ball fall into the path of Scott Kelleher who showed no mercy to the Blackrock with a thunderous strike to the back of the net.

During the Rockies’ drought O’Sullivan showed sheer class with three unanswered points as Na Piarsaigh now had their tails up much to the delight of their small band of supporters.

In the closing minutes O’Sullivan completed a great day at the office when he got behind the Rockies defence to round the keeper and place his shot to the corner of the net.

The appointment of Seán Óg Ó hAilpín as coach to both the Piarsaigh minor hurling and football teams was a wise one and his influence was evident as the fitness of his players when the game hung in the balance proved crucial in their win.

Referee Cathal McAllister should be commended for his handling of this cracking game and Na Piarsaigh may yet have a say in the destiny of this championship.

The company recently signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Triathlon Batteries GmbH the largest German manufacturer of battery systems for industrial trucks to supply 3D printed battery cells with several 100MWh per year. In addition there are further LOIs with customers spanning marine applications e-motorcycles e-commercial vehicles and e-buses which in total have a combined value of approximately €184 million.

Blackstone Technology can produce batteries that optimally fill the installation spaces of industrial vehicles. These include for example modern forklifts. In the future the old installation space standards—battery troughs—will be used less and less in vehicle design. These new adapted battery formats that Blackstone Technology will provide through its proprietary production process will help vehicle designers optimise the space used and remove the need for battery troughs.

Desired energy density thickness of the battery cells and charging capabilities can all be optimized—depending on the application—by using Blackstone Technology’s 3D-printing proprietary process. This process known as Blackstone Pre-Life-Technology will offer customers levels of flexibility in vehicle design.

Today standardized and static cell and battery designs often limit the device or electric car being powered. However by Blackstone's own 3D-printing technology batteries can be manufactured in almost any shape and size which not only gives more room for design freedom but also helps to make optimum use of the available installation space plus it is very economical. Therefore in the future battery cells will again adapt to the ergonomic and practical shape of the products.

Blackstone Resources is a Swiss Holding Company with its legal domicile in Baar Kanton Zug and is concentrating on the battery technology and battery-metals market and offers direct exposure to the battery-technology revolution.

Presently Blackstone Technology is building up a production-line for small series of 3D printed batteries in Döbeln. The short-term production will be pouch-cells with the Blackstone Thick Layer Technology which allows a 20% higher density in lithium-ion cells.

His company Roc Nation has recently invested in Blackstone’s majority stake acquisition in Certified Collectibles Group.

Certified Collectibles Group (CCG) is a company that focuses on authenticating collectibles such as trading cards comic books magazines stamps banknotes and many more. The $500 million USD transaction saw additional investors such as Fanatics founder Michael Rubin NBA guard Andre Iguodala and Philadelphia 76ers basketball operations president Dary Morey join in the funding round.

Bloomberg which calls Blackstone the “world’s largest alternative investment firm” reportedly saw the company’s share rise 0.3 percent last week after the funding round. Blackstone’s acquisition of CCG is also expected to help the company increase its “digital presence add employees and branch CCG’s geographic reach.” According to Business Insider CCG has authenticated more than 62 million collectibles which has contirbuted to approximately $50 billion USD of the collectible market value. CCG’s authentication service competitors include Beckett and PSA.

In a recent press release CCG’s founder Mark Salzberg said “When I established CCG I had a vision that we would transform collectibles into an asset class that is trusted by collectors dealers and investors around the world. It has been incredible to be a part of this journey as we achieved and then exceeded these goals. I am excited to join with Blackstone as we enter the next phase of growth for CCG and the collectibles market.”

Sully flight

HONOLULU: The trouble started minutes after a Boeing Co 737 freighter lifted off from Honolulu for a nighttime cargo run to the nearby island of Maui.As the 46-year-old jet climbed at the start of the planned 24-minute trip Friday one of its engines cut out. The relatively routine failure turned tense as Transair Flight 810 began to lose altitude while its flight crew attempted to return for a landing according to a recording of air-traffic radio calls posted by LiveATC.net.“We’re gonna lose the other engine too.It’s running very hot” a pilot radioed. “We’re low on the speed. It doesn’t look good.”A controller at Daniel K Inouye International Airport then told the crew the airport fire department had been alerted.“You need to let the Coast Guard know” the pilot replied.Minutes later the controller said “It looks like they went down in the water.”That triggered a dramatic rescue off the coast of Oahu as two pilots who may have experienced a rare dual engine failure struggled to survive.The US Coast Guard located the 737 in a debris field at about 2:30am -- roughly 50 minutes after the initial alert.“We first saw a man waving waving his hand from the tail of the airplane” said Lieutenant Gleb Borovok a Coast Guard crewman on the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter that arrived on scene in an interview with Hawaii News Now. “Next we saw another man floating on a bed of cargo.”The rescuers initially focused on the pilot clinging to the packages said Borovok and Lieutenant Alex Mead who flew the chopper. But then the tail of the aircraft started to sink thrusting the man who had been perched there into the water. The helicopter deployed a swimmer and hoisted the Transair pilot aboard.The Transair aviator on the packages was picked up by a Honolulu Fire Department rescue boat amid seas of as high as five feet (1.52 meters) and winds of 17 miles per hour (27 kilometers per hour).Both aviators were injured and rushed to Honolulu’s Queen’s Medical Center. One of them who is 58 was in intensive care in critical condition according to Hawaii News Now. The other 50 was in serious condition with a “head injury and multiple lacerations” the news outlet said.The ill-fated Boeing 737-200 began its commercial life in 1975 hauling passengers for Pacific Western Airlines predating by decades the new Max passenger model that was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes. The emergency water landing off Hawaii marks the second time this year that an older 737 jet has been destroyed. In January a Sriwijaya Air passenger flight crashed off the coast of Indonesia killing all 62 people aboard the 737-500.The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of 10 investigators to the accident site in Hawaii. Transair said it was working with federal authorities to investigate the cause while its “most immediate concern is the care and recovery of our colleagues.”Boeing said it was in contact with safety officials as did Pratt & Whitney a division of Raytheon Technologies Corp which supplied the JT8D engines used by the 737-200.Boeing fell 1.3% to $236.68 at the close in New York. Raytheon climbed less than 1% to $86.70.Flight 810 branded as Transair and operated by Rhoades Aviation Inc took off for Kahului a little after 1:30am local time and climbed to around 2100 feet (640 meters) according to a track posted by Flightradar24.com.The aircraft made a right turn over the ocean and circled back toward the airport ditching in the water about 11 minutes later. The track provided by FlightRadar24 doesn’t show the normally smooth altitude and speeds of a typical flight suggesting the pilots may have been struggling to control the plane.In the air-traffic recording the controller initially tells the aircraft to “maintain 2000 if that’s the altitude you like” and asks for more details about their emergency.A pilot responded that “all that is good” and said he would provide the information in “a little bit.”But the situation quickly deteriorated during the short time they were aloft. Apparently responding to an alert in the tower that the flight was too low the controller asked “Are you able to climb at all?”“No negative” the pilot responded.After initially advising the plane to return to Honolulu telling them they were “cleared to land any runway” the controller told them Kalaeloa Airport was closer.“We’d like the closest airport runway please” one of the pilots responded.Two calls from air traffic control to the crew then apparently went unanswered.Engine failures that lead to the loss of a jet are extremely rare. The 737 like all twin-engine aircraft is designed to fly on a single turbofan if the other malfunctions and maintenance programs are designed to ensure that the same issue doesn’t occur on both engines at the same time.While it’s not clear what happened with the Transair plane  if the plane lost both power plants the potential causes could range from maintenance error to fuel problems or a miscue in how the pilots responded to the initial emergency.The reason the second engine may have overheated wasn’t clear. Flying on one engine shouldn’t cause undue strain on the functioning power plant said Jeffrey Guzzetti former chief of accident investigations at the FAA.Because dual engine failures are so unlikely investigators will want to look for some kind of common issue that could have played a role in each Guzzetti said.Jets are designed to be able to ditch in water and float for a period of time according to federal regulations. In 2009 a US Airways jet plowed into a flock of birds in New York and lost power in both engines -- the plane that pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger famously landed on the Hudson River.Pratt has produced more than 14000 of its JT8D engines since the turbine entered service on the Boeing 727 in 1964 according to the engine maker’s website. About 2400 are still in use.Transair began operations in 1982 and says it provides the longest-running all-cargo service in Hawaii. It specializes in inter-island transport between all major Hawaiian destinations according to its website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2JldHRlci1idXktYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Boeing vs. Airbus,"Comparing the investment cases for the two aviation giants.

If you are thinking of buying stock in airplane manufacturers like Airbus (EADSY 1.48%) or Boeing (BA 2.06%) at the moment you probably assume that commercial air flights will get back to 2019 levels around the 2023 timeframe. That's how many leading industry figures see matters developing.

Given that scenario it's likely that the demand for new airplanes will pick up leading to higher production rates -- and ultimately higher margins and profits.

That said which of the two leading airplane manufacturers is the better recovery play? Let's take a closer look.

Boeing vs. Airbus

On a historical basis or at least before the 737 MAX debacle hit Boeing in 2019 Boeing has tended to generate higher margins and significantly better free cash flow (FCF) than its European rival.

That's something that might well encourage investors to favor Boeing as a recovery play. The argument is that a recovering commercial aviation market will lead to more orders and production. As production increases so should margins because airline manufacturers tend to reduce their unit costs of production as they build more planes -- an assumption built into financial modeling. Given that Boeing has been better than Airbus on these matters in the past it figures that investors might favor Boeing.

Boeing and Airbus valuations

Indeed Wall Street analysts have priced in a significant improvement in Boeing's earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin expectations. As you can see below analysts have Boeing's margin recovering strongly by 2023.

Focusing on the 2023 timeframe the consensus is for Boeing to generate $9.5 billion in FCF in 2023 compared to 5.1 billion euros for Airbus. These figures would put Boeing at a price-to-FCF multiple of 14.5 in 2023 and Airbus at a multiple of 16.3 times FCF. Both valuations use the current market caps.

Based on these figures both stocks are attractive. After all if the 2021-2023 period is the initial recovery phase leading to a resumption of Boeing and Airbus's mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth rates from the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=0P00009WFE&culture=en&platform=sal then those price-to-FCF multiples look very attractive. Moreover as commercial flights come back airlines will start ordering again and the narrative around the stocks will turn positive. For example Southwest Airlines has already ordered 134 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes this year and United Airlines recently announced its largest-ever order for 270 airplanes (200 Boeing 737 MAXs and 50 Airbus A321 NEOs).

Furthermore given that Boeing is forecast to trade at a lower FCF multiple than Airbus in 2023 it looks like a better value.

Case closed? Buy Boeing? Unfortunately it's not that simple.

Boeing is riskier

The case for buying Airbus over Boeing rests on the idea that there's a lot more risk to these estimates with Boeing. Analyst estimates are fine but they are contingent on the underlying development of the businesses. And unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic has created several challenges for Boeing.

First the 737 MAX grounding was an issue in itself but the COVID-19 pandemic tipped the market from being a supplier's market to a buyer's market. As such there are question marks around the kind of pricing concessions that Boeing may have to give away to sell 737 MAXs to fill production slots.

Second Boeing's plans for a new midsize airplane (NMA) dubbed the ""797"" have been pushed back by the pandemic and that's allowed the Airbus A321XLR to steal a lead in the marketplace for long-haul single-aisled airplanes.

Third the general expectation is that domestic flights will return quicker than long-haul international flights which means the narrow-body market will return earlier than the wide-body. That's a problem for Boeing as management had previously pinned its hopes on a wide-body replacement cycle beginning at the start of this decade being driven by its new 777X.

Boeing or Airbus?

All told gazing into the crystal ball for 2023 the risk around Boeing is that revenue and profitability could fall short of expectations due to pricing concessions on the 737 MAX while Boeing could find itself without a viable NMA. Also its 777X airplane might not be profitable over the long term relative to expectations.

While these concerns don't necessarily mean you should avoid Boeing stock given the choice the two they are enough to make Airbus the better buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdC13b3VsZC1oYXBwZW4taWYtYWxsLXRoZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWluLWEtYm9laW5nLTc3Ny1qdW1wZWQtYXQtdGhlLXNhbWUtdGltZS0xNjQ2MTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Would Happen If All the Passengers in a Boeing 777 Jumped at the Same Time?,"People are suckers for experiments and over the decades we’ve seen a bunch of them try out outlandish things for the sake of science or simply personal curiosity. But would you be able to convince 500 people to jump inside a Boeing 777 just to see what happens?

The 777 has been in operation since the mid-1990s and since then it has been at the center of about 30 aviation incidents of various types - that would be about one major accident per million departures according to Boeing which believe it or not is one of the lowest numbers in the industry.Some of these incidents involved mere mechanical failures other hijackings but none of them involved people jumping on the plane in unison for a very simple reason: no one has tried it before. But if you wonder how that's like the guys over at What If are here to enlighten us a bit on the hows and whys of such an unlikely experiment.The 777 was chosen for the task because of the large number of passengers it can seat up to 396 people (in the 777-300ER version). Granted that’s lower than the 500 imagined for this exercise but we reckon the effects of so many people jumping on the plane would not differ all that much between 400 and 500 pairs of feet.What effects you ask?Surprisingly What If suggests if a number of elements like the weight of the passengers and the speed and altitude of the airplane are just right nothing really dangerous should happen.If each of the 500 passengers weighed 75 kg (165 pounds) on average for a total of 37500 kg (82673 pounds) and the plane was flying at cruising altitude at speeds of around 870 kph (541 mph) all that would happen would be a rise in altitude at the moment of the jump and change of plane trajectory both easily correctable by the captain.Things of course would be a bit different if the weight of the passengers would be much greater or unevenly distributed or the stunt would be performed while the plane was engaged in takeoff or landing.It would also be a bad idea for people to continue jumping even if all the right conditions for a relatively safe experiment are met. An instability called flutter might set in affecting the aircraft’s aerodynamics and its natural frequency. This in turn could lead to structural failures of the plane and eventually crash.Below is the video of the What If imaginative experiment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL05ld3MvdmlkZW8vYm9laW5nLTczNy1jYXJnby1wbGFuZS1mb3JjZWQtbWFrZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy03ODY0NzU1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video Boeing 737 cargo plane forced to make emergency landing in water near Honolulu,Boeing 737 cargo plane forced to make emergency landing in water near Honolulu One pilot is fighting for his life and another is in serious condition after a crash landing in the ocean off the coast of Hawaii.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdHdvLXBpbG90cy1zdXJ2aXZlLWFmdGVyLWJvZWluZy03MzctY2FyZ28tcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2gtbGFuZHMtaW4tc2VhLW9mZi1oYXdhaWktNjhjazZjcXAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two pilots survive after Boeing 737 cargo plane crash-lands in sea off Hawaii,"Two pilots survived with serious injuries after flying their crippled Boeing 737 jet in pitch dark to a crash-landing on the sea off Hawaii yesterday.

Mitt Romney unloads his most controversial of homes,"(Gregory Bull | AP) The Romneys' La Jolla Calif. home photographed in 2013 which has since been renovated.

Sen. Mitt Romney’s real estate portfolio is shrinking — a bit.

The Utah Republican has sold his beachfront home in La Jolla Calif. It’s a property he and his wife Ann bought in 2008 for $12 million and then bulldozed to build a far larger home frustrating some of their neighbors.

San Diego County assessed the value of this supersize home at more than $15 million. The Romneys sold it for $23.5 million according to The San Diego Union-Tribune to William and Marisa Rastetter. William Rastetter has been a biotechnology leader who worked as the chief executive at IDEC Pharmaceuticals.

The Union-Tribune said it was the third-most expensive home sale in La Jolla.

The sale came to light June 25 during a virtual discussion on infrastructure sponsored by the Salt Lake Chamber. Romney was seated on his bed the laptop camera tilted to show his ceiling.

“The reason for that is we have sold our home in California” he said “and I’m actually in California today and the movers have cleared everything out except for this bed.”

(Screengrab from Salt Lake Chamber video) Sen. Mitt Romney is shown here in the La Jolla Calif. home that he recently sold as he participated in a Salt Lake Chamber virtual event June 25. 2021.

The senator still has his 5900-square-foot home in Holladay which he built in 2014. He has his vacation home in New Hampshire on Lake Winnipesaukee his $8.9 million ski chalet in Park City and his place in the Washington D.C. area.

The senator former Massachusetts governor and one-time Republican presidential nominee has unloaded his condo in Belmont Mass. and now the Romneys are leaving their most controversial home set in a stunning location.

Romney’s opponents criticized him during the 2012 presidential race for planning to add a “car elevator” to his La Jolla home using it to attempt to paint him as a rich out-of-touch politician. Some in the neighborhood accused him of building a house that was out of character with the decidedly upscale area. His home is at the end of a cul-de-sac and abuts the ocean.

“It was contentious” Anthony Ciani an architect and a critic of Romney’s plans once told The Boston Globe. “The issue was the bulk of it compared to the houses right next to it. It’s not compatible with the gingerbread houses that are immediately adjacent. It’s two three times bigger than those.”

The Romneys eventually won approval to tear down the 3000-square-foot home and replaced it with one that was 11000 square feet. Planning documents show the house includes a library a basement exercise room and a room for beach gear. The Romneys shopped the house around in 2015 but kept it until now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnNpb25nbG9iYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xpdmluZy1pbi10aGUtcGFzdC13aHktYW1lcmljYW5zLWFyZS1jcmF2aW5nLWNvbG9uaWFsLWhvbWVzLTAxNjI1Mzk3MzY00gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuc2lvbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzL2xpdmluZy1pbi10aGUtcGFzdC13aHktYW1lcmljYW5zLWFyZS1jcmF2aW5nLWNvbG9uaWFsLWhvbWVzLTAxNjI1Mzk3MzY0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Living in the Past: Why Americans Are Craving Colonial Homes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/living-in-the-past-why-americans-are-craving-colonial-homes-01625397364 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnNpb25nbG9iYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xpdmluZy1pbi10aGUtcGFzdC13aHktYW1lcmljYW5zLWFyZS1jcmF2aW5nLWNvbG9uaWFsLWhvbWVzLTAxNjI1Mzk3MzY00gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuc2lvbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzL2xpdmluZy1pbi10aGUtcGFzdC13aHktYW1lcmljYW5zLWFyZS1jcmF2aW5nLWNvbG9uaWFsLWhvbWVzLTAxNjI1Mzk3MzY0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The sobering message after the terrorist attacks 20 years ago this September and the spread of the deadly coronavirus a year and a half ago is this: Plan for the unexpected. Don’t be a prisoner of your lack of imagination.

It’s never too early to plan ahead.

“There’s no question that asteroids strike the earth and can create great damage” says Jay Apt an astronaut who has flown four space shuttle missions two as shift commander and who teaches engineering at Carnegie Mellon. “These strikes don’t necessarily plunge the Earth into winter for many years though it is something to take very seriously.”

“But” he continues “once you see an asteroid coming this way the question is what to do about it.”

Scientists have debated that at least since the Tunguska Impact of 1908 when an asteroid exploded over Siberia and with the power of multiple atomic bombs took out 80 million trees over a frozen expanse of 830 square miles. Astronomers have since counted 1097558 of the “rocky airless remnants” as NASA puts it in our solar system. Sometimes one of them can enter Earth’s orbit the prospect of which fuels the imaginations of science fiction writers and the nightmares of astronomers alike.

Collision course

The American science fiction writer Larry Niven once said “The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn’t have a space program.”

We do.

And now we have a tentative answer to the threat of an asteroid colliding to cataclysmic effect with our planet: NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test or DART.

Developed by a team of scientists from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office DART is an unmanned remotely controlled astronomical suicide mission designed to nudge an asteroid that is half a mile in diameter out of its orbit. Doomsayers take note: This is only a test. The asteroid in question Didymos — Greek for “twin” and so named because it was discovered to be paired with its own small moon — is not actually on a collision course with Earth.

Sometime between Thanksgiving week (perhaps as soon as the evening of Nov. 23) and February 2022 the team behind DART will launch it from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The spacecraft will if all goes according to plan travel 6.8 million miles to reach and collide with Didymos’s moonlet Dimorphos which is 525 feet in diameter.

DART will also ferry a shoebox-sized spacecraft contributed by the Italian Space Agency. Several days before DART’s impact with Dimorphos that little craft the LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids) will separate from DART to capture images of the impact.

Success will destroy DART but also provide data on how the collision alters the speed of the moon around its larger companion. The goal: to learn how to speed up or slow down an asteroid’s transit so that it can be done again if and when the asteroid in question is headed for Earth.

Only a little tap from DART will make an enormous difference.

“If you know an asteroid’s orbit for a long time and have advance warning and if you think it will hit the Earth even a tiny nudge far away will change the trajectory of the asteroid and save the Earth” says Michael J. Neufeld senior curator of the National Air and Space Museum.

But what if DART is a dud or what if the technology doesn’t work quite right? Are we simply to be the victims of to summon Robert Frost’s 1920 poem of the same name fire and ice?

“We have other tools” says Thomas D. Jones a veteran of four space shuttle flights who is chairman of the committee on Near-Earth Objects of the Association of Space Explorers. “We can ‘park’ nearby and tug on the object through gravitational pulls. We can use a nuclear explosive device. And there is an exotic idea of using a solar-powered laser pulse to hit the asteroid repeatedly creating a puff of gas that will vaporize a piece of the surface and propel the asteroid like a rocket. But the physics of DART are simple: We just run into the object the way we have automobile crashes on Earth.’'

Yes simple.

One way or another moving asteroids out of the way of Earth is a preoccupation of astronauts such as Jones whose committee believes the “chances are 100 percent that our planet will be struck again by a large Near-Earth Object” and that there are as many as 1000 “threats to human civilization” traveling near the planet.

Plus there is this challenge: Winning support — technical economic political — for a global mobilization against an asteroid careering toward Earth. As Kelly Fast manager of NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observation Program put it during an Association of Space Explorers seminar last week “Planetary defense is a team sport.”

Asteroid anxiety

Asteroids were first discovered on New Year’s Day 1801 in the very first hours of the 19th century. In the decades that followed that discovery science fiction writers speculated on how earthlings might redirect asteroids perhaps to use them for resources to produce rocket fuel or even to employ them for settlement. The real push to create a planetary defense came in the past half-century. “There’s a growing sense we need to track these things and see if we can do anything about diverting them” says Andrew Rivkin a Johns Hopkins planetary researcher involved in the DART project.

Asteroid anxiety in other words is real.

So is confusion about what exactly happens when an asteroid reaches Earth’s atmosphere. In 2017 a team of researchers determined that the cracks and pores in an asteroid’s surface let in high-pressure air that creates massive internal pressure. Most asteroids effectively explode from within before actually hitting Earth’s surface.

This happened 26 times in the first 14 years of the 21st century. Sensors installed around Earth because of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization which monitors the infrasound signature of nuclear detonations identified the nuclear-strength asteroid explosions most of which occurred over oceans.

On Feb. 15 2013 however a 66-foot-long asteroid traveling at 40000 miles per hour exploded about 20 miles above Chelyabinsk Russia. With a force 30 times that of the Hiroshima bomb it damaged thousands of buildings across six cities and injured 1500 people. Scientists widely believe that the destructive potential of an asteroid or other near-Earth object could exceed regional catastrophe and be global in scale.

Imagine then what an asteroid with a diameter of half a mile like Didymos could do.

‘A little safer’

The modern pioneers of asteroid deflection were scientists with the European Space Agency (ESA) who crafted a double-spacecraft plan they called Don Quijote two decades ago. The mission would have deployed one spacecraft Hidalgo to crash into an asteroid and a second Sancho to observe the change in its momentum.

Facing a funding shortfall Don Quijote didn’t make it out of initial studies which led to a 2010 report by the National Research Council in the United States ominously titled “Defending Planet Earth.” It urged “an experimental test of a kinetic impactor along with a characterization monitoring and verification system such as the Don Quijote mission that was previously considered but not funded by the European Space Agency.”

In 2018 ESA produced Hera a smaller spacecraft that is scheduled to follow DART into deep space after five years to study the crater that DART produces.

DART’s mission is no easy undertaking. While something of its size would cause a huge explosion in Earth’s atmosphere Dimorphos is actually quite small as celestial bodies go. DART will travel at approximately 4 miles a second and in the spacecraft’s final four hours before collision scientists on the ground will yield DART’s steering to autonomous onboard computers that will have a greater-than-human-guided chance of smashing DART into the rock thus pushing the asteroid off course.

The long-term effect of such efforts Hopkins’s Rivkin says “is to make the planet a little safer.”

But not entirely safe. There are other threats out there in space like comets hurtling toward Earth at high velocity. They can come from completely unexpected directions and we can have no advance warning of their arrival. But that’s for another day and another essay.

Pleasant dreams!

“Avapritinib had moderate clinical activity in the third and later-line treatment of a Chinese patient with GIST making it the potential new treatment option for the population” explained Jian Li MD PhD Beijing Cancer Hospital Beijing China during a presentation of the results.

In the open-label multicenter phase 1/2 trial designed to evaluate avapritinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST the median duration of treatment was 25.4 weeks.

In patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST the overall response rate (ORR) was 75% including 15 patients with a partial response (PR). Similarly in the third- and fourth-line treatment subgroup 9 (39%) patients had an objective response with 1 (4%) complete response and 8 (35%) PRs. The researchers noted that most responders (13 and 7 respectively) remain in remission.

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached. In particular for the PDGFRA D842V-mutant and third- and fourth-line treatment subgroups median PFS was not reached and 5.5 months respectively.

Lastly the researchers noted avapritinib was rapidly absorbed and the drug exposure increased proportionally with dose at the steady-state. “The mean T1/2 ranged from 30.9-42.2 hours supporting once daily dosing” they wrote.

Grade 3/4 treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 41 patients with the most common being anemia (32%). There were no treatment-related deaths.

Avapritinib – a potent selective small-molecule inhibitor that targets KIT/PDGFRA activation loop mutants – was approved in the United States based on findings from the NAVIGATOR study. The agent has been approved in China to treat adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA exon 18 mutations including PDGFRA D842V as the first approve precision therapy for this patient population in China.

At the meeting Li reported on updated safety and efficacy data from the CS3007-101/BLU-285-1105 which is a bridging registrational study of the NAVIGATOR trial in China.

In phase 1 of the study researchers aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose – between 200 mg daily (n = 6) and 300 mg (n = 6) and to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics (N = 12). In phase 2 they evaluated the preliminary efficacy and further assessed safety and PK (N = 48) following treatment at the 300-mg dose. In addition the phase 2 study evaluated subgroups of patients: those with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST (n = 20) and as a third- or fourth-line treatment in patients who progressed on or could not tolerate standard therapy (n = 28).

Median age was 63 years (range 43-70). The majority of patients were male (n = 41) had an ECOG performance score of 1 (n = 45) stage IV disease (n = 58) and metastatic disease (n = 59).

As of July 31 2020 60 patients were treated with avapritinib including 6 treated at 200 mg and 54 treated with 300 mg. Forty patients were still on treatment whereas 10 patients discontinued treatment due to death 9 from disease progression and 1 due to AEs.

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School:

VP Student Activities – Off Campus Graduate Business Association

Delta Leadership Coaching Fellow

Logistics Coordinator for the inaugural John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition Planning Committee

Received the Community Award during Goizueta’s Core Values Award Ceremony Fall 2020

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school?

It was an honor to work on the planning committee for the John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition. Racial injustice and inequity have been a topic of conversation among our class since the murders of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery this past summer. Many of our conversations revolved around what can we do as business students and future business leaders to make real change. My classmate Willie Sullivan came up with the idea to develop and host a national case competition specifically focused on racial injustice in big corporations. There was a lot of unknown when we started this journey last summer but we had a strong team that was able to bring the idea to fruition and it was truly an incredible event. This event and being a part of the planning committee is a top highlight of my time in business school.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? In my last year at my company before going back to school I had the opportunity to help senior leadership pitch for a new piece of business that was highly sought after. We ultimately won the business and I was promoted to Account Manager and given the new account. The accounts I had worked on in my first few years at Caudex were already well-established with processes in place and client relationships developed. This was a brand-new account so I was in charge of creating processes for my team and building relationships with the clients. While with any new account there are speed bumps along the way I was proud of how the account progressed and my influence on the account within the year.

Why did you choose this business school? The small class size and tight-knit community are what sold me on Goizueta. I went to a huge undergrad so I was looking for a smaller program where I could have the opportunity to get to know all of my classmates and the faculty on both a personal and professional level.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? TI Kim was my favorite professor. He taught Data-Driven Market Intelligence last spring and it ended up being one of my favorite classes in business school. TI was able to make data analytics more palpable. I had struggled with the data analytics class during core and signed up for DDMI to push myself out of my comfort zone and really work to hone these skills. TI made the class entertaining and engaging even when we went virtual halfway through the semester (due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? Semi-formal! This was held at the end of core semester in 2019 and the last big hoorah for our class before COVID-10 hit. For the first year students especially this event is a chance to dress up and celebrate the end of an intense core semester with your best friends.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I would have said yes to more club and social events during the core semester. There were many social or club events held during the weeks that I did not attend because I had too much work or was too overwhelmed with the transition back into school. Especially with how things took a turn in early 2020 I wish I had taken advantage of those in-person gatherings to better get to know my classmates both in my class and the year ahead of me.

What is the biggest myth about your school? This is not Emory-specific but something I thought before going to business school was that students going for their MBA had everything figured out already. I thought that I would be the only one unsure about where I wanted to work what I wanted to focus on in my classes and ultimately what I wanted to do in life. I quickly found out that I was far from alone in these uncertainties. Many more people than I expected have come to business school to do a full career switch so there is a true camaraderie in experiencing the unknowns together.

What surprised you the most about business school? Not having any business education prior I was surprised how much I could contribute to group work and class discussions. I thought that I would have to play catch up with my classmates with business undergrad degrees but that was not always the case. Most classes and groups I have been a part of have felt like an even playing field where we are all learning and figuring things out together.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? Being a dual degree student definitely helped me stand out in my application process. In general I think it helps to show a clear professional interest and how it relates to your previous experience in the application process. I had a clear focus on the healthcare industry with my background in medical communications and an interest in the public health degree which helped guide my application and interview.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I most admire Kristen Little. As the President of the Black MBA Association a Social Enterprise Fellow Associate Managing Director of the John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition (to name a few) Kristen is a true leader in our class. I have admired Kristen’s natural ability to network and her way of connecting and making people feel at ease. She is well-rounded in all of the activities she is involved in while also having fun and enjoying this time back in school.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? Academically the shift to online went pretty smoothly but there was definitely an adjustment period to remain focused while taking classes from my apartment. As VP of Student Activities the online shift was extremely disruptive. My counterpart Robert Brooks and I were just elected to our positions at the end of February and we were already discussing all of the fun events we wanted to plan for our classmates. Unfortunately because of COVID-19 we had to rethink our entire approach. Neither of us were that excited to host Zoom happy hours at first but we were able to get really creative and with the help from a number of clubs on campus we came up with a ton of fun and engaging virtual events to keep the community connected.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My mom most influenced my decision to pursue my MBA. Since I was little my mom has been taking me along to women in business or women in STEM conferences. I have watched my mom be an absolute force at these conferences networking and making connections left and right. My mom has had an amazing career ranging from technology to higher education which has been a huge influence in my decision to continue my education. My mom has always been my role model and taught me by example that I am capable of doing anything that I put my mind to.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Be a leader that is able to foster strong relationships within my team and colleagues

Be an advocate and mentor for women in my company

What made Tara such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

Tara Thomas’s impact on the Goizueta community cannot be understated. As the country dealt with the devastating effects of COVID-19 and systemic-racism Tara did an exemplary job supporting her peers when morale was at its lowest. Physical distancing created a paradigm shift for the usually robust Goizueta community which often feels more like a family. Tara who serves as our Graduate Business Association Vice President for Student Activities came up with creative and engaging programs that enriched remote social interactions by allowing participants to forget about “Zoom fatigue.”

In June of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd and the video of Ahmaud Arbery’s killing was released Tara and other student leaders jumped into action developing the Ally Education Series. The purpose of the series is to allow students who identify as allies to educate themselves on historically documented racism in the United States. Moreover they committed themselves to address racial disparities as future decision-makers within their respective organizations.

Tara’s commitment to addressing the challenges that our community faced over the past year speaks to her leadership abilities resiliency and high moral character. These attributes are also what makes Tara Thomas an invaluable addition to the Goizueta Class of 2021.”

“He’s always trying to help somebody. He helps everybody” she said outside their apartment Wednesday.

Police haven’t yet revealed a motive in the slaying but law enforcement sources said the shooting which occurred opposite the Chelsea Career and Technical Education High School may have been school-related.

The slain teen was a student at the nearby Broome Street Academy Charter High School sources added.

“The only time you see Mahki is when he’s walking with his girl” the friend said. “I was crying earlier. It just hit me… I thought I was going to push it off but I couldn’t. I did cry.”

Family friend Lakesha Jenkins told The Post the family didn’t know what led to the shooting – only that Brown was helping a friend at the time.

“He is a caring person. He is a respectful kid” Jenkins said outside the teen’s apartment. “We all have love for him.”

His basketball coach Jessica Jenkins echoed that sentiment.

J. Simpson for seven years. Reports suggest that the couple divorced in 1992 and two years later she and her friend Ron Goldman were brutally stabbed to death. O. J. Simpson was the main suspect in this double murder. Even though authorities arrested him and put him on trial the court controversially acquitted him.

Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were murdered in her condo at 875 South Bundy Drive in Brentwood Los Angeles California. Since this tragedy this home has been scrutinized by many individuals. According to People Magazine its new owners completely transformed its shrubbery in 1997 rendering the murder site unrecognizable. Furthermore its address was changed in an attempt to cleanse its ugly reputation. It has also been sold multiple times.

Nicole Brown Simpson’s life and death will be the subject of an upcoming Lifetime docuseries titled The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. Per IMDb its synopsis reads “Nicole Brown Simpson’s sisters and closest friends break their silence about her murder and O.J. Simpson’s controversial trial aiming to shed light on the truth.”

How many times was Nicole Brown Simpson’s condo sold?

Nicole Brown Simpson’s four-bedroom four-bath 3400 sq. ft townhouse was built in 1991. It first sold for $625000 in January 1994 five months before the murder. However two years after Nicole and Ron’s deaths the condo sold for a reduced price of $525000. According to People Magazine the condo was purchased again in 2006 but this time for a whopping $1.72 million. In total this infamous house has been sold three times.

In a 1997 conversation with the LA Times a resident of that area stated that Brentwood would forever be infamous for the double murders. He said “Brentwood is always going to have this ghost hanging over it — the place of the O.J. murders.”

O. J. Simpson died due to cancer on April 10 2024 at the age of 76.

Downtown

Best neighborhood for vintage Vegas

With its retro casinos the vibrant Arts and Fremont East Entertainment districts cool museums and free entertainment galore a visit or stay Downtown is the antidote for all Strip-related maladies. It's is a great place to base yourself if the Strip doesn't appeal. The area's clutch of old-school casinos usually have good-quality rooms at ridiculously good rates that will make you never want to stay in a hostel again.

Walking west on Fremont takes you along the Fremont Street Experience; you can't miss Slotzilla greeting you upon arrival. South of here is the loosely organized Arts District. Walking east you'll immediately be in the Fremont Street East Entertainment Precinct chock full of interesting bars restaurants and community galleries. If you're a fan of vintage shopping racks of bowling shirts gold-rimmed martini glasses and neon signs on the myriad shops on Main St await you. Another retro must-see is the Mob Museum – Las Vegas' old federal courthouse that has been repurposed to house a cutting-edge collection of mob memorabilia and the history of organised crime in early America.

Steer clear of the area east of the Container Park and north of the Interstate (you have to walk underneath it so you'll know) at night instances of street crime are not uncommon. Stick to the well-lit tourist areas and you should be just fine.

Summerlin

Best neighborhood for outdoor adventures

If you're excited by Las Vegas but everything about the Strip makes you a little anxious Summerlin is for you. Consider making Red Rock Casino or the area around Downtown Summerlin your base less than 10 minutes' drive from spectacular Red Rock Canyon the star of the Las Vegas Valley.

This part of town has a selection of comfortable and stylish accommodations and a wealth of great restaurants spanning a range of genres and tastes in settings from smart casual alfresco to high-end country club.

Summerlin might not be your bag for your entire stay in Vegas but it's worth considering spending a night here especially when the rowdiness of the Strip starts to wear you down and you need a fix of nature or a meal you can actually savor without dreading the bill (or the song and dance of choosing which celebrity chef). If it's comfort you seek without the hype Summerlin will deliver – it doesn't skimp on fine dining high-end shopping quality accommodations or natural beauty.

The Strip

The best neighborhood for sensory overload

It's Vegas' entertainment central the epicenter in a vortex of limitless potential where almost anything goes and time becomes elastic. Heads spin at the endless sales pitches: some get lucky many have such an unspeakably good time they don't seem to mind incinerating their hard-earned cash. Magic dwells in this 4.2-mile garden of earthly delights but finding yours can be tricky: the Strip excels at distraction.

Vegas is famous for its shameless re-creations of famous sights: Egyptian pyramids the Eiffel Tower Venetian canals. Jet from Europe to Polynesia and back without changing time zones – or even leaving the Strip. Start at the Big Daddy Caesars Palace on the center Strip and you'll know straight away that you're in Vegas baby! Linger a little in Ancient Rome then cross over to the slightly more chilled LINQ Promenade where you can take a breather down a beer a cupcake fish and chips or a sushirrito (sushi burrito) then decide: north via Venice to the Stratosphere (Nevada's tallest building) for more views thrills and spills or south to Mandalay Bay the something-for-everyone tropical oasis in the desert via Paris a pyramid and New York?

If you throw a lucky dice or two on your world tour of the Strip move on to retail therapy. Shopping here ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous with almost any human luxury you can imagine available somewhere. That said luxury comes with a price tag. If you didn't win big on the floor check out the excellent selection of discount merch at the not-on-the-Strip but not far from it Las Vegas Premium Outlets North and South.

East of the Strip

The best neighborhood for a local experience

Visits east reward explorers with a deeper understanding of what makes Vegas tick. You won't find many typical Vegas-style sights here but instead there are collections of vintage pinball machines rock-and-roll memorabilia and a glimpse into the city's dark atomic past. You'll also find cheap eats bars where bartenders drink and a vibrant LGBTIQ+ scene.

This is locals' Vegas home for many of the folks whose hard work makes the Strip tick: the 'anything goes' mentality that passes on the Strip isn't kosher here.

Aside from the Pinball Hall of Fame and the National Atomic Testing Museum sights east of the Strip are few. This is where you come to get a sense of 'real life' Las Vegas – how things are for the majority of Las Vegans. You'll likely find the working-class neighborhoods of this big desert city have a very different feel to other parts of the US or where you call home. Keep an open mind and have a friendly demeanour – there's much to discover.

West of the Strip

The best neighborhood for oases in the desert

It's really hard to define the area west of the Strip but the easiest way to get a handle on it is to head to Rio in the daytime and ride the elevators up to the patio of the VooDoo Rooftop Nightclub. It probably won't be open for food and beverage service but you can still enjoy the incredible views of the Strip and the Las Vegas Valley and make a plan.

A good place to start is the legendary Palms Casino which has undergone a serious makeover featuring revamped rooms the scalding hot new Kaos nightclub and pool and some excellent celebrity-chef-helmed restaurants. Throw in a sky-high zipline Vegas' newest casino an eco-minded desert oasis and the diverse flavors of Chinatown Plaza and suddenly you've got a neighborhood (or at least an evening) to rival the Strip.

Don't try and walk between sights – nothing is really near anything else and you're in the Mojave Desert (if you'd forgotten). When the buzz of the casino gets a little too much wander through the gorgeous desert gardens at the Springs Preserve for a soothing respite from all that neon. Enjoying these educational meticulously maintained botanical gardens which are literally oases in the desert.

From Patak's simmer sauces to the trusty Continental Pasta & Sauce these trusty staples can be found in most Kiwi pantries. Photo / The Spinoff

This story was originally published by The Spinoff.

Off-the-shelf ready-made sauces and recipe bases changed how New Zealanders cook forever. Against her therapist's advice Leonie Hayden dives deep into her childhood to look back on some of the most iconic Kiwi kitchen staples.

In retail speak they're called FMCGs – fast-moving consumer goods. We know the jingles as well as our own sweet mother's voice – ""Thanks Pataks!"" ""I feel like Chicken Tonight!"" ""My mum's a Maggi mum!"" ""You'll wear the Dolmio grin"". Stick. It. In. My. Veins.

Whether you call them recipe starters instant meals or meal companions they're the supermarket staples that pulled New Zealand kicking and screaming out of the 70s and introduced us to exotic foods like ""spaghetti bolognese"". The post-WWII parade of brown-grey chops mince sausages and stews with a pile of white bread spuds and a limp boiled vegetable suddenly became exotic over-cooked stir fries. Carbonara? Just add hot water bud. Weeknight meals became so easy even Dad could make them hahahaha it's so funny how little household labour dads are expected to do.

Sausages and veges thru the 90s then as far as I was aware Asian food was invented around 2001 and that became the main thing (mainly kantong stir fry or pataks curry) — Joseph Møøre (@josephmoore1) June 14 2021

It's not like we became a country with a refined palate overnight as a result oh no no. I can only apologise to every kid from a migrant household being sent to school with delicious flavourful homemade cuisine that was made fun of for being different. Imagine thinking luncheon sausage aka anus paste sandwiches were OK but not a delicately spiced dhal or hummus. We're disgusting goblins and we should be ashamed. But for better or worse this is what we eat in post-Victorian post-world wars post-globalisation New Zealand (and Australia Britain and Canada). Coloniser cuisine if you will.

I started cooking at a young age to help my mum out but mostly so my greedy ass could choose what we were having for dinner. It was thanks to a lot of these products I eventually learned how to make the real thing. Yes these rankings will be contentious. They are not comprehensive or based on any robust scientific method but are entirely influenced by my own tastes upbringing and sexual attraction to dads who like beef noodle soup.



15. Wattie's Just Add simmer sauces

Look I'm loath to judge any of these food stuffs too harshly – I'm aware as I'm sure Wattie's is that they're not the shining example of whatever meal they're trying to recreate. But someone has to be at the bottom and the Just Add range… is gloopy kaka in a can. Kaka can. Bad vibes.

14. Campbell's Soup

Campbell's soups have been a household name since Andy Warhol used them as his muse. Photo / Supplied

Every soup ever commercially manufactured likes to remind you that it is ""it's the perfect base for a casserole"". We get it!

I made the mistake of buying the Campbell's chicken soup once mostly for the iconic can but it may well have been from Andy Warhol's personal stash because the small cubed pieces of ""chicken"" tasted like drywall from a Cold War bunker.



13. Kan Tong

Australian brand Masterfoods launched the Kan Tong range in 1976 inspired by the influx of southeast Asian migrants to Australia. New Zealand of course came around in the 80s and standard weekday meals were suddenly transformed by flavour! Namely sugar the second or third ingredient listed on every Kan Tong cooking sauce. No shade – both sugar and MSG have been unfairly maligned in western cooking probably because we have problems with regulation (hello insane portion sizes and an obsession with thinness that has caused pandemic levels of disordered eating) and haven't figured out the sweet spot (heh) of using sugar to enhance savoury meals. Does Kan Tong find that balance? Hell no it's a candy-flavoured nightmare.



12. MasterFoods all the things

Maggi may have the name recognition but MasterFoods does a yuuuge range of recipe bases and cooking sauces and they do all the herbs and spices and own half the brands mentioned here. Their recipe bases are a slightly-too-sweet survey of the globe – beef stroganoff Thai green curry chow mein and cottage pie stand proudly shoulder to shoulder – proving they truly are the masters of food. Or at least some kind of regional manager.



11. Continental Cup-a-Soup

Nearly all of these leave a slimy film in your mouth but you know what? It's OK.

10. Rice Risotto

It's rice so nice they named it twice! Like ""chai tea"" before it rice risotto means ""rice rice dish"" but confusingly the rice in rice risotto isn't arborio rice typically used to cook risotto but a long grain rice mixed with risone pasta. It comes in such traditional Italian flavours as ""Chinese"" and of all the instant meals does the very least. The art-pop David Byrne-esque jingle however is killer and should absolutely have been released as a single. Release the single you cowards.

9. Chicken Tonight

There is nothing exceptional about Chicken Tonight (although I admit I went through a real honey mustard phase) but it gets bumped up the ranking because it comes with a banging tune and its own dance.



8. Maggi Cook in the Pot

Ah the English language. Cook in the Pot is the best example of saying what it does on the box since the North and South Islands. You add flavoured powder sachets to your food and cook it in a pot. If only they specified to Eat From the Plate – it makes such a mess of the table.

The devilled sausages apricot chicken and cottage pie flavours are a ubiquitous presence in New Zealand households – the devilled sausages especially remind me of my nana. She added apple to hers to which I remember thinking as a barely sentient toddler: ""Fruit in dinner! Now I've seen everything!"" Unsurprisingly they're mostly yeast extract and corn starch although the cottage pie mix surprised me by including ginger garam masala cinnamon and nutmeg. Go you spicy lil bitch!

7. Patak's

Patak's simmer sauces brought Indian food into the mainstream with families all over NZ lapping up the tasty flavours. Photo / Supplied

What westerners call Indian food is only the tip of the iceberg for the many and varied cuisines that are actually consumed in India and in fact some of your favourites like chicken tikka masala were invented in Britain. But the western-favoured meat and vegetables slow-cooked in a creamy spiced sauce is undeniably delicious and the Pataks range (founded by the Pathak family in the late 50s) actually outperforms a lot of takeaways I've had from restaurants.

Of course I'm going to prefer chaat or a tasty dhosa but butter chicken is unequivocally yum. It's made of butter! Thanks global conglomerate parent company that now owns Patak's.



6. King's Soup Mix

Huge nostalgia feels for this – a gargantuan pot of mum's vege soup was a mainstay on the stove in the winter months getting progressively thicker and tastier as it was reheated night after night. There are no measurements just some soup mix any veges you can find and a bacon bone or a ham hock. I always think of it as the kind of densely nutritious food you'd give to someone on the brink of starvation.

5. S&B Japanese curry mix

This mild but incredibly delicious flavour base is very popular in Japan. Photo / Supplied

Some version of this mild but incredibly delicious flavoured cube is found in every kitchen cupboard in Japan and growing ever more popular in New Zealand. It's a very glossy dark curry that's good with only a few basic ingredients – just onion carrot and potato is your winter weekday meal sorted – but serve it on pork or chicken katsu and you're soaring.



4. Continental pasta

Thursday nights at my house were karate practice which meant dinner had to be quick and easy. My absolute favourite of the regular rotation was my own invention creamy tuna pasta – a Continental pasta packet (sour cream and chives or alfredo flavour) with a can of tuna mixed in and sliced boiled egg on top. Yeah I did that and I thought I was Gordon fkn Ramsay.

It's very satisfying to see that more than 20 years on the packaging hasn't changed at all. Continental pasta can be substituted with the San Remo brand but somehow their red packaging makes it taste worse. I don't know why science!

3. Dolmio

Dolmio sauces have been a mainstay of Kiwi pantries for as long as most of us can remember. Photo / Supplied

MasterFoods followed its Kan Tong success with the Dolmio range in 1989 making Italian chefs out of everyone who could boil spaghetti and open a jar. What a revelation Italian food was to our drab palates! The brightness of the marinara a springy noodle smothered with cheese. Ugh. Now we all know how to make marinara Dolmio's sauces are fine whatever but the cultural impact is undeniable – from the jovial nonno in the ads (who had some kind of horrific accident that turned him into a puppet) to the iconic ""Dolmio grin"" to the particularly filthy joke it became a punchline for (you know the one).



2. Diamond Coat n Cook

Crunchy crunchy stuff of dreams. Sorry to the Colonel but it might be my favourite c-fry. You don't even need to dip your fryable in egg first this stuff just sticks to everything. Add in crushed cornflakes and you've got karaage. Add in breadcrumbs and you've got… crumbed stuff. When I die please crumb-coat me in Diamond Coat n Cook and lower my carcass into a hole filled with hot fat.

1. Old El Paso

Everyone looked forward to taco night and as far as most of us knew Old El Paso invented tacos! Photo / Supplied

I remember the first time an Old El Paso taco kit passed through the doors of my home. I was about 10 and in charge of cooking the meal that night. All the tiny elements were magical – small bowls of chopped lettuce and finely diced tomatoes the little packet of salsa the flavour sachet. Grated cheese! It was the science experiment of my dreams and I was Dr Frankenstein mad with the power of creation.

He wasn't exactly ""caught red-handed"" but police in Newark say a man wanted for robbing a bank found himself overcome by a plume of red smoke when a security dye pack exploded as he fled the building.

Newark Public Safety Director Brian O'Hara said the unknown suspect entered the Capital One Bank on Springfield Avenue Saturday morning and handed a note scrawled on a bank deposit slip to the teller.

Born: Chambersburg Penn.

Education: Bachelor of science in Business Administration University of Richmond 1996

Career: Circuit City finance trainee 1996-1998; CarMax technology 1999-current

Where in the metro area do you live: Short Pump

Best business decision: “For me one of the best decisions I made was to take a risk and move from a well-established company to CarMax which at the time was a small startup. Part of this move was to reskill myself into a developer and from there on I constantly focused on looking for problems that need solving and working collaboratively with others to provide solutions. I was lucky enough to have been surrounded by leaders and mentors at CarMax who identified my strengths and encouraged me to take on new challenges. They gave me the space to succeed sometimes fail but always to learn. The best thing I can do now is to pay it forward to my incredible team.”

Mistake you learned the most from: Forgetting to have a where clause after the words ‘delete from table x’ you only do that once. All tech geek joking aside a mistake that we often make in technology is assuming you know what your customers or business partners want without asking them. You might think you have the greatest idea in the world but I’ve learned not to invest a lot of time or money into something until you can prove it’s valuable desirable feasible and scalable.”

What is the biggest challenge/opportunity in the next two to five years: “Attracting hiring and retaining a talented diverse and inclusive group of technology associates and maintaining the great CarMax culture as more people shift to hybrid work.”

First job after college: “During college I was a supervisor for a group of souvenir shops at Hersheypark. I may have not realized it at the time but it was a great opportunity to learn how to lead people manage inventory and provide excellent customer service. Unlimited free access to the park was also a perk.”

If you had to do it all over again what would you do differently: “Probably nothing. Each decision I made has been so inter-related both personally and professionally from where to have a summer job to where to go to college to what job opportunities to explore.”

Book that inspired you the most: “I am an avid reader so I don’t know how I could choose just one. ‘Cultivate’ ‘The Zen of Listening’ ‘Mindset’ and ‘Inspire’ — each of these has made an impact on both my personal and professional life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Carnival Vista is set to sail on Saturday afternoon out of Galveston Texas marking Carnival Cruise Line 's first U.S. cruise since the pandemic halted its operations.

The week-long cruise is set to travel to Roatan Belize and Cozumel. Passengers aboard must show proof of vaccination or be pre-approved for an exemption by Carnival which is following strict guidelines.

The next day its Carnival Horizon ship will leave Miami.

The cruise industry is among one of the last sectors to return to pre-pandemic operations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently allowed it to begin sailing again with strict safety protocols aimed at preventing Covid-19 from spreading onboard. When the pandemic began there had been several high profile outbreaks on ships.

Royal Caribbean Cruises was the first cruise operator to sail a ship from a U.S. port since the beginning of the pandemic when its Celebrity Edge ship left Miami last Saturday.

Carnival's next cruise from a U.S. port is the Carnival Breeze which is scheduled to leave from Galveston on July 15.

But the industry is still on guard. The highly infectious delta variant is prompting new lockdowns in other countries where vaccination rates are still low. Even in the U.S. where more than half of the population is vaccinated delta is quickly becoming the most prominent coronavirus strain. For weeks new Covid cases were on the decline but this highly infectious variant is beginning to reverse the trend.

Australia offers another example. It had kept Covid cases under control for months but the country is now seeing new cases flaring up in several regions. To tamp down the spread new restrictions are being put in place. As a result Carnival has canceled its Princess Cruises in and out of Australia through Dec.19 citing continued uncertainty about the resumption of cruises in the region for its decision.

Royal Caribbean earlier this week changed its vaccination policy for all cruises except those leaving from Florida. The company had two unvaccinated guests under the age of 16 test positive for Covid. Now it wants any unvaccinated guests leaving from Florida ports to have travel insurance.

Industry analysts anticipate a slow road to recovery for cruise lines and several difficulties ahead due to the international nature of cruises.

Carnival's stock has risen more than 20% this year putting its market cap at just over $30 billion. However the stock has been losing ground in recent trading. It closed Friday at $26.06 which is about 17% lower than its 52-week high of $31.52 which it hit on June 8.

""We think the cruise industry will be one of the slowest sub-sectors to recover from Covid-19. Cruising needs not just international travel to return but ports to reopen authorities to permit cruising and the return of customer confidence"" said Morgan Stanley analysts Jamie Rollo in a research note Thursday. ""Risks are rising that further travel restrictions are imposed as the delta variant spreads and we approach the winter flu season.""

Rollo reiterated his underweight rating on the stock and cut his forecasts for this year and next due to a slower-than-expected resumption of cruises and expectations of higher cash burn and higher fuel costs net of refinancing and stock swap benefits.

As for future cruise bookings despite Carnival describing pricing as strong in its second-quarter results only a portion which Rollo predicts is about 25% of 2022 is currently sold. The analysts also estimate that about half of 2022 bookings are from guests rebooking canceled cruises and using their credits.

""There is therefore a fair amount of 2022 left to sell and it could be misleading to extrapolate from the small amount of cash bookings made to date"" Rollo said. ""Additionally initial cruise deployment is mostly domestic and short duration which are lower yielding itineraries than the more exotic/international cruises which will take longer to recover.""

Because of the slower-than-expected pace of return Carnival could be burning cash until the third-quarter of 2022 he said. Rollo therefore estimates that Carnival will only be operating at 18% capacity in its third-quarter and 45% capacity in its fourth-quarter of this year.

Argus on the other hand is maintaining a buy rating for the stock due to the company's plans to resume operations in July. Narrowed losses and increases in bookings that reflect strong pent-up demand for cruise vacations are also contributing factors to the rating analyst John Staszak said in a note released on Tuesday.

Staszak said the pace of bookings are ahead of 2019 bookings despite limited advertising and marketing.

""Consistent with its plans to resume cruises Carnival expects to have all of its ships deployed by the spring of 2022. With the number of COVID cases continuing to drop we are optimistic that management's targets are achievable"" Staszak said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJuaXZhbC1uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLXJlc3VtZXMtc2VydmljZS1mcm9tLXRoZS11LXMtd2l0aC1jYXJuaXZhbC12aXN0YS1zYWlsaW5nLWZyb20tZ2FsdmVzdG9uLXRoaXMtYWZ0ZXJub29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Resumes Service from the U.S. with Carnival Vista Sailing from Galveston This Afternoon,"To celebrate Carnival Cruise Line’s resumption of guest cruises from the U.S. Carnival President Christine Duffy Carnival Vista Captain Andrea Catalani and local officials led a “Back to Fun” ribbon-cutting ceremony officially welcoming guests back on board.

“Seeing our guests board the ship for the first time in over 15 months was a welcome and emotional sight. The excitement our guests have for Carnival cruising knows no bounds and it’s great to be able to have them enjoy our unique vacation experience and of course see our amazing crew once again” said Duffy.

Added Catalani “Having our guests on board again is something we’ve been looking forward to for a very long time. Our crew is very excited and will provide them with the incredible Carnival vacation they’ve been so patiently waiting for.”

Carnival Vista will set sail this afternoon at 4 p.m. for a weeklong cruise with stops in Mahogany Bay (Isla Roatan) Cozumel and Belize City.

In addition to Carnival Vista’s departure Carnival Horizon begins sailing from PortMiami tomorrow July 4 as well as Carnival Breeze from Galveston July 15 while Carnival Miracle kicks off the line’s Alaska season from Seattle July 27. Mardi Gras the line’s newest ship sets sail from Port Canaveral July 31. Other ships in the Carnival fleet will begin service in August.

Carnival Cruise Line was the first cruise line to recognize the incredible potential of Galveston as a homeport launching the port’s first year-round cruises in 2000.

Today Carnival is the number one cruise operator from Galveston and the only cruise operator with three year-round ships at the port. Carnival Vista Carnival Breeze and Carnival Dream operate 150 voyages annually from Galveston carrying an estimated 750000 passengers a year.

Proudly sailing as America’s Cruise Line Carnival operates from 14 U.S. homeports – the most in cruising – providing consumers with a convenient and affordable way of getting to and from their cruise. Roughly half of the U.S. population is within a day’s drive of a Carnival homeport.

Carnival Cruise Line's first cruise ship left the US since the pandemic halted its operations.

The Carnival Vista set sail from Port Galveston Texas on Saturday.

Passengers were required to confirm they were fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to boarding.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Carnival Corp the world's biggest cruise company on Saturday launched its first ship from a US port since the pandemic shut down its operations.

Vista set sail from Port Galveston Texas. The week-long cruise is set to visit spots including Roatán Mahogany Bay and Cozumel.

Passengers were required to confirm their status as fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and provide proof of vaccination in advance of boarding which follows strict guest protocols.

But cruise operators are well aware that being fully vaccinated doesn't completely remove the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. ""If the virus is in the community on land … then of course you can get it on board despite all the things we do"" Carnival's CEO Arnold Donald recently told Fox Business.

Insider's Monica Humphries is on the Carnival Vista and reported her first-hand experiences from boarding to buffet lines on the vaccinated ship.

The cruise industry is one of the last sectors to try and regain its pre-pandemic activity following the huge disruption caused by the pandemic. According to Donald its efforts are largely being welcomed by customers eager to get back on the water.

In a second-quarter business update the company said booking volumes for future cruises were 45% higher compared with the first quarter. It added that 2022 bookings were already higher than in 2019 as previously reported by Insider's Grace Dean.

People are itching to spend a lot of money on board too. The CEO of Celebrity Cruises Lisa Lutoff-Perlo said travellers are eager to shell out extra cash on casinos massages and luxury meals. ""They just want to enjoy themselves"" she told Time.

Celebrating Vista's departure Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line said in a video posted to Twitter: ""Our crew is so very excited and so ready and prepared for this first cruise.""

She added: ""The silver lining that's kept us going is the support and loyalty of our guests.""

Carnival's next cruise departing from a US port is the Carnival Breeze scheduled to leave Galveston on July 15.

(Asahi Shimbun file photo)

A year has passed since Japan introduced mandatory charges to customers for each single-use plastic bag taken from retail stores.

The ratio of shoppers who decline plastic bags at stores has risen to 72 percent up from 30 percent before the charge was introduced according to the Environment Ministry.

The charge has dramatically changed shoppers’ behavior around checkout counters. It is now common for shoppers to place items they purchased into their own bags.

Much more needs to be done however to make a dent in Japan’s overall plastic waste which amounts to 9 million or so tons annually. Plastic carrier bags account for much less than 10 percent of the total.

Japan is the world’s second-largest consumer of single-use plastic products on a per capita basis.

Greater efforts are needed to reduce plastic consumption as a whole and promote reuse. The government must work more closely with businesses and consumers in tackling the challenge.

Throwing away disposable plastic products means more than a simple waste of resources.

Plastic waste is causing serious pollution. It is estimated that by 2050 plastic trash in the oceans will outweigh all the fish combined.

Burning plastics generates emissions of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming while landfill capacity is diminishing fast.

In its strategy for promoting plastic recycling announced in 2019 the government set a target of reducing consumption of single-use plastic products by 25 percent and reusing or recycling 60 percent of plastic containers and packages by 2030.

Japan which hosted the summit of Group of 20 countries in Osaka in June 2019 presided over an agreement that pledged to reduce the plastic waste flowing into the oceans to zero by 2050.

In June the Diet enacted a law to promote recycling of plastic resources. The law calls on businesses to charge for single-use plastic products and switch to using alternative materials.

The government plans to recognize plastic products designed to reduce plastic use and promote plastic recycling with a logo to mark the change.

With the law scheduled to take effect as early as next spring the government is compiling a list of products to be covered such as single-use plastic straws forks and hangers given away at stores.

It should draw on its knowledge obtained through the plastic bag charge program to work out specific measures that will lead to a significant reduction in plastic waste.

New attempts to tackle the problem are also emerging in the private sector.

In the Kanto region around Tokyo a group of businesses that includes large companies started “Loop” a sales system to reuse plastic containers for shampoo and other products.

The environmental group Greenpeace Japan rolled out a new service online “Goodbye Waste” a map that shows stores where shoppers can buy items without using single-use plastic containers or packages. More than 1000 stores are registered.

There are ways for manufactures to support the cause. Makers of laundry detergent for instance can reduce packages and cut transportation and sales costs by developing tablet-type products.

There must be many other ways to reduce waste that are beneficial for both makers and consumers.

It is by no means easy to wean consumers off disposable plastic products so widely used in their daily lives.

Experts say sales of plastic bags have grown while the volume of plastic carrier bags supplied by stores for purchased items has declined.

Consumption of single-use plastic containers and wrappers is also said to have picked up due to increased demand for home delivery services stemming from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

It requires constant efforts to devise and improve measures to curtail waste and change people’s mindsets. The momentum of progress generated by the plastic bag charge should not be wasted.

Here's why the outbreak is so bad,"CNN —

Mark Boltz-Robinson looks forward to growing apples and berries every year. The fruits go into pies apple crisps and jams and other goodies that he sends to family in Germany.

After the coronavirus pandemic he’d hoped to use the harvest to renew the relationships that have been difficult to maintain over the past year.

But that’s impossible since gypsy moth caterpillars wiped his trees and bushes clean this year. Instead of up to 90 pounds of apples and 18 quarts of berries Boltz-Robinson says all he has are bare branches.

“Normally the things that I am able to make and pass to friends and family members is not going to happen this year” he told CNN. “It’s devastating.”

As the tree warden for Monkton Vermont and chair of the town’s Forest Committee Boltz-Robinson is familiar with arboreal nuisances and outbreaks. This year’s gypsy moth invasion is the worst Vermont has seen in 30 years he said.

“I grew up in Vermont and I remember some bad years in the late 1980s and I have never seen anything this bad” he said.

European gypsy moths are an invasive species. They were introduced to the US in the late 19th century by a French scientist Étienne Léopold Trouvelot who wanted to breed a new species of silk moth in Massachusetts according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Since then the US has seen outbreaks of gypsy moth caterpillars every six to eight years according to Margaret Skinner an entomologist and researcher with the University of Vermont and its extension program.

A legion of larvae

European gypsy moth larvae — otherwise known as caterpillars — eat the foliage of hundreds of trees according to the USDA including oak and aspen.

Caterpillars emerge from eggs in the spring and feed on foliage until June or July at which point they transition to an adult gypsy moth. The adults are alive for a matter of days — just enough time to mate and lay eggs on trees which will mature through the winter.

Gypsy moths have spread beyond New England where they were first introduced to the US. According to the USDA the larval moths are affecting the Midwest the Northeast and some Southern states.

This year in particular the larvae are legion. Officials are calling it the worst outbreak in recent memory.

“For years people weren’t experiencing them in outbreak levels” said Toby Petrice a USDA research entomologist in Lansing Michigan. “It’s been unbelievable to see how much of an impact they can have.”

An infestation of gypsy moth caterpillars can have a ripple effect Petrice said. As the caterpillars spread they affect wildlife timber production recreation and the overall health of the forest. And if the population of caterpillars grows large enough they move on from trees to other vegetation like crops.

Kathy Decker manager of the Vermont Department of Forests Parks and Recreation’s forest protection program told CNN the pandemic grounded the department’s aerial forest inspections. Social distancing regulations in March and April kept the department from being able to crew the small planes she said which kept authorities from catching the outbreak until it was too far along.

The USDA says that “early detection is critical to limiting the (European gypsy moth’s) spread.”

Several experts who spoke with CNN said that there were small-scale steps that could limit the damage to trees. Boltz-Robinson said that wrapping a tree in burlap sprayed with glue or with duct tape facing outward can trap the larvae on their way up a tree trunk.

“It’s effective on a small scale but if you have 10 acres of trees that’s an awful lot of duct tape” he said.

Skinner suggested physically removing caterpillar eggs though recommended wearing gloves masks and long-sleeved clothing to do so. Gypsy moth caterpillars have been known to cause skin rash and respiratory problems in some people according to the USDA.

Drought is playing a role in outbreak

The problem is ultimately environmental. Decker said she is hoping for rain which would promote the growth of a fungus that kills the caterpillars and keeps the population in check.

As of Thursday more than half of Vermont was in a moderate drought according to the US Drought Monitor. Year-to-date rainfall in the Northeast is 6 inches below what’s normal for this time of year.

If the drought continues Decker said it is likely there will be more defoliation next year.

Sandy Liebhold a research entomologist with the US Forest Service said that the damage from this year’s outbreak was set to be on par with previous large outbreaks.

“In the 1980s there was 12 million acres defoliation and in the 1990s 7 million acres” he said. “Between a million and 10 million acres of forests are expected to be defoliated over the next year due to this year’s outbreak.”

What’s unique about the 2021 outbreak Liebhold said is that the caterpillars are being found further north than before — even into Ontario where he said the gypsy moth population is likely the largest.

“Whether conditions have shifted to make them more favorable in the North than the South we don’t know” he added.

Boltz-Robinson the Vermont tree warden partially attributes the severity of this year’s outbreak to the pandemic and the inability to take preventative measures.

But he also points to climate change. Extreme drought has hindered the growth of some natural funguses that are repellent to the caterpillars he said.

“And my personal opinion it’s only going to get worse from here without any significant change” he said.

These companies have several positive catalysts in the months aheads and analysts say investors shouldn't underestimate them. CNBC Pro combed through the top Wall Street research this week to find some of the more underappreciated stocks for the remainder of 2021. They include: Caterpillar Apple  Performance Food Sysco  US Foods and Stryker. Stryker Stryker is poised for a second half surge JPMorgan said in a note this week. ""We continue to view Stryker as a standout within our large-cap coverage heading into 2H21 as it represents one of the few companies that has managed to pair a premium growth profile with consistent top-tier execution spanning the last few years"" analyst Robbie Marcus and his team said. The medical technology company is home to a diverse array of businesses including neurotechnology and orthopedic products but there's one area that investors may be overlooking Marcus wrote. The firm said Stryker's Medical unit known as MedSurg had ""value-creating tuck-in M & A sales specialization and market leadership in narrow high-growth markets."" Marcus wrote that a recent meeting with the company's management left him feeling more bullish about the unit which he called the ""underappreciated backbone of Stryker's premium growth profile."" The company continues to innovate as well and Stryker seems to be one step ahead of the competition Marcus added. ""With a better understanding of these key underlying markets and Stryker's positioning in them we are even more bullish on the company's ability to sustain growth at a premium"" he went on to say. Shares are up 8.3% this year. Performance Food Sysco and US Foods It's been a rough year for the big three food suppliers as the pandemic wreaked havoc across the companies' businesses. But now things may be looking up for Sysco US Foods and Performance Food according to Wells Fargo. ""We remain very optimistic on the post-COVID earnings power of the food service space overall and continue to see upside in all three stocks"" analyst Edward Kelly wrote. The firm said if recent management commentary is to believed investors could be in for a big rest of the year. ""PFGC recently indicated that total company sales in the most recent week were $100 million above 2019 levels USFD stated that both chain & independent volumes were above 2019 levels in April & SYY is serving 10% more independent doors than pre- COVID"" he said. Kelly also noted there were some silver linings as a result of the pandemic including cost inflation cost cutting and further share gains. ""Overall we continue to see potential for an underappreciated earnings recovery starting in the second half of 2021"" Kelly said. Shares of Performance Food are up 0.8% this year while US Foods is up 13% in the same time period. Sysco shares are up 3% this year. Caterpillar The time is right to buy shares of Caterpillar Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook said in a note this week. The construction equipment company was added to the firm's top picks list and Cook said he sees several positive catalysts coming up this year for the industrial ""bellwether."" ""We believe CAT's 2020 earnings are at a cyclical trough and see potential for most markets improving in FY2021"" he wrote. Cook noted that Caterpillar is a key beneficiary of what he called the ""cyclical bounce"" in oil and gas as well as increased construction activity. ""CAT should benefit from the North America Construction and Resource equipment replacement cycle which are recovering in tandem and both positive to mix"" he said. However don't overlook the power of a stronger commodities outlook according to Cook. ""Commodity prices including copper iron ore and nickel have been strengthening and the depressed mining business should begin to recover"" Cook said. Caterpillar has many other ""underappreciated"" attributes like strong cash flow generation and earnings power which should excite investors he added. Caterpillar shares are up 19.6% this year.

It’s growing well but it has developed an infestation of small creatures maybe one-sixteenth of an inch long who also leave a shiny reflective spotty surface to the leaves. What treatment would you recommend to get rid of them that at the same time will not prove harmful to monarch caterpillars which hopefully will come in mass in the future?” — Richie Locasso Hemet

The creatures you describe are oleander aphids also known as plant lice. They are bright yellow-orange in color with black legs. The easiest way of dispatching them is with a strong jet of water. You will probably not knock off monarch eggs since they are more strongly attached to their milkweed host than the offending aphids. Alternatively you can just rub them off the plant and squash them between thumb and forefinger.

If you do spray the aphids with Neem oil (made from seeds of a tropical tree) you will want to wash down the milkweed immediately afterward since monarch caterpillars would be killed if they chomped on stems or leaves coated with Neem.

Detergent sprays are commonly recommended for aphid control the simplest concoction being one tablespoon of dish soap dissolved in a quart of water. However according to Dr. Karen Oberhauser of the University of Minnesota who has studied aphids monarchs and milkweeds for decades “Detergent treatments will kill any live insects on aphid-infested plants including monarch eggs monarch larvae and aphid predators like syrphid fly larvae ladybug larvae and lacewing larvae. There is really no good way to kill aphids without killing everything else except by trying to lower the population by carefully killing them by hand.”

Alas bringing in large populations of predatory insects such as ladybugs or lacewings is also not a good idea since even while chomping on aphids these generally beneficial insects (in larval form) will munch monarch eggs as well.

Aphids are fascinating insects and oleander aphids all the more so. They are both viviparous and parthenogenetic. “Viviparous” means they give birth to live young just like mammals. The difference is that these aphid offspring also known as nymphs are clones of the mother. They will molt four times over the course of their lifetime which lasts twenty-five days and will give birth to as many as 12 aphids in a single day.

The fact that oleander aphids are parthenogenetic means that mating is not needed for reproduction and in fact no male oleander aphids have ever been found. If a milkweed plant is totally overcome with aphids some of them will sprout wings in order to fly to another plant and continue reproducing there.

What appear to be white flakes are a common sight on an aphid-infested plant. These are the skins aphids shed when molting. Dead aphids — puffed up or bloated — and brown to black in color are frequently spotted during an aphid infestation. These are aphids that have been cannibalized by parasitic wasp larvae. Tiny wasps no bigger than a pencil tip pierce the bodies of aphids with an ovipositor through which a wasp egg is passed. As the wasp larva hatches from the egg it consumes the inside of its aphid host before pupating and emerging as an adult wasp.

It is advisable to plant native milkweeds (Asclepias fascicularis and Asclepias speciosa) as opposed to the more commonly seen tropical species (Aesclepias curassavica) the type sold in nurseries that is recognizable by either yellow and orange or pure yellow flowers. The reason for this is that the tropical milkweed is evergreen and will disrupt the natural life cycle of monarchs by enticing them to lay eggs in winter which monarchs do not normally do since their native host milkweeds are dormant in winter. Monarchs that develop from eggs laid in winter have impaired navigation systems and will have difficulty migrating to their overwintering sites. If your milkweed is evergreen keep it cut back during winter so that monarchs will not be able to lay their eggs on it.

You will see oleander aphids not only on milkweeds and oleanders but also on Vincas and Hoyas which are oleander relatives too.

There are two perennial oxalis species that in my humble opinion no garden should be without. Both may appear delicate when you first set eyes on them but both are quite the opposite when it comes to perseverance and longevity in shady to semi-sunny garden spots. Based on my experience of more than two decades during which time I have witnessed both species thriving with little care I cannot find a reason not to have them around.

Purple shamrock (Oxalis regnellii) not only excels in shade gardens but thrives as a houseplant as well. It should only be noted that when you bring a plant indoors that appreciates a shady garden exposure outdoors it will demand a place next to the brightest window in your home in its new environment. That is because the shadiest outdoor exposure is still much brighter than what you will find in most indoor locations except those that are exceptionally sunny.

Purple shamrock’s dramatic appearance features large leaves divided into three triangular sections with pinkish-white flowers almost constantly in bloom. Both the flowers and leaves of purple shamrock are subject to photonasty a term that refers to movement of plant parts in response to light or darkness. At night purple shamrock flowers and leaves close up. Upon doing so the folded leaves take on the appearance of purple butterflies at rest.

If you suddenly see this plant shrivel up as though dead be patient. It is only going through a dormant period and in four to six weeks it will start to send out new growth. This is due to the fact that purple shamrock grows from tubers. Dormancy is the best time to dig up the plant and distribute these tubers to other shady parts of the garden or gift them to friends.

Volcanic sorrel (Oxalis vulcanicola ‘Zinfandel’) has become my favorite ground cover. Clover-like burgundy red foliage is complimented perfectly by yellow flowers. Volcanic sorrel spreads by tuberous rhizomes which you can use in its propagation. A small clump will eventually take over a shady flower bed.

Both of the above plants are fairly drought tolerant once established although they will perform at their best when provided one good soaking per week during the summer. They are marginally frost-tolerant but both of them can be successfully overwintered indoors.

Are you growing an unusual or seldom encountered plant that you would like more people to know about? If so please send me an account of your experience growing it for possible publication here.

Tip of the Week: One of the most glorious options for a flowering hedge is yellow bells (Tecoma stans) which is blooming now and will do so for many months. An orange-flowered cultivar is also available. It grows up to a height of 20 feet with dark green foliage and blackish stems. The plant has an exceptionally clean look and has no need for water or fertilizer once established. For some reason it is virtually absent from local nurseries perhaps due to a reputation for sensitivity to cold yet I have seen it growing in places where winter freezes are common and although damaged by frost to a certain extent it grows back stronger than ever the following spring.

This week’s column is about gypsy moths. More precisely it’s about the caterpillar stage of the gypsy moth’s life cycle. In short I don’t like them not even one tiny bit. However begrudgingly I do admire them as they are survivors.

I have no doubt that many readers have had to deal with these crawling nuisances for the last few weeks either sweeping off patios or wrapping tree trunks in burlap. And you have all reached the same conclusion I have: It just does not seem to be making a dent in their population.

So I guess it’s time to discuss this clash of natural events with the intersection of human nature. First the natural events.

These moths were brought to North America about 150 years ago as part of a commercial venture to find an alternative to the cotton industry. Could these caterpillars be harvested of their bristly hair and the material spun into fabric gold? Nope. Didn’t happen. And so the beasts were released into the wild and our backs were collectively turned.

The moths went “Whee we’re free!” and started on a steady and unfettered increase to their overall population. For the first few decades humanity shrugged this off with a big “so what?” Who’s sorry now?

Before I get to the human reaction part of this column let’s take a quick look at the usual life cycle of these creepy-crawlies. It’s pretty straightforward as far as moths go — eggs caterpillars cocoons adults eggs again.

The problem lies within that one stage the caterpillar. Many moth species do not eat in the adult stage so enough energy and protein must be assimilated prior to that miraculous metamorphic change that takes place with the cocoon the changing of all the body cells from a solid to a fluid and then back to a solid but in a much different configuration. This is like saying you and I can eat all we want from age 10 to 18 but then that’s it for the rest of our lives. So glad I’m not a caterpillar.

As the caterpillar grows it keeps shedding its constrictive outer skin sometimes five times. (Each stage is called an instar.) Not only is it now bigger but the colour and adornments change too. And the bigger it gets the more food it eats in a sitting (and the larger the caterpillar poo gets on your patio).

Then it’s a quick snooze inside a cocoon until out comes the adult moth either male or female. The males can fly and do so; the females cannot so they begin the long trek back up the tree to find a suitable site to attract a male and lay their eggs. Once the mating is done and the eggs are laid both male and female moths drop dead. So glad I’m not a moth.

Now here’s the twist: As gypsy moths are introduced to North America they have no natural controls on their populations. No predators plus abundant food makes for an ever-increasing population. However in time something has to give. When 1.2 bajillion caterpillars start feeding on a forest that has only enough leaves for 0.5 kajillion (not sure of my accuracy but you get the drift) it boils down to simple supply and demand.

Without enough food to go around part of the population gets sick and does not develop well maybe not even getting to the cocoon or mating stages. Indeed with enough sick and weak caterpillars out there viruses can spread like wildfire and start picking them off one by one a thousand by a thousand. Sucks to be them but to the survivors it means that next year there will be enough to go round.

This drastic collapse is called a population crash and it happens quite often in Nature. Not all the critters are killed just a huge proportion of them. The survivors survive and start reproducing to build up their numbers and in 10 years or so. Here we go again.

Which at long last brings me to the second part of this dissertation human behaviours. Full transparency here: I am a human and I do not react well toward gypsy moth caterpillars.

We humans like things which we can control such as where to plant the landscape trees and which species are to go where. When something starts to get out of our control mild panic sets in. We seem to be hard-wired that when a situation occurs that’s out of the norm our brain sends out a message: “Somebody Needs To Do Something. Now!”

And this is where I spring into action. Totally ignoring the much larger ecological world of fact and natural unfolding I grab the blow torch. “Die you miserable invading hairy bits of uninvited filth!” After several days of barbecuing caterpillars yet seeing no reduction in the harm being done to my beautiful oak trees I notice my Good Wife’s bemused grin.

Good Wife is a trained entomologist (a studier of insects) and has an annoyingly large amount of common sense. She points out (as she did last year as well if I recall correctly) that I am not killing all the caterpillars just the hapless ones that rest on the tree trunk at blow torch level. The canopy still has thousands of caterpillars each looking down and laughing at me as they finish off another oak leaf.

So what I’m really doing is easing the competition so that the survivors have lots of food and will grow big and healthy and go into the cocoon stage in good health and later emerge to make lots and lots of egg masses.

This kind of thinking I do not want to hear as another propane bottle fizzles empty.

If and this is a big if we all just stood back and let Nature take its course the caterpillars would die back due to overpopulation the trees would rebound next year just as Nature has programmed them to do and all this wringing of hands and bemoaning of events could perhaps be redirected to something that actually matters.

But I am human and there are colonies of big fat juicy caterpillars staring me in the face so it’s off to the hardware store I go for another bottle of propane. “Leave them alone? Let Nature take its course?” Ha I laugh in your face! My mind is set. Futile effort is my middle name.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9tcy1pcy1naXZpbmctYXdheS10aG91c2FuZHMtb2YtZnJlZS1jb2xpbi10aGUtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItY2FrZXMtdG9kYXktMTQ4NzA0NTIv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9tZXRyby5jby51ay8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L21zLWlzLWdpdmluZy1hd2F5LXRob3VzYW5kcy1vZi1mcmVlLWNvbGluLXRoZS1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1jYWtlcy10b2RheS0xNDg3MDQ1Mi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&S is giving away free Colin the Caterpillar cakes today,"Grab a free mini Colin today (Picture: M&S)

That’s what’s changed and shifted the demand in Los Angeles” said Darren Eades a managing director at JLL Alex Smith a vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said demand for data centers in L.A. was increasing even before Covid.

“The demand in L.A. really started to increase (in) about 2017 and the demand has sustained itself over the last four years. Prior to that it was in a lull” he said.

Local property owners have taken note.

“We are interested in the data center space because we believe digital real estate is now going to always be a part of an investor’s asset allocation in real estate” Chris Rising chief executive of downtown-based Rising Realty Partners said in an email. “The cloud is powering businesses and consumer products and reliable power and (the demand for) quality buildings to house servers is not going away.”

Rising Realty owns West 7 Center a major data center downtown and the company is interested in acquiring more.

Despite the rapid growth L.A. still trails other data center hotspots around the country.

“In general tenants are choosing to migrate to more cost-effective markets and solutions for their data centers when possible” said Kristina Metzger a senior vice president at CBRE Group Inc. In areas like Phoenix she explained power is much cheaper and taxes are lower than in L.A.

Eades agreed that L.A. isn’t as large as other data center markets.

“I’ve been doing this for almost 25 years now and the data center market in L.A. has been extremely secondary” he said. “Most users are local small users — health care technology gaming and such. The majority of data center users have gone to other markets primarily due to cost.”

Still experts said L.A.’s large population requires a significant number of data centers.

“L.A. is a market where you’ve got a lot of people … and the data center growth there is primarily driven by the ability and the need to touch eyeballs. Everyone is addicted to screens these days” Smith said.

Unique requirements

Data centers have a unique set of requirements including large amounts of power fiber high ceilings and large holding weights.

“You need a hard facility that can withstand earthquakes. It has to be structurally advanced; you need high ceilings strong floor loads 250 pounds per square foot and you need a ton of power” Smith said. “Typically data center operators want to build 200 to 300 watts per square foot of power in the facility.”

The space can range from 5000 to hundreds of thousands of square feet according to Eades.

“The key isn’t the size; it’s the amount of power” he said. “It’s mainly power and connectivity. You need to have fiber connections and you need to be able to get all the fiber you need.”

He added that a lot of equipment was stored in these buildings so floor loading was necessary. The buildings also have to be earthquake safe. And because some providers stack servers they want high ceilings.

Metzger said the specific needs are why most data centers are purpose built and not conversions.

Most data centers in L.A. are located downtown particularly at One Wilshire a building that has hundreds of fiber strands.

“The epicenter of data centers is One Wilshire … The majority of fiber runs through that building and all throughout all the other data centers. Everybody wants to be connected to that” Eades said. “It’s one of the most valuable assets out there.”

Metzger called One Wilshire “one of the most interconnected buildings in the entire country.”

The other hub of data centers in L.A. is El Segundo which Metzger said has emerged as a cheaper alternative.

“El Segundo is a more cost-effective location than downtown L.A.” she said. “Downtown L.A. has LADWP and El Segundo has Southern California Edison which is a little bit of a lower power cost.”

Growing investor interest

In 2020 there were 160000 square feet and 9 megawatts of data center space (which has since opened) under construction in L.A. County according to data from JLL.

But experts agree that there isn’t extensive data center construction in L.A.

“The price of construction is so expensive and the residential boom has priced data centers out because the cost of land is so expensive” Smith said.

He added that environmental issues and permits necessary for generators also slow the building of data centers.

Metzger said the cost of land was an issue in getting more data centers built but for those that are already here that means more demand.

“For data centers that are existing in Southern California there’s very tightened investor interest and demand given the criticality of the asset and (that it’s) difficult to replicate that infrastructure” she said.

Eades added that some industrial buildings capable of holding a data center are being “gobbled up” by big companies instead of being used as data centers.

Experts expect continued demand.

“It’s going to continue to grow” Smith said. “We are more and more reliant on technology and infrastructure. The more cloud infrastructure that’s out there it needs to be housed in an industrial facility that has the ability to stay online so our products won’t go down.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hbnl0aW1lLWZpdG5lc3Mtb3duZXItcmV0b29scy1hcy1pdC1jb21lcy1vdXQtb2YtcGFuZGVtaWMvNjAwMDc0NjkyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anytime Fitness owner retools as it comes out of pandemic,"One of the biggest lessons from the coronavirus pandemic should be a need to focus more on health at all levels said Anytime Fitness co-founder Chuck Runyon.

Runyon — who is chief executive of Self Esteem Brands whose fitness clubs include Anytime Fitness Basecamp Fitness and the Bar Method — said the world needs to look at health more holistically and he hopes his company will help people be more proactive and comprehensive about how they stay healthy.

The Woodbury-based company's purchase of digital nutrition coaching business Stronger U is the latest move to expand its business both in scope and platform.

""COVID shined a spotlight on the core health of developed countries around the world. Most people during COVID unfortunately were less active and they did not eat correctly"" Runyon said. ""We are left still [with] the epidemic of poor nutrition low body intelligence and unhealthiness so there's never been more of a need for nutrition and fitness.""

Runyon started the 24-hour gym chain Anytime Fitness with co-founders Dave Mortensen and Jeff Klinger in 2002. Self Esteem Brands has grown to about 5000 locations worldwide including Anytime Fitness which makes up the lion's share of the clubs.

Self Esteem Brands' annual revenue before the pandemic was $2.2 billion with the company seeing an average year-over-year revenue growth of about 18% each year.

In 2012 Runyon and Mortensen brought hair removal salon chain Waxing The City into their company fold as part of a strategy to expand ""into recession-resilient industries"" according to a news release. Since then Self Esteem Brands in 2018 picked up Basecamp Fitness which focuses on scheduled class workouts and the barre exercise chain the Bar Method the next year.

Other fitness companies also are expanding their scope. Chanhassen-based Life Time dropped ""fitness"" from its name four years ago because as CEO Bahram Akradi explained ""the company is so much more than fitness"" as it broadens services into co-working spaces and living complexes. Many of the larger fitness chains such as LA Fitness and Planet Fitness produce a plethora of digital content on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle or offer fitness training online.

Self Esteem Brands had been in discussions with Stronger U for several years before the acquisition was solidified.

""We've always wanted to add nutrition to our portfolio"" Runyon said. ""We all understand how important nutrition is as food as energy how it controls mood and of course for weight loss. Now that we can add this we get more holistic in our full support of our members.""

Stronger U offers personalized nutrition coaching with weekly nutrition and lifestyle recommendations. Runyon said Stronger U makes Self Esteem's fitness portfolio unique by connecting existing gym members with an additional service that he compared to ""having our own Weight Watchers within our portfolio.""

Founded in 2015 Stronger U has reached more than 50000 members mostly through word-of-mouth. With Self Esteem Brands' network of facilities Stronger U can continue to grow and attract new members Runyon said. Self Esteem Brands already has certified personal trainers within their fitness centers who could also be trained to be nutritional coaches for Stronger U. The company hopes to double Stronger U's membership base year-over-year in the next three years and expand access to the platform globally so that it is available in multiple languages.

As more people have added to their personal fitness equipment at home during the pandemic or plan to use exercise equipment at their offices as they return to work fitness centers have to stay competitive said Alex Wang a retail research analyst for CBRE who has studied the fitness boom in the Washington D.C. area.

""If gyms were to survive and were to add value it would have to be in the service component not in the equipment"" Wang said.

With the adoption of telemedicine Wang said he could see how digital nutrition coaching can be appealing especially coupled with workouts so health goals could be integrated and tracked. Despite the expanded digital fluency of the average consumer Wang said he believed physical gyms were here to stay.

""The reason why you go to the gym in the first place is for the community and the motivation for your to reach your fitness goals"" he said.

Self Esteem Brands first learned of COVID-19 through its dozen locations in China that had to shut down during the initial outbreak and then later its clubs in Italy and Spain. Company leaders hadn't foreseen how the pandemic would spread across the world but ""within a matter of weeks unbelievably we shut down an entire network 5000 stores around the world in a very patchwork rapid fashion"" Runyon said.

While fitness club locations have reopened in the United States there are still clubs in other parts of the world that haven't reopened such as in Canada and Europe Runyon said.

During the pandemic Self Esteem Brands concentrated on how it could help members stay healthy at home and produced more digital content and remote coaching on topics such as nutritional guidance.

The company also worked with a developer to create a reservation capacity system so members could reserve their time in the gym based on capacity restrictions a system they plan to keep after the pandemic. Anytime Fitness' model of being open 24-7 allowed members to spread out when they were at clubs and provided ""a massive advantage"" to the business Runyon said.

While Self Esteem Brands did learn to adapt the last year has been challenging as the company and individual franchisees have had to deal with capacity restrictions mask mandates changing cleaning guidelines and consumers that needed their memberships frozen or canceled as they could no longer visit the gym.

Self Esteem Brands had to help franchisees with lease negotiations with landlords and access to local emergency funding while at the same time lobbying government policymakers so gyms could be reopen. The company estimates it was able to obtain about $400 million in domestic accommodations for its franchisees through rent relief and state and national relief funding.

Still more money is needed to help those in the fitness industry who were the first to close down during the pandemic Runyon said. Self Esteem Brands continues to push for the passage of the Gyms Act which would create a $30 billion fund to provide grants to affected businesses in the health and fitness industry.

In the last two months Self Esteem is starting to go back to pre-pandemic numbers with usage rates around 80% systemwide Runyon said. Personal training has seen a surge and is near pre-pandemic levels.

Waxing The City has reached all-time highs in monthly revenue and retail sales likely because people are traveling and outside for the summer he said. Studio traffic for group fitness classes has started to come back as well though more slowly. By the fall Runyon estimated business overall will be back to the pre-pandemic levels or possibly above.

As Self Esteem continues to build out its capabilities company leaders say it's possible that Self Esteem Brands could expand services to help people in a variety of health areas such as in sleep and healthy meal delivery.

""I firmly believe that care for self-esteem is an outcome of the pandemic something people will take more seriously and seek services to help them manage"" said Mortensen who serves as Self Esteem Brands' president. ""We're evolving next into a space where fitness nutrition and wellness services are viewed and sought more holistically and the directions that we can potentially go next for our growth are exciting. ... We will seek new brands to join us new franchise owners to invest with us and a wider range of communities — especially communities of color — for our brands to operate and thrive.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGVzb3VyY2UuY29tLmF1L21hY3F1YXJpZS1wYXJrLW9mZmljZS1zaG93cm9vbS1jb2xsZWN0cy01NW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Macquarie Park office/showroom collects $55m,"AMP sold Sekisui House at 68 Waterloo Road in April.

RF Corval has sold a Macquarie Park office for $55 million.

The deal with Charter Hall for its Deep Value Property partnership reflects a 5.23 per cent initial yield.

The vendor paid $34m in 2016.

That seller Abacus acquired it four years earlier from receivers Ferrier Hodgson – outlaying $17.35m.

Macquarie Park is about 13 kilometres north west of Sydney.

37 Epping Road Macquarie Park

On 8010 square metres 37 Epping Road was purpose built in 2003 for Officeworks which still occupies.

Over four levels it contains a 5752 sqm office – 60pc tenanted to Teva Pharmaceuticals – a 2522 sqm showroom and 232 car parks part within a basement and mezzanine.

The ground floor is also fit out with a café.

Fully let the Weighted Average Lease Expiry is 3.2 years.

CBRE’s Scott Gray Spencer and Kenny Duncanson with Knight Frank represented RF Corval which is backed by former Multiplex chief Andrew Roberts (story continues below).

“The asset received strong interest attracted to the quality of the existing improvements tenancy profile excellent exposure to Epping Rd and significant land holding with potential development upside” Mr Duncanson said.

String of Macquarie Park office deals

The Epping Rd deal comes three months since AMP sold Sekisui House at 68 Waterloo Rd for $106.5m.

Not long earlier the same vendor banked $71m from ESR Australia for an office/warehouse on 1.5 hectares in the street – at #44-50.

In December another AMP trust asset in the suburb – 1-5 Thomas Holt Drive – collected $288.9m from Ascendas Reit.

That buyer two months earlier picked up MCX4 an unbuilt office within the Macquarie Exchange business park being established by Frasers Property Industrial and Winten Property Group for $167.2m.

Goodman Group has recently sold two assets in the suburb: the Macquarie Park Corporate Centre for $144m to AEW Capital and Pinnacle Office Park to Keppel REIT ($306m).

Last July Stockland struck a deal to acquire Johnson & Johnson’s sprawling Macquarie Park headquarters – 1-5 Khartoum Rd – conditional on it building the vendor a replacement office in the area.

(AP) — As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLXdhbGVzLTU3NDk5NTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pandemic investing: 'Using my part-time pay to invest in stocks',"Pandemic investing: 'Using my part-time pay to invest in stocks' Published 4 July 2021 Share close panel Copy link About sharing

Richard Jones 18 has spent much of the past year working at Home Bargains. The rest of the time he's been investing in stocks.

The A-level student is among the thousands of people who've got involved via online share-trading platforms during the Covid pandemic.

But while social media is awash with those flashing the trappings of trades and boasting of vast earnings consumer groups and experts warn of the less ""instagrammable"" risks.

Richard from Penrhyn Bay Conwy county said it had certainly been a ""rollercoaster"".

""In January I was getting quite bored during lockdown and I needed something new to get into and I wanted to find a way of making my money work for me"" said Richard.

""I was up quite a bit at one point then down quite a lot. Now I suppose I'm up £400"" he said.

Online brokers such as Charles Schwab TD Ameritrade Etrade and Robinhood have seen millions of new accounts opened during the pandemic particularly when fear stalked the markets and prices dropped in March 2020.

The emergence of online share-trading apps where users can buy shares or fractions of shares on their mobile phones for low fees has driven this new wave of interest.

Image source VIEW press/Getty Images Image caption GameStop hit the headlines in 2021

""I saw quite a lot of videos on investing on TikTok and YouTube and it sort of got me into it"" said Richard. ""I decided to just watch more and more videos and teach myself about it to see what to put my money into.""

He has put in £3000 from a trust fund previous savings and cash he has put by while working part-time at Home Bargains before he heads off to study politics at the University of York.

The influx of amateur investors hit the headlines earlier this year during high-profile clashes over several so-called ""meme"" stocks.

These involved major hedge funds battling with retail investors swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit or Twitter and driving up prices on stocks for companies including GameStop and AMC.

'Mistakes are not instagrammable'

Gary Power of investment company Charles Stanley said the Cardiff office where he worked had seen roughly double the usual number of young students getting in touch in connection with work experience since March 2020.

""It's increased because of what we've seen - the fact that it is now front-page news"" he said adding that client enquiries about investing had also risen.

However he urged anyone thinking about investing their own money not to be seduced by the image of massive rewards with low risks.

""You could argue that some smaller retail investors might have shot the lights out [in the last year] but many others would have found themselves in very difficult situations.

""And generally people will not own up to their mistakes - that is not instagrammable.""

Others have warned that online discussion forums and social media can put pressure on inexperienced investors and for some trading can become addictive.

'I wouldn't have known about trading if it wasn't for Covid'

Image source Nicola Knight Image caption Nicola Knight started with an investment of £2000 and is currently about 1500% up

Nicola Knight 41 a marketing manager and mother-of-three from Llantwit Fardre Pontypridd started investing in June 2020 and now counts herself among the thousands of UK day and swing traders - those carrying out several trades within one or a few days to take advantage of market movement.

""I would never have known about any of this if it wasn't for Covid because of the impact it had on pension funds in the stock market"" she said.

She started with an investment of £2000 and is currently about 1500% up - although she said she had spent the first six months losing as much as she made while learning about the market.

""For me trading is a purpose to get a cash flow that is coming in as supplemental income. So we live our normal lifestyle from our normal income and then any money we get from trading goes into a separate pot.

""Ideally I want to buy properties at auction or in cash so that there's no mortgage on them which will be for our retirement.""

Nicola said interest in investing had grown massively in the last 16 months with a Facebook group she helped to run for investors in penny stocks - those worth less than $5 (about £3.60) a share - now having more than 7500 members.

However she said due diligence and strategy were key.

""I try to tell everyone in my network 'please please don't buy stock if you know nothing about it. Just because somebody has mentioned something don't buy it'.""

What to consider if you're thinking about investing?

Image caption Guy Anker said it was also important not to put all your eggs in one basket

Guy Anker deputy editor of the Money Saving Expert website said it had seen more inquiries from people about different kinds of investing as rates for traditional savings accounts had dropped even lower from a low base during the pandemic.

""If there's one thing for you to consider when it comes to investing it's risk"" he said.

""Sometimes there's potential to make lots of money but you can lose some or all of your money never lose sight of that. Make sure you only invest money you can afford to lose and do your research before going ahead with it.""

He said it was important people considered what kind of investment if any might be right for them as there were numerous options.

'Not a way to make quick cash'

""A lot of people start out with funds. This is typically where a fund manager will run a fund of money for lots of people. They are going to spread that risk among lots of types of shares - maybe different commodities maybe corporate bonds gilts shares they could go into art - who knows?

""But funds are a good way to start because somebody else is doing a lot of the leg work for you.""

He said it was also important not to put all your eggs in one basket and to be aware that you cannot necessarily access your money as quickly and easily as with a savings account if it's invested.

""Linked to that it's normally best to save for the long-term. Investing shouldn't be seen as a way to make quick cash.""

“Whomever is downloading movies illegally PLEASE STOP!” the signs read. “My internet is going to be turned off permanently because of your actions. PLEASE STOP!”

Owners Sue and Scott Brucker are facing copyright infringement strikes from their internet service provider Spectrum due to an unknown person illegally downloading content using their Wi-Fi.

As of June 23 they had been hit with 12 infractions — the maximum amount of infractions they can get before their internet is completely shut down Sue said.

Spectrum itself is not the one enacting the copyright infringement notices however. It’s Disney. Spectrum just sends the notices on behalf of the conglomerate the Bruckers said.

Online after hours

In the past the Bruckers had around one or two copyright infractions they said. They have owned Mocha Lisa located at 2825 4 1/2 Mile Rd. since 2009 and have kept free Wi-Fi as a part of their service ever since then.

Since this spring however the Bruckers have been getting hit with copyright strikes left and right.

“It’s weekly” Sue said. “It could be two three times a week but it’s a weekly thing.”

The Bruckers don’t know who is doing it. What they do know is what’s being downloaded and when it’s being downloaded.

According to the notices Spectrum has given the Bruckers the user or users is illegally downloading Disney movies and television shows after the coffeehouse’s hours. The Bruckers know nothing about the identity of the downloader beyond an IP address.

Allegedly the user is downloading new episodes of Disney+ shows like “Loki” and “Star Wars: The Bad Batch” as they come out Scott said. The infractions occur usually between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.

The coffeehouse closes daily at 5 p.m. except on Sunday when it closes at 2 p.m.

“They’re either on the road or my parking lot wherever they’re doing it” Sue said. “They could even be on my dock or my yard wherever you can get the signal from around here.”

Not able to track down who the user is the Bruckers posted signs throughout the coffeehouse to get the message out there in case the user happens to walk inside.

“I feel like I’m punishing my regular people for something somebody else is doing” Sue said. “I know it’s not them. … I don’t know what else I can do. I mean I’m just at my wit’s end.”

‘At a disadvantage’

“Our job is to provide you with the internet service what you do with it is your responsibility” Sue recalled Spectrum representatives telling her.

Kim Haas — state senior director of communications for Charter Communications which facilitates Spectrum — was initially responsive to questions posed by the Journal Times. But when a reporter told her that the copyright holder was Disney Haas said “We don’t have anything to share.”

On the technical side the Bruckers have upgraded their Wi-Fi services and bolstered their firewall to safeguard against more illegal downloading.

A firewall is installed in a computer to block any malicious software or any unauthorized access to the network which may give access to important passwords and information.

Currently customers can access Mocha Lisa’s Wi-Fi through a provided password. The user behind the illegal downloading “knows what they’re doing” however Scott said.

The Bruckers can consider putting more restrictions on Wi-Fi usage with the caveat that users can only be on Wi-Fi for a short amount of time may have to pay extra to stay on for extended time or may sacrifice connection speed.

“That’s not something we want to pass on to our guests” Scott said. “When I go to Mocha Lisa I may have to do this. But when I go to McDonald’s I just walk in and I’m all good. Now we’re at a disadvantage.”

Policing Wi-Fi?

Scott said the corporations behind the media being misused should be the ones responsible for policing any copyright infringements. In other words the little guys shouldn’t be getting in trouble for something they can’t control.

“If they (media companies) are actually policing it enough to know somebody is doing this illegally then they should go after that person” Sue said. “It shouldn’t have to be up to me to do that.”

Racine Public Library offers free Wi-Fi and free internet on their computers. Librarian Darcy Mohr head of adult and youth services said the library has a policy to ensure illegal activity doesn’t occur on their network. But like the Bruckers they aren’t able to monitor what their patrons do behind the screen. It’s the patrons’ responsibility.

“It’s a privacy issue when you try to police” Mohr said of accessing logs of what websites their patrons visit. If someone were to break policy the library would find out when it’s brought to their attention.

The library rarely sees cases of patrons breaking the rules Mohr said. But they are able to suspend or restrict a patron from the library if it happens.

Jon Procunier — vice president of Racine County-based e-vergent which is providing free internet access points across Racine County to increase technological accessibility — said the company uses a high-powered firewall to ensure the connections are clean of any illegal activity.

“Small businesses of the world have been left to their own devices to figure it out” Procunier said adding it shouldn’t be that way. “It’s almost like death by a thousand cuts. You learn as you go.”

The Brucks have received much support from their customers after posting on Facebook about their situation. “I just don’t want to upset my customers out here” Sue said.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMjAyMTA3MDMtY2hldnJvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron to proceed with $4B Jansz-Io subsea compression project,"Chevron announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Chevron Australia Pty Ltd. (Chevron Australia) as operator and the Gorgon joint venture participants will proceed with the approximately $4-billion (AU$6 billion) Jansz-Io Compression (J-IC) project.

Jansz-Io will be the first gas field outside Norway where the subsea compression technology comes to use. It is located around 200 kilometers off the Australian north-west coast at a water depth of approximately 1350 meters (4429 feet).

The J-IC Project objective is to unlock low pressure reserves from the Jansz-Io reservoir and maintain plateau production rates to the Gorgon Project facilities on Barrow Island (BWI).





A modification of the existing Gorgon development J-IC will involve the construction and installation of a 27000-tonne normally unattended floating Field Control Station (FCS) approximately 6500 tonnes of subsea compression infrastructure and a 135km submarine power cable linked to Barrow Island.





Construction and installation activities are estimated to take approximately five years to complete.

Nigel Hearne Chevron Eurasia Pacific Exploration and Production president said J-IC represents Chevron’s most significant capital investment in Australia since the sanctioning of the Gorgon Stage 2 project in 2018.

Using world-leading subsea compression technology J-IC is positioned to maintain gas supply from the Jansz-Io field to the three existing LNG trains and domestic gas plant on Barrow Island. This will maintain an important source of clean-burning natural gas to customers that will enable energy transitions in countries across the Asia Pacific region. —Nigel Hearne

J-IC follows the Gorgon Stage 2 project which is nearing completion of the installation phase to supply gas to the Gorgon plant from four new Jansz-Io and seven new Gorgon wells.

The Chevron-operated Gorgon Project is a joint venture between the Australian subsidiaries of Chevron (47.333%) ExxonMobil (25%) Shell (25%) Osaka Gas (1.25%) Tokyo Gas (1%) and JERA (0.417%).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvaG93LWxhc3QtY2VudHVyeXMtb2lsLXdlbGxzLWFyZS1tZXNzaW5nLXdpdGgtdGV4YXMtcmlnaHQtbm93L2FydGljbGVfZDQ0MWRmMTAtZGFjZC0xMWViLTkyNmQtZDMyOWMyY2U1OWUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How last century's oil wells are messing with Texas right now,How last century's oil wells are messing with Texas right now,,,,,,,,,

Numerator a data and tech company said its survey found 68% of consumers expect to return to normal holiday celebrations this summer on or by the Fourth of July. However 8% of consumers said in the survey they planned to go out to eat or for drinks and another 7% said they were bringing food or drinks in.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that adults and kids not fully vaccinated should wear a mask indoors and in crowded outdoor spaces. The CDC changed mask guidance for fully vaccinated people on May 13 and major retailers started updating mask policies the next day.

Panera Bread is scheduled to end its three-day free bagel giveaway Sunday for customers who received a COVID-19 vaccine and 7-Eleven is giving away free Slurpee drinks to rewards members throughout July. Check to make sure your Panera is open before heading out as some locations are closed for the holiday.

Krispy Kreme's daily free doughnut giveaway for vaccinated customers continues through the end of the year but the chain also has special patriotic treats.

Chipotle Mexican Grill will offer a COVID-19 incentive on July 6 from 3 p.m. to closing time at participating restaurants nationwide with the purchase of an entree.

Restaurants open July 4th

Check with your closest location to confirm they are open and to find out holiday hours. Some locations will be closed as it is often a franchisee decision on whether to open for holidays.

All these casual chain restaurants share a common theme and that’s their focus on quality ingredients affordable prices and fast service.

This rapid-growing restaurant concept during the past decade is known as “fast casual“. A more upscale approach to eating out fast casual combines affordability with higher quality ingredients compared to “fast food” (in industry parlance “quick service” or QSR) restaurants like McDonald’s or KFC.

The Rise of Colorado-based Fast Casual Restaurants

Although patrons order from a menu board fast casual establishments provide a more refined ambiance than the typical hash house. After placing their orders diners sit down to enjoy their repast much as they would at a “casual” restaurant like a diner. While disposable dishes and plasticware are the norms fast casual eateries add value by offering premiums such as organic ingredients and perceived “healthier” menu options.

Food industry research firm Technomic sets the following metrics for “fast casual” restaurants:

Self-service or limited service

Meal prices average between $8 – $15

“Made-to-order” menu options with greater flavor variety compared to fast food

Unique upscale and (or) highly refined decor

Usually does not offer “driv-thru” window service

The 1980s in Colorado saw the onset of what’s now called fast casual restaurants offering subs pizza and burgers. In the 1990s fast casual establishments began dishing out burritos sushi and pasta. With the new millennium came fast casual breakfast and salads eateries.

Below are 15 fast casual restaurants with Colorado origins. Some have hundreds—even thousands—of locations nationwide and internationally while the smallest has less than a dozen.

1. Quiznos – Started 1981 in Denver CO

Quiznos first opened in 1981 at 1275 Grant Street in Denver’s Capitol Hill area; the location is still in operation. The sub chain once boasted 5000 locations spanning Asia to Europe to South America and North America. In its heyday Quiznos was second only to Subway in North America as a sub shop chain. In 2016 sales ranked Quiznos as the ninth-largest sub chain and by May 2018 only 1500 U.S. locations remained.

Quiznos is no longer Colorado-owned. While the company is still headquartered in Denver San Diego-based High Bluff Capital Partners a private equity firm bought Quiznos in June 2018. The company reported a revenue of US $170 million in 2017. Money.com ranked Quiznos in 2018 as the 14th-best fast casual chain in the U.S.

The shop chain that popularized “Mmmm…Toasty” (and prodded Subway into toasting subs) is no moribund brand. Emerging from a slew of franchisee class-action lawsuits following the Great Recession the chain plans to roll out over 1000 locations in 40+ countries (mostly in Asia) by 2020.

2. Anthony’s Pizza & Pasta – Started 1984 in CO

Starting business in 1984 this chain counts 23 locations along the Front Range from Windsor south to Colorado Springs. Anthony’s uses pure olive oil imported from Italy pizza dough made daily and 100% whole milk mozzarella cheese shredded by hand.

Anthony’s makes two kinds of New York-style pizzas: a thin-crust Neapolitan pizza with either white or red sauce and a Sicilian thick crust pizza with red sauce. Both styles are available by the slice. Gluten-free pies can be had as well.

The chain also offers a variety of salads available with the diner’s protein of choice premium pasta made with 100% semolina flour Italian subs and hoagies—even three styles of chicken wings. Those with a sweet tooth can order New York-style cheesecake tiramisu or cannoli for dessert. Note that menus vary by location.

3. Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custards – Started 1987 in Boulder CO

Based in Lakewood Good Times opened its first location in Boulder in 1987. It started publicly trading on NASDAQ in 1992. Most franchisees are located in Colorado; Wyoming has two. Many (if not all) locations have WiFi available for customers.

Calling itself a “quick service” restaurant Good Times is a fast food style restaurant with drive thru at all its locations. Good Times serves all-Angus beef all-natural chicken breakfast burritos made with Hatch Valley green chile beer-battered onion rings and signature “Wild Fries.” Deserts include frozen custard “hand-spun” shakes sundaes and their famous “Spoonbenders.”

For canine “furkids” Good Times offers the “Pawbender”—vanilla custard served in a “lick-friendly” cup with peanut butter and three doggie biscuits. Just ask it’s complimentary!

4. Santiago’s Mexican Restaurants – Started 1991 in Brighton CO

Local Carmen Morales opened the first Santiago’s in her home town of Brighton in 1991. She’s since grown her empire to include 28 franchised and company-owned restaurants across the Front Range. (The Eastern Plains towns of Fort Morgan and Sterling have locations as well.)

Santiago’s specialty is their famous breakfast burrito made with the family’s secret green chile recipe. Restaurants use locally-sourced eggs from Platteville and Hatch green chiles from New Mexico. Most locations serve full lunch and dinners as well as breakfast items. Other menu choices include tamales chile rellenos Indian tacos Mexican hamburgers fajitas carne asada and enchiladas.

Santiago’s is a Denver-area favorite; its smothered breakfast burrito and green chile have received numerous awards from local publications. Morales claims their restaurants use almost a half-million gallons of green chile per year. They also serve New Mexico-style red chile.

5. Chipotle Mexican Grill – Started 1993 in Denver CO (HQ in Newport Beach CA)

Named after the dried and smoked jalapeño pepper Chipotle opened its first location at 1644 East Evans Avenue near the DU campus (still in operation). Now a publicly-traded company (CMG) on the NYSE (and part of the S&P 500) as of 2018 the chain counted more than 2000 locations in the U.S. Canada the U.K. France and Germany.

After calling Denver home for 25 years in June 2018 Chipotle relocated to Newport Beach CA. Also in early 2018 Chipotle announced that Taco Bell exec Brian Niccol would replace founder Steve Ells as CEO. While Wall Street greeted the news by launching Chipotle’s stock up 12% CNBC’s Jim Cramer criticized the move as “against everything the (company) stands for.” Ells remains as board chair.

Despite two E. coli outbreaks in 2015 sickening diners in 14 states Chipotle was ranked 11th in 2018 among the best fast casual U.S. chains by money.com due to their use of high-quality ingredients which include open-range pork and organic produce.

Menu offerings at Chipotle are limited to five categories: Mission-style burritos tacos bowls quesadillas and salads. Vegetarian options are available. After expanding the menu in 2007 Ells remarked “(If you) keep the menu focused you can ensure (doing) them better than anybody else.” Most locations offer margaritas and beer.

6. Qdoba Mexican Eats – Started 1995 in Denver CO (HQ in San Diego CO)

One of Chipotle’s fiercest competitors is Qdoba which first opened in 1995 at the corner of Grant Street and Sixth Avenue in Denver. Originally known as Zuma Fresh Mexican Grill the original location is still open for business.

Like Chipotle Qdoba departed for California leaving Lakewood for San Diego in 2017 after parent Jack in the Box (which acquired Qdoba in 2003) integrated the company into their corporate headquarters. In March 2018 when Qdoba was sold to Apollo Global Management the chain had over 700 outlets in 47 states D.C. and Canada.

Too like Chipotle Qdoba is known primarily for its Mission-style burrito but also serves quesadillas nachos tacos and Mexican “gumbo.” Food is prepared in open kitchens in plain sight of patrons. Qdoba also serves breakfast; some locations remain open 24 hours during weekends.

While considered Qdoba didn’t crack the top 15 in money.com’s best fast casual chains in the U.S. for 2018.

7. Noodles & Company – Started 1995 in Denver CO (HQ in Broomfield CO)

Based in Broomfield Noodles & Company started its first restaurant in Denver’s Cherry Creek neighborhood in October 1995. Now a publicly-traded company listed on the NASDAQ (NDSL) the company has 459 locations in 29 states and D.C.

After a rocky start and numerous negative reviews founder (and former Pepsi marketing exec) Aaron Kennedy overhauled the company’s operations. Changes included a modified menu revamped decor (such as recycled bamboo furniture and softer lighting) and new pricing. Management also installed sauté lines to prepare dishes as they were ordered.

As the name indicates restaurants feature both American and international noodle dishes. Other offerings include pasta soups and salads. Most entrees are vegetarian-based with a choice of protein toppings. Gluten-free options are also available.

While some outlets are owned by franchisees Noodles & Company has a reputation for carefully selecting franchise partners and thus has more corporate-owned outlets than most franchising restaurants. It tied for 9th place on money.com’s list of best fast casual chains in the U.S. for 2018.

8. Illegal Pete’s – Started 1995 in Boulder CO

With just 11 locations across Colorado and Arizona Illegal Pete’s ranks among the smallest chains on our list. It’s another Mission-style burrito eatery and it too began business in 1995. Founder Pete Turner opened the first location in Boulder’s The Hill (still in operation) just west of the University of Colorado campus.

With a relaxed yet nonconformist vibe Illegal Pete’s is a favorite haunt of athletes musicians and college students. Rock musician Jack Johnson claims that while eating a burrito at Illegal Pete’s in The Hill Universal Records first contacted him about a record deal. The restaurant also gives “Starving Artists” free food vouchers in advance to touring bands when they hit a town with an Illegal Pete’s outlet.

Like its competitors Illegal Pete’s has a simple menu of burritos tacos nachos and salad. Add-ons include grilled chicken or steak pork carnitas shredded beef and beer-battered fish. Customers can choose sides such as pinto beans primavera or fajita veggies tortillas and cheese or sour cream. (Guacamole can be substituted for dairy.) “Extras” are potatoes green chile queso and poblano pesto.

All ingredients used in Illegal Pete’s dishes are locally sourced; meats are antibiotic- and hormone-free. While bar options vary by location happy hour is from 3 – 8 pm with an extensive selection of local craft beers.

9. Tokyo Joe’s – Started 1993 in Englewood CO

Now with 46 locations in Colorado Arizona and Texas Tokyo Joe’s began operations in 1996 at 8727 East Dry Creek Road in Centennial. Asian-cuisine inspired Tokyo Joe’s prepares made-to-order dishes using proprietary recipes. Their model combines both full service and fast casual concepts.

Started by ex-pro skier Larry Leith Tokyo Joe’s offers white and brown rice and udon noodle bowls salads and made-to-order sushi rolls. Ingredients are sourced from mostly organic vegetables and “natural” meats. The menu is MSG-free with gluten-free options available. All dishes are either steamed or grilled.

To spur growth beyond Colorado in 2013 Leith sold a majority stake of his company to private-equity firm Gridiron Capital. Greg McDonald former Quiznos CEO assumed chief executive duties of the chain. Leith became chief innovation officer saying: “(McDonald is responsible for) making Tokyo Joe’s bigger. I’m (responsible for) making it better.” McDonald has since been replaced as CEO by Mark Davis.

10. Snarf’s Sandwiches – Started 1996 in Boulder CO

Founded in Boulder by Jimmy “Snarf” Seidel in 1996 the original location at Pearl and 21st fondly known by locals as “The Shack” closed in 2007 a victim of soaring real estate prices. Seidel moved his flagship catty-corner across Pearl Street but developers struck again forcing him to close on March 27 2019 to make room for new townhomes.

Residents need not fret; Seidel plans to soon reopen his flagship at 2660 Pearl and Boulder is still home to three other Snarf’s locations. Seidel’s empire (which now includes three Snarfburger outlets) counts 22 Snarf’s Sandwich locations as far afield as St. Louis and Austin.

Seidel’s oven-toasted sandwiches feature his combination of giardiniera peppers premium cheeses hand-sliced meats and fresh crusty bread. Menu choices include French Dip the Italian NY Steak and Prime Rib as well as salads with homemade dressings and soups. Vegetarian and gluten-free fare is available as is catering.

Seidel strives to create a unique vibe for each location with custom décor and commissioned mosaics and artwork from Nederland native Jen Haley.

11. MAD Greens – Started 2004 in Centennial CO

Now with 33 locations scattered across the Front Range to the metro areas of Phoenix and Austin MAD Greens first began tossing their salads in 2004 at the northeast corner of East County Line Road and South Yosemite Street in Centennial.

Co-founders Dan Long and Marley Hodgson sold their company in 2013 to the Coors family company AC Restaurant Group which expanded MAD Greens to Arizona and Texas. Just within the last month (October 2019) MAD Greens merged with Dallas-based Snappy Salads to form Salad Collective led by the MAD Greens management team of Darden Coors and John Montgomery. The two companies will continue operating under their respective brands.

MAD Greens is noted for its signature salads named after “MAD” people like Ty Cobb Bonnie Parker and Pancho Villa. Their menu also includes grain bowls wraps soups and juices. The restaurant strives to deliver healthy meals lickety-split in a clean but austere dining environment.

12. Larkburger (maybe Lark Spot) – Started 2006 in Edwards CO

Debuting in 2006 the first Larkburger opened at the Edwards Village Center mall off I-70 in Vail Valley. The chain which rebranded itself in early 2019 as Lark Spot to highlight its menu focus away from burgers has contracted from 14 outlets at the end of 2018 to now just 2 locations in Boulder and Greenwood Village. The original Larkburger is “temporarily” closed; both Denver locations have closed as well as stores in Kansas and Missouri.

In February 2019 Lark Spot CEO Todd Coerver said that the rebranding of one-location-at-a-time would be “mostly finished” by the end of the year. He added that the rebranding is due to constriction in the fast casual sector of the restaurant business. Yet the first location to be rebranded in Arvada has closed and the remaining two outlets still carry the Larkburger name. Too “larkspot.com” currently redirects to “larkburger.com.”

Eschewing the plastic pre-fab look of most burger joints Larkburger uses wooden trays wraps sandwiches in brown paper and uses cardboard boxes for sides to highlight their eco-friendly posture. The decor of the flagship store in Vail Valley included white top tables plenty of wood and steel chairs imparting a hybrid concept of a contemporary drive-in with a classic carhop.

The two remaining restaurants currently offer seven different burgers four made with house sauce. They include exotic choices such as a truffle burger (finished with truffle aioli) a tuna burger (made with a cilantro and wasabi-ginger dressing) and a veggie portabello burger from a mushroom cap. Other items available are wraps salads and “shareables.” Their menu is predominantly gluten-free with many vegetarian choices.

13. Snooze – Started 2006 in Denver CO

In 2006 founders Adam and Jon Schlegel began the first Snooze at 22nd and Larimer in Denver and quickly grew to eight Denver metro locations plus restaurants in Fort Collins Colorado Springs and Boulder. This one’s a sit-down order with your server-style brunch restaurant and not a “fast-casual” diner but we included it anyway because it’s local tasty and growing.

Calling itself an “A.M. Eatery” Snooze markets an eco-friendly image by using sustainable (and trendy) ingredients such as pure maple syrup from Vermont handcrafted Snooze Bloody Mary mix bottled in Denver Guatemalan coffee and “responsibly raised” pork products from an Iowa farm.

In 2016 the Stripes Group gained a majority interest in the restaurant chain propelling the restaurant’s expansion into distant locales like Texas California Arizona and North Carolina. Snooze’s plan to open Georgia and Missouri locations in 2020. As of now Snooze’s has 39 outlets. They serve breakfast lunch and brunch items; most locations close by 2:30 pm.

At Snoozes diners can partake in potent adult libations with their meals. The extensive drink menu includes a variety of mimosas “morning” margaritas coffee cocktails and local and seasonal craft beers. Their signature entrees include a pineapple upside-down pancake and Benedict egg dishes one with smashed avocado.

14. Smashburger – Started 2007 in Glendale CO

In 2007 with $15 million in capitalization veteran fast food execs Tom Ryan (Pizza Hut McDonald’s) and Rich Schaden (Quiznos) founded Cervantes Capital the corporate overlord of Smashburger. With backing from private equity firm Consumer Capital Partners they opened the first Smashburger located in a Glendale strip mall at 1120 South Colorado Boulevard.

Smashburger is more akin to a QSR than most brands listed here but Ryan explains that Smashburger was meant for the 20-30% of QSR patrons who want something better than the industry norm.

15. Garbanzo Mediterranean Fresh – Started 2008 in Denver CO

Featuring an open kitchen and a sleek dining decor Garbanzo Mediterranean Fresh was founded in 2008 and first debuted in 2009. Since its inception the Denver-based chain has grown to 26 locations with franchises in 10 states some on college campuses. Larry Sidoti Garbanzo chief development officer foresees much greater growth soon. Within five years corporate management looks to have 300 locations.

One food critic compares the restaurant’s concept to that of Panera Bread. Garbanzo features WiFi and classical music creating a calm and relaxing dining atmosphere. The restaurant’s menu focuses on healthy dining accommodating low-carb gluten-free vegan and vegetarian and paleo diets.

Garbanzo makes their pitas fresh with on-site baking ovens. Mediterranean staples include hummus tabbouleh. falafel grilled steak and chicken rice and baba ganoush as well as Greek gyros. Many dishes have Lebanese spice blends to impart an authentic Middle East flavor and the chain uses the Israeli founder’s family recipes.

When new management assumed control of the chain in 2016 CEO James Park reined back expansion while they revamped menu items and recipes. They also introduced a new décor with a Middle East-inspired look. The changes worked; in 2017 industry magazine First Casual cited Garbanzo as fourth-best “Mover and Shaker” and QSR Magazine included it on their “40 Under 40” as a chain with under 40 locations poised to hit the big leagues of franchised restaurants.

As you can tell more than a dozen top fast casual restaurants got their start in Colorado. While some have since moved their headquarters out of state such as Qdoba and Chipotle to California all of them were found and grown with passion in Colorado.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NoaXBvdGxlLWlzLWxhdGVzdC1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXRvLWVtYnJhY2UtZHJpdmUtdGhydS1pbi1saW5jb2xuL2FydGljbGVfZjZmNTg1NDctODAxZC01NGIyLTgzZTktMGMxZGQxNjNjY2FhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chipotle is latest restaurant to embrace drive-thru in Lincoln,"On Monday Chipotle Mexican Grill opened its first Lincoln store with a drive-thru.

The location in a former Taco Bell at 7133 Pioneers Blvd. is part of a new concept for Chipotle called ""Chipotlane."" Rather than driving up to a menu board and using an intercom to order and then driving to a window to get their food customers order ahead using the company's website or app and then pick up their order in the drive-thru.

""These formats continue to perform very well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience as well as increase new restaurant sales margins and returns"" Chipotle said in a news release announcing its first-quarter earnings.

Chipotle has found success with the concept and is rapidly rolling it out. Though only about 7% of Chipotle locations had a Chipotlane as of March 31 more than 60% of the stores the company has opened since the start of 2020 have one.

And that percentage appears to be growing.

Erin Wolford Chipotle's senior director of external communications said the company expects that about 70% of the approximately 200 new locations it plans to open this year will have a Chipotlane.

Chipotle is among a number of restaurant companies both large and small that have learned the value of drive-thrus.

Many restaurants already were embracing drive-thrus before COVID-19 but the pandemic turbocharged the move for some.

Even before the pandemic drive-thru visits had grown with 39% of people saying they visited a drive-thru more in 2019 than they did in 2018 according to the National Restaurant Association. And they are continuing to grow.

As of April the number of people who had used a restaurant drive-thru was 36% higher than it was in April 2020 according to a survey from Bluedot. In addition the survey found nine out of 10 diners had visited a drive-thru in the past month.

Drive-thrus have long been a staple for fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's and Burger King but they are now being embraced by fast-casual and coffee chains as well.

For years none of the three Panera Bread locations in Lincoln had drive-thrus. But in early 2019 the chain opened two new locations with drive-thrus -- at 62nd and O streets and 14th Street and Pine Lake Road -- to replace locations nearby.

Scooters Coffee is another chain that has embraced the drive-thru. Last fall it closed two of its stores downtown because they lacked a drive-thru. Most of its new locations in Lincoln and elsewhere now are kiosk-style buildings that have little if any seating and do most of their business through their drive-thru windows.

""More and more people are drinking coffee every year and to be able to serve these people we need drive-thrus"" said Jason Metcalf the franchisee for Scooters in Lincoln.

Metcalf said people are also busier than ever and appreciate not having to leave their car to get their coffee.

Inflation is currently taking many industries by storm and the restaurant sector is no exception. Increased prices tie back to a wide variety of factors from higher transportation and labor costs to a rise in prices of the food itself: meat corn soybeans and wheat have recently reached record price highs.

Unfortunately more expensive commodities mean higher restaurant bills for diners as U.S. restaurants have decided to pass on the growing operational costs to consumers. Even fast-food and fast-casual restaurants which have traditionally been more affordable are raising the prices on their menus in order to offset some of these price surges.

Here are several big-name brands for casual and fast dining which have recently raised their prices. For more check out This Popular Fast-Food Menu Deal Is Becoming Extinct Experts Warn.

Chipotle Mexican Grill

Chipotle recently hiked up its prices by about 4% which translates to about an extra 30 to 40 cents per meal. The move is helping to fund the new $15-per-hour rate for their staff—a wage increase that came as a response to mounting public demand for more liveable wages as well as serious staffing shortages.

However the company noted that further price increases don't appear to be on the horizon despite the additional rising cost of ingredients.

Instead the beloved burrito chain is making headlines lately for another socially-conscious initiative: they are partnering with the White House to help raise awareness about vaccinations by offering a buy-one get-one deal on July 6.

Cracker Barrel

The classic Old Country Store known for its Southern charm and comfort food has announced that they recently increased their prices by about 3%. The reason behind the increase apparently is so that they can cover rising labor and commodity costs.

It might be slightly more expensive to dine at the Barrel now but the chain is aiming to draw customers in with an array of new perks. This summer they are launching a Care It Forward campaign that celebrates connection and care in a post-pandemic world. The summer-long event will include a variety of treats for Cracker Barrel diners from in-store surprises to a live music concert series.

Shake Shack

Shake Shack has raised its prices not once but twice in the last year. The first increase came last December when the menu prices at the burger and fry joint went up by 2%. Then in February the Shack increased their delivery prices by 5%. Now according to The Wall Street Journal further hikes might be on the way due to higher labor and meat prices.

And while a burger may cost a few extra cents with the way Shake Shack's new summer menu is shaping up it's likely worth it. Shake Shack just announced new sweet and spicy line-up which includes a Hot Honey Chicken Sandwich Hot Honey Fries Hot Honey Chicken Bits and more.

Red Robin

Red Robin is another classic all-American brand which opted to increase their prices—albeit minimally—to cover the spike in labor and commodity costs. On average their food will cost about 3% more.

The chain's focus isn't just on cost coverage though. Restaurant Dive reported that by the end of 2021 Red Robin will have added 120 more Donatos pizzas to their locations making their brick-and-mortars even more attractive to diners.

Texas Roadhouse

When it comes to Texas Roadhouse which is America's largest steakhouse chain one might expect a price increase would be noticeable. However the Roadhouse has raised its prices by a modest 1.4% and is expected to get to a 1.75% increase this year in an effort to help alleviate the cost of paying workers fairer wages.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But the price increases don't seem to be deterring guests who visit the steakhouse's locations—check averages were up by 5.5% during the first quarter and the chain's to-go sales are still going strong. Guests are spending more on both food and alcohol.

Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical

Much like Red Robin and Cracker Barrel Fiesta Restaurant Group recently jumped on board with the 3% price increase at both of its restaurants. Its chains Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical located in Texas and Florida respectively will implement the price raise in an effort to offset higher labor and commodity costs.

That said the change might not last at Taco Cabana. As of the time of publication early reports indicated that Fiesta Restaurant Group is selling its Texas empire to YTC Enterprises. It's unclear what pricing model they will adhere to if the sale goes through.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

SÃO PAULO Brazil – As candidates make their final efforts for support for the May 19 general elections in the Dominican Republic the Church suddenly appeared as an influence for voters.

Earlier this week the Bishops’ Conference’s Pastoral Ministry for Life released a list of candidates it’s endorsing for Congress.

Father Manuel Ruiz a long-time pro-life activist in the Caribbean nation is the mastermind behind the initiative which has been criticized by the press.

“We think that the people needed our guidance. Candidates say beautiful words during their campaigns but we wanted to show to the people what they have done in the past and what were their commitments” Ruiz told Crux.

The commission followed the candidate’s lives for months paying attention to their statements the ideas they have been expressing and their actions in Congress in the cases of lawmakers seeking re-election. The group focused on the stances of politicians regarding the so-called gender theory abortion and euthanasia.

“For one year we looked at them on the internet we followed their steps and we heard what they had to say” the priest explained.

The list includes 130 candidates from several parties on the left-wing and on the right-wing and with different ideologies. Ruiz said that “regardless of who will win the important thing is to have pro-life incumbents.”

“In some districts we almost couldn’t find a candidate to indicate so we chose the lesser evil – and then we will accompany that person after the elections” he added.

The list was sent to every parish in the country. The idea is that the pastor prints it and shows it to parishioners so they can know the suggestions.

“If the other candidates are sure about their [pro-abortion] policies they should send their platforms to us and we will gladly send them to the parishes as well. But they prefer to keep their ideas about such issues in secret” Ruiz said.

Abortion is completely forbidden in the Dominican Republic. Over the past years politicians and activists tried to advance bills concerning the introduction of more flexible legislation.

Their idea was to allow abortion under three circumstances: If pregnancy poses risks for the mother’s health if the unborn child has a condition that makes his or her life inviable out of the womb or if pregnancy was the result of rape.

Nobody has been able to introduce the three circumstances for legal abortion in the Dominican legislation but some of the current candidates defend the proposal and the subject has been creating division among voters.

“The debate on the three circumstances for legal abortion interrupted the process of approval of a new penal code. The current one is from the 19th century and is obsolete. So that’s a central issue for the country” sociologist Alejandro Abreu told Crux.

He said that surveys have shown that most Dominicans reject the decriminalization of abortion but a small majority favors that it may be legal in some cases.

That’s why Ruiz thinks that this is a moment in which the Church must openly declare its views and support the right candidates.

“Of course many argue that the Church must be prudent and keep out of politics. But Latin America has been giving worrisome signs and we should roll up our sleeves” the priest said.

Over the past years a number of Latin American countries legalized abortion like Colombia and Argentina and euthanasia like Ecuador. Ruiz said that the region is dominated by left-wing governments that have closed the doors to the Church and adopted policies imported from developed nations “which financed abortion and euthanasia all over the world.”

Ruiz said that the Pastoral Ministry for Life is not only concerned about subjects like abortion and gender ideology but also “defends the survival of everybody and is against policies that increase poverty for instance.”

“Catholics must balance all those things. Some politicians only favor developed nations trade agreements that harm Latin America mining projects that devastate our countries. A pastoral for life cannot preach the gospel for dead people” he said.

Abreu claimed that “the Church stance expressed through Father Ruiz comes from a traditionalist Catholicism.”

“The Church is not breaking any rule by declaring its preferences in the election. But assuming a belligerent attitude impacts the work of mediation that the Catholic hierarchy should carry out. One can’t rule from the extremes” Abreu said.

In his opinion “every time the Church directly intervened in electoral politics things didn’t end up well.”

“The Church in Latin America has historically taken sides with conservatives. But with Liberation Theology it also sided with the left-wing in some moments. One way or the other it always went wrong” he added.

Abreu said that themes like abortion and gender theory have been creating deep divisions and irrational stances on both sides and the Church should intervene by mediating the debate instead of taking one side.

“Mentioning specific candidates is something unprecedented for the Church in the Dominican Republic” he said.

Most Dominicans will probably not guide themselves by the Church’s electoral list Abreu added but it may impact one of the major races the one for the next national district’s senator.

The two front-runners are Guillermo Moreno and Omar Fernandez a young politician whose father former President Leonel Fernandez is trying to get a new presidential tenure.

Moreno has declared on a number of occasions that he’s not pro-abortion but that he favors the introduction of the three circumstances. Fernandez is pro-life and received the Church’s support.

“Moreno is now eight or seven points ahead according to polls. If the margin between them diminishes the Church’s endorsement to Fernandez may be determinant for the final result” Abreu said.

Ruiz said he’s not worried about the criticism he has been suffering from the press and nongovernmental organizations. He said most priests and bishops support him.

“We caused a revulsion. Many people thought the Church was in the ICU but they now see that it has a presence in the nation that no other institution has” he said.

The Gospel must dictate the norms of life in society Ruiz claimed.

“With that effort we were able to draw the people’s attention to what the Church has to say” the priest said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vdmF0aWNhbi8yMDI0LzA1L2NodXJjaC1zYW5jdGlvbnMtcHJpZXN0LWZvci1iZWluZy1hbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJvbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church sanctions priest for being an online troll,"Listen

ROME – This week a public spat on social media platform X previously known as Twitter revealed that a Spanish priest has been barred by the Vatican from his online activities for trolling a victim of a Peru-based group currently under investigation.

In a May 7 post on X Spanish Father Francisco Delgado who lives in Virginia Dale Colo. in the United States announced that “By direct order of my Archbishop I am forced to interrupt activity on all of my networks and suspend my participation in the media.”

A high-ranking source confirmed to Crux the archbishop received the request from the Holy See.

“This time I’m not doing it of my own free will. I have no choice but to defend myself against a slander that I hope one day to be able to give details about” he said insisting that despite the “persecution” against him “I continue to maintain my purpose of being faithful to the Church of Christ and to its visible leader who is Pope Francis.”

Delgado one of six priests who regularly appear on the popular “La Sacristía de La Vendée” podcast said he would be offering the suffering this situation has caused “for the conversion of those who harm the Church from outside and from within. Long live Christ the King!”

In a response post on X the same day a man named of José Enrique Escardó Steck also known as JEES said that “In the midst of so many stupid attacks by a pole there comes good news for me.”

Founder of the Peru Survivors Network and co-founder of the Brave Movement of Latin America and the Caribbean Escardó is a former member of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV) and was the first to lodge a complaint against the group in 2000.

A lay group founded by Peruvian layman Luis Fernando Figari in the 1970s the SCV for 10 years has been shrouded by scandals involving various allegations of abuse and accusations of financial corruption against Figari and other top-ranking members.

Scandals erupted in 2015 when Peruvian journalists Pedro Salinas and Paola Ugaz authored a blockbuster book titled “Half Monks Half Soldiers” exposing scandals within the group.

Figari was accused of physical psychological and sexual abuse within the community including sexual abuse of minors and in 2017 was sanctioned by the Vatican and prohibited from having further contact with members of the group. He is currently living in exile in southern Italy.

Last summer Pope Francis sent his top abuse investigating team Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Spanish Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu to Lima to begin a formal inquiry into SCV and its various attempts at reform.

Escardó spoke with Scicluna and Bertomeu while the duo was in Lima conducting official interviews and inquiries.

In his May 7 post on X Escardó said Delgado several months ago had “blocked me and then defamed and insulted me” on the social media platform through “various tweets and for several days for being a victim of the #Sodalicio.”

“The story reached the Vatican and they asked me for details of the case because the investigation into the Sodalitium is still open” he said saying Vatican officials “told me they were going to sanction him.”

Several days later Escardó said he listened to Delgado’s podcast in which Delgado apparently said “he wished Pope Bergoglio was dead.”

“Well here are the consequences” Escardó said saying “For the first time in history the Catholic Church sanctions a priest for trolling and I feel proud that it was thanks to me.”

He also accused Delgado of covering up the abuse of a fellow priest in Spain saying “I hope this is just the first measure and that the same thing happens with others who act the same.”

In addition to Delgado Escardó said a similar sanction was also made against another priest “who insulted me” Father Juan Razo and that instead of making a public statement Razo “first deleted his tweets and then quietly closed his account.”

In comments to Crux Escardó said the online confrontation with Delgado began in January when he replied to a post that Rezo had made criticizing the image of a Jesus “who seemed a bit homosexual” on a poster in Seville during Holy Week.

Escardó said he sarcastically replied that he would like the priests to spend as much time talking about how to obtain justice and reparation for victims of sexual abuse in the church saying Razo would one day have to face “this election of priorities” before God.

In response he said Razo replied with a quote from Proverbs saying “’Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes.’ You are so short-minded that you answer one thing with another. Don’t come and blame other people’s faults in my face. Only ignorant people use insults when they have no arguments.”

Things deteriorated from there Escardó said saying Razo continued to insult him and make vicious comments in his posts. Eventually Escardó revealed that he was a victim of abuse on the part of the SCV and that the posts were revictimizing.

He told Crux that each of the priests had thousands of followers so others joined and also began attacking him and that Delgado was among those who did so blocking him on X before opting “to tell lies about me to defame me to disparage the allegations against the Sodalicio” in several posts for the next three days.

Escardó gave Razo 24 hours to delete his posts threatening to send the exchanges to the Vatican. When Razo did not comply publishing more critical posts in response Escardó reached out to the Vatican and when asked sent the relevant correspondence.

As the situation online unfolded Escardó said he was contacted by someone claiming to be the victim of a priest in Spain and that Delgado had helped to cover up the abuse.

Delgado declined a Crux request for comment on the situation saying that by order of his archbishop he was unable to make any statements to the media.

Though he said he has little hope that any real justice will be achieved through the Vatican’s investigation Escardó said he remains firm in his desire to seek justice and reparation for victims of abuse in the church.

(KOLN) - If you are traveling in far northern Sioux County you might want to drive by the Montrose Church which is located on the Oglala National Grassland.

We caught up with Mary Jayne Jordan to talk about some of the memories she had of attending services at the Montrose Church while growing up.

“What I remember is no air conditioning” Jordan said. “I also remember in the summer time the windows were open and you would smell sage in the air. Whenever I smell sage I go right back to Montrose in my mind.”

The Montrose Church can be found on Hat Creek Road and Road 958 in Sioux County.

“The church was built in 1887” Jordan said. “The immigrants who came to that area were mostly all Catholic so they chose to build this church. They wanted to have a gathering place to worship.”

There was a former village named Montrose that was established there for a time. The village no longer exists.

“My dad and his sisters went to school across the road from the church” Jordan said.

Amazingly the structure that still stands today is the one that’s been there since the beginning. It’s never moved or been damaged. A local family now provides funding to keep the building looking good.

“At one point they built a rectory for the priest to stay in” Jordan said. “But again it’s so remote priests are in high demand so we always had a traveling priest. They eventually sold the rectory and it moved north of Ardmore. The church closed in 1973.”

We are told supporters of the church try to hold an honorary mass there once a year.

“My older brother and I were my sister’s godparents in 1968” Jordan said. “She and a cousin of ours were the last two children to be baptized here when it was an active parish in 1968. There have been weddings since then but it’s not been an active parish since 1973.”

Sebuah serial web series yang bisa dikatakan terbaik bagi saya dalam genre romance. Mengakhiri Cinta dalam 3 Episode yang disutradai oleh Yandy Laurens. Bercerita tentang sepasang kekasih yang sudah berpacaran 8 tahun dan sudah merencanakan menikah tetapi Satrio yang diperankan oleh Dion Wiyoko ingin memutuskan hubungannya dengan Ayu. Satrio mengaku tidak cinta lagi. Mereka sepakat untuk mengunkapkan ini kepada orang tua Ayu. Sesampai di rumah Ayu Satrio mengurungkan niatnya untuk berterus terang dengan Orang tua Ayu melihat ayah Ayu sedang terbaring sakit. Ayahnya senang melihat Satrio dan Ayu datang ke rumahnya dan dalam waktu dekat akan melangsunkan pernikahan. ia mendoakan anak dan calon menantunya agar mereka dapat sehati sepikir sejiwa satu rasa dan satu pandangan. Ayah Ayu juga bilang tidak ada yang lebih indah daripada bersatunya dua insan. Setelah pergi dari rumah orang tua Ayu mereka masih bersitegang dan Ayu menanyakan apa alasan Stario tidak cinta dan mengapa tidak bilang langsung ke orang tuanya. Ayu meminta untuk turun ditengah perjalana pulang tapi sesaat setelah keluar dari mobil mereka merasakan ada hal yang aneh. Mereka bisa berkomunikasi melalui hati dan pikiran atau mungkin juga diakatan telepati. dan untuk kelanjutannya kalian bisa menonton langsung di web seriesnya di Youtube dan platform lain mungkin.

Terdengar klise memang bahwa berpacaran lama tidak menjamin seseorang itu cinta kepada kamu tetapi itu nyata dan benar adanya. Hal ini bisa mengajarkan kita tentang seperti apa hubungan yang dewasa. Yang menjadi permasalahan yang diangkat dalam film adalah ketidakmampuan mereka untuk berterus terang dari awal pada saat terjadi permasalahan. Mereka membiarkan masalah berlarut-larut dan tentunya dalam suatu waktu masalah tersebut akan meledak.

Putus secara baik-baik bagi saya tidak ada perpisahaan yang baik-baik saja. Putus secara baik-baik malah menjadi perpisahan itu semakin berat tetapi menjadi terkenang dengan indah. Dalam hal ini kita akan belajar untuk mengiklaskan memaafkan dan dapat menerima kenyataan. Akan indah karena cinta diawali dan dibangun dengan baik dan diakhiri dengan baik pula.

Bagi saya meskipun kamu tidak cinta dengan pasanganmu seringkali tidak nyambung dalam berbicara kurang menarik tapi kamu bisa berusaha untuk menemukan dari sudut mana kamu bisa menyukainya. Aku menyukaimu dengan ada apanya dan menerimamu apa adanya.

The books titled are ‘Tales of Two Kingdoms’ by Erioluwa Salako and Laurel Salako; ‘Crown of the Street’ by Aishat Habeeb ‘Always Come Back Home’ by Abiola Covenant ‘Silver Spoon in the Moon’ by Abiodun Erioluwa ‘Voices in the NoiseN by Rahmat Braimoh.

Others are ‘Dairy of a Nigerian Teenager’ by Temitope Oyedele and ‘Acts of Our Words’ by Akindipe Iranlowo.

Juliet Adesinmi Ajayi headmistress Unilag Staff School said that since the inception of Art Club pupils between ages 7 to 12 have written more than 50 storybooks which are very inspiring.

Speaking at the public presentation of the books in Lagos Ajayi said the unrelenting efforts of all teachers at the school helped discover quality writers and also helped the pupil direct their attention and time to productive and educative ventures.

According to her “The children used their leisure hour and time productively. They brought their imaginations together to write stories that will teach moral lessons to shape the society. These efforts are necessary at this period in our society today”.

Akinade Eunice Adedoyin deputy headmistress said that since the inception of the school in 1983 the school has produced scores of scholars who have left their footprints on the sand of life adding that the school is still thriving and has had the ambience improving tremendously in the past few years.

Adedoyin said the eight pupils books being presented is the first-ever book launch to be done in Annex school in her 38 years of existence noting that all the books represented pieces of writing from a child’s heart and perspective with figments of their imaginations aided by happenings around them.

She observed that for pupils to be young writers is very essential because it shows what type of talents they have inherent in them. “When we teach we want to develop them to become useful citizens in the society. This is the maiden book launch in the annex school but inside the main school in Akoka it is well over 8 years that children have been writing books and it is been launched”. She said.

“Through writing pupils develop their minds in order to know how imaginative they can be. Children mind is supposed to be a clean slate so when we take them in and begin to teach them all we want is for them to be developed. We take each child as individual and find a talent in each of them we would like to bring it out”.

On the selection process for the authors she said the school organised a training for children who are interested in writing out of the 12 pupils that took part in the training 8 of them are the authors whose books are being launched.

The educationist further said that the essence of promoting book writing is more about making sure the children shift their focus from addiction to electronic gadgets such as television to having a mind of their own.

According to her “I believe that if all the children are able to see that their age mates are writing it should be a challenge to them knowing full well that a child who spends time to write will most likely not have the time to spend watching programmes on television or playing games and this will make them to be more studious”.

Commenting on how pupils can build an effective culture of reading Adedoyin said parents have a role to play in inculcating in children the habit of reading. She urged parents to set a good example for their children on how to embrace reading as a culture rather than being too busy and deploying television and mobile phones as the best way to keep the children busy.",,,,,,,,,

Parts of I-95 were shut down Saturday and a shelter in place order issued nearby after the standoff with the heavily armed group began around 2 a.m.

Mass State Police Col. Christopher Mason said some members of the group were clad in military-style gear with long guns and pistols and were heading to Maine from Rhode Island for “training.”

In a joint statement Sunday state police and the Middlesex County District Attorney's office said troopers recovered at least eight firearms from the group including three AR-15 rifles two pistols a bolt-action rifle a shotgun and a short barrel rifle.

All 11 men were charged with eight counts of unlawful possession of a firearm unlawful possession of ammunition use of body armor in commission of a crime possession of a high capacity magazine improper storage of firearms in a vehicle and conspiracy to commit a crime.

The group refers to itself as ""a militia and state that they adhere to 'Moorish Sovereign Ideology'"" police and prosecutors said in the joint statement.

The Southern Poverty Law Center says the Moorish sovereign citizen movement a larger collection of independent organizations and individuals is ""an offshoot of the anti-government sovereign citizens movement"" which contends individuals are independent of the government.

However Mason said the leader of the group identified as Rise of the Moors claimed it was not an anti-government group.

More on the Massachusetts standoff:11 people in custody after hourslong armed standoff on I-95

Here's what we know:

What happened in the standoff?

Mason said the incident began early Saturday when a trooper noticed two cars pulled over on I-95 with hazard lights on after they had apparently run out of fuel.

The trooper noticed the group of men were heavily armed and asked for their drivers licenses and firearm permits Mason said. The men did not have either and after the trooper called for backup some of the men ran into the woods with their firearms Mason said.

“You can imagine 11 armed individuals standing with long guns slung on an interstate highway at 2 in the morning certainly raises concerns and is not consistent with the firearms laws that we have in Massachusetts” Mason said.

Police spoke with the group throughout the morning via hostage negotiation teams Mason said. Mason said the individuals surrendered after police tactical teams used armored vehicles to tighten the perimeter around them.

Nine of the 11 were identified; with two of the men refusing to self identify to police. One of the 11 was a juvenile. Two of the men were charged with furnishing a false name to police.

Additional charges were also possible as authorities seek to search the two vehicles involved in the incident authorities said.

The juvenile was expected to be released to parental custody while the other 10 men were to be held on $100000 bail.

Who are Rise of the Moors and Moorish sovereign citizens?

Videos shared on social media appeared to show the leader of the group speaking from a vehicle on I-95 and with police negotiators.

“We are not anti-government. We are not anti-police we are not sovereign citizens we’re not Black identity extremists” said the man who appeared to be wearing military-style equipment. “As specified multiple times to the police that we are abiding by the peaceful journey laws of the United States.”

J.J. MacNab a fellow at the George Washington University's Program on Extremism described the larger Moorish sovereign movement as ""'salad bar' group.""

""Different factions and leaders cobble together bits and pieces from a variety of sources and craft their own legal theories"" MacNab wrote on Twitter saying they rely on beliefs from ""Moorish Science Temple Black Hebrew Israelism Nation of Islam UFO theories phony Native American tribes and the pseudo-legal arguments crafted by white supremacist 'patriot' groups in the 1970s.""

On its website Rise of the Moors says ""Moor does not mean Black. The noun ‘Moor’ is a shortened variant of the word Moroccan."" The group also says the term Black was used by Europeans to ""strip us of our illustrious history.""

The group also denies being sovereign citizens on its website but says the records ""show that the Moors are the organic or original sovereigns of this land – America.""

MacNab said some believe Moors were the first settlers of the U.S. Some also believe Morocco and the United States signed a treaty shortly after the American Revolution that exempts Moorish people from the law.

The Moorish Science Temple of America a religious sect dates back to the 1913. Most adherents of the Moorish Science Temple are not sovereign citizens MacNab said. But some members of sovereign movements merged the two belief systems in the 1990s forming the new group according to the Anti-Defamation League.

The group has absorbed many ideas from Black sovereign groups but is independent of them the Anti-Defamation League said. In general most sovereign citizen movements in the U.S. are predominantly white but there has been growth in interest among Black Americans since 2009 the Anti-Defamation League said.

Because of their claims of independence from U.S. law some members have alternative passports and drivers licenses MacNab said. The Southern Poverty Law Center says some groups sustain themselves by selling these fake documents. Others engage in tax fraud and other financial fraud the center said.

MacNab said most Moorish sovereigns are not violent but that their financial tactics may spread amid post-pandemic foreclosures.

The Southern Poverty Law Center said a small number of Moorish sovereigns however have engaged in violent acts from shootings robberies to other armed confrontations.

Rise of Moors has Rhode Island ties sued Providence police in 2019

On its website Rise of the Moors states it is a nonprofit based in Pawtucket Rhode Island. The building listed is owned by MidFirst Bank. Its stated mission is ""Moorish Americans dedicated to educating new Moors and influencing our Elders.""

""The RISE OF THE MOORS organization has successfully claimed an abandoned home for our benefit as a people"" the group's website states. The group also said it planned to claim other buildings ""to the point that every Moorish family has a home and a business if they so desire for themselves.""

In October 2019 the group filed a quiet claim to the property with the Pawtucket land records – a move that MidFirst Bank challenged in Providence County Superior Court.

Four people who identified as Moorish American indigenous people filed separate lawsuits the same month against the Providence Police Department accusing officers of violating their rights by interrupting a lecture by Grand Sheik Jamal Talib Abdullah Bey at their Providence temple.

The group’s leader alleged that the police responded to a complaint that someone watching a live feed of his talk had seen him teaching a class with a semiautomatic weapon strapped around his neck and a Glock 22 on his waist as men women and children looked on.

The lawsuits alleged that police violated their right to bear arms and their right to peacefully assemble and tried to search their temple without a warrant. They sought $1 million each and a public apology from Mayor Jorge Elorza and the police department according to filings in U.S. District Court.

The complaints were dismissed in U.S. District Court for lack of prosecution dismissals upheld by the federal appeals court. Providence Police Cmdr. Thomas Verdi said the department had not had contact with the group since.

Rhode Island State Police Col. James Manni said Saturday that they are aware of the Moors and have had interactions in the past year and a half including making arrests.

Manni said the department is working closely with Massachusetts State Police and the FBI on the investigation.

Guest columnist

Brad McKibben is a son of Norm McKibben and Ruth Volk. Brad’s siblings include Beth (Nee) Bruce; Ben; and Becky (Sunday).

Norm worked at the United Bank and retired from Farmers Citizens Bank. Ruth was the Crawford County recorder. Brad attended Colonel Crawford Schools and while in high school he was fortunate to be All Ohio in baseball and football. He also played basketball. Brad graduated in 1993 and was one of the class valedictorians.

Brad went on to Heidelberg College majoring in sports medicine and religion. He also played baseball while there. During the summers he was an intern at First United Church of Christ in Galion.

Brad graduated in June 1997 with a degree in his majors. Immediately afterwards he was called to serve as a youth director for St. John’s United Church of Christ on Park Avenue in Mansfield. At that same time he also began working for Dave Gebhardt at the Insurance Center of Bucyrus.

Brad met Krista Nigh at the First United Church of Christ where they attended church together. Krista is the daughter of Larry a retired painting contractor and Barb Nigh.

Krista’s siblings are: Carolee Balliett; Jenay Pfeifer; Dr. Sarah Nigh-Bruner; and Deanna Durham. Krista was also a graduate of Colonel Crawford and was involved with cheerleading and graduated in 1994 as one of the valedictorians.

Brad and Krista married in 1997 just before Brad started working at the Mansfield church. Krista also went to Heidelberg College and was still in college when they married. She graduated in 3½ years with a degree in education and went to work in January 1998 as a long-term sub at Ridgedale Schools. She worked there full time the following year and moved on to Galion Schools for 16 years.

Currently she teaches mathematics at Colonel Crawford as well as college credit plus courses for North Central State College.

Work and school kept Brad busy for four years

Brad worked for Dave Gebhardt from June 1997-2000 when Dave allowed Brad to purchase half of the business. At the same time Brad commuted to the Methodist Theological Seminary in Delaware from 2001-2005.

He received his Master of Divinity in 2005 and at that point he received a call on Father’s Day June 2005 from Trinity United Church of Christ in Upper Sandusky. Pastor Brad was ordained on Feb. 5 2006. The church has about 265 members with average attendance around 65-70 including a nice group of younger kids.

When Dave Gebhardt retired in December 2017 Brad purchased the other half of the Insurance Center of Bucyrus. They are an independent agency offering auto home business — everything except health insurance. The main companies they represent are Westfield Auto Owners Progressive and Travelers.

Brad and Krista are involved in many activities primarily with Colonel Crawford School. Krista is a National Honor Society adviser and the Leo Club adviser a group of students involved with the Lions Club. They were the Leo Club of The Year for the State of Ohio. She also serves as the chair on the LPDC Local Professional Development Committee.

Brad is president of the Colonel Crawford school board and secretary of the Colonel Crawford Schools Foundation (a part of the Community Foundation for Crawford County.) He is the announcer at all home football games and all home boys’ and girls’ basketball games. He is also an assistant varsity baseball coach in the spring.

Meet the family: Mason Nolan Lynae and Ayla

Brad and Krista have four children.

Mason graduated in 2021 as valedictorian of his Colonel Crawford class and was a National Merit finalist. He ran cross country played basketball and baseball and is going to attend the University of Alabama in the fall. He will play the trumpet in the Million Dollar Band.

Nolan will be a senior at Colonel Crawford plays football basketball and baseball and is a full-time student at North Central State College in their Sci-Med Academy. He will graduate with an associate’s degree from college at the same time he graduates from high school.

They have twin daughters. Lynae will be a sophomore and will be on the football cheerleading squad plays basketball and runs track and qualified for state. Ayla golfs plays basketball runs track and qualified for the regional track meet.

All the children study piano under their instructor Donna Kurtz and are very active in music and piano.

It would buy you a year of study at Harvard University a couple of luxury boxes at the Yankee Stadium in New York or a lengthy stay at London’s Ritz Hotel. But Chinese citizens might soon be able to do something different with the $50000 they are permitted to take out of the country annually: invest it.

In February Ye Haisheng a Chinese official at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (Safe) said the government was researching whether the allowance — which has been unchanged since 2007 requires no specific approvals and is spent mainly on travel and education — could also be used to purchase overseas securities and insurance.

Even as it has risen as an economic power China has retained strict capital controls which keep most of its vast household wealth within its borders and reflect the control which the ruling Communist party continues to wield over the country.

This year there are more signs than ever of that grip on savings loosening. As well as a potential change to the allowance the government in June approved record amounts of money to flow out of the country through an official investment quota. It is also on the verge of launching a programme with Hong Kong called Wealth Connect that will allow households in southern China to invest overseas.

“This is a very interesting time for all of us” says Terry Pan chief executive officer for Greater China at Invesco which is eligible to manage money through the programme. “Liberalisation is happening in front of our eyes.”

While China’s asset management outflows remain small they are part of a profound shift that hints at future expansion. The country’s wider financial system is opening up enticing the world’s biggest banks and asset managers. HSBC one of the most active participants estimates that Chinese households will have Rmb300tn ($46.3tn) of investable assets by 2025 — an amount equivalent to the entire US bond market.

“With more outbound investment channels available households have genuine choices to diversify into overseas securities” the bank noted in May.

In the past outbound schemes have been suspended at times of market volatility while other projects have proved to be false dawns adding to the sense that for now China is unlikely to loosen its capital controls except at the margins.

The economic logic of keeping so many savings trapped in one place however has come under greater scrutiny at a time when the renminbi has strengthened markedly and the stock market in February surpassed its 2007 peak. Policymakers have become more vocal warning of rising asset prices especially within the country’s property sector where much of household wealth continues to chase returns.

If it were allowed to suddenly chase returns globally that could have chaotic consequences from both a Chinese and western perspective. The country’s savings would have the capacity to flood certain international markets — if a mere 10 per cent of households invested $50000 abroad HSBC calculates that would amount to $2.4tn. Michael Every global market strategist at Rabobank says “carrots had been dangled” in front of western banks but a deep opening of the capital account was “structurally extremely unlikely” because it would lead to a collapse in asset prices within China as well as the value of its currency.

But China’s policy shifts can be almost imperceptibly gradual. Just as the country’s entry into the World Trade Organization two decades ago has resonated in all corners of the global economy even the slim prospect of capital account liberalisation raises urgent questions for the entire financial system: will Chinese savings be unleashed upon the world and what happens if they are?

Investing by the back door

In 2016 the central bank the People’s Bank of China prohibited the use of so-called “dual currency” credit cards that allowed people in China to make foreign purchases through international networks Visa and Mastercard. Unionpay the country’s major credit card provider was barred from being used to buy insurance in Hong Kong.

The ban came after mainland citizens began taking out life insurance policies in Hong Kong that were linked to savings policies. When the policies matured the customer was left with a lump sum in Hong Kong dollars effectively circumventing the $50000 currency limit.

“At the time you could use a mainland credit card to pay for anything in Hong Kong” says Stewart Aldcroft Asia chair of Cititrust an arm of Citibank. “The regulators suddenly woke up to that and had to do something about it.”

Like the casinos of neighbouring Macau Hong Kong is well known for its role in illicit flows of money out of mainland China ranging from bags of cash to manipulating trade invoicing figures. But the territory — which has undergone extraordinary political upheaval in the past two years — now offers up a greater than ever array of legitimate methods for investing money outside mainland China.

The Wealth Connect programme is set to be the most symbolic milestone yet in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as the gateway to international markets. A pilot scheme expected to be launched this year will allow households in nine Chinese cities in the Greater Bay Area — which includes Shenzhen and Guangzhou and is home to about 70m people — to invest up to Rmb1m ($154000) in low and medium-risk funds domiciled in Hong Kong. It stands to give them access to markets in the US and elsewhere.

Offshore investors can also buy mainland products through the scheme which follows previous programmes linking Chinese stock and bond markets to Hong Kong. Eddie Yue head of the city’s monetary authority says the programme “underpins Hong Kong’s strategic importance in the mainland’s opening up of its financial markets”.

Wealth Connect nonetheless represents a cautious approach from Beijing that applies to other methods of investing abroad legally. Crucially it operates according to a closed-currency loop meaning investors in the country have to convert the proceeds back to the renminbi when they cash out. Total flows in each direction are capped at Rmb150bn ($23.1bn) — a tiny fraction of household wealth.

“Wealth Connect will be the first time that China has legitimately allowed mainland residents to directly move money out of the country for the purposes of offshore investment” says Anthony Lin Standard Chartered chief executive for the Greater Bay Area. “Today the limit is not very big and there are restrictions on products but we believe this will change over time.”

For international banks the Wealth Connect scheme is just one part of a China savings opportunity most of which will be managed within the country itself. In February HSBC said it would spend $3.5bn over five years to develop its wealth and personal banking operations in Asia which already accounts for two-thirds of its global wealth business. Citibank and Standard Chartered have laid out similar plans that aim to double wealth management staff numbers and income in mainland China and Hong Kong over the next five years.

“The opportunity is enormous” says Greg Hingston HSBC’s head of wealth and personal banking for Asia Pacific. “Even if you only get a small share of it it’s going to be very meaningful.”

Despite excitement over Wealth Connect data from Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the total annual fees shared by banks operating under the scheme is likely to be less than $500m due to the initial cap.

For foreign players part of the bet is instead that a gradual loosening of constraints on that growing wealth will gather pace. Major US banks that have partnered with Chinese counterparts have also emphasised the offshore opportunity where they have a distinct advantage compared with onshore competitors; Goldman Sachs plans to eventually offer “overseas products” — although it has yet to say which ones — through its partnership with ICBC.

“[International] banks aren’t looking at what direct income can be generated in the short term” Lin says. “We are focusing on building a customer base so that over time when China further opens up its capital account the relationship with those customers gets far bigger.”

The urge to invest

Warren Jia a 29-year-old IT worker in Shanghai studied at Glasgow university in Scotland and still has a few thousand pounds in a UK bank account. He says overseas investment is something he is actively pursuing.

“First of all I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket” he says. “The second is I had experience living abroad and there’s a possibility of immigration or living and working abroad in the future so I think it’s necessary to hold some assets overseas.”

Savers like Jia are not only an opportunity for foreign and domestic businesses seeking to take advantage of a booming asset management industry. They are also an opportunity for the Chinese government as it grapples with a strengthening renminbi and a rush of inflows into its stock and bond markets encouraged by its rapid recovery from the pandemic.

In June the government increased to $147bn the total quota for a scheme that allows companies to invest overseas on behalf of their clients the majority of which are retail investors. The additional $10bn was the largest increase in the 14-year history of the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme. Like Wealth Connect it forces investors to cash out in renminbi meaning it currently has no clear use for those wishing to spend rather than invest overseas.

Analysts suggest the move was partly a response to the strength of the renminbi but also hinted at its relevance to the debate over the future of China’s capital account one which relates not only to household savings but also overseas activity from the country’s businesses financial sector and the government itself.

“I would say that in typical China fashion this is going to be a trial and error approach” says Carlos Casanova a senior economist for Asia at UBP. “There are reasons for and against doing this.”

Asset bubble territory

After Deng Xiaoping reformed China’s economy in the late 1970s direct foreign investment rushed into the country. Capital outflows were tightened after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s which exposed the risk of foreign money being rapidly pulled out of emerging economies. The QDII scheme was launched in 2006 and has been followed by incremental signs of further liberalisation the latest of which is Wealth Connect.

A 2017 book published by the IMF said opponents of liberalisation typically cited the Asian crisis while proponents pointed to “self-fulfilling expectations of currency appreciation and bubble-prone domestic financial markets”. Foreign direct investment in China last year at $163bn surpassed inflows into the US for the first time.

This year official expressions of concern over inflated domestic asset prices have become more frequent. In March Guo Shuqing China’s top banking regulator warned of “bubbles” within the country’s property sector. The government has moved to restrain leverage across the biggest real estate developers but property prices have continued to skyrocket.

While these factors might on the face of it encourage outflows to ease pressure on prices they might also discourage an opening of the floodgates. “In the long term full capital account liberalisation will only take place once all of the domestic structural fragilities . . . are resolved” says Casanova pointing to “high corporate debt levels” as the biggest issue. Guo in March not only warned about domestic property but also bubbles in the same “foreign markets” where Chinese savers would be more active.

Dariusz Kowalczyk an economist at Crédit Agricole suggests full liberalisation is unlikely because the government will “want to continue to micromanage the economy” so they will need “to retain capital controls and exchange rates rather than being thrown at the vagaries of the global system with all its volatility”.

China’s position is nonetheless highly unusual and is likely to become even more so as its middle class expands. HSBC estimates it will soon exceed 500m people. The IMF book said it was “difficult to imagine that one of the world’s largest economies and trading nations will maintain tight controls on capital flows indefinitely as it becomes an upper-middle-income economy”.

A Safe official in June said the QDII expansion was “conducive for meeting domestic investors’ needs for diversifying overseas asset allocation”. China holds more than $1tn of US Treasuries which help it control its exchange rate but capital controls will also need to be relaxed if it is to achieve its stated goal of internationalising its currency.

Experiments in capital account liberalisation are an opportunity for foreign asset managers and Chinese investors. Across international financial markets though outflows could have significant and unexpected consequences.

Overseas corporate activity or purchases from wealthy individuals with income streams abroad have already helped reshape the overheated housing markets of entire cities in the west from Vancouver to Sydney.

The first phase of the Wealth Connect scheme only allows savers to buy low and medium-risk products such as highly rated bonds reflecting the government’s cautious approach. Pan at Invesco suggests that under a hypothetical scenario with all of Chinese savings flooding into low-risk products “you would obviously see even more negative interest rates” as the purchases of bonds would push up prices and move yields lower.

The $23bn total through the Wealth Connect scheme will not move global markets but if Beijing is laying the groundwork for further reform that cap could change in time.

Citi’s Aldcroft notes that hundreds of millions of people in China have already bought into some form of domestic mutual fund which he says are currently more than 99 per cent targeted towards the domestic markets. Diversified investments overseas — the kind that help build stable retirement systems and insurance markets — would continue a long-term pattern in which the Chinese middle class flocks to buy the staples of its western counterparts.

Its policy approach though is equally liable to change course despite its gradual trajectory. “Ultimately everything about China is about control keeping control maintaining control” says Aldcroft. “And it’s not going to let things get out of control.”

This type of contrarian investing takes great conviction and nerves of steel but its practitioners—Templeton included—can be rewarded handsomely. The trick is to find the opportunities.

Right now I see gold as the ultimate contrarian investment. The yellow metal is largely unloved at the moment. It’s set to notch its worst monthly slump since November 2016 and the 50-day moving average is threatening to fall below the 200-day moving average.

Bloomberg reports that the S&P 500-to-gold ratio is nearing its highest level in over 15 years. As of this week it takes close to two and a half ounces of gold to buy one “share” of the S&P 500. That’s up significantly from September 2011 when two thirds of an ounce of gold was enough to get you entry.

All of this points to the fact that gold is extremely undervalued right now and no one seems to be paying much attention. I don’t know if this means we’re at “maximum pessimism.” What I do know is that all of the traditional drivers of the gold price are firmly in place making the yellow metal very attractive I believe. I’ll highlight two of those drivers below.

Record Money-Printing Favors Gold

Over the past 18 months central banks have taken unprecedented measures to prop up their economies. That includes printing money at a record pace which has the direct effect of diluting the purchasing power of the local currency.

Recently I shared with you that nearly a quarter of all U.S. dollars in circulation has been created since January 2020. What that means essentially is that the greenback has lost a quarter of its value thanks to the actions of Powell & Company.

Such money-printing has rightfully triggered massive interest in Bitcoin which (unlike the dollar) is completely decentralized and has no third-party risk. The rate of new Bitcoin issuance is cut in half roughly every four years. No central banker then can push a button and create millions more Bitcoin out of thin air.

The same can be said of physical gold. Gold’s supply growth is naturally restricted by a lack of new large discoveries and companies’ reluctance to spend more to develop harder-to-mine deposits.

One advantage that gold has over Bitcoin is that there’s decades’ worth of data illustrating the near-perfect positive correlation between the amount of money circulating in the U.S. economy and the price of gold. As the value of the U.S. dollar has decreased due to greater rates of money-printing gold has surged to new record highs.

The implication of course is that gold may continue to benefit from the Fed’s easy-money policies.

Inflation to Remain Elevated

The second factor is something I’ve been writing a lot about lately—inflation. May’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 5% over the same month last year. That’s the highest rate we’ve seen since August 2008.

The real inflation though could be much higher. The price of used cars and trucks are up more than 36% from last year according to vehicle auction company Manheim with some pre-owned vehicles selling for more than their original sticker price.

Or consider home prices. They climbed at their fastest rate on record in April increasing 14.5% year-over-year surpassing the previous record rate set in September 2005.

Despite the Fed’s insistence that this current spate of inflation is “transitory” analysts at Bank of America believe prices could remain elevated for two to four years. Short of a major financial crisis central banks are unlikely to raise rates in the next six months to tame inflation according to the bank. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool shows there’s a 100% chance of rates staying near zero until at least the end of 2021.

Everyone’s heard at one point or another that gold is an excellent inflation hedge. That hasn’t been true in every cycle and it’s not true now: The CPI is up 5% while gold is effectively flat compared to a year ago.

But that may be because we’re at “maximum pessimism” as Templeton called it. Gold is presently out of favor as stocks chart new all-time highs. If Templeton were alive today he might say now is the time to buy.

Plus with bond yields trading below zero on a real basis right now investors may have little alternative than to consider gold and gold mining stocks in an effort to combat inflation’s impact on their portfolios.

I’m a woman in my early forties living with my seventy-plus old mother.For most of my life I’ve lived with a debilitating autoimmune condition largely dependent on immunosuppressants for my daily functioning. Pain  fever muscle aches rashes allergic cough stomach issues are regular features of my life.Over the years viruses have shown a great affinity towards me. Yes all thanks to my suppressed immune system. Prior to the pandemic I’d been admitted twice to the hospital ailing from two different viral infections so when a new virus took over the world I surely didn’t want to be its next marked victim I decided I would be extra careful I took all the safety measures I didn’t venture out tried to stay as healthy as possible exercised took health supplements and avoided humans like the plague. Unfortunately the last part didn’t last too long. Sometime after boredom took over longing for more human company I decided to stay with my sister who lives in the same city for the weekend a decision that later proved to be detrimental in introducing me to the novel coronavirus!As luck would have it the day mom and I returned from my sister’s place my brother-in-law fell sick tests further confirmed his COVID positive status. In retrospect I knew I was next in line but at that time I was living in a state of denial I decided not to get myself tested until I showed any symptoms and sure enough on the third day I slowly started showing signs of tiredness muscle pain headache cough but all these symptoms aren’t new to me so I continued living in doubt next I had gotten chills mild fever a little breathlessness again not very uncommon to me but finally my sister ordered me to get myself immediately tested.Not surprising to anyone except me I was found not only positive but had a viral load slightly on the higher side by then I’d lost my sense of smell and taste. I was woken from my reverie.Once the results were out I transformed myself I decided to accept my situation block negativity and face each day as it comes. Unfortunately the next day my mom fell sick too circumstances dictated that we get ourselves admitted to the hospital to be on the safer side. Once in the hospital I decided to stop following the news vowed not to Google any information regarding COVID treatment trust doctor’s medicament and most importantly stopped receiving calls or replying to messages from people who tend to give unsolicited advice. All this made my battle against the virus tolerable. Something worth mentioning here was the positive and cheerful attitude of the doctor and the hospital staff was a big added bonus.We were in the hospital for six days if you ask me what was the most daunting part that I endured during this stay; it would be the blood tests which were done every alternate day They’d become a thorough nightmare due to my pre-existing condition fuelled with anaemia; my veins are very thin and blood flows very slowly after a lot of pricking prodding squeezing my limbs a vial or half would fill up and it was never enough so the lab technician had to revisit after a few hours to collect the adequate amount of blood sample and I’d to go through the same ordeal all over again. I survived that and also the onslaught of antibiotics steroids administered during and after being discharged from the hospital. I guess I should be grateful I didn’t encounter any major complications in spite of being in the high-risk category owing to my health problems. Recovery was tough it took me almost 45 days to feel my normal self again. Looking back I’d never imagined I would scrape through if I was ever infected by the coronavirus but here I am sharing with you my story of surviving the dreadful virus. I cannot confirm or deny that “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” but certainly I’m living a little longer and happy to do so!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL250cGMtb25nYy10by1ib29zdC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1vZi1vZmZzaG9yZS13aW5kLWVuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDExMTEwNi5jbXPSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMvbnRwYy1vbmdjLXRvLWJvb3N0LWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW9mLW9mZnNob3JlLXdpbmQtZW5lcmd5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDExMTEwNi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NTPC ONGC to boost development of offshore wind energy,"

State-run power giant NTPC and upstream oil firm ONGC have planned to boost the development of offshore wind energy in India which is blessed with a coastline of about 7600 km surrounded by water on three sides and has good prospects of harnessing this clean source. Earlier in May last year NTPC and ONGC had signed a memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) to accelerate their footprint in the renewable energy space.As per the MoU NTPC and ONGC will explore the setting up of offshore wind and other renewable energy projects in India and overseas.The pact also provided that they shall also explore opportunities in the fields of sustainability storage E-mobility and ESG (Environmental Social and Governance) compliant projects.Now the MoU assumes significance in view of almost doubling the target of renewable energy capacity addition to 60GW by 2032 by NTPC last month.Moreover NTPC has also shown its intention to bring an initial public offer of its arm NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd to raise funds for achieving 60 GW clean energy capacity by 2032 which requires about Rs 2.5 lakh crore investment.A senior official said that NTPC as well as ONGC want to boost the offshore wind energy capacity in the country which is more efficient than the onshore wind turbines.The official further said that the onshore wind turbine efficiency is up to 25 per cent while offshore windmills can be 50 to 60 per cent efficient and this is relevant in view of limited land resources in the country and also safety aspects.Keeping in view the 7600 km long coastline and the expertise of ONGC in handling offshore operations this association can bring a sea change in this segment of clean energy the official added.According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) portal offshore wind turbines are much larger in size (in range of 5 to 10 MW per turbine) as against 2-3 MW of an onshore wind turbine.While the cost per MW for offshore turbines is higher because of stronger structures and foundations needed in marine environments the desirable tariffs can be achieved on account of higher efficiencies of these turbines after the development of the ecosystem it says.The MNRE has set a target of 5 GW of offshore wind installations by 2022 and 30 GW by 2030.The wind resources assessment carried out by the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) gives total wind energy potential at 302 GW at 100-meter hub height.Out of the total estimated potential more than 95 per cent of commercially exploitable wind resources are concentrated in seven states ( Andhra Pradesh  Gujarat Karnataka  Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9uZXdzP2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGxCU2s0RVV5REhHcSUyQjBscHJ3ZVJINCUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hitachi ABB Power Grids evolves to become Hitachi Energy broadens commitment to sustainable energy future,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/news?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDlBSk4EUyDHGq%2B0lprweRH4%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9uZXdzP2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGxCU2s0RVV5REhHcSUyQjBscHJ3ZVJINCUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV82ODQ1MjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next Lieutenant Governor appointed,"Next Lieutenant Governor appointed

On the first death anniversary of veteran choreographer Saroj Khan model-actor Darasing Khurana remembers spending a great time with her in her last few days. Darasing spearheaded a digital cultural event organised by a UK-based organisation for artistes during the lockdown last year and Saroj Khan was the guest of honour for the dance event.“Saroj ji had a childlike energy. She was so much in love with her work that she would say ‘Beta please get me more events.I want to work till my last breath.’ It was so inspiring to see how she let her passion and enthusiasm overpower her bad health. Even when she was part of the event she was unwell. We even suggested her to back out but she was persistent that she wanted to be part of this event. That’s how much she loved her work. Her spirit was truly commendable. During the event she interacted enthusiastically with all the participants and even shared feedback with those who performed” says Darasing.Saroj Khan (L) and Darasing Khurana He also spent a lot of quality time with the veteran choreographer whose steps Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi followed on screen around that time and he remembers how the last few years were tough for Khan professionally. “Saroj ji told me that she was longing for work. While everyone in the industry respected her and promised her work in their films few ever called her back. I feel honoured to have shared such a close bond with Saroj ji and I really miss her” says Darasing."

I love you Diet Coke,"At significant risk of giving a multinational corporation publicity it does not need – please feel free to Google oligopoly markets after reading this piece – I am going to extol the virtues of a long-term love: Diet Coke. Someone has to given Cristiano Ronaldo’s rejection of the drink in a Euro 2020 press conference and a recent plummet in its share price.

There are two types of people: those who can tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi and those whose taste buds are clearly compromised. Confusing the two is basically like downing a glass of red and proclaiming: “Love a sauvignon blanc!”

I almost certainly started drinking Coca-Cola products too young my gateway drug being regular Coca-Cola. Now I can’t abide the stuff – it feels as I imagine it would to brush one’s teeth with sugar. But Diet Coke? Someone could make a lot of money opening a rehab clinic.

That exultant hiss of freed fizz is merry music indeed. The pretty patterns of the bubbles rising to the surface. The exquisite tingle on the tongue.

There is a hierarchy of receptacles. I maintain that Diet Coke tastes better from a glass bottle poured over crushed ice. A recyclable (and teeth‑preserving) straw added to the mix. Next is the pop of a cool can straight from the fridge diamonds of condensation glittering on silver.

Plastic bottles are out. Not only because (science backs me up here) the chemicals that make up the plastic are capable of contaminating the flavour of the drink but also because the warmer the beverage the more CO 2 escapes. The heart sinks when one orders Diet Coke at a festival then spies a two-litre bottle with the flat three inches of liquid languishing at the bottom.

I have cut down on Diet Coke a lot in the past few years. I now consist almost entirely of tap water Earl Grey tea and cognac but that gives the DC an extra pleasurable edge when indulging. I can’t agree that aspartame rots the brain given that my intelligence is clearly off the scale (yesterday I laughed for a solid 20 minutes at someone emulating the waddle of a duck) but I get that it’s probably not the healthiest thing in the world. Please join me in raising a glass though to the greatest soft drink there is.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjI1NDUxMjUvcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWFtZXJpY2EtZWR1Y2F0aW9uLXBvbGFyaXphdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The GOP backlash against corporations isn't real — yet,"For much of this year Republicans have been openly feuding with their most important constituency — big business.

After the January 6 insurrection the social media giants deleted Trump’s accounts while other major corporations like Comcast and UPS suspended campaign donations to Republicans who supported overturning the 2020 election.

After Georgia passed its crackdown on voting rights in April Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines condemned the bill while Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game out of Atlanta — leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to warn that “corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country.” Corporate criticism of Texas’s new voting legislation likely to be approved in a special legislative session prompted Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) to openly threaten financial retaliation.

In May and June Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis blocked cruise line companies’ renewed efforts to require their passengers and crew to get Covid-19 vaccinations. The phrase “woke capital” an epithet for a corporate world deemed overly left-wing is everywhere in conservative discourse.

The liberal reaction to all this has largely been dismissive seeing the GOP battle with corporations as more lovers’ spat than divorce. Liberals point out that Facebook opened the door to a Trump return in two years while corporations have figured out ways around their no-donation pledges. Meanwhile they say most of the GOP anti-corporate rhetoric isn’t backed up by policy substance: DeSantis’s fight with cruise lines is one of only a handful of Republican efforts with real teeth.

Certainly history doesn’t give much reason to think this will all amount to something real. The GOP and corporate America have been joined at the hip for the entirety of the modern political era animated by opposition to regulation and taxation.

Yet the tremors are worth taking seriously: They are manifestations of a tectonic shift in American politics toward polarization along educational lines.

Whites with college degrees a longtime Republican demographic have shifted into the Democratic camp; noncollege whites have become the GOP’s most important base. These fundamental shifts are realigning the interests of both the corporate world and the GOP — leading the former to lean into social liberalism while the latter embraces right-wing cultural war as its principal message.

These trends have been building up over time and they suggest that the GOP anti-corporate turn could one day swell into something consequential instead of mainly posturing.

An important test case is happening now. The House is currently considering a series of anti-trust bills targeting Big Tech the corporate sector populist Republicans hate most of all. How Republicans handle this legislative fight will give us a clue as to how serious the GOP’s anti-corporate turn is.

“The longstanding relationship between the business community and the Republican Party is now changing” says Didi Kuo a Stanford political scientist who studies business and politics. “I’m really not sure what happens next.”

How education polarization is leading to a clash between business and Republicans

Corporate America is not a monolith. Different sectors of the economy and individual companies have different interests in politics; an oil firm and a renewable energy company will have very different views on which political side to favor. Many firms give heavily to both parties; some even favor Democrats.

But it’s fair to say that the business community is generally on the GOP’s side. A 2014 study of corporate PAC donations found that 35 percent donated primarily to Republicans while a scant two percent preferred Democrats. A 2019 paper which looked at campaign contributions from 3800 CEOs of large companies found that 57 percent heavily favored Republicans (only 19 percent leaned Democratic).

That makes the recent rhetorical turn in the GOP striking. In his recent book The Tyranny of Big Tech Sen. Josh Hawley labeled companies like Google “the gravest threat to American liberty since the monopolies of the Gilded Age.” In May Sen. Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in the left-wing American Prospect blasting the GOP’s traditional pro-business policies. “Politicians in my own party have too often been reluctant to intervene over concerns about the ‘free market.’ But things are changing” argued Rubio.

This kind of rhetoric is a direct outgrowth of the Trump years. The former president showed that the politics of cultural grievance can be a winning formula for the GOP — that attacks on minorities the media and “liberal elites” are powerfully resonant with non-college whites in particular. From vaccines to public safety to “critical race theory” virtually all of the GOP’s messaging works to highlight the culture war. The party’s free market ideology is as a consequence simply less important to its public identity.

“At this point [Republicans] are driven mostly by cultural grievances that stem from the preoccupations of their most activist followers and ... the conservative entertainment complex” says Geoffrey Kabaservice the vice president of political studies at the center-right Niskanen Center. “Those things really have very little to do with business’ calculations about those things that are best for it.”

While Republicans have political incentives to play up their populist culturally conservative stances — even when they come into tension with free-market ideas — corporations face powerful pressures to take liberal positions on the social issues that most animate the GOP base.

Over the past few decades the percentage of Americans with a college degree has increased significantly as has the percentage of good-paying jobs that require one. The biggest sectors in the new “knowledge economy” like Big Tech and finance are full of employees with college degrees while some traditional blue collar sectors like manufacturing have stagnated.

Between 1956 and 2016 Republicans won a majority of whites with college degrees in every single presidential election. But in the Trump years Republicans’ identity demagoguery pushed college-educated whites — who tend to have more culturally liberal values — into the Democratic camp.

Research suggests that these changes are behind the new corporate willingness to make liberal statements on significant cultural issues like voter suppression and anti-trans bills. “It’s harder for businesses [now] to stay out of the chaos and say ‘we’re not involved’ in the social issues of the day” says Zhao Li a Princeton professor who studies the politics of business.

Liberal consumers care a lot about the politics of the corporations they buy from. One study found that Democrats are more likely to boycott businesses for political reasons than Republicans; another found that liberal consumers are more likely to purchase a company’s product if its CEO had publicly taken liberal political stances.

For major retail corporations with high brand recognition like Coca-Cola the political perceptions of liberals really matters. Not only are there more college graduates than ever but these graduates have an outsized market share because college graduates make more money. When you combine rising education polarization with other changes to key demographics like the overwhelmingly liberal preferences of younger Americans corporations have strong incentives to offer at least symbolic support for socially liberal causes.

But pressure on corporations isn’t just coming from the outside — it’s coming from the inside as well. The increasingly educated and urban workforce at major corporations is also pushing them in a more socially liberal direction.

A recent paper by two political scientists Cory Maks-Solomon and Josiah Mark Drewry examined the effect of LGBTQ employee groups on every Fortune 500 company finding “robust evidence that in highly-educated workforces LGBT employee groups persuade management to take public stances in support of LGBT rights.”

Another study of 10000 employees at a management consulting firm found that the launch of corporate social initiatives made employees less likely to quit: “Consultants in this firm willingly took pay cuts to participate in corporate social initiatives and their post-participation likelihood of staying at the firm was greater than that of nonparticipants.”

Beyond the culture wars there’s also the issue of how the Republican Party’s assaults on democracy affects the stability of the American system — something corporate America is deeply invested in. Corporations may instinctively side with the GOP on policy but if right-wing radicalism leads to market dysfunction and political instability then that may sway business toward the Democratic Party and its small-d democratic agenda.

“As the country becomes more dysfunctional that presents a greater existential threat to the business community that I think they’ll also be responsive to” Kuo says.

The GOP’s “war” on corporate America has been hollow so far

For all the tension between the Republican Party and big business so far there has been no break-up — not even close.

There have been policies here and there: DeSantis’s battle with cruise lines for example and a vote in Georgia’s House of Representatives to eliminate Delta’s special multi-million dollar tax cut as punishment for its opposition to the state’s new voting law. But the spat has been mostly rhetorical corporate-bashing to win points with anti-elite Trumpists. The Delta bill for example was never even considered by the state Senate.

What would a true breakup look like? It would at least involve an end to the mutual aid agreement that’s sustained their political alliance: businesses cutting off the cash flow to the right and Republicans becoming more willing to raise taxes and regulate corporate behavior.

So far there’s very little evidence of this happening. “It’s striking how the GOP has doubled down on very unpopular plutocratic priorities e.g. opposition to reasonable changes in tax code” says Jacob Hacker a political scientist at Yale.

When Rubio wrote an op-ed in March supporting the unionization drive an Amazon plant in Alabama he argued on pure culture war grounds — casting his position as punishment for Amazon removing an anti-trans book from its book store. He also said that he would continue to oppose the PRO Act the transformative pro-union bill passed by Democrats in the House because “adversarial relations between labor and management are wrong.”

Rubio’s article is unusually transparent about the hollowness of its argument. But it’s representative of the party’s anti-corporate positioning so far — all hat and no cattle.

“The party appears at this point to be caught between its old identity and this new identity that it thinks it wants to take on due to the influence of Donald Trump. But there’s very little convincing about this transformation so far” says Kabaservice the Niskanen scholar.

Yet the fact that business-Republican tensions haven’t yielded much of a substantive shift doesn’t mean they won’t in the future. One of the most significant tests of the GOP-corporate alliance’s durability at least in the short term is the Republican relationship with tech.

Republicans have long been suspicious of Big Tech accusing them of censoring conservative speech (generally with little evidence). Adding to the suspicion is that these companies — Apple Facebook and the like — tend to have highly educated workforces with extremely liberal political views.

Tensions exploded after the January 6 attack on the Capitol when multiple platforms banned then-President Trump for fear that his inflammatory posts could incite future violence. “If Big Tech can ban a former president what’s to stop them from silencing the American people next?” Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said in May after Facebook extended its Trump ban to 2023.

Currently the GOP’s seriousness in taking Big Tech to task and using government to regulate business is being tested in the House which is considering a package of bills strengthening anti-trust regulations on big tech companies.

The bills a Democratic-led effort that began with some Republican buy-in have gained support from prominent Trumpy House Republicans like Matt Gaetz (FL) and Madison Cawthorn (NC) — though House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has come out against them as has ranking House Judiciary member Jim Jordan (OH) (they have their own counterproposal).

So far the early signs are that GOP leadership is winning: The bills passed out of the Judiciary Committee with mostly Democratic support.

Anti-tech Republicans may well fail to bring the party to their side. But the fact that we’re even talking about a conflict between Republicans and corporate America speaks to a fundamental shift in American politics. As white voters continue to polarize along educational lines in the post-Trump era these skirmishes between two long-time allies deserve real attention.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS9jaGFuZ2UtYnV0LW5vLWNsb3N1cmUtaW4tcGxhY2hpbWFkYS9hcnRpY2xlNjE0NDcwNTYuZWNl0gFqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwva2VyYWxhL2NoYW5nZS1idXQtbm8tY2xvc3VyZS1pbi1wbGFjaGltYWRhL2FydGljbGU2MTQ0NzA1Ni5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Change but no closure in Plachimada,"July 03 2021 02:45 am | Updated December 04 2021 11:45 pm IST

In Plachimada a small Adivasi village in Palakkad district of Kerala a building once infamous was lying derelict and abandoned until recently. Overrun by weeds and bushes it was hard to imagine that this building was once the bottling plant of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages the Indian subsidiary of the Atlanta-based manufacturer of aerated drinks. Spread over 34 acres the 35000 sq ft ‘Coke building’ as it is referred to by the locals used to look haunted. Winds would whistle through broken windowpanes and snakes would lie hidden in the thick undergrowth. People rarely loitered in the area.

Today the sprawling single-storey edifice wears a fresh coat of paint. The ‘Coca-Cola’ logo has disappeared from the entrance of the building which smells of disinfectants and paint. The contested site now serves an important purpose to meet the challenges of the times. The Government of Kerala has spruced up and converted the building into a COVID-19 care facility . The company that had once caused grief to the locals closed the plant and left long ago but the building remained a symbol of despair. While the government believes that it has now become a sign of hope for all those affected by the raging pandemic the villagers of Plachimada are not as enthused.

A transformed space

The miraculous transformation took barely six weeks. The local bodies helmed by the Perumatty Grama Panchayat in Palakkad led the efforts. The building had caught the attention of the local administrators during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in May. Palakkad was seeing more than 3500 infections every day on average and a test positivity rate of more than 30%. The State Minister for Power K. Krishnankutty who wields great influence in the eastern Chittur belt including the Perumatty Grama Panchayat is largely credited for converting the Coke building into a healthcare facility with a clear eye on a possible third wave of the pandemic sweeping across the district.

It was important for the administration to ensure that the building was swiftly transformed. In May discussions on the project assumed a sense of urgency. In just a day 200-odd volunteers under the leadership of the Perumatty Grama Panchayat president Risha Premkumar cleared the weeds and bushes in the compound of the plant. Eight neighbouring panchayats under the Chittur Block joined hands and offered to donate up to ₹10 lakh each when the District Disaster Management Authority and the Chittur Block Panchayat chipped in ₹30 lakh each. With ₹1.4 crore in their pocket the authorities were excited to take up the work of the new COVID-19 care centre. Officials in Coca-Cola chipped in too offering their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to renovate the building. According to sources in the government Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages has spent ₹60 lakh from its CSR funds in three phases including to repair the building. Officials of the company refused to speak to this reporter.

With money flowing in new toilets were built and water facilities arranged. Apart from electrical partitioning and plumbing work the Nirmithi Kendra arranged cots beds and electrical fittings. A new spacious kitchen was set up with facilities to cater to more than 600 people. Engineers with experience in the medical field oversaw the setting up of a triage facility and sheds for biomedical waste disposal. With everyone working at a frenzied pace the goal was accomplished in about six weeks.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan could barely conceal his excitement when he inaugurated the hospital virtually on June 17. He was all praise not only for the officials of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages but also for all those who worked to build the treatment centre. “Four weeks is record time in setting up such a huge facility. The Plachimada treatment centre will give us a fillip in the fight against COVID-19. The centre will be most suited for COVID-19 treatment as it is located quite a distance away from areas where people live” he said.

The care facility has 550 beds. Of them 100 are oxygen beds 50 are ICU beds and 20 have ventilators. It also has air-conditioned ready-made cabins a portable X-ray console a round-the-clock pharmacy and a COVID-19 outpatient wing. The capacity of the oxygen tank set up at the centre can be enhanced from 1 KL to 2 KL.

At the time of going to press 40 COVID-19 patients had sought admission at the facility. “The infrastructure is right. We can accommodate 400 patients now. Very soon we will raise it to full capacity” said Nenmara Divisional Forest Officer R. Sivaprasad the nodal officer of the centre. Doctors and nurses have been appointed to take care of 200 patients round the clock. The patients here are not as fearful and concerned about the virus as those in other parts of the State. For now none of them is critically ill. At present only B-category patients are being admitted.

A water-guzzling plant

The unusual silence in the hospital is in contrast to the pitched struggle of the people in Plachimada some two decades ago. The people don’t show the same excitement that politicians and the government authorities display about the COVID-19 care facility.

Santhi C.S. a 43-year-old Adivasi woman who was at the forefront of the agitation against Coca-Cola said: “The people of this village are still suffering. We haven’t been given a single paisa of compensation. So how can we smile?”

Many who were part of the agitation echoed her sentiments. They said that applauding the transformation of a plant that had destroyed their water resources would amount to “making fun of the cause for which they stood”. Santhi an ASHA worker had been jailed several times along with other leaders of the agitation. She had also undergone a week-long hunger strike. “They are cheating us. These political leaders have their vested interests” she said.

Wariness about official promises and initiatives stems from the events in Plachimada that grabbed global attention in the early 2000s. A few months after Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages began operation in Plachimada in 2000 the villagers in the neighbouring areas began to face problems. According to one study by Dr. Sathish Chandran the water in some open wells and shallow bore wells which the villagers depended on began to taste strong and bitter; according to another study by Jananeethi an NGO it started tasting salty and hard after the company began manufacturing.

The plant the villagers realised soon was a water-guzzler: it drew about 20 lakh litres of groundwater from six bore wells and two ponds in the area every day. As a consequence local wells were slowly sucked dry. As the company had extracted excess groundwater the villagers began to drink water with high levels of calcium and magnesium.

Studies conducted at a laboratory at the University of Exeter U.K. found high levels of lead and cadmium in the sludge from the factory. The villagers had not been aware of the health threats posed by these metals until activists and scientists informed them about it. The sludge was initially sold to the farmers as fertilizer. Later it was given free. When protests erupted the sludge was dumped by the roadside.

“Many of us developed skin rashes and deformities. Although we stopped consuming the contaminated water in our wells many of us had already fallen sick because of it” recalled Santhi.

M. Thankavelu son of Mayilamma the ‘Plachimada Heroine’ who stood at the forefront of the agitation until her death in 2007 was at the brink of death after he contracted psoriasis. “Like my mother I too contracted this terrible disease from our exposure to toxic water. I could not move out of my house for about a year. I never thought I could survive to speak to you now” he said.

C. Murugan a paddy labourer from Plachimada said that at least half a dozen people had miscarriages because of the contaminated water.

With water rapidly depleting and giving them all kinds of health problems the residents soon became parched. Many had to trek long distances for potable water. Their primary livelihood from farming was affected and agricultural production declined.

From April 2002 to March 2004 Plachimada witnessed fierce and protracted protests under the banner of the Coca-Cola Virudha Janakeeya Samara Samithy (Anti-Coca-Cola People’s Struggle Committee) demanding people’s right to natural resources especially water. Groups from different parts of the country joined the agitation. National activists like Medha Patkar and Vandana Shiva inspired the protesters. Hundreds of protesters including women and children were arrested and beaten up. Soon the agitation turned into a long legal battle.

A world water conference organised near Plachimada in January 2004 adopted a declaration which stated that “it is our fundamental obligation to prevent water scarcity and pollution and to preserve it for generations... Water is not a commodity. We should resist all criminal attempts to marketise privatise and corporatise water. Only through these means can we ensure the fundamental and inalienable right to water for the people all over the world”.

The people won the agitation in 2005 when the company finally put up the shutters and left Plachimada. In 2017 Coca-Cola submitted to the Supreme Court that it had no intentions of resuming operations in Plachimada. Santhi the joint convener of the protest body said that it was not a mere victory of their agitation; “it was a victory of all such struggles to come”.

Waiting for compensation

However the people of Plachimada remain disappointed. Governments have come and gone but their promises have not been fulfilled. “The transformation of the building seems to be an effort to whitewash the actions of the multinational company. Governments have always been supporting the company. That’s why our leaders have not given the villagers who suffered from water pollution a single paisa in compensation” alleged Arumughan Pathichira State general convener of the Samara Samithy. “If the government is honest let it give the victims their compensation. We have no objection to the COVID-19 hospital; it is very important. But the government should have confiscated the property and compensated the victims” he said. Arumughan warned that the villagers would strengthen their agitation until the victims are duly compensated.

A government-appointed high-level committee headed by the then Additional Chief Secretary K. Jayakumar had assessed the degradation of the environment and damage suffered by the people of Plachimada and recommended a compensation of ₹216.24 crore to be paid to them. The committee had also recommended setting up a tribunal for proper distribution of damages. Although the State Assembly passed the Plachimada Coca-Cola Victims’ Relief and Compensation Claims Tribunal Bill in 2011 it did not get the Centre’s nod . And though the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had assured the people that a tribunal would be formed in its 2016 Assembly election manifesto this promise has not been kept. The LDF has got a consecutive second term in Kerala but the people of Plachimada are not hopeful.

Coca-Cola has consistently opposed the setting up of a tribunal. It has claimed that the estimated losses were computed through a flawed process. According to Coca-Cola its operations in Plachimada did not cause any water depletion or environmental damage as the company had followed the same process in the village as it did around the world.

The residents of the village scoff at this claim. “Everyone knows that the company has left leaving behind a trail of misery . We need compensation” said Sakthivel K. general convener of the Samara Samithy. Sakthivel was among the dozen-odd agitators who were arrested by the police on June 17 for protesting outside the new COVID-19 facility while the Chief Minister was inaugurating it. Front-line leaders of the Samara Samithy — Vijayan Ambalakkad and Vilayodi Venugopal — also courted arrest along with Sakthivel.

Preparing for a third wave

For the State government this new facility is more than politics. Minister Krishnankutty who has been involved throughout the process said the Plachimada facility will go a long way in strengthening the district’s preparedness to face another wave of COVID-19 infections. “We are thinking about how we can overcome the problems we faced in the second wave. Such a hospital in government control will help provide care for COVID-19 patients from all sections. We can ensure equity in treatment for everyone in the rural sector” he said.

Water for the facility will be drawn from a large pond within the compound. It will be used after UV filtering. Two tanks of 10000 L capacity each have been set up and fresh pipelines have been laid for the purpose. Sivaprasad said that potable water was available and storage capacity would be enhanced when more patients come. Today almost all houses in the village have pipeline connections and water is being pumped in from the Bharathappuzha river.

The facility is close to Kerala’s border with Tamil Nadu. If the COVID-19 situation worsens during a third wave the hospital can be opened for the people from Tamil Nadu as well. The Palakkad district administration has given consent for this.

“We are happy we could use the abandoned factory to gear up for the next phase of the pandemic” said Premkumar. “We had faced many shortcomings when we set up a first-line treatment centre for COVID-19 at the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Park at Kanjikode. Here we have been able to address all of them” she said.

State Health Minister Veena George recently visited the Plachimada hospital and said that the State was prepared to face a third wave. Problems that the district saw during the second wave included a shortage of oxygen beds ICU beds and ventilators. Some private hospitals refused to set aside beds for COVID-19 treatment. A recent assessment also found that a large number of category-A patients had occupied the beds leading to a shortage of beds for category-B patients. Given the failure to treat non-COVID-19 cases long distances from houses to hospitals and non-cooperation of some private hospitals cases shot up in Palakkad in recent months.

A committee of officials and people’s representatives will be in charge of the Plachimada COVID-19 hospital. But the people still want closure for their past suffering. Kanniyamma 75 said the early 2000s were a terrible time. “We lost peace our drinking water our sound health” she said. The State government may have seized an opportunity to heal Plachimada but its residents are still far from being placated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tdWNoLWplbm5pZmVyLWFuaXN0b24tb3RoZXItYWN0b3JzLTIyMDAwMDk5Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Much Jennifer Aniston and Other Actors Get Paid for Their Reruns,"Matt Baron/REX / Shutterstock.com

Forbes was referring to ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" which ran for nine seasons ending in 2005 and continues in reruns on TV Land. Romano can earn up to $18 million a year mainly from show residuals Forbes and Vanity Fair reported.

Under its previous Racing Point and Force India guise the team competed in a striking pink livery between 2017-2020 before its latest change of identity to Aston Martin came after Lawrence Stroll became a part-owner and executive chairman of the British luxury car manufacturer last year.

But Aston Martin’s new livery has in certain lights made it difficult to distinguish its cars on TV coverage from other teams running dark colour schemes - most notably Mercedes.

Aston Martin CEO Otmar Szafnauer admitted there is room for improvement with its green livery and revealed it is looking at ways to make its colour “pop"" more on TV to help it avoid looking too similar to rival machinery.

“The green colour suits us that's for sure” Szafnauer said at the Austrian Grand Prix. ""It's a stunning colour in the sun and when you're looking at it in person.

""But I believe we should be looking at making it pop a little bit more on television - without losing the green when you're looking at it outside.

""I don't know if we can do that but that's one thing that we're looking to do just to make sure that it differentiates itself on TV from some of the other darker cars.”

Ahead of last weekend’s Styrian Grand Prix BWT CEO Andreas Weissenbacher told Speedweek that Aston Martin should revert to its pink colours.

""Aston Martin boss Lawrence Stroll understands that my heart is bleeding” he said. “If the Aston Martin were pink title sponsor Cognizant would also have more fun because the recognition value would be much higher.

""From a business point of view it was wrong. Historically the British racing green is certainly understandable for many not for me. The Aston Martin does not stand out on TV.”

But Szafnauer played down the chances of Aston Martin giving back full branding rights to BWT as Weissenbacher had suggested.

""With the name of Aston Martin and Aston Martin being green traditionally and we're growing the Aston Martin Cognizant F1 team I would think it will stay green"" he stressed.

""Ferrari is red. Aston Martin is green.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGYxLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FzdG9uLW1hcnRpbi1hbXIyMS1saXZlcnktY2hhbmdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aston Martin will look into livening up livery,"Aston Martin has confirmed they will try and brighten up their livery on the AMR21 but a return to a predominant pink has been ruled out.

The return of the Aston Martin name to Formula 1 also brought with it a return of racing green to the Formula 1 grid. The initial reception to the AMR21 livery was a positive one but that has not stood firm over the test of time due to how the colour scheme has translated across to the television screens.

Aston Martin’s livery was thrust further into the spotlight when sponsors BWT called for the car to return to a pink colour which became synonymous with the team when they were known as Racing Point.

But Aston Martin team boss Otmar Szafnauer has said the green will be here to stay on the AMR21 yet the team are looking into ways to liven the livery up so it stands out more on television.

“I think the green colour suits us that’s very clear” Szafnauer told reporters in Austria as quoted by Grandpx.news.

“If you see it live it’s a great colour especially in the sun.

“I think we should look to see whether we can emphasise it a little more for TV without losing the green.

“I don’t know if we can do that. But let’s see how we can distinguish it from the other dark cars for the TV pictures.

“Given our name and the fact that Aston Martin is traditionally green and we are expanding the team in Formula 1 I think we will stay green.

She was 96.

Her daughter Delia Betancourt confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.

Every fan of the genre knew what to expect: Gypsy maidens. Wicked stepmothers. Wealthy handsome male heirs. Amnesia fictional illnesses mistaken identities misplaced babies. And at the center of it all a young and beautiful woman who was often an orphan but always from a humble background and with whom the well-born young man would fall madly in love — though the couple would be thwarted through all sorts of swirling Shakespearean complications (murder faked pregnancies love triangles those conniving stepmothers) before coming together in a happy ending 200 or so episodes later.

(American soap operas go on forever with an unending cast of characters. The telenovela works itself out in under a year with a finite cast of characters. Mostly they end happily.)

“The essential theme of a novela is the story of a love that is obstructed” Ms. Fiallo told Variety in 1996. “A couple meet fall in love suffer obstacles in being able to fulfill that love and at the end reach happiness.” She added “If you don’t make the public cry you won’t achieve anything.”",,,,,,,,,

After the January 6 insurrection the social media giants deleted Trump’s accounts while other major corporations like Comcast and UPS suspended campaign donations to Republicans who supported overturning the 2020 election.

After Georgia passed its crackdown on voting rights in April Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines condemned the bill while Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game out of Atlanta — leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to warn that “corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country.” Corporate criticism of Texas’s new voting legislation likely to be approved in a special legislative session prompted Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) to openly threaten financial retaliation.

In May and June Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis blocked cruise line companies’ renewed efforts to require their passengers and crew to get Covid-19 vaccinations. The phrase “woke capital” an epithet for a corporate world deemed overly left-wing is everywhere in conservative discourse.

The liberal reaction to all this has largely been dismissive seeing the GOP battle with corporations as more lovers’ spat than divorce. Liberals point out that Facebook opened the door to a Trump return in two years while corporations have figured out ways around their no-donation pledges. Meanwhile they say most of the GOP anti-corporate rhetoric isn’t backed up by policy substance: DeSantis’s fight with cruise lines is one of only a handful of Republican efforts with real teeth.

Certainly history doesn’t give much reason to think this will all amount to something real. The GOP and corporate America have been joined at the hip for the entirety of the modern political era animated by opposition to regulation and taxation.

Yet the tremors are worth taking seriously: They are manifestations of a tectonic shift in American politics toward polarization along educational lines.

Whites with college degrees a longtime Republican demographic have shifted into the Democratic camp; noncollege whites have become the GOP’s most important base. These fundamental shifts are realigning the interests of both the corporate world and the GOP — leading the former to lean into social liberalism while the latter embraces right-wing cultural war as its principal message.

These trends have been building up over time and they suggest that the GOP anti-corporate turn could one day swell into something consequential instead of mainly posturing.

An important test case is happening now. The House is currently considering a series of anti-trust bills targeting Big Tech the corporate sector populist Republicans hate most of all. How Republicans handle this legislative fight will give us a clue as to how serious the GOP’s anti-corporate turn is.

“The longstanding relationship between the business community and the Republican Party is now changing” says Didi Kuo a Stanford political scientist who studies business and politics. “I’m really not sure what happens next.”

How education polarization is leading to a clash between business and Republicans

Corporate America is not a monolith. Different sectors of the economy and individual companies have different interests in politics; an oil firm and a renewable energy company will have very different views on which political side to favor. Many firms give heavily to both parties; some even favor Democrats.

But it’s fair to say that the business community is generally on the GOP’s side. A 2014 study of corporate PAC donations found that 35 percent donated primarily to Republicans while a scant two percent preferred Democrats. A 2019 paper which looked at campaign contributions from 3800 CEOs of large companies found that 57 percent heavily favored Republicans (only 19 percent leaned Democratic).

That makes the recent rhetorical turn in the GOP striking. In his recent book The Tyranny of Big Tech Sen. Josh Hawley labeled companies like Google “the gravest threat to American liberty since the monopolies of the Gilded Age.” In May Sen. Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in the left-wing American Prospect blasting the GOP’s traditional pro-business policies. “Politicians in my own party have too often been reluctant to intervene over concerns about the ‘free market.’ But things are changing” argued Rubio.

This kind of rhetoric is a direct outgrowth of the Trump years. The former president showed that the politics of cultural grievance can be a winning formula for the GOP — that attacks on minorities the media and “liberal elites” are powerfully resonant with non-college whites in particular. From vaccines to public safety to “critical race theory” virtually all of the GOP’s messaging works to highlight the culture war. The party’s free market ideology is as a consequence simply less important to its public identity.

“At this point [Republicans] are driven mostly by cultural grievances that stem from the preoccupations of their most activist followers and ... the conservative entertainment complex” says Geoffrey Kabaservice the vice president of political studies at the center-right Niskanen Center. “Those things really have very little to do with business’ calculations about those things that are best for it.”

While Republicans have political incentives to play up their populist culturally conservative stances — even when they come into tension with free-market ideas — corporations face powerful pressures to take liberal positions on the social issues that most animate the GOP base.

Over the past few decades the percentage of Americans with a college degree has increased significantly as has the percentage of good-paying jobs that require one. The biggest sectors in the new “knowledge economy” like Big Tech and finance are full of employees with college degrees while some traditional blue collar sectors like manufacturing have stagnated.

Between 1956 and 2016 Republicans won a majority of whites with college degrees in every single presidential election. But in the Trump years Republicans’ identity demagoguery pushed college-educated whites — who tend to have more culturally liberal values — into the Democratic camp.

Research suggests that these changes are behind the new corporate willingness to make liberal statements on significant cultural issues like voter suppression and anti-trans bills. “It’s harder for businesses [now] to stay out of the chaos and say ‘we’re not involved’ in the social issues of the day” says Zhao Li a Princeton professor who studies the politics of business.

Liberal consumers care a lot about the politics of the corporations they buy from. One study found that Democrats are more likely to boycott businesses for political reasons than Republicans; another found that liberal consumers are more likely to purchase a company’s product if its CEO had publicly taken liberal political stances.

For major retail corporations with high brand recognition like Coca-Cola the political perceptions of liberals really matters. Not only are there more college graduates than ever but these graduates have an outsized market share because college graduates make more money. When you combine rising education polarization with other changes to key demographics like the overwhelmingly liberal preferences of younger Americans corporations have strong incentives to offer at least symbolic support for socially liberal causes.

But pressure on corporations isn’t just coming from the outside — it’s coming from the inside as well. The increasingly educated and urban workforce at major corporations is also pushing them in a more socially liberal direction.

A recent paper by two political scientists Cory Maks-Solomon and Josiah Mark Drewry examined the effect of LGBTQ employee groups on every Fortune 500 company finding “robust evidence that in highly-educated workforces LGBT employee groups persuade management to take public stances in support of LGBT rights.”

Another study of 10000 employees at a management consulting firm found that the launch of corporate social initiatives made employees less likely to quit: “Consultants in this firm willingly took pay cuts to participate in corporate social initiatives and their post-participation likelihood of staying at the firm was greater than that of nonparticipants.”

Beyond the culture wars there’s also the issue of how the Republican Party’s assaults on democracy affects the stability of the American system — something corporate America is deeply invested in. Corporations may instinctively side with the GOP on policy but if right-wing radicalism leads to market dysfunction and political instability then that may sway business toward the Democratic Party and its small-d democratic agenda.

“As the country becomes more dysfunctional that presents a greater existential threat to the business community that I think they’ll also be responsive to” Kuo says.

The GOP’s “war” on corporate America has been hollow so far

For all the tension between the Republican Party and big business so far there has been no break-up — not even close.

There have been policies here and there: DeSantis’s battle with cruise lines for example and a vote in Georgia’s House of Representatives to eliminate Delta’s special multi-million dollar tax cut as punishment for its opposition to the state’s new voting law. But the spat has been mostly rhetorical corporate-bashing to win points with anti-elite Trumpists. The Delta bill for example was never even considered by the state Senate.

What would a true breakup look like? It would at least involve an end to the mutual aid agreement that’s sustained their political alliance: businesses cutting off the cash flow to the right and Republicans becoming more willing to raise taxes and regulate corporate behavior.

So far there’s very little evidence of this happening. “It’s striking how the GOP has doubled down on very unpopular plutocratic priorities e.g. opposition to reasonable changes in tax code” says Jacob Hacker a political scientist at Yale.

When Rubio wrote an op-ed in March supporting the unionization drive an Amazon plant in Alabama he argued on pure culture war grounds — casting his position as punishment for Amazon removing an anti-trans book from its book store. He also said that he would continue to oppose the PRO Act the transformative pro-union bill passed by Democrats in the House because “adversarial relations between labor and management are wrong.”

Rubio’s article is unusually transparent about the hollowness of its argument. But it’s representative of the party’s anti-corporate positioning so far — all hat and no cattle.

“The party appears at this point to be caught between its old identity and this new identity that it thinks it wants to take on due to the influence of Donald Trump. But there’s very little convincing about this transformation so far” says Kabaservice the Niskanen scholar.

Yet the fact that business-Republican tensions haven’t yielded much of a substantive shift doesn’t mean they won’t in the future. One of the most significant tests of the GOP-corporate alliance’s durability at least in the short term is the Republican relationship with tech.

Republicans have long been suspicious of Big Tech accusing them of censoring conservative speech (generally with little evidence). Adding to the suspicion is that these companies — Apple Facebook and the like — tend to have highly educated workforces with extremely liberal political views.

Tensions exploded after the January 6 attack on the Capitol when multiple platforms banned then-President Trump for fear that his inflammatory posts could incite future violence. “If Big Tech can ban a former president what’s to stop them from silencing the American people next?” Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said in May after Facebook extended its Trump ban to 2023.

Currently the GOP’s seriousness in taking Big Tech to task and using government to regulate business is being tested in the House which is considering a package of bills strengthening anti-trust regulations on big tech companies.

The bills a Democratic-led effort that began with some Republican buy-in have gained support from prominent Trumpy House Republicans like Matt Gaetz (FL) and Madison Cawthorn (NC) — though House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has come out against them as has ranking House Judiciary member Jim Jordan (OH) (they have their own counterproposal).

So far the early signs are that GOP leadership is winning: The bills passed out of the Judiciary Committee with mostly Democratic support.

Anti-tech Republicans may well fail to bring the party to their side. But the fact that we’re even talking about a conflict between Republicans and corporate America speaks to a fundamental shift in American politics. As white voters continue to polarize along educational lines in the post-Trump era these skirmishes between two long-time allies deserve real attention.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwdW5jaC5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9zdHJhaWdodC10by1iZWNodGVsLXdoZW4tZG9uYWxkLXJ1bXNmZWxkLWxhaWQtcGlwZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Straight to Bechtel - CounterPunch.org,,,,,,,,,,

Known for driving home runs over the fence Haase unleashed his secret weapon.

Speed.

""When he dove it got by him"" Haase said. ""I knew it was time to turn it on.""

Hamilton chased after the ball which rolled to the warning track. Jonathan Schoop and Miguel Cabrera scored easily. Third base coach Chip Hale aggressively waved his arm. Haase chugged around third base and crossed home plate for a three-run inside-the-park homer in the fourth inning.

But that moment wasn't the only reasons fans applauded Saturday at Comerica Park. The Tigers (37-46) scored four more runs in the fifth inning propelling them to a 11-5 win over the Chicago White Sox in the second of three games in the series.

Entering Saturday Detroit had lost 18 of its past 20 games against the White Sox.

""Wins we'll take them from whoever we can be lucky enough to get them from"" Haase said. ""But these guys have notoriously beat us up a little bit. We've just been playing really good baseball and to be doing it against the (American League Central) division leaders is huge.""

Haase's inside-the-park home run was the first by a Tiger since JaCoby Jones' on Aug. 10 2020 against the White Sox.

For their 11 runs the Tigers recorded 10 hits and eight walks — scoring three runs in the fourth inning four in the fifth three in the seventh and one in the eighth. Haase crushed his second home run in the seventh (this one over the fence in right field). It marked his fourth multi-homer game in 2021.

His three-run blast pushed the Tigers' lead to 10-5.

""They have played us very tough this year"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. ""We've had some close games that slipped away against them. They're leading the division for a reason. They have a ton of talent and they're doing a good job of collecting a lot of wins. Today we fought back.""

Haase finished 3-for-4 with six RBI. Through 36 games this season he has 11 home runs. Schoop crushed his team-leading 16th homer (in 79 games) in the eighth inning. His solo homer traveled 440 feet to straightaway center.

""That was a no-doubter off the bat"" Haase said.

Hinch turned to his bullpen in the sixth inning.

His first reliever right-hander Joe Jimenez struck out the side all on fastballs: Hamilton and Danny Mendick went down swinging and Zack Collins got punched out looking. For Mendick's whiff to end the inning Jimenez's fastball maxed out at 97.3 mph.

Once Jimenez completed his job Hinch went to his most reliable relievers. Righty Jose Cisnero pitched a scoreless seventh thanks to an inning-ending 6-4-3 double play started by shortstop Zack Short. Right-hander Kyle Funkhouser added a scoreless eighth this time behind a 4-6-3 double play started by second baseman Willi Castro.

Righty Buck Farmer pitched a perfect ninth.

""Things are clicking for him"" Hinch said about Jimenez. ""Obviously Fett (pitching coach Chris Fetter) and Juan (Nieves assistant pitching coach) have done a great job with him both mentally and physically. I trust him a lot. I said early in the season 'Our best bullpen has Joe Jimenez in it.' ... Joe deserves a lot of credit.""

Not when they had singles doubles walks and Akil Baddoo's leadoff presence (along with his flying helmet) leading them to a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox in Sunday's series finale at Comerica Park.

The Tigers (38-46) won two of three games in the series and own a 29-22 record since May 8. Detroit logged its first series win against the White Sox since Sept. 3-5 2018 in Chicago.

Entering Saturday the Tigers had lost 18 of their past 20 games to the American League Central-leading White Sox. In their back-to-back wins over the weekend they put up 17 runs 21 hits and 10 walks combined.

""We have to stand up and defend ourselves against our division"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. ""These are teams that have had their way with us over the course of a few seasons but we can put pressure on any team. When we take the lead we feel really good about our guys (in the bullpen).""

MEET BRADY HOUSE: This Tigers' potential No. 1 pick knows 'what a bad day is'... and it's not baseball

MIDSEASON REPORT CARD: Coaching starting pitching star but low marks elsewhere

After starting pitcher Matt Manning was pulled in the third inning the Tigers picked up 5⅔ scoreless innings from the bullpen lasting until one out in the ninth inning from Tyler Alexander (2⅓ innings) Kyle Funkhouser (1⅔ innings) and Daniel Norris (final out in seventh inning).

Right-hander Joe Jimenez who is evolving into a high-leverage reliever again fired a scoreless eighth inning. He struck out two logged four swings and misses and reached 96.4 mph with his fastball.

Lefty Gregory Soto after the umpires forced him to change his glove pitched the ninth inning. Using his backup glove he allowed a three-run homer to Jose Abreu — cutting the Tigers' lead to 6-5 — with one out.

""It's a red glove which is legal"" Hinch said. ""As they inspected it it had darkened up in some areas I think just from usage. When you throw a ball and pound up against it it's going to darken up on the palm. It wasn't sticky. There was no issue with it. Rather than have any sort of concern whatsoever they removed the glove. There was no wrongdoing other than the umpiring crew decided they wanted as close to a brand new glove as they could get.""

After Soto got his second out he walked Leury Garcia to put the game-tying run on first base. Hinch then went to Jose Cisnero who finished the game with one pitch.

The offense helped out the relievers by chipping in two runs in the fifth inning thanks to a pair of two-out RBI hits from Jeimer Candelario and Eric Haase for a 6-2 lead. Candelario finished 3-for-4 while Baddoo Haase and Harold Castro tossed in two-hit performances.

Attacking Giolito early

The Tigers made White Sox starter Lucas Giolito work through two innings. He needed 47 of his 102 pitches to earn his first six outs. The first of six runs he allowed had an old-fashioned feel: Baddoo opened the first inning with an infield single stole second base (his 13th of the year) advanced to third base on a groundout and scored on Robbie Grossman's groundout to shortstop.

But the Tigers didn't need small ball to score three in the second inning. They simply piled on singles and doubles — along with Daz Cameron's seven-pitch walk to load the bases — for a 4-0 lead.

NOTEBOOK: Why Miguel Cabrera is back to 'DH only for the time being'

With the bases full Castro singled to center to score a run. Baddoo then cranked a two-strike changeup from Giolito to the right-field corner lost his helmet upon rounding first base and cruised into second for a two-RBI double.

It was Baddoo's 14th double this season and his helmet popping off his head is becoming a trademark of his speed aggressiveness on the bases and all-around athleticism.

""We're riding high right now"" Baddoo said. ""It's just how we've been playing lately. We talked about it early before the game just continue to bring pressure and try to win each series. That's what we've been doing lately and we're going to continue to play baseball the way we know how to play.""

Manning starts

Hinch kept Manning on a short leash in his fourth MLB start. That meant walking out to the mound with two outs in the third inning and calling on Alexander.

Manning had only thrown 60 pitches (38 strikes) and allowed two runs but Hinch wasn't going to squander the chance of winning a series against the White Sox. With runners on the corners Alexander ended the inning with two pitches.

""What I told Manning was don't let me taking him out in the third inning or some of the little soft hits characterize this as a negative start"" Hinch said. ""He showed progress. I thought his slider was really good. He mixed in the slower breaking ball today.

""I went to the bullpen because of the matchup that we had and I liked that the left side of our bullpen was pretty fresh. I wanted to go aggressively after this win to try to win the series against that team. We haven't beat them in some of the close games.""

Manning finished with two runs on seven hits and one walk in 2⅔ innings. He has a 7.94 ERA wiht the Tigers though that's elevated by his nine runs allowed over 3⅔ innings in his previous outing against Cleveland at Progressive Field.

INJURY UPDATE: Tigers' Spencer Turnbull reports 'no problems' after bullpen session

MIZE'S INNINGS: Tigers begin limiting Casey Mize's innings. Here's the plan moving forward

Between starts pitching coach Chris Fetter focused on helping Manning with his fastball command and a new slider. The Tigers have asked Manning to throw fewer four-seam fastballs and mix in his breaking balls (slider curveball) more often.

This time he made slight improvements.

Manning's mix over 60 pitches was 62% fastballs 17% sliders 12% curveballs and 10% changeups.

In the first inning Manning conceded back-to-back singles to Tim Anderson and Gavin Sheets but a 6-4-3 double play left a runner at third with two outs. The next batter Brian Goodwin flied out to left field.

Two more batters reached in the second — each with two outs — before Manning induced a ground out to third base. Once again he pitched out of a jam to keep the White Sox from scoring.

Four singles hurt Manning in the third though with Abreu (single) and Garcia (sacrifice fly) picking up one RBI each. Following Andrew Vaughn's two-out single Hinch pulled Manning from the game.

""It wasn't all Manning being ineffective"" Hinch said. ""In a normal start he's got to power through that. He had plenty of pitches left. I want him to take the positives out of it.""

All seven hits allowed by Manning on Sunday were singles.

Another big day for Haase

In the third inning Haase crushed a fastball from Giolito to the deepest part of the ballpark in right field. Right fielder Adam Eaton darted to the warning track and made a leaping catch against the wall.

Haase wasn't technically robbed of a home run but his flyout was measured at 395 feet. He was robbed of extra bases though and Eaton doubled up Candelario at first base. This came after Saturday's showcase in which Haase went 3-for-4 with two home runs — one traditional and one inside-the-park — and six RBIs.

The 28-year-old has 11 home runs in 37 games this season.

On Sunday Haase finished 2-for-4 with one RBI.

FROM YESTERDAY:Eric Haase's homer gives Tigers lead against White Sox in unlikely fashion

Game notes: The Tigers go for their first series win of the season vs. the White Sox. The South Siders had won nine of the teams' 11 meetings coming into this three-game set. Manning was shelled (nine hits and nine runs vs. Cleveland) in his last outing and gets a tough test on Independence Day: Chicago's offense ranks top 10 in OPS and runs but relies on walks and timely hits instead of the long ball. Giolito faces Detroit for the third time this season and 13th time in his career. He saw the Tigers in back-to-back games last month giving up four earned runs in seven innings and taking a loss June 5 and giving up two earned runs in six innings for a no decision (that the White Sox eventually won) on June 11. In 13 innings vs. the Tigers in 2021 he has struck out 18 walked one and given up five home runs.

But it’s far from the first time extreme weather has caused serious problems with the power grid in recent months. During the winter storm that hit Texas in February nearly 5 million people lost power. In June California suggested that residents charge their electric vehicles during off-peak hours to save energy. And for the first time ever after power outages hit several neighborhoods during this week’s heat wave New York City officials sent residents an emergency mobile alert urging them to conserve energy.

It’s abundantly clear that the power grid in the United States is not ready for the effects of climate change including the extreme weather events that come with it. After all climate change isn’t just increasing the demand for energy to keep people cool or warm amid heat waves and winter storms. It’s also damaging the grid itself. The country is now in a race against time to shift its energy supply toward renewable sources like wind and solar while also needing more and more electricity to do everything from powering more air conditioning to boosting the number of EVs on the road.

“I would probably give our power grid maybe a C minus” Kyri Baker an engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder told Recode. “It’s like this perfect storm of extreme temperatures more electricity consumption and aging infrastructure.”

Having a reliable power grid can be a matter of life and death. In the most severe power outages during the winter storm in Texas this past February 700 people are estimated to have died according to BuzzFeed. Hundreds of people died during this past week’s heat wave in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. Meanwhile the effects of heat waves have been disproportionately worse for historically marginalized brown Black and Indigenous communities. People who are elderly very young who have certain medication conditions or who work outdoors are also more likely to feel the impacts of extreme heat.

Climate change means that extreme weather events are becoming more intense and common which is worrisome not just because the power grid is aging. The grid is woefully unprepared for an imminent and disturbing future.

How the US power grid works

Last year about 40 percent of the country’s electricity generation came from natural gas. While the grid still relies on a good amount of coal-based power a growing share of power is coming from renewable sources like solar and wind power which will hopefully make the grid more sustainable. But while some of these sources are a lot worse for the environment than others they all contribute electricity to the grid a giant engineering system full of high- and low-voltage wires sensors poles and transformers that work together to transport electricity to your home.

Electricity travels across the grid moving from high-voltage lines that carry the electricity across long distances to low-voltage lines a process known as “stepping down.” The low-voltage lines distribute that electricity to buildings and then individual appliances and electronics. But there are hurdles. Right now the country is still facing problems with the congestion of transmission lines that have maxed out on the amount of electricity they can carry. In Vermont solar and wind energy have stalled because the grid is already too constrained.

“So it’s not like you can just set up a wire from point A to point B and everything will be fine” Sam Gomberg a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists explained. “You need to set up little steps along the way to guide that electricity in the direction that you want it to go so that it ultimately ends up at your home.”

The US power grid is actually made up of several regional grids or interconnections that are tied together and operate on a synchronized frequency of 60 hertz. While these systems are very large oversight of the grid is somewhat patchwork. Generating power for the grid are more than 10000 power plants in the country. But the grid itself including transmission and distribution systems is operated by a mix of state-owned and private entities including some public-private collaborations. Then local utility companies like Con Edison in New York City and PG&E in San Francisco ultimately deliver electricity to peoples’ homes.

“The unique thing about the power system versus any other type of infrastructure is that it’s almost instantaneous” Baker of UC Boulder told Recode. “So if I turn on a light in my house there is an instantaneous mismatch in supply and demand. And the power plants actually respond almost in real time to that increase in demand.”

At the same time that means not being hooked up with a broader system can cause problems. Texas for instance has opted to operate its own electric grid which is largely independent from other regional power systems. While this has given the state more autonomy some have argued that Texas could have avoided such devastating outages this past winter if the state’s grid had been able to draw from other power sources. Notably nearby Oklahoma was able to turn to other states to keep its power on during the same storm.

Why the heat makes things worse

Summer heat can interfere with the US power supply in many ways.

Hot weather can drive up energy demands often to power air conditioners which can overload the electric grid and cause brownouts — partial outages that reduce the overall power available. At the same time high temperatures can make power plants less effective limit the amount of energy power lines can carry and make failures more likely in transformers which help control the voltage throughout the power grid.

That’s why during the summer months you might receive an alert telling you to cut back on electricity usage like delaying vacuuming until the evening. If the problem gets bad enough utilities might even use rolling blackouts — when a utility company temporarily shuts down electrical power for different areas in order to avoid overloading the entire system — in order to protect the grid. Of course while officials might deem these steps necessary rolling blackouts can be inconvenient and even risky for residents who need power to stay cool during heat waves. This past week New York’s power company Con Edison distributed dry ice to some residents of Greenpoint Brooklyn who were left without air conditioning during a power outage.

The heat can cause problems for the electric grid beyond overcapacity. If the weather gets hot enough power lines start to sag — a result of the metal inside them expanding — and risk striking a tree and starting a fire. At the same time power plants are highly dependent on water which they need to cool down their systems. This means that as hot and dry weather drives up demand for air conditioning the increased need for energy is also driving up the power grid’s demand for water which is often in short supply during periods of drought. Cooling systems need electricity too adding even more demand for energy.

“We’re trying to project the weather two years from now or five years from now and climate change is making it more difficult” Anjan Bose an electrical engineering professor at Washington State University told Recode. “If you can’t project the weather you can’t project the load demand.”

Eventually individual energy users become aware of these problems. This summer California’s state power grid operator warned that people should prepare for temporary power outages. Last week Portland had to shut down streetcar service. And in areas where there’s a high wildfire risk utility companies might order rolling blackouts to lessen the risk of an overloaded grid causing additional fires.

What Biden wants to do to fix this

Fixing the power grid can’t be done in one fell swoop. Instead the grid will need to be updated by transitioning to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar adapting grid and energy storage infrastructure to adjust to these new types of power and changing our approach to energy consumption in general.

The system also needs to predict and respond to changes in energy demand. One part of the solution is smart grid technologies which use internet-connected sensors on various parts of the grid to collect a lot more detailed data about how well those parts are working. That real-time data can also help utility companies quickly resolve potential problems before they become widespread. The Biden administration supports deploying this tech which could be key to making power grids more resilient.

In April the White House also freed up $8 billion in order to boost the grid’s capacity to support renewable energy and committed to making it easier for new renewables-focused transmission lines to be approved. Joe Biden is now pushing to modernize the grid as part of his massive infrastructure plan. Through that plan the president is hoping that the government will be able to spend at least $73 billion on improvements including building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to expand renewable energy. This will be key to making renewables more feasible. As Vox’s Umair Irfan and Rebecca Leber explain:

Transmission lines can link areas that need energy with places where wind and solar power are cheap which can be separated by thousands of miles. This would help boost the business case for wind and solar power. The proposal calls for a new grid authority to facilitate clean energy transmission and an infrastructure financing authority to help come up with the money to pay for it.

But changes have to go beyond the federal government. Equipment needs to be updated on the regional and local level too. Whether Biden will succeed in addressing the complex challenges of updating the grid remains to be seen. Without government action private companies may be left with the job of fixing the grid and there’s no guarantee they’ll put the long-term protection of the US power supply ahead of their profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL3NxdWF0dGVycy10ZXJyb3JpemluZy1ueWMtYXJlYS1mbGVlLWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLW91dGVkLWJ5LXRoZS1wb3N0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Squatters terrorizing NYC neighborhood flee after being outed by The Post,"A group of alleged drug dealing squatters who terrorized a working-class Bronx neighborhood for months appear to have finally fled.

But residents of Bedford Park may not be totally free from trouble just yet.

The squatters were able to stay for nearly 10 months in part because of a historic backlog in the city Housing Courts.

The NYPD raided the Valentine Avenue home just two weeks after The Post highlighted how the squatters had become the scourge of the once quiet area with dope deals prostitution loud music and harassment of anyone who walked past their front porch.

Cops allegedly found synthetic cannabinoid crack residue and a round of ammunition at 3059 Valentine Ave. police told The Post.

Frank “The Tank” Castillo who according to court records had been squatting in the home since October and had been arrested on drug charges in April was arrested the day of the raid for harassment records show.

Castillo and his crew haven’t been seen since a source said.

“Besides the (Post) article we feel this was accomplished because residents in the neighborhood made calls to 311 & 911” one nearby building manager wrote in an email to tenants.

The squatters who were able to open a Con Edison account to prove their residency were able to stay for nearly 10 months in part because of a historic backlog in the city Housing Courts brought on by pandemic protections for those who cannot pay rent. A lawyer for the owner of the Valentine Avenue home said they’re working with the Bronx District Attorney’s office in a bid to keep the squatters away for good.

Cops allegedly found synthetic cannabinoid crack residue and a round of ammunition at 3059 Valentine Ave.

“We are hopeful that this new case will get us before a housing judge quicker than the squatting case we commenced previously since the illegal sale of narcotics and nuisance behavior proceedings are actually getting court dates at this point in the pandemic” said attorney Melissa Levin of the firm Horing Welikson Rosen & Digrugilliers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2NvcGEtYW1lcmljYS0yMDIxLWdpYW5sdWNhLWxhcGFkdWxhLWhpem8tZ29sLWFyYml0cm8tZGlvLWNvbW8tYXV0b2dvbC1jb25tZWJvbC1zZWxlY2Npb24tcGVydWFuYS03MTk4OdIBkwFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9hbXAvZGVwb3J0ZXMvMjAyMS8wNy8wMy9jb3BhLWFtZXJpY2EtMjAyMS1naWFubHVjYS1sYXBhZHVsYS1oaXpvLWdvbC1hcmJpdHJvLWRpby1jb21vLWF1dG9nb2wtY29ubWVib2wtc2VsZWNjaW9uLXBlcnVhbmEtNzE5ODk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gianluca Lapadula dejó de ser junto a Messi el goleador de la Copa América 2021 por fallo arbitral,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://elpopular.pe/deportes/2021/07/03/copa-america-2021-gianluca-lapadula-hizo-gol-arbitro-dio-como-autogol-conmebol-seleccion-peruana-71989 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2NvcGEtYW1lcmljYS0yMDIxLWdpYW5sdWNhLWxhcGFkdWxhLWhpem8tZ29sLWFyYml0cm8tZGlvLWNvbW8tYXV0b2dvbC1jb25tZWJvbC1zZWxlY2Npb24tcGVydWFuYS03MTk4OdIBkwFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9hbXAvZGVwb3J0ZXMvMjAyMS8wNy8wMy9jb3BhLWFtZXJpY2EtMjAyMS1naWFubHVjYS1sYXBhZHVsYS1oaXpvLWdvbC1hcmJpdHJvLWRpby1jb21vLWF1dG9nb2wtY29ubWVib2wtc2VsZWNjaW9uLXBlcnVhbmEtNzE5ODk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Kevin G. Jackson who has been serving as interim chief commercial officer since January will continue in this role on a permanent basis. Mr. Jackson also will remain president of the company’s snacking and beverages division.

Prior to joining TreeHouse in February 2020 Mr. Jackson was with the J.M. Smucker Co. where he held numerous roles of increasing responsibility across sales and marketing during his 17-year tenure including senior vice president of the US retail sales and North American food-away-from-home division. Earlier he was a senior brand manager at Brach's Confections and at Constellation Brands.

He received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado and a master’s degree in business administration from the New York Institute of Technology.

Meanwhile Sean Lewis has been promoted to senior vice president and chief customer officer reporting to Mr. Jackson. He also will join the executive leadership team.

Mr. Lewis joined TreeHouse in August 2019 as vice president of sales national and regional West. Prior to joining TreeHouse he spent nearly 20 years with Kraft Heinz and Nabisco where he held several regional district category and business lead roles with increasing responsibility including the development pursuit and leadership of customer relationships to achieve revenue share and distribution growth and optimal shelving. Earlier he was customer vice president for the West area at Mizkan America.

He received a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix.

“Over the last few years we purposefully structured our commercial organization to become more customer centric and to make it simpler for customers to do business with us” said Steven T. Oakland president and chief executive officer of TreeHouse Foods. “These appointments represent an important evolution of this commitment and I am confident that Kevin and Sean are well suited to build on our past progress and drive our commercial organization forward as we execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders.

“Kevin has been a valuable asset to TreeHouse and his contributions will be important to further developing our commercial vision aligning the organization and driving our revenue objectives; while Sean will serve as a key voice with our customers solidifying top-to-top relationships and refining and optimizing our sales processes in support of Kevin's efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZm9vZGluc3RpdHV0ZS5jb20vZm9jdXMvZm9vZC1pbmR1c3RyeS1maW5hbmNpYWxzLWdlbnotdW5lbXBsb3ltZW50LW1jY29ybWljay1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food Industry Financials: GenZ Unemployment McCormick and more,"Here are trending economic and food industry data points as well as major economic and company earnings releases for the coming week: Gen Z Unemployment Robinhood and new generation of investors earnings from McCormick (MKC) General Mills (GIS) Constellation Brands (STZ) and more.

Why is Gen Z staying on the sidelines during the best job market in decades?

U.S. businesses hired 692K workers in June and 3.1 million YTD. Yet there are still > 9 million unfilled job openings. “Many employers still can’t find enough workers” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said in a Bloomberg interview “and they don’t know why.” Among the different demographic groups Gen Z stands out as the most unwilling group to jump back into the job market. Let’s take a closer look.

Higher Gen Z jobless rate

Gen Z has nearly 2x the unemployment rate of older generations. During the pandemic outbreak the overall unemployment rate was ~11.5% while Gen Z was >23%. As of June the overall unemployment rate dropped to <6.0% while Gen Z remains > 10%.

There are many explanations for why young people struggle to find and retain employment. According to Forbes the top reason cited by employers is work ethic. Today’s younger workers may not be as emotionally prepared for the workplace as previous generations.

Alternative sources of income

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius cites unusually generous unemployment benefits which in some cases exceeded minimum wage as an obstacle for hiring managers. Even as the number of new jobless claims dropped to a pandemic low of 364K in the week ending June 26th the number of beneficiaries that continued to receive unemployment benefits is double pre-pandemic figures.

At the same time more and more young people became interesting in investing. A new GOBankingRates survey found that 71.96% of Gen Z investors started investing within the last six months. Unlike older generations who opt for long-term investments many Gen Z investors are aiming for short-term profits using risky strategies such as day-trading option-trading cryptocurrencies meme stocks and SPACs. About 40% of Gen Zers check their investments every day.

Robinhood has been instrumental in attracting Gen Z investors. With a free mobile app free stock for referrals no paperwork and seamless execution Robinhood removed many barriers to entry for first time investors. Over the past five years Robinhood users increased eight-fold. The average age for Robinhood users is 31 while >30% are under 24.

Power approval comfort and control

According to Tom Brooks Head of Marketing at Guidant Global Gen Z workers are confident in their abilities and have the drive to succeed but they often suffer from career anxiety. They are willing work hard and in return expect a lot particularly when it comes to flexible work schedules company culture and technology. They value freedom and flexibility at work and look to managers for direction and structure but not necessarily approval. They also want to contribute to corporate culture and technology matters. Although Gen Z is concerned about financial security it is purpose energy and culture that motivate them. In short Gen Z’s attitude towards work is quite different from previous generations.

With rapid technology advancements transforming our world in recent years perhaps it should come as no surprise that younger workers would approach work with a different mindset.

It's 44 times the size of the sun and 400 times as luminous. It's also the namesake of AMD's next Instinct Accelerator.

Aldebaran the computer part has appeared a few times in Linux patch notes. Its two-die design was half-implied in February and confirmed last month: ""on Aldebaran only primary die fetches valid power data. Show power/energy values as 0 on secondary die"" one note reads.

It's the first AMD Accelerator/GPU to leverage an MCM (multi-chip module) design a technique that's been plastered on patents for years but has only just begun to materialize. Using multiple chips/dies connected closely allows for more scalability than traditional monolithic designs but also reduces the per-compute unit performance of a card particularly in poorly parallelized workloads.

Nvidia is expected to challenge Aldebaran with their own MCM designs based on the Hopper architecture next year. Intel meanwhile is on the verge of releasing the Ponte Vecchio accelerator based on the Xe HPC architecture and an early MCM implementation.

Like Ponte Vecchio Aldebaran leverages MCM to expand memory capacity patch notes imply. A note from last week describes Aldebaran as having two dies four UMCs per die and eight channels connected to 2 GB of HBM per UMC. Or 128 GB in total.

The patch notes also mention support for a ""new HBM2 memory type"" presumably HBM2e. If AMD is using SK Hynix's new HBM2e memory modules with 3.6 Gbps of bandwidth and a 4096-bit bus on each die then Aldebaran could have 3.6 TB/s of memory bandwidth.

For comparison Aldebaran's predecessor the Instinct MI100 (formerly codenamed Arcturus another star) has 32 GB of HBM2 and 1.2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. Nvidia's A100 accelerator can be configured with up to 80 GB of 3.2 Gbps HBM2e memory for 2 TB/s of bandwidth.

AMD CEO Dr Lisa Su has already said that the CDNA2 architecture meaning Aldebaran is slated for release later this year. Presumably it will release as the MI200 Accelerator.

""This year as I said we're putting together our next generation CDNA architecture. This is actually a key component that enabled us to win the largest supercomputer bids in the US"" Su said at a conference in May. ""... And we will be launching the next generation of that architecture actually later this year. We're very excited about it. I think it's progressed extremely well.""

Ruth Ann Watts

Corning - Ruth Ann Watts 82 of Corning (Portersville) Ohio went to be with her Lord and Savior at 11:40 AM Sunday July 4 2021 at Genesis Perry County Emergency Room in Somerset following a sudden cardiac event.

She was born September 28 1938 in San Toy Ohio the daughter of the late Bernard Greuey and Ruby (nee: Kronenbitter) Greuey Omen.

Ruth Ann was a homemaker who enjoyed cooking and baking for her family. She enjoyed reading and Facebook. She was a devoted and loving wife mother and grandmother as she followed her grandkids activities everywhere for school sports and whatever else they were involved. She was a member of Oakfield Baptist Church but had most recently been attending New Beginnings Fellowship Church in Portersville.

Left behind to mourn her passing is her beloved husband of 63 years Robert Watts whom she married on November 30 1957; her children Lou Ann and Michael Holcomb and James Robert and Tara Watts; her siblings Don (Ann) Greuey Linda Swinehart and Sandy (Jim) Henery; her grandchildren Amy (Justin) Frame Matthew (Amanda) Holcomb Dillon Watts Hannah Watts Dustin Watts and Devin Watts and her great-grandchildren Gracelyn Frame Paige Frame Lilah Frame Scarlett Frame and Hadley Holcomb.

In addition to her parents Ruth Ann was preceded in death by her daughter Kathy Sue Watts who died October 6 1979; her step-father Raymond Omen; her brother Dick (Wanda) Greuey; her sister Marlene Allen; her nephew Butch Greuey and her brother-in-law Dwayne Swinehart.

Family and friends will be received 4-8 PM Friday July 9 2021 at Goebel Funeral Home 36 N. Buckeye St. Crooksville.

Syngenta Group the agriculture giant owned by China National Chemical Corp has applied for an IPO in the STAR Market in Shanghai where it aims to raise 65 billion yuan ($10 billion). This would be the largest IPO in China's A-share markets since that of Agricultural Bank of China in 2010.Industry insiders said that the IPO could help boost the company's business and China's influence in the global agricultural sector that has long been dominated by several Western giants and create healthier competition in the industry.The IPO which comes as China has been stepping up development in seeds and other critical areas to cut foreign reliance may make the company a leading global player experts noted.Syngenta ranked third in the global seed industry in 2020 with a market share of 7 percent behind Germany's Bayer with 20 percent and the US' Corteva with 17 percent according to Kynetec a global animal health and agriculture researcher news site chinastarmarket.cn reported on Saturday.""The listing of Syngenta may have a great impact on the global agricultural industry as the company will have more capital to focus on advanced agricultural technology research and overseas acquisitions among other issues"" Ma Wenfeng a senior analyst at the Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultancy told the Global Times on Sunday.The estimated market value of Syngenta is over 300 billion yuan the largest on the STAR market. The IPO application was accepted by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday media reports said.Jiao Shanwei editor-in-chief of cngrain.com a website specializing in grain news told the Global Times on Sunday the listing will channel capital into the nation's agricultural priorities. It will speed up research and development especially in some bottleneck sectors such as seed cultivation Jiao said.Domestic seeds occupy a dominant position for some grain crops but in the field of feed such as corn the seeds have been monopolized by foreign companies for a long time analysts said.In June 2017 ChemChina completed the acquisition of Syngenta the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company to date.Industry insiders said that the listing will strengthen Syngenta's competitive position in the sector and may break the long-term Western monopoly.""Its listing will enhance China's voice in the world and prevent the global industry from being monopolized by a few enterprises from Western countries"" said Jiao.Syngenta did not respond to a Global Times' request for comment as of press time on Sunday.The company is part of a sunrise industry in China's strategic development. For example the market for vegetable seeds is expected to double by 2030 media reports said.With the development and commercialization of breeding technology corn and other feed crop seeds also have huge commercial value in China experts said.Syngenta ranks first in China's plant protection industry and second in the seed industry.The IPO proceeds will help China introduce advanced seed technologies to improve domestic grain production. Soybean and corn yields in South America are about two times those of China while the yield of wheat in Europe is about one and a half times that of China said Ma.The global precision agriculture market is expected to exceed $4 billion by 2025 and the company has proven advantages in the field. The revenue generated by Modern Agriculture Platform Syngenta's digital agricultural services platform in China tripled to $700 million in 2020 and further rapid growth is expected the China Securities Journal reported on Friday.Industry insiders said that China's capital market will welcome a truly world-class agricultural technology giant.Syngenta ranked No.1 in the global plant protection industry No.3 in the seed industry and No.1 in the digital service area in 2019 with a leading position in the field of digital agriculture public data showed.ChemChina's acquisition of Syngenta in 2017 was controversial because of its high debt sluggish global market growth and uncertain prospects for business integration.However within just four years Syngenta's operating income was first in the world for two consecutive years.Syngenta has significantly reduced its operating risks through debt optimization especially after the completion of debt restructuring in 2020. Its asset-liability ratio fell to 40.51 percent lower than the average level of comparable listed companies in stark contrast with 57.2 percent at the end of 2019 and 56.3 percent in late 2018 according to the company's prospectus.In the prospectus Syngenta said that its commitment is not only to the transformation and upgrading of global and Chinese agriculture but also the integration of the world's leading scientific research concepts technologies and resources with the needs of hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers and agriculture and rural development.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The one-story building located at 1020 El Centro St. was built in 1920. It was 100% leased at the time of the sale according to CoStar Group Inc. and has roughly 16000 square feet of space on 2 acres.

Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage’s Joe Kaplan and Bill Ukropina represented the buyer in the transaction.

“The purchase of this 2-acre parcel was a beneficial transaction for everyone involved and the residents of South Pasadena will be well represented by the buyer who plans a mixed-use development on the site” Ukropina said in a statement.

Gangi Development’s Frank Gangi will develop the property. He was also behind the Mission Meridian project in South Pasadena in 2006.

In January South Pasadena Unified School District purchased a nearby building at 1100 El Centro St. to house its offices. The district bought the building from a trust for $10.8 million.

Built in 1980 and renovated in 2001 the building has nearly 21000 square feet.

“Securing this new space for our district employees is a thrilling way to begin 2021” School Board President Ruby Kalra said in a statement at the time. “Years of hard work have gone into our overall facilities planning and finding an office environment that so efficiently meets our needs for safety and location while remaining within our fiscal means is a huge accomplishment.”

The school board borrowed $11 million for the purchase. The loan is for 20 years with a 2.48% interest rate.

The tenants of the property vacated in March. The school district plans to make improvements to the building and move in by July.

The South Pasadena market has had a few other notable sales this year including a 16-unit apartment building at 150-154 Monterey Road sold for $6.1 million in June.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvaG90ZWxzLS8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvaG93LWhvdGVscy1hcmUtYWRhcHRpbmctdG8tdGhlLXVucHJlZGljdGFibGUtbmF0dXJlLW9mLXBvc3QtcGFuZGVtaWMtZGVtYW5kL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg0MTAwMzg1LmNtc9IBqwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvaG90ZWxzLS8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvaG93LWhvdGVscy1hcmUtYWRhcHRpbmctdG8tdGhlLXVucHJlZGljdGFibGUtbmF0dXJlLW9mLXBvc3QtcGFuZGVtaWMtZGVtYW5kL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NDEwMDM4NS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How hotels are adapting to the unpredictable nature of post-pandemic demand,"

At the offices of French hospitality major Accor India  the numbers-focused cohort of revenue managers have been asked to reorient their analytical thinking to take into account travel sentiment lockdown status and fluctuating holiday demand across locations to predict room prices.A deputy housekeeping manager at a top-end boutique hotel in Delhi has taken on tasks like attending requests for bubble baths in rooms servicing in-room dining and even taking guests on walking tours.The iconic Imperial Hotel in Delhi which temporarily reduced staff as part of cost-saving measures has introduced its employees to multi-skilling in which employees were rotated across a host of different teams so that they could pick up the skills needed to work in each department. Says senior executive vice-president Vijay Wanchoo “We also skilled them well so that the quality of the service isn’t compromised.”For hotels of all sizes and stripes the unpredictable fluctuating nature of post-pandemic demand has led to a rethink in staffing strategy product offerings and cost management. Call it the yo-yo model of hotel management: haphazard peaks of very high demand which don’t correspond to traditional popular travel times interspersed with periods when leisure travel dries up completely due to staggered lockdowns.Add manpower challenges and low cash flows to the mix and hotels have had to reinvent the wheel.According to STR. a division of CoStar Group that provides market data on hotel industry the resurgence of Covid-19 cases and lockdowns in India in April and May this year resulted in a steep decline in hotel occupancy levels. Preliminary data for May indicates that all-India occupancy levels were shy of 20% and revenue per available room hit rock bottom at under Rs 650.Dilip Puri founder Indian School of Hospitality says about 50% of jobs in the hospitality sector (which accounts for about 10% employment in India) have been lost. This has hit blue-collar jobs as well as at leadership levels. “Over the past year we have found that the situation changes very quickly requiring our teams to be agile and flexible” says Anand Singh Shekhawat regional director for Aman Resorts in India. Since most travellers are booking holidays at the last minute it requires teams across departments to work reactively.Like other companies Aman has established flexible booking policies to enable guests to postpone or cancel their trips something it did not offer before. But the hotel says it still has not compromised on its staff-per-room ratio keeping it as high as 5:1 and 8:1 depending on the hotel.For Ananda in the Himalayas and others after a period of steady growth till mid-April 2021 demand abruptly petered out. While Ananda remained open for a few long-stay guests costs mounted. “Having 100% staff has significant cost implications when travel is severely hampered. Within the hotel all departments especially engineering focussed on optimisation techniques” says Mahesh Natarajan chief operating officer IHHR Hospitality Ananda. So it reallocated customers to some wings and floors to save on energy.At Niraamaya Retreats across India small changes have had a big impact — like keeping 50 bulbs on in public areas instead of 100 to save on energy offering limited menus and training 90% of its people to do 100% of the work.Many hotel businesses have tried never-before-tested strategies like furloughing staff for a three- or four-month period on a rotational basis so that every staffer gets an opportunity to earn despite the lack of operations. A hotel general manager tells ET that they may never go back to previous staffing levels since multi-skilling employees has emerged as a big winner.At Lemon Tree Hotels  clustering of rooms special service zones and customised service have helped maintain service standards with minimal staff. In some cities the chain is down to just 0.5 or 0.6 employees per room almost half of what has been the norm in midscale hotels pre-pandemic. Staff schedules have been worked around in such a way that key team members are permanently living on hotel premises for smoother operations and minimal risk of infection says deputy MD Rattan Keswani.Puri says that in the coming years hiring preferences will lean towards candidates who can understand and react to evolving guest behaviour. “Employers now have more efficient models where they have cut the flab from the system by reducing their fixed costs (of electricity and manpower) and are now looking for more and better skilled people” he explains.Shruti Shibulal chief executive officer Tamara Leisure Experiences says they have learnt that their operations must now be geared towards rushed service and have therefore invested heavily in automating processes and training employees in the less busy lockdown periods.“Our resorts have had to shut earlier due to environmental disasters and through those experiences we have learned the importance of developing nimble teams that are continually trained to handle challenges. This gives us a reliable system and the confidence to shut down as needed and reopen very quickly” she says.At Accor India outsourced contractual staff is being used to meet sudden surges in demand. Meanwhile the full-time staff is also multi-tasking says Kerrie Hannaford vice president—commercial Accor India & South Asia. “Everyone is trying to pitch in wherever support is needed. Some hotels have also been sharing resources to manage the high occupancy.” Manu Rishi Guptha CEO Niraamaya points to an unexpected spinoff: guests are now less demanding and prefer a “less intrusive” experience (read: will settle for less pampering). For the beleaguered industry that’s a silver lining they are happy to live with.",,,,,,,,,

Masako Kenley was last seen in the area of 7134 S. 700 E. in Midvale on Friday afternoon. Her car was found in the Costco parking lot at 11100 South Auto Mall Dr. in Sandy on Saturday.

She is an Asian female who is five feet two inches tall 110 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. Kenley was last seen wearing a blue floral shirt dark blue jeans and dark blue sandals.

About 100 people gathered in Sandy today to help search for Kenley. Her friends and family say she was headed to Layton to meet with some coworkers Friday afternoon but she never showed up.

Sandy Police/South Salt Lake Police

""She's a great person. We're really worried about her"" said Tracie Benites Kenley's longtime neighbor and friend. ""We're concerned about her disappearance and the circumstances surrounding it.""

When Kenley's family couldn't get in touch with her they became worried and called police. The search for her began just before midnight on Friday.

""When we all found out about it we started searching and we started looking along the freeway corridor from here to Layton just trying to check every off ramp because we figured maybe she had a medical emergency so we checked hospitals"" said Adam Clayton another friend and neighbor of Kenley. ""We just tried searching where we think she might have gone.""

Surveillance footage from a nearby business captured her van pulling into the parking lot of the Sandy Costco just after 8 on Saturday morning.

Close to 100 people showed up to help search the surrounding areas for Kenley. They say the fact she has not been answering her phone or been in touch since Friday is very out of character for her.

""It's mixed emotion you know. Seeing the line of people this morning was the best thing and the worst thing that you could ever think to see"" Benites said. ""We love her. We just want to bring her home.""

If you have any information about Kenley's whereabouts or information on her disappearance call the sandy Police Department at 801-799-3000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9mb3VydGgtanVseS1vcGVuaW5nLWNsb3NpbmctdGltZXMtdGFyZ2V0LXdhbG1hcnQtY29zdGNvLTE2MDYzNTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Stores Open on July 5th?

The Tower of London a castle on the bank of the River Thames in London is one of the city's most famous historic sites. It's a tourist attraction but it also has residents — including 36-year-old comedian and TikTok sensation Tom Houghton.

Since May 2020 Houghton has shared TikTok videos under his account @HonourableTom documenting his family's home at the Tower of London. Houghton has 142000 followers on the app at the time of writing.

Speaking with Insider Houghton said that he and his family moved into their Tower of London residence in 2016 when his father General Sir Nicholas Houghton the former head of the British military was appointed to the constable of the Tower of London.

Historically constables were in charge of the operation upkeep and security of Tower but today the role is largely ceremonial according to the Tower of London's website Historic Royal Palaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Pan Am). The proposed merger is opposed by Amtrak but backed by scores of local political leaders across New Hampshire and New England like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Gov. Chris Sununu (R-N.H.)

“The proposed transaction is an ‘end-to-end’ acquisition that will integrate the New England rail network owned by Pan Am into CSX’s national rail network creating seamless single-line service” James M. Foote president and chief executive officer of CSX said in a statement. “This will provide substantial benefits to shippers with low-cost environmentally-friendly rail service with truck-like reliability.”

The CSX-Pan Am deal would have a significant impact in northern New England bringing Class I rail service to shipping centers like Portland Maine and Portsmouth N.H. and making them more competitive.

“This transaction would be beneficial to New Hampshire because it would provide a continuous single-line rail service and provide additional resources to market the line with the potential to bring additional freight service to New England markets” Sununu said in a letter of support. “The ability to create more opportunity for freight service in New Hampshire could possibly take additional trucks off the road which would be beneficial for both the economy and the environment.”

And while Washington debates the fate of an infrastructure spending deal backed by New Hampshire’s Sens. Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen supporters of the merger see private infrastructure investment for the region’s local rail network coming right away.

CSX which spent nearly $1.4 billion in private dollars in 2020 to update its infrastructure has indicated that as part of their transaction they would make a five-year commitment to improving the Pan Am infrastructure. The company cited their plans to upgrade many of the Pan Am’s 10-mph mainline track miles to 25-mph standards as a tangible example of this investment that would benefit customers shippers and even passenger rail in the region.

Based in North Billerica Mass. Pan Am owns and operates about 1200 miles of rail and also owns a partial interest in the more than 600-mile Pan Am Southern system.

Pan Am’s CEO David Fink said on Friday that “Pan Am remains excited about this merger with CSX a North American leader in rail-based freight transportation.” He continued “We have continued to receive support from our customers about the transaction as they know that CSX’s investment in the region will benefit not only New England shippers but also those who will have new access to their goods and products through the direct connection into CSX’s national rail network.”

CSX already operates a network spanning 23 states. They say the merger would expand rail service in the Northeast and provide much-needed benefits to the region making the rail network generally more efficient and safer for operations communities and passenger rail.

“CSX’s operating model will benefit passenger and commuter carriers in New England as well as shippers as the company commits to maintaining or improving existing passenger service that operates on Pan Am” the company said in a statement. “CSX has a long-standing history of working cooperatively with Amtrak and other passenger rail partners as evidenced by the significant improvement in contractual on-time performance with Amtrak since CSX has implemented its new operating model.”

Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn has expressed concerns over the impact of the Pan Am-CXC merger on Amtrak’s service in the region.

“As currently proposed the acquisition of Pan Am by CSX represents a significant threat to the American traveling public which relies on Amtrak and our state partners to deliver frequent reliable and sustainable intercity passenger rail service” Flynn said last month. The “Amtrak Connects US” proposal released in March aims to provide new rail service to over 160 more communities and 20 million more passengers annually by 2035.

However on Thursday the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority (NNEPRA)’s executive director Patricia Quinn which has oversight of Amtrak’s service in much of the northeast including the Downeaster service from Boston to Maine seemed to counter Amtrak’s concerns telling Mainebiz in an interview that they support the merger stating “We think this is a good deal for the state for both passenger and freight service.”

Similarly the Maine Department of Transportation also expressed optimism about the revised application and what it could mean for the region. Nate Moulton director of freight and passenger services for the Maine Department of Transportation told Mainebiz that the state remains: “… supportive of the transaction. We are still confident it will happen and we think it’s good for Maine.”

The support for the merger extends beyond New Hampshire and Maine. In neighboring Massachusetts the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce added their support in a letter to federal regulators overseeing the merger: “Single-line CSX service offers best-in-class service with new standards of service performance with higher velocity faster equipment turns and greater consistency. CSX will also enhance competition through lower costs better service and improved access to the rail network in the eastern United States.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

July 3 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

We’ve filled you in on why so many truck pullers prefer the Mud Grappler over other tread patterns in the past but that doesn’t mean the trend has cooled off any. In fact at this year’s Ultimate Callout Challenge several competitors entrusted Nitto’s extreme terrain mud tire when it was time to hit the dirt. In a competition like the U.C.C. sled pull—where cut tires are permitted—finding trucks on Mud Grapplers is a pretty big deal. And while the Mud Grappler wasn’t able to move the iron sled the furthest at U.C.C. 2021 they were mounted under the Second and Fourth Place finishers—both of which are highlighted below.

But first we’ll take a look at a full-blown puller—a beautiful square body ‘76 GMC we found sitting in the DPI Expo. It’s big it’s Duramax-powered it’s on Mud Grapplers and it was built to do one thing and do it very well. And if you find yourself in northern Illinois this summer you might even be able to catch it in the act!

Legally Altered Mudder-Equipped

You can find Jason Wehrli’s ’76 GMC tearing up the Illini State Pullers’ circuit within the 6300-pound Altered Stock Truck class. It’s a fairly unique category in truck pulling whereby diesel and gas-powered trucks are allowed to go head-to-head so long as a specific set of rules is adhered to. As for tires only DOT-approved will do and the maximum size is 35-inches in diameter. Jason’s tire of choice? The Nitto Mud Grappler of course. He campaigns the 35x14.50 version that fits his 15-inch Keizer aluminum wheels.

The Big-Block Eater

The Illini State Pullers rulebook states that diesel engines competing in the 6300-pound Altered Stock Truck category must be 450 cubic inches or less—which makes the 6.6L-based Duramax an ideal candidate to run. It’s a diesel but not super heavy and can be made to push serious horsepower which is needed against gas engines that are allowed a larger displacement limit (480 ci). As the owner of Wehrli Custom Fabrication a lot of Jason’s own craftsmanship and manufacturing capabilities made it into the engine build. Just check out the individual runner intakes up top and the billet front cover which can accommodate as many as three reverse rotation CP3 pumps.

Smooth Bore Turbo: Big Flow Small Package

Class rules also dictate that diesel engines in 6300-pound Altered Stock are forced to breathe through a smooth bore turbocharger with an inlet measuring 2.6-inches (or 66mm). The term “smooth bore” means that no MAP groove is allowed—and that translates into a turbo that is fairly restrictive. But thanks to turbo technology constantly evolving in the diesel world this little 66mm snail probably moves a lot more air than you think.

A High-Quality Hook From Quality Diesel Performance

Nothing says you’re having fun quite like a 76-year-old man behind the wheel of a pulling truck. Sure the Quality Diesel Performance team competed on the drag strip and on the chassis dyno at U.C.C. but they are most at home in the dirt hooked to the iron sleigh. Before competitor Brian Shew threw the keys to his elder Jon Shew he and his team bolted dual rear wheels and six Mud Grapplers onto the common-rail Dodge. With Jon behind the wheel the truck hooked smooth and dug its way to a 314.30-foot Second Place finish.

NT420S On The Dyno Mud Grapplers In The Dirt

Right on the heels of Third Place sled pull finisher Trevor Peterson was Justin Andres’ Mud Grappler-equipped Dodge. Just 24 hours prior he used a pair of Nitto NT420S all seasons to lay down 2220 hp and 3404 lb-ft of torque on the dyno. While the dyno tune-up (and a slew of other things) was changed considerably before his date in the dirt Justin’s Dodge had just enough power—and especially traction—to carry the sled 306 feet and change.

A Drag Racer Goes Pulling

It was clear from Day 1 at U.C.C. when he ran a 5.56-second eighth-mile right off the trailer that Kenny Bruner was definitely a drag racer but the verdict was still out as to whether or not he’d done much sled pulling. Either way Kenny had a good idea which tires would yield the best performance in the dirt. He and his bright orange third-gen Cummins arrived in the pulling pits riding on six Mud Grapplers then proceeded to yank the sled 280.58 feet. Incredibly Kenny lost the truck’s transfer case on the drag strip on the first day of U.C.C. (a rare failure in the diesel world). If it weren’t for Fleece Performance Engineering’s Evan Rusk Kenny and his team would’ve been dead in the water and looking at a very long 40-hour drive back to NorCal.

Behind The Scenes

Under the GTS Fiberglass front clip Kenny Bruner’s common-rail Cummins sports a beautifully-executed set of compound turbos. The compounds are big and Kenny fabricated the system himself—and just look at that wastegate piping! All the air is matched by a pair of 12mm stroker CP3 high-pressure fuel pumps and Super Mental injectors from Dynomite Diesel Products. Sprinkle in a healthy dose of nitrous and it’s easy to see why he made the Top 10 or better in each test of strength U.C.C. threw at him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGhpdHYuY29tL2FyY2hpdmUvbm90aWNlLXRoZS10aXBzLW9mLXRyZWUtYnJhbmNoZXMtZGVhZC1oZXJlcy13aHkvYXJ0aWNsZV8wNTQ3NjE3YS05ZTg5LTU1YzctOTM4OS1kNjA1YmUzNjM3NWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Notice the tips of tree branches dead?

Rugby league fans witnessed possibly the most bizarre refereeing in recent memory in the opening 10 minutes of the Broncos’ clash with the Sharks on Sunday.

In just three minutes referee Ben Cummins missed a blatant professional foul and missed a clear as day forward pass that led to a try. Then just when things couldn’t get any worse the bunker — which can’t rule on forward passes — came up with an odd call to ensure that try was taken off the Sharks.

In the eighth minute Broncos half Tyson Gamble broke through and passed onto fullback Tesi Niu who put in a grubber for Kotoni Staggs... only Staggs was pulled down by Ronaldo Mulitalo before he could even go after the ball.

Staggs sat the ground with his arms in the air looking up at Cummins waiting and expecting a call — but there was nothing.

“Staggs has been thrown down by Mulitalo... hello sin-bin you’ll have a friend in a moment” Fox League commentator Andrew Voss said.

Steve Roach agreed saying “that’s a sin-bin.”

However instead of calling Mulitalo over Cummins asked the Sharks where they wanted their play the ball.

“Well hang on a second there’s no action at all” Voss said.

“There’s got to be. What’s the touchy doing?” Roach added.

Not long after that eyebrow-raising moment Sharks winger Sione Katoa scooped up a loose ball before throwing a forward pass to Jesse Ramien who scored.

“There’s a forward ball thrown from Katoa” Voss said.

“That’s a mile forward” Roach added.

Broncos players were well-aware of how forward the pass was and didn’t bother chasing Ramien.

But then... Cummins awarded the try.

“Oh hang on a second... they haven’t got it. Surely. My first impression was three metres forward” Voss said.

Roach agreed.

“I’m with you I don’t want to have a go at the touchies but what else do they do? They’ve got to be able to be on the spot to call that. That’s a shocking call it’s two metres forward. It’s terrible... poor old Broncos.”

Sideline reporter and Broncos legend Corey Parker was happy to call it as he saw it.

“It was definitely forward there was no two ways about it... the touch judge was right there in line to make that call” he said.

Then things took an unexpected turn.

Cummins decided to send the try up to the bunker... to check a knock-on — because as we know the bunker can’t rule on a forward pass.

The moment in question was a little bumble of the ball by Katoa while passing to Ramien.

“After juggling the ball it has gone forward across the ground” the bunker official said.

Justice was served and the try was taken off the Sharks.

“The rugby league gods have smiled down on Suncorp Stadium” Voss said.

“I don’t mind that as long as we get to the right decision” Roach added.

Although it all turned out fair Voss couldn’t wrap his head around what had just happened.

“I live and breathe the game I’m trying to think of an instance where that’s happened” he said.

“He had complete control of the ball he was running with the ball and then he’s gone to pass it and in the act of juggling it’s gone forward and they’ve missed it.

“I think that’s the great smother of rugby league.”

Fox League analyst Cooper Cronk said the officials ultimately got it right — but the lead-up was “an absolute circus” in what was ""the best cover-up” he’s seen.

“It was an absolute circus because that was a forward pass every day of the week and twice on Sunday”

“It’s the best cover-up I’ve seen in a long long time.

“The letter of the law is once you loose control of the ball rolling out and propel it on it’s called a juggle basically a forward pass. You need to hold onto possession regain re-grip to make a pass.

“The bunker and referees have actually got it right but the bunker interfered to make sure they got it right.”

Fans and pundits found the whole mess confusing.

Five patients in the San Francisco area sued the company's pharmacy benefits manager CVS Caremark in 2018 after a change in how patients could receive specialty drugs.

Previously patients coukld pick up their prescription at any local drugstore. Under the new policy patients had to either go to a CVS or receive their prescriptions by mail.

The lawsuit said that patients risked losing their privacy when pharmacy staff shouted their names and medications in the presence of other customers at a CVS the Chronicle reported.

The plaintiffs considered mail order risky because their delivery would be exposed to the elements and to theft.

In a court filing CVS said ”If pharmacies and employers cannot use “common cost-containment strategies then either the cost of the pharmacy plan will increase overall or benefits must be reduced for other patients with different medical needs.”

At first U.S. District Judge Edward Chen sided with CVS but then the U.S. Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit overturned Chen's ruling prompting CVS's appeal to the high court which is scheduled to hear the case in its term that begins in October. The Circuit Court's ruling is on hold pending action by the Supreme Court.

Four other federal appeals courts have considered the same issue the Chronicle reported and three have reached the same conclusion as the Ninth Circuit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9uaWNrLWNhbm5vbnMtN3RoLWNoaWxkLWFycml2ZXMtMTUwMDAwNTI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nick Cannon's 7th Child Arrives According to Alyssa Scott: 'I Will Love You for Eternity',"Alyssa Scott Instagram Nick Cannon Alyssa Scott

Fox – who first found mainstream fame in 2007’s Transformers – has previously spoken out against the pervading misogyny that impacted her career.

“I think there has been a pervasive perception of me as a shallow succubus if that makes any sense for at least the first decade of my career” she told The Washington Post.

“And then that started to change more recently as people revisited my interviews listened to me speak and started to see me in a different way.”

Because of her physical appearance Fox said: “I was never really established as having been talented.”

The 35-year-old added that she noticed “people were surprised” to find she was funny when she starred in the hit comedy series New Girl as Reagan.

“More than being overlooked for my ability to handle comedy sometimes I’ve always been surprised by how easy it was for people to overlook that I’m relatively intelligent” she said.

“I was like how does that get so lost when there’s ridiculous amounts of material that can educate you otherwise?”

The This if 40 star reflected on her early career stating: “I was so lost and trying to understand like how am I supposed to feel value or find purpose in this horrendous patriarchal misogynistic hell that was Hollywood at the time.

“Because I had already been speaking out against it and everyone including other women received me in a very negative way for doing it.”

Elsewhere in the interview Fox said that she would like to see her 2009 horror film Jennifer’s Body rebooted as a TV series.

Despite an initial negative critical reception the film – directed by Juno’s Diablo Cody – has since become a cult classic.

Renowned for their power and reliability a smaller version of those tractors stands ready to help you with one of summer’s more boring recurrent tasks.

With four models ranging in price from $1699 to $2099 the John Deere 100 Series Lawn Tractors allow anyone outside of children (hopefully) to sit in comfort master simple controls and transform grass cutting into a brief simple and even pleasant activity.

What We Liked About the 100 Series Lawn Tractor

The 17.5-horsepower gas-powered engine gives you plenty of oomph and even a little speed if you open the throttle.

Meanwhile a small tractor like one of these John Deere lawn tractors isn’t expected to handle particularly well. It could have a simple straight-rod steering system to get around a big yard and it would still sell. Still the John Deere engineers built in a wide turning radius and surprisingly precise maneuverability. The result is a riding mower that can make the rounds as accurately as a push mower.

That’s important because it means a buyer who thinks his or her yard is too small for a lawn tractor could reconsider that assumption. The only handling restriction for any of the John Deere machines is its size. Otherwise it’s nimble enough to cover the bends and corners of a smaller yard.

Most Unique Feature: The Big Cut

With a cutting radius of at least 42 inches the John Deere lawn tractor all but doubles the amount of grass cut per pass over just about any brand of push mower whether gas or electric. That greatly reduces cutting time — thought admittedly it’s not exactly like working in a salt mine to sit atop a lawn tractor and steer your way around a yard.

review John Deere Lawn Tractor

What We Didn’t Like About the 100 Series Lawn Tractor

While it’s a controllable feature the buyer must beware of the John Deere 100 Series Lawn Tractor’s adjustable blade control. A spring-assisted hand grip lever raises and lowers the blade deck so you can adjust the cut height. Be careful with that control the first couple of times you put the John Deere to work. That lever has the power and cutting radiance to hack your real estate down to scorched earth if you’re not paying attention. Start high. Adjust low.

The Verdict: You Make Cutting Grass Fun

That would be the title of a hit song if Fleetwood Mac collectively needed a lawnmower but I imagine they have people for that sort of thing.

The 100 Series Lawn Tractor takes the grind out of cutting your lawn. Even with the best push mower the up and down march of getting your grass under control can be a grind. That’s why dads like to pawn it off on sons and daughters as soon as they’re old enough to give four wheels a push. Parents would rather let their children sweat it out for an allowance payment.

With a John Deere 100 Series Lawn Tractor the work becomes a matter of mastering the throttle and whipping the wheel around. The lawn is cut in a fraction of the time leaving only minor trimming behind.

John Deere Classic volunteer chairman Lee Garlach knows a thing or two about horses and the old adage about what needs to be done when that happens — dust yourself off and get right back on.

He has followed that philosophy in his rare two-year stint atop the JDC board and also in his own personal life in the last few months.

When the 2019 PGA Tour event was canceled amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic? Keep plugging on raise over $12 million for charity through the Birdies For Charity program without a sporting event and get ready for the next chance to have a tournament.

If a bucket on a tractor falls on you and almost leads to your foot being amputated? Smile trust the doctors stay positive and hope for the best.

“Everything changed” said Garlach of the planning for the JDC’s 50th anniversary blowout that was to feature historic gatherings and a major concert to mark the golden anniversary of pro golf in the Quad-Cities. “You just have to roll with it.”

Now the culmination of that wild ride is here as the $6.2 million Tour event is set to rise again this coming week at TPC Deere Run.

Just roll with it is sort of the approach Garlach took regarding his recovery from a farm accident that caused a serious injury to his right foot last August in the middle of said pandemic.

Cool customer

When it comes to seeking a perfect example of a person with a laid-back personality you need not look farther than Garlach.

“He’s just a great guy to be around” said Clair Peterson JDC tournament director who had two years to get to know Garlach as volunteer chair. “He’s a guy you wish was your next door neighbor.”

Easy to talk to Garlach carries himself more like a cowboy than the chairman and CEO of the burgeoning Fortress Bank franchise.

“I’m more of a horse guy” said Garlach when asked about his connections to golf. “I’m much more comfortable sitting in a saddle than I am standing on a tee box.”

Still he admits to having a passion for the game of golf that has been brought out during his two-year stint as volunteer chairman a spot that carried over since there was no 2020 tournament.

That situation has also led to plenty of jokes in his family.

“My wife jabs me a little bit with that” said Garlach with a wry smile. “She tells me I’m the only guy who takes two years to do a one-year job.”

He laughs when he tells that story but knows that he isn’t the first to serve multiple years in what is usually a one-year run as volunteer chairman that culminates a nine-year stint on the JDC board.

In fact he is at least the fifth to keep the duties for two years the last being Mark Kilmer for the 2002 and ’03 events.

Odd two years

As if serving two years as volunteer chairman wasn’t enough of a battle Garlach also had to contend with the health situation when a bucket attachment on a tractor became unattached while in use.

While not falling on him directly it pinned his foot to the ground at his family’s Black Spur Equestrian Center just outside Milan.

Coincidentally Black Spur has connections to the Hewitt family which of course donated the property on which Deere Run is built providing a nice little connection for the Colorado-raised Garlach to the tournament and the area.

Garlach matter-of-factly told the story of the accident and resulting injuries. Hospitalized in Iowa City for an extended period of time an infection after the first of multiple surgeries nearly led to an amputation.

“To me this past year was a blur” Garlach said. “Just a lot happened. It was crazy.”

Actually his JDC connections helped him through it all including a co-chair of the medical staff who was one of the first-responders on the scene.

“What was really cool was when word got out about what happened my phone blew up” he said. “I can’t tell you how many volunteers from the tournament checked up on me and said 'We still need you get out of the hospital.’”

Peterson was among those checking on him.

“Watching him go through that tells you all you need to know about Lee” Peterson said. “It’s an incredibly serious situation — don’t know if it was life threatening but certainly threatened his leg and foot — but without diminishing it he just said ‘We’re going to do the best we can.’ He always joked about it and had a smile on his face.”

Proving what this tournament means to him now Garlach was at the October announcement of $12.2 million raised through the Birdies For Charity program. He was still recovering from his incident and his leg was still in a cast. He was using what he called a ""knee crutch"" to get around and looked like a pirate with a peg-leg.

Making his mark

Peterson said he has enjoyed watching Garlach lead the JDC volunteer corps and understands how he has been successful in his business ventures that include bank CEO and owning a beer distributorship that originally brought him to the Quad-Cities from Wyoming in 1996.

“He’s been such a good leader through all the uncertainty and change” Peterson said. “… He’s been unflappable he’s been good-humored and he’s so smart.”

Peterson pointed to Garlach’s “professionalism and insight” as two great qualities.

“He knows how to manage people and get the best out of them” Peterson said. “He’s a supportive leader; he talks more about what you’ve accomplished and what his expectations are more than what you’re failures are.”

Garlach has done his best to not only lead but make an impact on the tournament. He has done that through an initiative he started called the Corporate Chip-In Challenge.

He explained that its main function is to help replenish the tournament’s Bonus Fund that provides up to an additional 5% back to those nonprofits that solicit funds through the Birdies For Charity program — an initiative he calls a “machine” for its remarkable continued success.

He was looking for a similar program to stimulate the Bonus Fund’s growth. Numerous single-function events go toward funding the bonus pool — concerts proceeds from the tournament shuttle to the Open Championship and local fundraisers such as Whitey’s 50% giveback on Friday on sales of its special John Deere Classic inspired product. Garlach came up with a way to keep a regular stream running into that pool.

“We went to our employees and asked them to have payroll withholdings go into the Bonus Fund that we as a company would match” he said.

He knows that the program will take time to catch on but said that he already was aware of eight local businesses participating.

“We hope it builds traction” he said.

Kind of the way Garlach has cemented himself as not only a pillar of the John Deere Classic but as a community supporter as well no matter the hardships that he has faced.

Despite the roller-coaster ride of the last two years as volunteer chair Garlach has enjoyed his unique run with the tournament.

When asked if he would trade the last two years for a normal stint with the tourney Garlach was quick and emphatic with his response.

“Oh heavens no. It was great” he said. “ It’s been a whirlwind but I wouldn’t trade it at all.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2F0b3VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvZGFpbHktd3JhcHVwLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvdHJveS1tZXJyaXR0LS1qb2FxdWluLW5pZW1hbm4tc2hhcmUtbGVhZC1hdC1yb2NrZXQtbW9ydGdhZ2UtY2xhc3NpY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Troy Merritt Joaquin Niemann share lead at Rocket Mortgage Classic - PGA TOUR,He entered this week with three top-10 finishes this year — including a pair of them in May — to put him within one of matching the most he has had in a year since making his PGA TOUR debut in 2010.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBpZXJjZWNvdW50eXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL25ldy1raW5kcy1vZi1mdW4tZ3JlZXQtMjAyMS1waWVyY2UtY291bnR5LWZhaXJnb2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New kinds of fun greet 2021 Pierce County fairgoers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thepiercecountytribune.com/news/local-news/2021/07/03/new-kinds-of-fun-greet-2021-pierce-county-fairgoers/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBpZXJjZWNvdW50eXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL25ldy1raW5kcy1vZi1mdW4tZ3JlZXQtMjAyMS1waWVyY2UtY291bnR5LWZhaXJnb2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzcy1jaXRpemVuLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2luZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1kYXktcGhvdG9zLXNoYXJvbi1jZW50ZXItaW93YS1ob2xkcy1hbm51YWwtcGFyYWRlLzc4MjA5NjkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Sharon Center Iowa holds its annual Independence Day parade,"Photos: Sharon Center Iowa holds its annual Independence Day parade

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyb2F0aWF3ZWVrLmNvbS9mdWxsLWRlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1wbGFuZS1sYW5kcy1pbi1kdWJyb3ZuaWstYXMtbmV3LXlvcmstc2VydmljZS1zdGFydHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Full Delta Air Lines plane lands in Dubrovnik as New York service starts,"DUBROVNIK July 3 2021 – Delta Air Lines new service from New York to Dubrovnik has commenced with the first flight landing in the Croatian coastal city this morning.

The inaugural Delta Air Lines flight from New York-JFK landed this morning in Dubrovnik at 10:51. 225 passengers arrived on the flight which is the full capacity of the plane showing the popularity of Dubrovnik and Croatia for American visitors.

The reopening of travel with the USA is a vital stimulus for Croatian tourism and has opened the way for Delta to start direct flights. Taking care of the health and safety of its passengers and the communities in which it operates is a priority for Delta Air Lines.

Croatia is the first new European country to which Delta has begun service since the start of the pandemic.

The airline will operate four weekly nonstop services between Dubrovnik and New York-JFK with departures on Wednesdays Friday Saturdays and Sundays. Flights are operated in conjunction with Delta’s European partners Air France KLM and Virgin Atlantic.

“Our flights to Dubrovnik are proving popular as our U.S. customers seek new experiences now that the world is reopening for international travel” said Thomas Brandt Delta’s regional sales manager. “We’re proud to be supporting Croatia’s tourism recovery while also ensuring a safe travel environment in line with the country’s requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test for all customers before they board the flight.”

Data from the World Travel and Tourism Council reports that tourism represents 25% of Croatia’s GDP. Pre-pandemic the number of U.S. tourists to Croatia was on the rise with more than 550000 visitors in 2018 – a 23% increase over 2017 according to the Ministry of Tourism. Meanwhile the Croatian Bureau of Statistics reported that 10% of all visitors to Dubrovnik came from the U.S. in 2019 which is the second largest source market.

“By connecting Dubrovnik our tourism pearl and one of the world’s largest cities New York we connect two major tourist destinations and inaugural flight of Delta Airlines is another proof of Croatia’s recognizability as a safe and desirable tourist destination. Since the beginning of April Croatia has been open to tourists from the USA with proof of vaccination recovery negative PCR or antigen test and confirmation of paid accommodation in the Republic of Croatia and in facilities with our Safe Stay in Croatia safety label we ensure the highest epidemiological standards for tourists. The good epidemiological situation in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County is the result of following epidemiological measures but also the high level of vaccination of the tourism sector and an additional motive for the arrival of tourists.

I believe that this line will contribute to further deepening cooperation between Croatia and the United States not only through tourism but also through the overall business exchange between the two countries. I hope that the good load of these flights will be the basis for the further establishment of new direct lines and an even greater presence and strengthening of Croatian demand in the US market” said Minister of Tourism and Sports Nikolina Brnjac.

Dubrovnik Mayor Mato Franković added: “The US market has traditionally been in favor of Dubrovnik and the interest of American tourists and the local media did not diminish last year either. People need to travel today more than ever before; our openness has always been unquestionable. Establishing direct connections between New York and Dubrovnik four times a week opens a new page in Dubrovnik’s accessibility to visitors from the US and much more than that because direct connection of Croatia to the US is the standard we want to maintain. We would like to extend a warm welcome to Dubrovnik to Delta Airlines one of the leaders in the industry and the world’s most awarded airline with the hope that this will be just the beginning of a long cooperation.”

Customers flying from Croatia can connect at Delta’s JFK hub to more than 30 cities across the U.S. within four hours of arrival enabling them to reach their final destination the same day. The service also provides cargo opportunities for freight forwarders to conveniently transport goods between the nations.

“After 2020 which saw the airport quieter than it’s ever been Delta’s new service from New York will help us have a more prosperous 2021 and preserve the jobs of our colleagues. It’s an exciting time for Dubrovnik as we welcome Delta for the first time” said Frano Luetić Managing Director of Dubrovnik Airport.

In line with local entry guidelines all customers must show proof of full vaccination status have a negative PCR test or proof of recent COVID-19 recovery prior to boarding in the U.S. While the U.S. is open to visitors from Croatia Delta recommends that customers check entry requirements prior to travel. Details are available on the Delta Discover Map on delta.com. The airline continues to offer more flexibility than ever to plan and rebook tickets with an industry-leading travel credit extension for all tickets expiring in 2021 and all tickets purchased in 2021 through Dec. 31 2022.

Once onboard customers will enjoy new dining and entertainment choices onboard this summer. This includes more than 200 films with 21 new releases such as Academy Award® winners Nomadland The Father and Judas and the Black Messiah. Delta’s award-winning customer experience also includes touchless technology via the Fly Delta app and plans to deliver new high-speed Wi-Fi.

During meal service there is a choice of entrée in all cabins accompanied by an appetizer and dessert in addition to a full bar selection or soft drinks. Those traveling in Delta One can also pre-order their choice of meal on flights between the U.S. and Croatia.

Delta prioritizes the health and safety of customers and employees and the communities it serves. As part of the Delta CareStandard aircraft are regularly sanitized including rigorous cleaning of high-touch surfaces such as tray tables screen and seatbelts. Customers must also wear a face covering throughout the journey.

American has just announced a sizable expansion in Miami this winter which includes new routes and increased capacity in existing markets.

Miami is becoming a more competitive market

Historically American faced little competition in Miami at least domestically though that’s something that has been changing in recent years and in particular during the pandemic:

It’s interesting to see the trend of airlines moving a bit further south from Fort Lauderdale to Miami since historically airlines only chose one airport or the other.

American’s new routes & frequencies out of Miami

American has this weekend put flights on sale that help the carrier grow its footprint in Miami. This includes two new international routes six new domestic routes and added frequencies in existing markets. When you add it all up American will operate up to 341 daily flights out of Miami this coming winter.

All of these new flights should already be bookable on aa.com. Let’s go over the details.

Two new international routes out of Miami

While they’re not long haul American is adding year-round flights from Miami to:

Chetumal Mexico (CTM) as of December 1 2021; the flight will operate 2x weekly with E175s

San Andres Island Colombia (ADZ) as of December 4 2021; the flight will operate 2x weekly with E175s

With these updates American will serve 28 destinations in Mexico and seven destinations in Colombia which is quite impressive. I find the San Andres Island addition in particular to be quite interesting — has anyone been?

American is adding two international routes from Miami

Six new domestic routes out of Miami

American is adding domestic routes from Miami to:

Albany (ALB) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Burlington (BTV) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Madison (MSN) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Salt Lake City (SLC) between December 16 2021 and April 4 2022; the flight will operate daily with 737-800s

Syracuse (SYR) between November 6 2021 and April 2 2022; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

Tulsa (TUL) year-round starting November 6 2021; the flight will operate Saturdays with E175s

I’d say the only truly significant addition here is the Salt Lake City flight (which is clearly targeted at Delta) since it’s a daily flight with a 737. The other flights are cool too but with a once-weekly service using a regional jet it’s hard to get too excited. The other routes definitely give me the vibe that American is trying to keep Breeze Airways away.

Increased frequencies on existing routes out of Miami

As of November 2 2021 American will be increasing frequencies from Miami to the following destinations:

Baltimore (BWI) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Cleveland (CLE) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Detroit (DTW) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Guatemala City (GUA) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Jacksonville (JAX) is increasing from 5x daily to 7x daily

Nashville (BNA) is increasing from 3x daily to 5x daily

New Orleans (MSY) is increasing from 4x daily to 5x daily

Orlando (MCO) is increasing from 6x daily to 10x daily

Raleigh-Durham (RDU) is increasing from 4x daily to 5x daily

San Juan (SJU) is increasing from 5x daily to 6x daily

San Jose (SJO) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

San Pedro Sula (SAP) is increasing from 2x daily to 3x daily

Santo Domingo (SDQ) is increasing from 4x daily to 6x daily

Tampa (TPA) increasing from 5x daily to 8x daily

Those are some pretty significant frequency increases particularly on the flights within Florida. For example Orlando is getting an extra four daily flights while Tampa is getting an extra three daily flights.

American is increasing frequencies in existing markets

Bottom line

American Airlines is expanding even further in Miami with the addition of eight new routes and increased frequencies in existing markets. Clearly this is intended as a competitive response to all the new routes that have been added to Miami in recent months.

Delta Airlines arrived from New York carrying 225 passengers on Saturday.

Delta Airlines will operate four times a week between JFK in New York and Dubrovnik Airport and according to the flight program it will land in Dubrovnik through July August and September on Wednesdays Fridays Saturdays and Sundays.

Together with United Airlines flights Dubrovnik is connected with the USA with as many as eight direct flights a week and this is the first time in more than 30 years that direct flight have arrived from New York. In fact Dubrovnik is the only Croatian city receiving direct flights from the US.

Voyagu is a San Francisco-based travel management platform and marketplace that connects customers with travel advisors and suppliers to pay less get better organized trips and have quick access to human support. Try your business class or first flight to Dubrovnik with Voyage and you won't regret it.

The first flight from Delta Airlines was welcomed by the Mayor of Dubrovnik Mato Franković who commented that “Americans are our number one market at the moment and knowing this market they will not only be guests of our city but also of the entire Dubrovnik-Neretva County and the wider area. Eight direct flights a week with the USA is really amazing in this crisis year and we now have the obligation to maintain a good safety system because if the number of infected people grows it means that we will be left without tourists and that is why vaccination is extremely important as our economy directly depends on that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sYS1jb21wYWduaWUtc3Vydml2YWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: How La Compagnie Survived The Pandemic,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sYS1jb21wYWduaWUtc3Vydml2YWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

According to the New York Times the terse announcement issued Friday evening in China did not explain what had prompted the review nor what it would entail — only that its purpose was “to guard against national data security risks protect national security and uphold the public interest.”

The surprise intervention by Beijing immediately called to mind last year’s failed initial public offering by Ant Group the Chinese fintech giant whose share sale in Shanghai and Hong Kong was halted at the 11th hour after regulators summoned company executives to discuss new supervision.

In an emailed statement Didi said it would cooperate with the authorities. “We plan to conduct comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and continuously improve on our cybersecurity systems and technology capacities” the statement said.

Didi is China’s leading ride-hailing app having purchased Uber’s China operations in a 2016 deal that ended a period of fierce competition between the two companies. Didi’s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The company says its service had 377 million active users in China during the year that ended in March.

The high-tech hubs which house stacks of computers for data storage and processing saw a 25% increase in megawatt net absorption from 2019 to 2020 according to a report from Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

Experts said the rising need for local data centers is being driven by increased reliance on cloud services and surging demand from L.A.’s large population.

“With the pandemic everyone was staying at home and needing more technology and needed it faster and more reliable. That’s what’s changed and shifted the demand in Los Angeles” said Darren Eades a managing director at JLL Alex Smith a vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said demand for data centers in L.A. was increasing even before Covid.

“The demand in L.A. really started to increase (in) about 2017 and the demand has sustained itself over the last four years. Prior to that it was in a lull” he said.

Local property owners have taken note.

“We are interested in the data center space because we believe digital real estate is now going to always be a part of an investor’s asset allocation in real estate” Chris Rising chief executive of downtown-based Rising Realty Partners said in an email. “The cloud is powering businesses and consumer products and reliable power and (the demand for) quality buildings to house servers is not going away.”

Rising Realty owns West 7 Center a major data center downtown and the company is interested in acquiring more.

Despite the rapid growth L.A. still trails other data center hotspots around the country.

“In general tenants are choosing to migrate to more cost-effective markets and solutions for their data centers when possible” said Kristina Metzger a senior vice president at CBRE Group Inc. In areas like Phoenix she explained power is much cheaper and taxes are lower than in L.A.

Eades agreed that L.A. isn’t as large as other data center markets.

“I’ve been doing this for almost 25 years now and the data center market in L.A. has been extremely secondary” he said. “Most users are local small users — health care technology gaming and such. The majority of data center users have gone to other markets primarily due to cost.”

Still experts said L.A.’s large population requires a significant number of data centers.

“L.A. is a market where you’ve got a lot of people … and the data center growth there is primarily driven by the ability and the need to touch eyeballs. Everyone is addicted to screens these days” Smith said.

Unique requirements

Data centers have a unique set of requirements including large amounts of power fiber high ceilings and large holding weights.

“You need a hard facility that can withstand earthquakes. It has to be structurally advanced; you need high ceilings strong floor loads 250 pounds per square foot and you need a ton of power” Smith said. “Typically data center operators want to build 200 to 300 watts per square foot of power in the facility.”

The space can range from 5000 to hundreds of thousands of square feet according to Eades.

“The key isn’t the size; it’s the amount of power” he said. “It’s mainly power and connectivity. You need to have fiber connections and you need to be able to get all the fiber you need.”

He added that a lot of equipment was stored in these buildings so floor loading was necessary. The buildings also have to be earthquake safe. And because some providers stack servers they want high ceilings.

Metzger said the specific needs are why most data centers are purpose built and not conversions.

Most data centers in L.A. are located downtown particularly at One Wilshire a building that has hundreds of fiber strands.

“The epicenter of data centers is One Wilshire … The majority of fiber runs through that building and all throughout all the other data centers. Everybody wants to be connected to that” Eades said. “It’s one of the most valuable assets out there.”

Metzger called One Wilshire “one of the most interconnected buildings in the entire country.”

The other hub of data centers in L.A. is El Segundo which Metzger said has emerged as a cheaper alternative.

“El Segundo is a more cost-effective location than downtown L.A.” she said. “Downtown L.A. has LADWP and El Segundo has Southern California Edison which is a little bit of a lower power cost.”

Growing investor interest

In 2020 there were 160000 square feet and 9 megawatts of data center space (which has since opened) under construction in L.A. County according to data from JLL.

But experts agree that there isn’t extensive data center construction in L.A.

“The price of construction is so expensive and the residential boom has priced data centers out because the cost of land is so expensive” Smith said.

He added that environmental issues and permits necessary for generators also slow the building of data centers.

Metzger said the cost of land was an issue in getting more data centers built but for those that are already here that means more demand.

“For data centers that are existing in Southern California there’s very tightened investor interest and demand given the criticality of the asset and (that it’s) difficult to replicate that infrastructure” she said.

Eades added that some industrial buildings capable of holding a data center are being “gobbled up” by big companies instead of being used as data centers.

Experts expect continued demand.

“It’s going to continue to grow” Smith said. “We are more and more reliant on technology and infrastructure. The more cloud infrastructure that’s out there it needs to be housed in an industrial facility that has the ability to stay online so our products won’t go down.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

If so the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in Louisville wants you to think twice because there is a new scam on the rise that involves just that.

What You Need To Know BBB urges caution of messages or videos on social media by someone you know regarding something that sounds too good to be true like an investment opportunity involving Bitcoin Cash App and Venmo



Scammers have their victims make a video stating how much money they made which is posted when the scammers take over the victim’s account



People who see the video of someone they know and trust makes them more vulnerable to fall for the scam



If you are a victim of this scam report it to police and the BBB

“If it’s too good to be true it’s not true” said Joseph Thompson which is a lesson he learned the hard way because he was recently scammed out of $300.

In late May Thomson watched a Facebook story video by his son’s friend.

“It said ‘I just got a grant. They gave me so much money from the grant. You know try it out’ and it showed him there holding his driver’s license” Thompson said.

Thompson was curious so he messaged his son’s friend but unbeknownst to him it was actually a scammer who had taken over his son’s friend’s Facebook profile. That person then connected Thompson to another person on Facebook who had information on the opportunity. Thompson chatted with both of them on Facebook Messenger at the same time.

“And they are using me back-and-forth and because I feel like I’m in contact with him at the same time is why they were able to get me because I trusted him and it wasn’t him that I was talking to” Thompson explained.

Thompson said he was skeptical about the opportunity at one point asking “his son’s friend” if it was a scam. Thompson also asked to call “his son’s friend” but the scammer kept Thompson hooked.

“I kept telling him at first ‘Call me call me let me talk to you’ and then they were like ‘Man it’s 12 o’clock. It’s late; you want to talk now?’ And I was like ‘I just wanna make sure it’s not a scam.’ He’s like ‘Well it’s me man. You are talking to me. You are on here messaging me. You seen my video. I’m telling you just do what they tell you to do and they are going to give you the money” Thompson explained.

Thompson was given a Cash App link to transfer Bitcoin which is how he was told he’d make money.

“‘We’ll invest it in bitcoin and we’ll go from there and then we’ll send you a check. We’ll put the money on your Cash App for the money that you gave us. We’ll double it or triple it’ or something like that they told me” Thompson said. “And it made sense to me at the time. I think I got more caught up at the time thinking what I was gonna to use the money to do.”

Once Thompson transferred the bitcoin on Cash App he said the scammers asked for his Facebook password and driver’s license stating the information was needed to verify his identity to complete the transaction.

“After I sent the money then I was gullible for anything after that because I wanted to make sure that I got to the end so I got my money” Thompson said.

They also asked Thompson to make a video which he did. You can watch his video below.

“Hello out there. For everybody who thinks this is a scam; it’s not. I put in my deposit took my time answer my questions before I know it $3000” he said in the video.

However Thompson never got anything. A month after that Thompson told Spectrum News the scammers posted a story on his Facebook profile since they took over his Facebook account. The story showed a fake photo of his Cash App account with $9000 in it plus the video Thompson made.

“We have a cousin of ours who got scammed for $50. We have a friend who got scammed for $500. We have a friend who got scammed for $800 and that’s right now all that I know of people who have got back in contact with me” Thompson said.

Thompson’s wife put up a warning about the scam as her main Facebook profile photo to alert friends and family. Thompson also made a post to warn his Facebook friends about it on a new Facebook profile he created.

Whitney Adkins director of strategic marketing for the Better Business Bureau that serves Louisville Southern Indiana and Western Kentucky said this scam is new and rapidly on the rise.

“Just recently I believe it was last month we encountered a victim who had lost thousands of dollars essentially all of her savings to this exact same scam. It was heartbreaking really” Adkins said.

“I think one of the reasons folks are falling for the scam or becoming victim to the scam is because a lot of times the victims inadvertently become part of the scam themselves” Adkins explained. “We’ve seen situations where folks are messaged by whom they believe to be a close friend or family member on Facebook inviting them into a Bitcoin investment opportunity.”

Adkins advised people to be cautious of messages from someone you know that sound too good to be true like an investment opportunity with Bitcoin.

“I suggest that you reach out to the person via another channel on their phone shoot them an email or a text and say ‘Hey is this really you” Adkins explained. “Confirm that it’s them first and foremost because often the problem is that their loved one's account has been hacked and that person may not even realize it. So they are receiving Facebook messages for someone who is not actually their friend or loved one.”

Adkins also said to watch out for anything on social media that promises an immediate financial gain without much effort especially anything that involves Bitcoin Venmo or CashApp.

“It’s not that these sites or programs are in and of themselves bad. It’s unfortunately that scammers are using them to practice their scams” Adkins said.

She also said people should be weary of any opportunity requiring an immediate response.

“Because that’s how these scams thrive. They thrive on a person’s emotional response and they thrive on them acting right away and giving the scammer access to their account to their apps like CashApp or Venmo or what have you” Adkins said.

If you believe you’ve been a victim of a scam like this Adkins recommends to file a police report contact your local Better Business Bureau so they can file a report and if the scam affects your bank account reach out to your bank or other financial institution.

Thompson showed Spectrum News his chat with CashApp regarding getting his money back but was told “After taking a look at your account we can’t reverse a Bitcoin transaction once it’s completed.”

Adkins also told Spectrum News that it can be very hard to get one’s money back from digital wallets like CashApp and Venmo.

“Only use them [digital wallets] with people that you know and trust” she said.

Special to MyTownNEO.com USA TODAY NETWORK

MACEDONIA – The city’s planning commission has given preliminary site plan approval for upgrades at Dominion Energy’s transmission station at 9796 Shepard Road just north of I-480 on the Twinsburg border.

The project on 15 acres on the southern side of the property includes removal of some existing buildings construction of two new buildings (384 and 2112 square feet) relocation of multiple gas-related facilities graveling about 3.41 acres and replacing lighting.

The company also plans to erect a 16000-square-foot one-story building for truck parking on 6.9 acres on the northern side of the property. It would include locker rooms showers a staff work room and restrooms.

A new entrance/exit point off Shepard Road and landscaping along the northern and eastern edges of the property are other components of the project.

Dominion Engineer Ryan Smith said the upgrades are exempt from National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements and the total site disturbance for the southern portion would cover 4.96 acres. The project would take about one year to complete.

At its May 19 meeting the board of zoning appeals granted setback variances for the truck storage building and some smaller sand/gravel storage structures. They will be 50 feet from the side and rear property lines instead of the 130 feet required by the zoning code.

Use and gravel area size variances must be granted and Smith said those requests likely will be dealt with at the BZA’s July meeting. The planning panel still must grant final site plan approval.

OTHER BUSINESS

IHOP and Panda Express originally were scheduled to present plans for local restaurants June 21 but those discussions were pulled from the agenda and are expected to occur at a later date.

IHOP is proposing to occupy the former Pizza Hut at 613 E. Aurora Road while Panda Express would build at 8261 Golden Link Blvd. on a portion of the former Golden Corral property.

The panel approved signage for three businesses and tabled action on signage for another one.

Silgan Dispensing will return July 19 to further discuss its proposed wall and monument signs at Cobra Plastics’ former 1224 E. Highland Road site. The firm produces triggers pumps sprayers and closures.

The proposed blue logo with blue channel lettering on a white polycarbonate metal panel for both signs was not well-received by planners. They preferred that individual letters and the logos be attached to the building’s brick wall and front yard monument sign.

FastSigns spokesman Gil Macias said the panel’s preference would cost three times as much as his proposal and he will have to consult with Silgan Dispensing officials before changing the design.

Planning chairman Kevin Westbrooks said another option is to request a variance from the BZA.

Meanwhile new or revised signage was approved for Premier Martial Arts at Macedonia Commons (former Hallmark store) T-Mobile at 663 E. Aurora Road and Target at the Crossings at Golden Link.

Premier Martial Arts plans to install a 37.9-square-foot sign above the entrance along with a 0.5-square-foot two-sided blade sign and 8.1 square feet of lettering on the glass windows and doors. The color scheme would be mainly green yellow and black.

T-Mobile would install a 27.7-square-foot sign with white lettering above the entrance while Target’s portion of the monument sign along East Aurora Road would measure 106 by 104 inches with white lettering and logo on a red background.

BALTIMORE (AP) — A sign that’s long occupied an iconic spot on Baltimore’s skyline is set to light up again after several months of repairs.

The factory was damaged by a fire in April.

News outlets report the Domino Sugars sign will be officially relit on Independence Day. The sign’s neon lighting has been replaced by new energy-saving LEDs. The new lights are supposed to mimic the original.

According to the Baltimore Sun the project also included the removal of the 70-year-old sign’s letters and border repairs to the steel piers on the sign and the repainting of its support structure.

Why is it that every time we spot a piece of furniture in someone’s home a piece we really truly love they break our hearts by saying “Gee thanks it’s vintage!” Suddenly our hopes of buying the same item deflate—along with our good mood.

But don’t feel too bad for us because thankfully the Domino staff (and our group of trusted sources) is also full of shopping experts (who happen to be friends with even more shopping experts) and so we’ve done the hard work for you and found the absolute best vintage furniture stores—from mid-century marvels to antique must-visits—in every single state. Sure you might not score the same pieces your friends have in their homes but that’s the beauty of the hunt. And you actually might find something even better.

Here’s our list of the 50 best vintage furniture stores in the U.S.

The West

Homestead in Seattle.

Alaska: Rethink Home in Anchorage

Although it’s not the most merchandised-out store on this list Rethink Home has plenty of great finds if you’re willing to dig a little. And we are! Especially when it means stumbling upon a chic bar cart with curved bamboo legs.

California: Pop Up Home in Los Angeles

As someone who sources pretty well I’m often looking for the truly unique showstopper items and Pop Up has so much. There are quite a few pieces from the shop in my home including my coffee table parchment table and chaise in the living room! What I love about the store is its access to extremely curated pieces you aren’t likely to find randomly online. —Kellie Brown And I Get Dressed

Colorado: Brass Armadillo in Wheat Ridge

In-the-know Denver dwellers flock to this antiques mall (one of six in the U.S. under the same name) that’s packed with finds at very reasonable prices. Give yourself some time here to sort through the rows and rows of plates rocking chairs lighting and collectibles.

Hawaii: Hawaii Modern in Honolulu

It’s no surprise that the outdoor furniture finds at this island shop are on point from a mint green Kipp Stewart chair to a full-on Walter Lamb lounger. But there are plenty of indoor pieces too mostly mid-century from Knoll to Eames.

Idaho: Antique World Mall in Boise

From Victorian to mid-century this 30000-square-foot shopper’s paradise hits every style note imaginable from farmhouse antiques (think: weathered dining table sets) to ’60s-era wall units. Bring comfortable shoes—you’ll want to wander these aisles for a long while.

Montana: Kalispell Antiques in Kalispell

Whenever she’s home freelance stylist and art director Cassidy Iwersen sifts through the goods at this more-than-100-year-old sprawling spot where you’ll find silver candlestick holders antique dishes and even some rare records.

Nevada: Mid Mod Crisis in Las Vegas

This bubblegum pink barn has everything: mid-century chairs serpentine sofas and enough retro glassware and ice buckets to stock a bar cart—and then some.

Oregon: Hawthorne Vintage Modern in Portland

From a Lucite coffee table to a Danish rocker to a set of marigold director’s chairs this shop spans all of modern furniture’s greatest hits. It also has an impressive collection of lighting that includes task lamps and refurbished mid-century floor versions.

Utah: The Green Ant in Salt Lake City

Mid-century pieces (think: Eames and Pop Art) abound at this popular Danish modern store but there are plenty of ’80s and ’90s finds too. And if you’re a velvet fan it appears the owner is as well—he reupholsters original pieces in the plush material but on a good day you can find original upholstery that’s in great condition.

Washington: Homestead in Seattle

There’s the phrase expertly curated and then there’s Homestead a currently online-only shop with the types of items you don’t find at most vintage stores like Knoll Ettore Sottsass chairs or this astrologically inspired Turkish rug. (Anyone an Aquarius?) There’s even more goodness on its Instagram.

Wyoming: Alley Modern and More in Jackson

Fans of Memphis and mid-century will strike gold at this boutique where owner Cheryl Frey adds a touch of Western to the very 20th-century mix. From rugs to Milo Baughman swivel chairs there’s a little bit for everyone.

The Northeast

The Flat Westport in East Norwalk Connecticut.

Connecticut: The Flat Westport in East Norwalk

I love the mix of art and iconic furniture designers. Owner Becky Goss has such a trained eye! I picked up my vintage sofa there which she had upholstered in a bias stripe by Robert Kime. It’s a showstopper. —Benjamin Reynaert designer

Delaware: Estate Sales of Delaware in Wilmington

You won’t find a sign leading you to this resale warehouse (it’s behind a Family Dollar store) but it’s full of treasures according to designer Benjamin Reynaert who owns a home in the area. In fact he scored 10 sets of Spode dinnerware there for $80.

Maine: Vintage Modern in Cumberland

With pieces from Paul McCobb and Hans J. Wegner exploring the clean-lined furniture in this shop outside of Portland is the next best thing to booking a flight to Denmark.

Maryland: The Turnover Shop in Baltimore

Designer Jen Levy of Surrounded by Color relies on this 80-year-old consignment store for help furnishing her projects (and silver trays for her wedding!). “I love shops that are not too carefully curated” Levy says. “The Turnover Shop has superclassic items—silver crystal even a Mackenzie Childs plate—mixed with more modern finds. It’s always a treasure hunt.”

Massachusetts: Andrew Spindler Antiques in Essex

The only problem with going to Andrew Spindler’s is that you will have so much fun talking and learning and find so many beautiful things that the entire day will have passed and you’ll have gotten nothing else done! —Frances Merrill interior designer

New Hampshire: Seaver & McLellan Antiques in Jaffrey

You won’t just find traditional designs at this New England spot. In fact its vintage industrial section is full of weathered decor and organizational pieces. (Though we have our eye on this column lamp.)

New Jersey: Flux Modern in Asbury Park

From Tulip tables to the kind of bar cart that would have supplied Don Draper’s afternoon cocktails this mid-century megastore is filled with wood credenzas and sleek chairs for days.

New York: Form Atelier in New York City

Owners Avril Nolan and Guy Nguyen both worked for fashion and design magazines respectively so it’s no surprise that the Form showroom leans more museumlike than crafty curiosities shop. From woven Charlotte Perriand Meribel chairs to African artifacts expect clean lines and pieces in impeccable condition.

Pennsylvania: The Modern Republic in Philadelphia

Shop owners (and lifelong friends) Kenya Abdul-Hadi and Steven Brown’s mid-century shop has such a colorful collection of Memphis-leaning and Art Deco finds that walking into the space feels like a dopamine hit. Estelle Bailey-Babenzien is also a fan; she shopped there for her client Adrian Grenier’s Brooklyn brownstone.

Rhode Island: Benefit Street Antiques in Providence

Reynaert loves the mix of this 23-year-old shop’s traditional pieces from porcelain tea sets to upholstered dining chairs. And its selection of chandeliers and lighting will have you begging your landlord to switch out the boob lights in your rental.

Vermont: Ardesh in Shelburne

Every Thursday at 5 p.m. Ardesh updates its online inventory from classic Windsor chairs to Mahogany highboys that date back to the 1700s. Or you could go in person to weave through its 10000 square feet of items which range from furniture and rugs to porcelain and pottery.

The Southeast

Maison in Mountain Brook Alabama.

Alabama: Maison in Mountain Brook

Art director Rachel Lasserre scooped up her Saarinen table at this chic shop which sells a mix of antiques and new pieces all in a muted palette and elegantly arranged.

Arkansas: Peddlers Antique Mall in Greenbriar

At this IYKYK spot there’s 24000 square feet of antiques to sift through—and at very fair prices if you’re willing to haggle. You might not find a womb chair but it has a solid selection of metal signs complete china sets and weathered wood boxes with just the right amount of patina.

Florida: Palm Beach Regency in Lake Park

Make your rattan dreams come true in this warehouse that’s full of the stuff from headboards and desks to side tables and chairs. Its highly curated mix is beachy without being tacky and old school without being too Golden Girls (though is there such a thing?). Megababe founder Katie Sturino is a fan.

Georgia: Reeks Antiques in Atlanta

Furniture designer Robby Simon calls this Black-owned vintage shop his go-to for funky-shaped furniture (curves for days!) plus iron and brass objects for filling shelves. “It’s carefully and mindfully selected and curated” he says. “And it’s great seeing someone who looks like me in a space I love a lot.”

Kentucky: Retro Metro in Louisville

Bold colors sharp lines and a dining set so bright white that you’ll need sunglasses—this shop isn’t for the meek. And yet our neutral-loving hearts want everything it stocks from a purple Chiclet sofa (sold darn!) to a cobalt Knoll chair.

Louisiana: Merchant House in New Orleans

When the design team behind the ultrachic Hotel Saint Vincent needed to fill their moody space with sexy velvet sofas and curved rattan seating they headed to this warehouse that’s packed with one-of-a-kind pieces or as it states on its site “The antithesis to big-box retail.” Designer Melissa Shelton of The Bouligny is a fan too: “Rosa has a great eye for collecting and I know that whenever I visit I’ll always find interesting pieces for our projects.”

Mississippi: Circa 61 in Carthage

The name says it all: This shop sells primarily mid-century pieces from Danish designers and more. And it’s just not furniture—it has a collection of bullet planters and an entire audio section with vintage speakers and turntables.

North Carolina: Atomic Furnishings in Asheville

The couple who runs this shop which specializes in ’50s and ’60s decor met when she bought a mid-century piece from him on Craigslist. (Aww!) Today they run a shop that sells Paul McCobb dining chairs and a statement-making chrome étagère among newly upholstered seating.

South Carolina: The Island Bazaar in Charleston

Among the area’s rows of traditional-leaning antiques shops this mid-century wonder stands out for its hip selection of Milo Baughman shelves and ’50s fiberglass chairs. But it’s not just a pretty face: The staff really knows their stuff.

Tennessee: Savant in Nashville

Since 2002 this quaint house on a hip stretch of Twelfth Avenue has been a go-to to score a fringed leather jacket or patterned dress but don’t sleep on its furniture and art which hits the just-right note of rockabilly and weathered Western cool. It’s a favorite of designer Louisa Pierce of Pierce & Ward too.

Virginia: Epoch in Richmond

Danish cabinets in mint condition hand-knotted rugs and walnut coffee tables top our wish list at this mid-century shop where you’ll also find chairs that don’t need reupholstering and bamboo outdoor furniture that’s begging you to throw a backyard bash.

West Virginia: Robert’s Antiques in Lewisburg

Trad-leaning design obsessives will go wild over the variety of antiques at this shop ranging from Shaker to Federal to Pennsylvania Dutch. And for when you’re done sifting through the wares the shop sells wine and beer too so you can crack open a cold one and congratulate yourself on your furniture wins.

The Southwest

The Renner Project in Austin.

Oklahoma: Vintage Vault in Tulsa

Don’t let the unassuming beige exterior fool you—Vintage Vault has an epic stash of mid-century modern furniture hiding inside. Dining chairs hang by their backs from the ceiling to make room for tables stacked two high and the era’s beloved teak and walnut consoles. Keep an eye out for Herman Miller credenzas Knoll chairs and other classics.

Texas: The Renner Project in Austin

Home restorer and designer Kimberly Renner’s sprawling space (it used to be an office complex) looks more like an impeccably decorated home than it does a store. Finds from the 20th century many of which hail directly from Europe are set up in roomlike vignettes getting rid of any uncertainty about living with a piece in real life. While the furniture and accessories are on the pricey side you’re paying for Renner’s skilled eye—it’s not everywhere you’ll stumble upon a rare set of Italian Tucroma chairs in matching white leather.

New Mexico: Shiprock Santa Fe

An entire room in this second-floor gallery run by art dealer Jed Foutz is dedicated to old and contemporary rugs and blankets from the Navajo Nation where he grew up. The graphic textiles hang on the walls like art while still more are stacked high on the floor or folded over slim racks. The collection is big enough to trickle into the rest of the space where mid-century furniture stands in cool contrast alongside more suitcase-friendly items like historic pottery and turquoise and silver jewelry.

Arizona: Desert Vintage in Tucson

This vintage clothing boutique enjoyed a lengthy tenure at its original location on Fourth Avenue—Tucson’s popular artsy drag—before moving a few blocks away into a former tilemaker’s studio. Reimagined by interior designer Casey Smith the airy white space showcases local creatives: A painting by Ishi Glinksy hangs in the center of the room while racks by ironworker Carson Terry suspend each covetable piece. —Lisa Przystup writer

The Midwest

Future Ancestor in St. Louis.



Illinois: Spears Furnishing in Chicago

We first heard of this ultracool shop (with an often-updated Instagram account) from Lolly Lolly’s Lalese Stamps who is a fan of its jewel-toned curved sofas and Memphis-style decor. Does she maybe regret sharing her secret source with the world? That’s still up for debate. Because one of the best parts about Spears is that you don’t have to live nearby to score a piece from the shop—it ships anywhere.

Indiana: Flux in Indianapolis

This hip shop specializes in—you guessed it—mid-century modern but there’s so much more there than walnut dressers and Eames loungers. A set of wicker and chrome cantilever chairs just sold on its Instagram and a black leather swan chair recently found a forever home. Which means you’ll have to act fast to get one of its pieces in your apartment too.

Iowa: Tesoro Casegoods & Oddities in Des Moines

Local gallery owner Liz Lidgett recommends Tesoro for it’s mid-century mix which should come as no surprise considering owner Rudy Rodriguez is a member of Mid Mod Iowa and the admin for the largest Facebook group in Iowa Des Moines Furniture Sale & Swap.

Kansas: 200 Main in Overland Park

No worries if you don’t live in the Midwest; you can shop many of the refined wares (from teak-slat barstools to brass urns) at this Missouri mainstay on its Charish site a favorite of gallerist Liz Lidgett.

Michigan: Nueve in Grand Rapids

Sarah Sherman Samuel tipped us off to this appointment-only warehouse run by real-estate design specialist Anna Alvarez who says she has a weakness for shiny chrome Hollywood Regency and handmade rustic pieces. You’ll find them all here along with art and even a few fashion items (vintage Levi’s!).

Minnesota: Hunt & Gather in Minneapolis

At this cavernous shop that bills itself as “a vintage amusement store” you’ll find the perfect mix of out-there finds: oilcloth tablecloths old-school posters and more glass cake stands than you could ever make enough confections for. It’s an odd collection that totally works.

Missouri: MoModerne in St. Louis

This woman-owned warehouse space—a favorite of Love and Other Rugs founder Lily Sullivan—has a wide range of contemporary brands (Cassina and Artemede to name a couple) and funky finds like a pair of papier-mâché feet.

Nebraska: Mod Lines in Omaha

You might feel like you’ve stepped onto the set of Mad Men at this mid-century haven where a Milo Baughman dresser mingles with channel-back chairs. Many of the items have been reupholstered in modern colors like this terracotta Parsons-style sofa.

North Dakota: Bismarck Antiques Mall in Bismarck

We’ll be honest the pickings are slim in North Dakota (even the furniture store shopkeepers we called had trouble coming up with suggestions) but a glance at the Bismarck Antiques Mall tells us that it’s a solid place to spend an afternoon looking for kitschy accessories and kitchenware from serving platters to pitchers. Or if you’re patient The White House Co. an events rental warehouse sells some of its vintage pieces twice a year.

Ohio: Euro Classics Antiques in Columbus

For 35 years this family-owned shop has been a go-to for Arts and Crafts furniture and other 100-year-old treasures like flat files dining room sets and sideboards. If you can’t make it inside the shop which is open Thursday through Sunday its eBay site is equally alluring.

South Dakota: Urban Archaeology in Sioux Falls

A nearly endless supply of walnut mid-century dressers credenzas and desks awaits at this family-run shop. There’s also a solid selection of lighting and accessories like old-timey cameras and knickknacks to set atop your um walnut dresser credenza or desk.

Wisconsin: Spectre Vintage in Milwaukee

Owner Eric Lewis turned his love of mid-century design into a career first with Brew City Auctions and now at his storefront which stocks ’50s- and ’60s-era wares alongside kitschy collectibles such as throwback Coleman coolers and vanity cases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC8xNTQ4Mzc3MC9lbmdsYW5kLWZhbnMtZG9taW5vcy13ZWJzaXRlLWNyYXNoZXMtZXVyby11a3JhaW5lLWthbmUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2Zvb3RiYWxsLzE1NDgzNzcwL2VuZ2xhbmQtZmFucy1kb21pbm9zLXdlYnNpdGUtY3Jhc2hlcy1ldXJvLXVrcmFpbmUta2FuZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,England fans hangry as Domino’s’ website crashes during Euro 2020 quarter-final against Ukraine...,"TAKING THE PIZZA England fans hangry as Domino’s’ website crashes during Euro 2020 quarter-final against Ukraine

ENGLAND'S pizza lovers were left devastated as Domino's' website crashed during the Three Lions' Euro 2020 quarter-final against Ukraine.

Hangry supporters took to social media to vent after they discovered the tragic news.

Ravenous football fans were greeted with an error message as they tried to order their dinner on the pizza giant's website.

It read: ""It's not you. It's us.

""Sorry guys we are having difficulties. Don't worry we'll be back online ASAP.""

Most of the nation's pizza lovers saw the funny side and took to Twitter to share their thoughts.

Zoe wrote: ""What are you doing to me?""

Doop just tweeted: ""Yo Domino's you okay hun?""

And Miss Oxfordshire quipped: ""Where are you now that I need you?""

And another account hilariously added: ""Dom the @Dominos_UK pizza tracking bot has clearly bailed on his shift to go and watch the England v Ukraine football match! Not good enough Dom.""

Angry fans will have been heartened by England's display however as they battered Ukraine 4-0 in Rome to book a Wembley semi-final with Denmark on Wednesday night.

A Domino’s delivery driver has been served up a slice of reality after claiming he’d been robbed of his takings at knifepoint.

Colin McKenna 45 pretended he was the victim of an armed robbery while out delivering pizzas in Renfrew so he could trouser the cash.

Sobbing McKenna who was working as delivery driver for Domino’s at Bridgewater Shopping Centre in Erskine told his boss his takings had been snatched along with his tips.

He claimed a raider had entered his motor held a knife against his throat and robbed him of the cash.

Procurator fiscal depute Sean Docherty told the court McKenna should have had £92.72 in takings as well as tips on him on the evening in question.

He said: “The accused made delivery to a customer named Lewis for which he received payment of £20.99.

“At around 9.15pm after making that delivery he contacted the shop manager to say he had been robbed at knifepoint by an unknown male.

“The unknown male had made off with the shop takings and the tips.

“He arrived back at the shop where he was crying and was shaking.

“His employer contacted police to report the matter.”

The court heard McKenna was visited at his home by cops probing the armed robbery when his story fell apart and he confessed he had “made the whole thing up”.

The prosecutor added: “Police launched an investigation during which they contacted the accused at his home address.

“The accused appeared agitated and he was nervous.

“He told officers he was lying and had made the whole thing up.

“He also handed over the cash to police.”

McKenna of Port Glasgow pleaded guilty to a charge of wasting police time by making false claims on the evening of June 29 2019.

He also admitted a second charge of stealing £92.72 from Domino’s.

Defence agent Terry Gallanagh described his client’s actions as “sheer folly”.

He said: “He had clearly not thought this matter through.

“But he accepted full responsibility for it to police and before the court at an early opportunity.

“He is fully remorseful for engaging in this conduct and says he feels wholly contrite.”

Mr Gallanagh added McKenna had committed the offence after suffering a family bereavement and was feeling depressed.

He urged the court to show him leniency given his plea of guilty and demonstration of remorse.

Sheriff Tom McCartney told him: “Causing police officers to be diverted from their proper duties and responsibilities is always regarded as a serious matter and often results in a sentence of imprisonment.

“But it appears to me this incident was very much out of character.

“So I am prepared to deal with this offence by the imposition of a fine which will reflect the gravity of the offence.”

He fined McKenna £1200 reduced from £1800 because of his pleas of guilty."

We can do better,"Editor’s Note: Mark Wolfe is an economist specializing in income inequality and serves as the director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Record-breaking temperatures are starting to become the new normal. Just last week Portland reached 116 degrees Seattle reached 108 degrees and British Columbia reached 121 degrees. And the extreme heat could last until mid-July in some areas.

Heat waves are a major cause of weather-related deaths in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there were an average of 702 heat-related deaths annually from 2004 to 2018. And just last week hundreds of reported deaths were believed to be related to the heat wave. The National Weather Service advises that one of the best ways to cool down during an excessive heat event unsurprisingly is an air conditioner.

That’s fine if you can afford the bill.

But many Americans cannot. While utility companies scramble to keep up with increasing demand for cooling some low-income families cannot even afford the cost of an air conditioner let alone the cost of the electricity needed to power the unit. That means the nation’s most vulnerable families are at a high risk for heat-related illnesses. The federal government and state governments must do more to ensure low-income Americans have access to air conditioning.

When families struggle to pay their energy bills they are forced to choose between paying to keep their electricity on or buying food medicine or other essentials. The other option is to not turn on their air conditioner potentially putting them at a serious health risk. Elderly Americans who have no other income beyond Social Security are particularly at risk. After they pay for rent food and other essentials they have little money left over to keep their homes at a safe temperature.

The small solution the country has now isn’t great. Low-income Americans can shelter in locally designated cooling centers until the temperatures drop but many shelters have limited capacity because of pandemic regulations. It’s also morally wrong — why should a family lose all privacy just because they do not earn enough money to pay their energy bills?

There are better solutions. First we need to make sure that all low-income families have access to cooling in their homes. When families were asked to shelter-in-place during the pandemic last year New York City purchased 74000 air conditioners for low-income seniors. The city also provided supplemental funding to help families pay for the electricity to operate their air conditioners. Local governments across the country should implement similar programs immediately.

Second Congress needs to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help the most vulnerable afford to keep their homes cool and livable during these historic heat waves. LIHEAP is a federal program designed to help families pay their heating and cooling bills and provide basic weatherization services. My organization the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) represents the state LIHEAP directors and we use these funds to help more than six million eligible families annually improving public health outcomes.

While heat waves have increased the need for cooling assistance in recent years annual funding for LIHEAP decreased from $5.1 billion in federal fiscal year (FFY) 2009 to $3.7 billion in 2021 causing the program to serve many fewer people than are eligible. Congress should immediately increase funding for LIHEAP to the fully authorized level of $5.1 billion as a first step to help families buy air conditioners and pay for their operating costs.

Heat waves are a public health issue. And no family should be forced to leave their homes and move to a cooling center just because they cannot afford air conditioning.

The Cyberspace Administration of China on Sunday banned Didi from app stores after saying it posed a cybersecurity risk for customers.

“Didi Chuxing app is found to have severely violated the laws by illegally collecting and using personal information” the regulator said. It called on Didi to fix the issue with its app to comply with the country’s laws and to ensure its customers’ safety.

The company which has 377 million active users in China alone said in a statement it is complying with China’s demands pulling the app from stores as it works to make changes to its app to satisfy regulators. Didi said customers and drivers who have already downloaded the app will be able to continue to use it.

“We sincerely thank the … department for its instruction in troubleshooting Didi’s risks” the company said. “We will rectify and improve risk avoidance and … provide safe and convenient services to our users.”

The ban comes less than a week after Didi went public on the New York Stock Exchange in the biggest US share offering by a Chinese company since Alibaba debuted in 2014.

Just two days later on Friday China suspended the registration of new users on the app. The suspension was put in place “to prevent the expansion of risk” during a “cybersecurity review” into the company according to a statement from the country’s cyberspace administration. The company’s stock price tumbled Friday.

Sunday’s ban represents an escalation of China’s action against Didi but it’s part of a larger crackdown on Big Tech companies in China.

In March Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the need to regulate “platform” companies businesses that offer online services for customers in the country. Several tech companies in the past few months have faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behavior or breaches of customer rights leading to record fines and massive overhauls.

Several tech companies in the past few months have faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behavior or breaches of customer rights leading to record fines and massive overhauls. Chinese President Xi Jinping has endorsed the probes setting regulatory crackdowns as one of the country’s top priorities in 2021 and he has continued to call on regulators to scrutinize tech companies.

In April Alibaba (BABA) the online shopping giant co-founded by Jack Ma was fined a record $2.8 billion after antitrust regulators concluded the company had behaved like a monopoly. Days after the fine was issued Ant Group another part of Jack Ma’s business empire was ordered to to overhaul its operations and become a financial holding company supervised by the central bank.

Following these crackdowns China’s State Administration for Market Regulation gathered 34 companies and issued a warning to stop any anti-competitive behavior and ordered internal inspections. Didi was among the summoned companies.

Special to the Post

Once again a landowner and Century Village residents in suburban West Palm Beach are wrangling over the future development of a defunct golf course immediately south of the sprawling retirement community.

Vehement objections were par for the course previously. But what a difference a decade makes.

The Palm Beach Zoning Commission unanimously recommended Thursday that the County Commission allow revisions to a plan it approved for the Turtle Bay Country Club golf course site years ago following a hearing that lasted only an hour and was notable for its decorum.

“I think there’s a recognition that there is a need for development” said Donald Foster property manager at the United Civic Organization of Century Village an umbrella organization for the numerous condominium associations within the 7854-unit complex on Haverhill Road north of Okeechobee Boulevard.

“We have concerns that will be addressed” Foster said. “It’s a process.”

It’s been a long process that may have an end in sight. At a series of public hearings from 2011 to 2013 residents vociferously objected to plans for a mixed-use development that included 689 housing units plus an assisted-living facility a civic center and 84500 square feet of shops and offices on the 70-acre site.

Hundreds of people packed the governmental center in downtown West Palm Beach in 2013 as a divided County Commission ultimately approved the proposal. Residents sued in vain to stop the project.

Since then the landowner Fairways LLC has abandoned many aspects of that plan and sought the zoning commission’s approval Thursday for the latest version. Four to five dozen Century Village residents showed up too but only a handful spoke. Another 27 people wrote to oppose the plan and 11 wrote in support.

The Turtle Bay Golf Course adjacent to Century Village closed in 2009. Today it is an expanse of sabal palms pine trees live oaks red maple strangler figs and overgrown grasses and weeds.

The latest iteration of the proposed development called Reflection Bay is for 707 townhouse units on 57 acres with 4 acres set aside for recreation and a neighborhood park of a little more than a half-acre. It will be built by D.R. Horton Inc. if green-lighted. The range of prices is wide going from roughly $166000 to $308000 depending on the unit.

The roughly 13-acre plot not included from the earlier approved plan is on a parallel but slower regulatory path A lake and a passive park are envisioned there.

The development approved earlier included homes townhomes and apartments. Now the landowner proposes only townhomes. Senior site planner Ryan Vandenburg recommended that the zoning commission require at least one other housing type be included to avoid a “cookie-cutter design.”

The commission didn’t require that and the project’s representative Jeff Brophy said afterward that only townhouses will be built. He noted that the plan approved years ago allowed building heights of five stories and nothing will exceed two stories now.

The townhomes will include 31 units designated as workforce housing for households having 60 percent to 140 percent of the area’s median family income. The 2020 area median family income for a family of four was $79100 according to county planners.

How many trees will remain standing on the site if the townhouses are built is an open question. The county’s Environmental Resource Management department says two in particular are worth saving — a live oak thought to be more than 100 years old and a large ficus.

Among Century Village residents’ other concerns are traffic and the need for a buffer from a development west of the condominiums.

The planned changes are projected to result in 5175 net vehicle trips compared to 10238 under the old plan Brophy said.

The amended plan also calls for a 6-foot opaque wall or fence along the west property line and an additional 80 feet beyond this buffer as open space.

“With the reduction in traffic by half and the height reduction … I can see why there is not the level of opposition it had” Brophy said after Thursday’s hearing. The goal now he added is to meet with Century Village residents and present the revised project to the County Commission on July 22.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The timeline if approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission would move up the closure of the J.H. Campbell Generating Plant in Port Sheldon Township by 15 years.

While environmental activists are pleased with Consumers' announcement local officials are adjusting to a timeline which will be a major change for the community. The plant is the largest source of tax revenue for Port Sheldon Township and the Grand Haven Area Public School District.

Those tax payments will not disappear completely and the property where the plant sits at 17000 Croswell St. will remain valuable but officials will need to begin planning for the repercussions.

""It took us by quite a surprise"" Port Sheldon Township Supervisor Howard Baumann said of Consumers' announcement. ""Just three years ago we were meeting with them and they were looking at closing Units 1 and 2 in 2031 and Unit 3 even later than that.""

The plant makes up nearly 30 percent of the township's tax base Baumann said.

It also employs 310 workers.

Consumers said it plans to work with plant employees to find other jobs within the company and work with area leaders to mitigate the effect of the closure.

""As we have done with previous coal plant closures we will continue to exercise care with both our co-workers and communities as we transition through plant closure and retirement once the Michigan Public Service Commission gives us a final order on the filing"" the company's West Michigan spokesman Joshua Paciorek said in an email.

""We’ll also support Port Sheldon Township (Campbell) Hampton Township (Karn) and those communities and their respective regions by re-imagining the local economic landscapes after the plants are retired.""

The township and Ottawa County have been discussing redevelopment possibilities for years.

""We have been for a long time looking at the potential use for a continuation of the trailway along Pigeon Creek and Pigeon River to Lake Michigan"" said Roger Bergman chair of the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners. Bergman represents parts of Grand Haven Township and the city of Grand Haven Spring Lake Township and the city of Ferrysburg.

""Long term we're thinking in terms of how we can use the property for the public to have access to the waterfront area.""

Consumers is the county's largest taxpayer with a total assessed valuation of $486.5 million 4.1 percent of the county's total assessed value according to 2019 figures. That includes Consumers' Campbell power plant and the company's Zeeland Generating Station.

Bergman said the county has also been looking at which parts of land could become housing or other private development to restore some of the lost tax base.

""Consumers is a pretty good size chunk of Grand Haven (Area) Public Schools' budget"" Bergman said. He represents parts of Grand Haven Township and the city of Grand Haven Spring Lake Township and the city of Ferrysburg.

Township and county leadership were encouraged by the energy company's outreach in the past and its promise to work with them on redevelopment plans.

""Consumers Energy has been a very good corporate citizen"" Bergman said. ""They have put their best foot forward in trying to help us look at the future and what that might mean.""

HBPW also affected

Holland Board of Public Works will also feel the ripples of the retirement of Unit 3 in which the city-owned utility has a life-of-plant contract for 11 megawatts of power. Unit 3 was previously scheduled to retire in 2040.

HBPW and nine other public utilities bought stakes in Unit 3 of the coal-fired power plant in 1979 through the Michigan Public Power Agency a joint action agency that facilitates power buys for Michigan's publicly owned utilities. MPPA has about 5 percent ownership in Campbell Unit 3.

The news of the Campbell plant closure was welcomed by climate activist Laura Judge who said she hopes it spurs more investment in renewable energy by the Holland Board of Public Works.

""While the Consumer's Energy announcement is a very lucky and welcome break for Holland in the shorter term they should start now to aggressively plan to totally transition away from natural gas and toward a carbon-free net-zero goal for 2050 and half their carbon dioxide emissions from 2030 to 2040"" she said.

When the Campbell plant closes it will leave one remaining coal plant in the city's portfolio of energy sources: DTE's Belle River Power Plant. HBPW has an ownership stake in Belle River's Units 1 and 2 for 36 megawatts of power through the MPPA.

""The opening of Holland Energy Park in 2017 was a big step away from coal and toward a cleaner future"" said Peter Boogaart a member of the Holland chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby.

""Nevertheless the HBPW's portfolio still contained coal through its legacy contracts with Campbell and Belle Isle. The closing of the Campbell facility is another step in the right direction and a major assist in meeting our Community Energy Plan goal.""

""Given the rapidity with which Consumers Energy moved to drop its coal fired-power production one has to wonder if the market pressure just shifted to DTE. Will DTE close the Bell Isle plant ahead of the announced 2030 closing date? If DTE moves early the HBPW will need a plan to replace that capacity too.""

The city-owned utility meets the majority of its energy needs through the natural-gas-powered Holland Energy Park. Natural gas burning releases about half of the carbon emissions that coal does though Boogaart and other Holland climate activists would like to see Holland end all use of fossil fuels.

About 15 percent of Holland's power comes from renewable sources such as landfill gas wind and as of December solar. The city also recently approved two new contracts for additional solar power.

Consumers which serves more than 100000 customers in Ottawa County said in the news conference the transition to clean energy would save customers $650 million by 2040 compared to their current trajectory.

The energy company said it would use its existing natural gas plants including the plant in Zeeland and buy four additional natural gas plants elsewhere in Michigan to continue to meet power demand during the transition away from coal.

Nuguse ran a time of 3:36.19 in the 1500 meter final to finish third claiming the final team spot as he punched his ticket to Tokyo.

What You Need To Know Yared Nuguse DuPont Manual grad and University of Notre Dame track and cross county star is heading to Tokyo



Nuguse makes first Olympic team finishing 3rd in the 1500 meters at the Olympic Trials



He hopes to run professionally after college



The Tokyo Olympics is set to begin July 23 2021

The DuPont Manual alum and Notre Dame track star has been crushing the record books since his sophomore year of high school. Nuguse is known for his legendary kick which helped him get a spot on the 2021 Olympic team.

“At first I was like I need to position myself to be where I want to be because if I want to be able to kick I have to be up close to the front so I have a shot at winning. Then coming around that last 200 I was where I wanted to be and I just started going and at that point there's almost nothing going through your head you're just like run run run” Nuguse said.

Nuguse has a list of accomplishments that go on and on: 6 high school state championships NCAA record holder in the 1500 meters 2021's 1500 meter ACC champion 2021 cross country All-American and 2020-2021 ACC cross country runner of the year just to name a few.

But the one that takes the gold? Qualifying for his first Olympic team.

“It's still a little unreal I guess. I mean I know it happened but it doesn't feel like it really did so i’m just taking it in. I’ll probably get to Tokyo and be like an Olympian I'll come to terms with that but it's still just an unreal moment” Nuguse said.

Something that would have never been possible without the help of Tim Holman Yared’s high school coach at Manual.

“He didn't run cross country his freshman year. A PE teacher told me 'Hey I got this kid he ran a decent mile in PE.' So I hunted him down and found him in class and asked him 'What do you do here at school?' He famously said 'Science fairs sir.' And I said 'No no what sport?' and he had been bowling but I said I think you need to come run for me” Holman remarked.

As Nuguse embarks on this new journey he is reminded of how it all started.

“Probably one of the best decisions I've made in my life just deciding to go run for Holman because that's really just what started everything and I definitely wouldn't have gotten started without his kind of push to get me there” Nuguse said.

Yared Nuguse will use his COVID year to finish his last year at the University of Notre Dame. Nuguse plans to run professionally in the future and make another Olympic appearance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmVnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NsZWFyLWxha2Utd2F0ZXItbGV2ZWxzLW5vdC1hLWNvbmNlcm4vYXJ0aWNsZV8zMDM3YWU2Yi1hYjE4LTU1MTktYTZiYi1jZDMxZTc1MTRiNTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clear Lake water levels 'not a concern',"Concerns about the water levels in Clear Lake were raised last week when many could see that the water levels were well below average for Clear Lake.

But according to Scott Grummer a fisheries biologist for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources the water levels at Clear Lake at least for now are not a reason for concern.

“The concern sets in when it’s feet below (the lake spillway levels) not inches” Grummer said. “So it’s not a significant concern at this moment.”

Grummer said that the rainfall from last week has already done a lot to rectify the situation and calm those concerned.

“Before the rainfall last weekend we were around six inches below the lake outlet level” Grummer said. “But after the rain from last weekend we are within two inches.”

Drought conditions may not have had a considerable impact on Clear Lake but it has plagued other Iowa areas to a much more significant level. According to Grummer at Spirit Lake in western Iowa the lake is around 16 to 17 inches below the outlet level.

While Clear Lake may not be suffering from the same water deficits as others it is notable that the water levels are significantly down over the same 30-day time span compared to last year. At this time in 2020 the water level at Clear Lake was nearly three inches above the outlet level compared to two inches below in 2021.

This is in line with statewide drought conditions where the entirety of North Iowa has been suffering from some level of drought conditions this summer.

According to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship 85 percent of the state is suffering from some level of drought conditions.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reports that as of Tuesday June 29 18.11 percent of the state is experiencing ""abnormally dry"" conditions 31.87 percent is experiencing moderate drought conditions and 35.62 percent experiencing severe drought conditions.

Exceptionally dry conditions persist across Iowa The heat is on in Iowa with nearly 90 percent of the state experiencing some degree of drought according to the latest update issued by a coalition of state and federal agencies.

The last time Clear Lake suffered significant water level loss was in 2012 when the water levels reached 30 inches below the lake outlet level according to Grummer.

It’s unclear what the water levels in Clear Lake will look like over the rest of the summer but Grummer says that hoping for additional rain is all anyone can do at the moment.

“If we don’t continue to get rain then those water levels may be something to keep an eye on” Grummer said.

Below-average water levels when at even lower levels can also cause harm to aquatic plants and dry out streams.

If rain is hard to come by over the coming months the water levels at Clear Lake may start to drop as a result. Declining water levels can lead to difficulties for Clear Lake residents and visitors like boat loading and unloading zones becoming more challenging to use and raised docks becoming unusable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2d0by5jb20vZWF0X2RyaW5rLzIwMjEvMDcvbGUtcGFyYWRpcy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXRvcm9udG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,French restaurant has survived 34 years hidden away on a side street in Toronto,"A little restaurant on a side street in Toronto has survived for 34 years despite its slightly obscure location and the shifting times.

Le Paradis is a French bistro that opened up on the little stretch of Bedford that's tucked between Davenport and Dupont in 1986.

Current owner David Currie was only a part owner at that time and it was actually his partner who Currie says was ""keen on the side street"" joking he's ""still stuck there"" over three decades later.

He had previously been involved at Panache on Yonge and actually liked the main street that he ended up leaving.

It was around 1990 that he bought out his partner assuming full control of Le Paradis. Currie tells blogTO it would have been too expensive to move the restaurant over all these years.

The 110-seat restaurant is known for classic French fare the menu these days consisting of iconic items like boeuf a la bourguignonne cuisses de canard aux cerises and onglet au poivre (hanger steak with peppercorn sauce) all of which have been made available for takeout.

The boeuf a la bourguignonne and some other items like ratatouille have also been made available in heat-and-serve form.

The hanger is something that's always been on the menu though when the restaurant first opened they were able capitalize on cheaper prices for ingredients needed for French cooking like hanger steak kidney sweetbreads or flank steak.

Some ingredients that might go for around $10 a pound now cost closer to $1.99 a pound around 20 or 30 years ago.

This in turn was reflected in the menu prices and despite their out-of-the-way location the restaurant found success with a reputation as ""the cheapest place in an affluent neighbourhood"" according to Currie.

Prices when Le Paradis first opened hovered around $10 their most expensive items topping out at around $14.

The place also became popular with students because of its affordability as well as people seeking a true French bistro experience.

This combined with the reputation he already had based on the success of Panache helped skyrocket Le Paradis to popularity even if some of the eager patrons weren't always prepared for the kidneys and sweetbreads that awaited them.

""We weren't for fussy eaters back then. We never served pasta or other standards"" says Currie.

""In our heyday people would line up for a long time to get inside then realize 'I don't want to eat any of these things.'""

Currie says over time the menu ""became less hardcore"" out of necessity due to aging clientele and the way their staff changed over the years.

In the 1980s and 1990s most chefs had learned the basics of French cooking whereas now it's less common and harder to find someone with that background.

The unexpected nature of the menu at Le Paradis would become something that helped it survive over the years perpetually changing and drawing people back to the restaurant every single day.

""A huge amount of the neighbourhood would eat there Monday to Thursday"" says Currie.

Currie also says there used to be more of a culture of going out for dinner not only before but after events like hockey games concerts and theatre shows and Le Paradis developed a relationship with Tarragon over the years.

It's rarer for people to go out to dinner after events these days and of course there haven't been many events to speak of lately.

Currie says there was ""all of a sudden no business plan"" for a bistro that had never done takeout when the pandemic hit and restaurants were locked down.

He says during the first lockdown the restaurant was doing about 20 per cent of its normal business.

Currie says it's also been tough staffing the restaurant since ""so many people won't come back.""

However in a nutshell Currie says he really didn't want to walk away from the business after hanging on for so long. Also moving would be very expensive and it's not like the demand for Le Paradis isn't there.

Currie says he could seat 500 people a night if it were humanly possible based on the demand for reservations.

When they opened the patio up the first day it was allowed in 2021 Le Paradis was serving 120 people a night which Currie still had to cut back on to avoid staff burnout.

He's continuing to run the restaurant to try and pay off debts from the pandemic but says of a return to business as usual ""until we get there there's no possibiliy to catch up.""

Even indoors a banquette that could normally seat 14 only seats 8 with social distancing a room that seats 40 normally only seating 12.

In the meantime Currie says Le Paradis has an ""incredible customer base"" even though they ""don't know when they'll allowed to welcome them back to the business again.""",,,,,,

Keeping close to the bull Rich zigged zagged and managed to stay out of harm’s way during his three 40-second performances.

“I tell you what that was probably the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me. I started this last year during COVID and I didn’t fight in front of any crowds” the 19-year old Rich said. “So heck this was exciting.”

Rich’s next bullfighting adventure will take him to Kansas.

“I’d like to be an NFR bullfighter and cowboy protector” Rich said when asked about what his career aspirations are.

While Rich managed to keep away from the angry bull three other contestants weren’t so lucky.

In the first round Kirk Cowen from New Mexico was tossed in the air several times by his bull before the bullfighter managed to dive over the fence to safety. Cowen stood bent over behind the gate trying to regain his wits before heading to the staging area behind the arena.

The chute’s gate barely opened before Texas bullfighter Alex Parades’s bull charged at the man taking him down and seriously hurting him.

As other bullfighting contestants rushed into the ring to take the bull’s attention off of Parades rodeo staff and paramedics worked to assess Parades as he was lying on the ground.

Montana bullfighter Kyle Olsen made it to the second round of the competition before his bull bolted out of the chute and stomped him. Bent over his face visibly showing pain Olsen scuttled to safety where again paramedics assessed his condition.

Other bullfighters that participated in the event included:

Colton Orcutt from Kersey

Lane Dorr from Texas

Dexton Draper from Utah

Blake Starret from Oklahoma

The sport of American Bullfighting pits men against Mexican fighting bulls. The bulls are quite a bit smaller than the bulls used in bull riding but they are much meaner.

“Can you imagine if the big bulls were as mean as these guys?” a wrangler asked his fellow cowboy while watching the bulls being loaded into the chutes.

During their performances bullfighters try to stay as close to the bull as possible touching its horns and head while twisting and turning around the arena. Some bullfighters ratchet things up a notch and jump over the bulls or try to place their hat on a bull’s head.

Points are accrued by how well the bullfighter performs as well as how the bull performs.

The bulls definitely had a mind of their own during Saturday’s event as the pickup men often had to rope the bulls to get them back into the pen. At times the feisty bulls would go after the men’s horses.

Between bouts JC and the Revolvers band entertained the audience. Singer Jesse Cornett even participated in the action by crawling into a big blowup bubble contraption for a beer run contest.

While Cornett’s partner shuttled glasses of beer from a bucket to a pitcher Cornett had to fend off not only other human competitors but an angry bull as well. During the contest the bull was rolling Cornett tucked up tight inside his bubble around the arena.

“I talked to Ken Rich before the show and I thought he was kind of joking when he said ‘You’ve rodeoed you can get in there” Cornett said in an interview with the Greeley Stampede. “I thought ‘We will see.’ Then I got called out there. I was in the bubble and I’ve got hit by bulls before and I was thinking ‘Oh no oh no’.”

After walking away unharmed Cornett took to the stage to finish out his set with the band.

A couple got the fright of their lives after a huge bull confronted them in the middle of a country road.

Tina O’Neill and her partner Ken Fuller took refuge in their car on Thursday afternoon when the massive animal burst through a field fence in Castle Eaton Wiltshire.

It then proceeded to roam around the country lane bellowing and snacking on the verge.

Posting pictures of the raging bull on Facebook Ms O’Neill 44 said: ‘When you get trapped in the car because this beast has escaped from the field.’

Luckily the farmer was alerted and arrived to put the big lad back in his field.

Describing the experience Ms O’Neil from Swindon added: ‘We were on our way back from Stanton Park getting pictures of dragonflies as we’ve started doing wildlife photography.

‘On the way home I saw him (the bull) and said how massive he was so my partner said: “Do you want to go get a photo?”

‘So we reversed back to the field where he was but just as I took one photo he then went barging towards the fence.’

He did not look happy (swns)

The farmer eventually came to collect his boy (swns)

MS O’Neil said: ‘We heard the fence break so my partner got out and went up to the farmer’s house to get help but no one was about.

‘So we drove back onto the road – we were face to face with bully!

‘Another driver passed and said he knew the farmer and would go make some calls. So we sat for about 20/30 minutes to wait for the farmer to come rescue us and put him back in the field.

‘Not something we planned on bumping into.’

However the company said they only knew of two positive tests no-one had been put at extra risk and they had taken all possible measures to keep their staff safe.

The source told the Press: ""Last Thursday one of the workers was showing symptoms so they brought in lateral flow tests.

""All the office staff took them and she came back positive but continued to stay at work for a good three-to-four hours.

""Apparently they were too busy to send her home.

""She took a second test and that came back positive too. Since then three other folk have tested positive.

""Only one of them put everyone down as a close contact but I don't think test and trace has actually contacted anyone.""

The source said fewer than 20 people work at the Pitreavie centre and share facilities such as the canteen.

They added: ""You read the stuff in the Press about PJs and Lorenzo's that have shut and had to get deep-cleaned I don't know if they're doing that here.

""The suggestion is they want to keep the garage open.""

However group operations manager Stephen Fells told the Press: ""That information is not correct. We had one confirmed case where a worker got tested at home and never came in.

""He called and informed us of the positive test and as a result we carried out lateral flow tests on site.

""One of the tests came back inconclusive so she took another test and it came back positive.

""We sent her straight home as well as two other people who were negative but were close contacts.

""We won't allow them back until it's safe to do so not just for the people that are off but we need to look after the people that are in too.

""It's left us short on the admin side but we're trying to cover with the resources we have.""

He added: ""Staff are a big part of our business we couldn't do anything without them so we've had staggered starts finishes and breaks and done everything to accommodate them to try and keep them safe at work.

""We've had regular visits across the group by health and safety to check on our cleaning stations risk assessments and procedures and always had very good feedback.

""An inspector was at Dunfermline on Friday and gave the manager the thumbs-up.

""Infections are on the increase in society in general but we haven't slackened off in any way and are still sticking to the measures we brought in in March 2020.""

L & I Eaton was established in Manchester in 1953 and they have 11 accident repair centres across the UK including the site at Pitreavie Business Park."

The former World Champion earned his stripes even before walking into the WWE; his Olympic gold medal putting him in the upper echelon of American athlete. With accolades like these its safe to say that Angle’s wrestling gear is nothing short of sacred.

The iconic Kurt Angle singlet remained a staple throughout his career. It bridged Angle’s experience in amateur wrestling and his new career in pro wrestling. Add to that the mouth guard and you have a look that would make any opponent think twice before stepping into the ring with the Wrestling Machine.

However Angle revealed he gave away most of his ring gear to charity. Although this upset his wife Giovanna she came up with a unique way to get some of his wrestling artifacts back. On the Kurt Angle Show the Hall of Famer revealed how his wife is buying his old merchandise back on eBay.

“I kind of messed up- I didn’t mess up- I gave away most of my gear to charities and Hall of Fame’s. You know I was never a keepsake kinda person. My wife is so I got a lot of heat from her when she said ‘Where is all your ring gear?’ and I said I gave it all away years ago.”

“She’s like “Why would you do that? You gotta keep all that stuff. What about our kids? They’re gonna wanna know who their dad was and how good he was back in the day. Why would you give away your gear? So she started buying it back on eBay. So I’m buying gear like T-shirts and singlets and stuff. She’s just trying to get it all back and we’re just ordering whatever we can to try and buy it back.

“I don’t have a lot of T-shirts that WWE and TNA made of me. So that’s what we’re buying back; we’re not really buying the ring gear back ’cause I gave that away. But the shirts and merchandise is what we’re buying.”

Where does Angle keep his gold medal?

via Imago 31 Jul 1996: Kurt Angle of the United States holds the American flag at the free-style wrestling competition during the Summer Olympics at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta Georgia.

On the show a fan asked Kurt where he kept his Olympic gold medal. Angle narrated an incident of how his kids dented the medal and how it isn’t really made of gold.

“Well I had an incident with my kids where they threw the medal into the wall and-the gold medal- part of it got dented so I keep it in my safe. No more kid time with the medal. I used to take it with me on appearances and show people but the gold starting wearing off. Believe it or not a gold medal is not really gold it’s silver.”

Fair to say if any man can take shots at the Olympics it’s one who won a gold medal. Kudos to Angle for taking care of his medal and keeping it out of danger. Of all the WWE Titles TNA Championships and IWGP belts he held the Olympic gold medal is probably his most prized possession.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvbWF0Y2hpbmctbnVtYmVycy0xOTY4LWRvZGdlLWNoYXJnZXItaGFzLWJlZW4tcm90dGluZy1pbi1hLWJhcm4tc2luY2UtMTk4OS0xNjQzNjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matching-Numbers 1968 Dodge Charger Has Been Rotting in a Barn Since 1989,"Dodge’s B-body Charger wasn’t exactly a match for the then-current Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro pony cars simply because it was larger. While initially the Chrysler B platform idea didn’t exactly take flight it was the second generation that paved the way for its eventual success and the fact that we’re still seeing Chargers in modern seventh-generation form to this very day.

For some the true Charger isn’t the current four-door sedan though. Instead it’s something that has vintage written all over it. Perhaps just like this 1968 Dodge Charger that’s currently on sale from eBay user chillman1173 for just a few more days (auction scheduled to close early Tuesday July 6th). Sure with this second-generation Charger looking to have spent a bunch of years in storage  maybe we’re dealing with more than a little patina here.According to the description provided by the seller (who counts himself as the car’s third owner) the Charger has been sitting parked since 1989 which was also the last time its cool 383ci (6.3-liter) engine was fired up. By the looks of it this one is a serious project car probably one that will never resemble Vin Diesel’s latest F9 hero Charger car the SpeedKore’s Hellacious But perhaps the new owner won’t go in that direction at all considering that save for a few ‘69 exterior modifications (owed to a 1970 accident and the scarcity of ‘68 parts) we’re dealing here with a highly original survivor . Apparently the engine and transmission numbers match the VIN meaning this could be one of just 259 cars optioned with the 383ci 4bbl V8 engine and the four-speed manual transmission not counting the exterior paint and interior options.It’s enticing enough for anyone with a knack for highly original survivors. Still this Charger will need a huge mechanical and cosmetic effort to get it running and looking prim and proper just the way it did back in the late 1960s. Still the interest seems high enough as the auction has already seen 37 bids with the current highest offer standing at $17900.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1mZXJyYXJpLTQ4OC1zcGlkZXItdnMtbWNsYXJlbi01NzBzLXNwaWRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auction Dilemma: Ferrari 488 Spider Vs McLaren 570S Spider ebay.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1mZXJyYXJpLTQ4OC1zcGlkZXItdnMtbWNsYXJlbi01NzBzLXNwaWRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9tb25leS8xNTQ3ODM2OC9yYXJlLTItZXJyb3ItY29pbi1iaWRkaW5nLXdhci1zcG90LWNoYW5nZS_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvbW9uZXkvMTU0NzgzNjgvcmFyZS0yLWVycm9yLWNvaW4tYmlkZGluZy13YXItc3BvdC1jaGFuZ2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare £2 error coin sells for £420 on eBay after massive bidding war – how to spot one in your change...,"All recommendations within this article are informed by expert editorial opinion.

THAT’S MINT Rare £2 error coin sells for £420 on eBay after massive bidding war – how to spot one in your change

A RARE £2 coin with a minting error on it has sold for £420 after collectors battled to bag it in a massive bidding war.

The coin which the seller claims was minted in 2010 has been struck twice on both sides.

This means that both designs on each face of the £2 coin have doubled up and “fallen off” the side.

On one face of the coin you can see the Queen’s head has been stamped twice and is not aligned in the centre.

While the other side which features the “Standing on the Shoulders of Giants” design also has the same minting error.

Coins with mistakes tend to be among the highest valued because of their extremely limited numbers.

3 Ten bidders locked horns for it Credit: eBay

3 One lucky collector scooped it up with just seconds to spare

They tend to be in demand with collectors because it's pretty rare if coins with an error make it into circulation.

Many will pay over the odds to get their hands on one and this particular £2 caught the eyes of 10 coin fanatics looking to get their hands on it.

The rare coin sparked a bidding frenzy on eBay with rivals locking horns until the very last seconds of the auction to bag it.

One lucky collector scooped it up with just 17 seconds to go with the winning bid of £420.

The seller said the £2 was in a box of coins they had received from a late relative who had passed their collection on.

The best way to find out if your error coin is genuine RARE and valuable coins can go for a hefty sum - but how do you know if your coin is the result of a genuine minting error? The best way to find out if you have an error coin is to send it to the Royal Mint museum which will analyse it and see if it is a result of a genuine minting error or not. It'll normally take a couple of weeks to get the results back to you. But remember there's a difference between a genuine error coin and one that is just imperfect for example with a design that is not as clear as you'd expect. And whatever you do don't be tempted to splash your cash without evidence from the Mint confirming that it's a genuine error.

They added that they have more coins to come with “several to list” over time.

But the best way to see if an error coin is genuine is to check whether the seller has sent it to the Royal Mint museum.

Coin boffins will analyse it to see if it is the result of a genuine minting mistake or not - as you’ll be surprised at how many fake coins are in circulation.

The Royal Mint manufactures between three million and four million coins a day so you can see why sometimes things go wrong and error coins enter into circulation.

When they do they can go for hundreds - this £2 with a similar minting error on it recently went for £138 on eBay.

While in February last year a mis-struck £1 coin which looked like a fried egg sold for £112.

If you notice your spare change looks different to what it’s supposed to you might want to keep hold of it and check out how much it could be worth on eBay.

You can also use an online tool called Coin Hunter which gives you an estimated valuation of your coin based on the average of the most recent sales as well as a range of how much you can expect it to fetch.

You can also check how much coins previously sold with the same or similar minting error have been sold for on eBay to give you an idea of pricing.

To do this search the full name of the coin select the ""sold"" listing and then toggle the search to ""highest value"".

It will give you an idea of the amount of money that the coin could go for.

THAT’S DANDY Old Beano or Dandy comics are selling for up to £2200 – how to spot them

IF you've got old Dandy and Beano comics hiding in your attic they could be worth a small fortune - even if they're not in mint condition.

Beano favourite Dennis the Menace reached his 70th birthday last week and collectors are spending up to £7000 to get their hands on rare editions.

11 Beano and Dandy comics lost in your storage could be worth hundreds if not thousands of pounds

Beano is now the longest-running UK comic strip and you can rake in the cash if you have some of the earliest issues or annuals.

Don't forget Dandy - the Beano's sister comic - either as these can also be worth a pretty penny.

Currently there are listings for rare editions costing up to £7000 but there's no guarantees people will pay that price.

To get a better sense of what you could earn the Sun trawled through recent completed eBay sales to see how much issues were sold for.

What makes a comic book valuable? COMICS aren't automatically worth a mint even if they are rare - there are certain things collectors will look for if you list one for sale. Malcolm Phillips of Comic Book Auctions reveals the top things to keep in mind if you're planning on selling. Mint condition: The better condition a comic the more money it'll sell for. Collectors are looking for clear crisp pages with as little discolouration as possible and with minimal rips.

The better condition a comic the more money it'll sell for. Collectors are looking for clear crisp pages with as little discolouration as possible and with minimal rips. Free gifts: A comic will double in value if it comes with its original free gift or pull-out. That's because so often the original owner would throw the freebie away making any extras a rare find.

A comic will double in value if it comes with its original free gift or pull-out. That's because so often the original owner would throw the freebie away making any extras a rare find. Number in existence: If few copies are known to still be doing the rounds of a particular comic this will likely increase it's value. I think I've got a rare comic - how do I sell it? If you've got a valuable comic you could try to sell it yourself on eBay. However it can be tricky to know how to price items and if you do an auction you run the risk of people not seeing it. If you have something very rare such as the first ever edition of the Beano you could also considering using an auction house such as Comic Book Auctions

Here's ten of the top recent sales for Beano and Dandy:

1940 Rare Beano Annual - £2200

11 This annual fetched £2200 on eBay

The highest recent sale we could find was a Beano annual which sold for a whopping £2200 online.

The rare annual was described as being in 'very good' condition with vibrant colours and no rips however the original owner's name and address is written in the front.

The issue reached its top price in a eBay auction earlier this month.

Beano comic #452 - £620

11 This comic sold for £620

The next highest sale price we found was a Beano issue #452 which first came out in 1961.

The issue is particularly special because it's the first time you get a glimpse of Dennis the Menace in the series.

It's a brief appearance and there's no sign of Gnasher Curly Pie Face stripy jumper catapult or pea shooter.

The issue had 31 bids before finally selling for £620 in June.

Beano comic #45 - £595

11 A seller got £595 for this issue on eBay

This issue is one of the earlier Beano comics making it far more rare than recent editions.

It was described as in 'fine condition' with just a small tear to the cover. Other than that the seller said it was in excellent condition externally and internally.

It sold for £595 in April this year.

Beano comic #49 - £595

11 This comic sold for £595 on eBay

This comic which was launched just three weeks after the one above also sold for £595.

It was listed by the same seller who also described it as being in fine condition.

There's no chance of seeing fan favourites Dennis and Gnasher as rare old issues were first sold long before he was introduced to the series.

1943 Beano Book - £525

11 This very worn annual sold for an astonishing £525

One lucky seller managed to sell this Beano annual for hundreds after finding it in his loft.

Despite visibly being in quite poor condition which rips and tears and fading six people bid on the book eventually stopping at £525.

Beano comic #84 - £495

11 This comic sold for £495 on eBay

This early edition comic sold for slightly less than others perhaps because it looks to be in worse condition or maybe because it was slightly later.

Even so the seller still managed to get £495 for it which means it's well worth checking your attics and lofts in case there are any forgotten about in storage.

Dandy Comic #30 - £392.94

11 This early Dandy comin was a real money spinner costing £292.94

This is one of the very early Dandy comics making it very rare. It came out over 70 years ago on June 25 1938.

The seller said it was in good condition complete with all its pages and that it had been kept out of direct sunlight meaning the colours are strong and bright.

There was some wearing with very small 1-2 mm rips in the opening spine margin and very light discolouration to the paper throughout.

It sold for £392.94 in April this year.

Beano comic #65 - £256.47

11 This Beano sold for £256.47

This Beano edition was really popular in its eBay auction attracting a whopping 41 bids in total.

It wasn't one of the highest amounts we've seen though eventually selling for just £256.47.

It was published on October 21 1939 during the second World War.

Dandy Book 1956 - £166

11 This annual sold for £166 on eBay

Despite being slightly newer and therefore less rare this Dandy annual sold for an impressive £166 after attracting 21 bids on eBay.

The seller said it might be unsold shop stock and was in one of the best conditions they have seen for older comics.

They wrote: ""we've sold 26 copies of this book in the past and this is the best by far and we should probably be keeping it for our own collection.

""It's possibly unsold shop stock indeed a previous owner has written that in pencil along with the year to the first page.""

Dandy Monster Comic Annual 1950 - £150

11 This annual sold for £150 online

Generally speaking Dandy comics tend to sell for less than Beanos but that doesn't mean it's not worth putting them on eBay.

This monster annual sold for £150 after 21 bids in May.

It was described as being in very good condition despite being well over 70 years old. In fact the journal was first published back in 1950.

When Morgan Wanek 14 of Plainfield surprised her grandmother with an illustration for her birthday she never dreamed it would win an an art contest.

But it did – and Morgan was featured in an Ecolab video because of it according to Morgan’s mother Tammy Wanek of Plainfield and an Ecolab employee.

Tammy said Ecolab is “huge” in supporting the military through its employee and their families. In that spirit Ecolab held an art contest for Memorial Day.

So Tammy asked Morgan if Morgan would like to submit her drawing of her great-grandfather Glen Meadows who was a staff sergeant in the Army during World War II Tammy said.

“Morgan loves drawing” Tammy said. “And she started doing it more and more during the pandemic.”

Morgan said she’s been drawing since at least the fourth grade because she was a winner for her school’s yearbook cover contest. She especially likes to draw people.

“I like to capture my own perspective of a person” Morgan said.

Morgan Wanek 14 of Plainfield drew this picture of her great-grandfather Glen Meadows who was a staff sergeant in the Army during World War II. Morgan presented it to her grandmother Nancy Murphy of Joliet (right) on her 70th birthday in March. Morgan's illustration won in Morgan's age group in an Ecolab art contest abour Memorial Day. (Photo provided)

Tammy said Morgan is also very good from drawing from memory. And so when Nancy Murray of Joliet Morgan’s grandmother was turning 70 in March Morgan surprised her with an illustration of Meadows Murray’s father which Morgan had drawn from memory.

“I knew how much she loved her father” Morgan said. “And I knew it would mean a lot to her if I did this.”

Morgan said Murray talks about Meadows all the time especially the way he supported her. Morgan completed the illustration in two days and was very surprised it later won a contest.

“I didn’t expect this to even happen to me” Morgan said.

Tammy said Morgan who will attend Joliet West High School in the fall also sings writes paints and plays the guitar. Morgan previously ttended schools in Troy Community Consolidated School District 30-C.

Morgan would encourage anyone who wants to draw to do so.

“I think it’s really a great way to express yourself and share your own ideas” Morgan said.

But don’t get discouraged if drawings are imperfect at first.

“Just keep drawing” Morgan said. “You’ll keep getting better.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The round was led by 415 CAPITAL a specialist VC firm that primarily backs innovative medical technology companies in the cardio-and neurovascular space. The round was joined by an unnamed global strategic leader in structural heart interventions and a group of Israeli angel investors.

Headquartered in Yokneam Cardiac Success was founded in 2017 in the Alon Medtech Ventures’ incubator by serial entrepreneur Dr. Shimon Eckhouse and Dr. David Neustadter (Chief Technology Officer). The company’s management team includes Boaz Manash (CEO) an experienced R&D leader previously responsible for the Sapien M3 mitral valve program at Edwards Lifesciences and Prof. Rafael Beyar (Chief Medical Officer) an internationally-recognized cardiologist and former director of Rambam Medical Center.

Despite guidance-directed medical therapy heart failure continues to be a serious and common health condition that affects millions of patients and carries high rates of rehospitalizations and deaths. Cardiac Success has developed the “V-sling” system which aims to provide a new treatment approach by transforming an invasive open-heart surgery into a safe and effective minimally-invasive transcatheter procedure. Using the “V-sling” may significantly improve patients’ quality of life while reducing hospitalization time and costs.

""There are millions of patients who despite guidance-directed medical therapy continue to suffer and deteriorate from Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)"" said Boaz Manash CEO of Cardiac Success. “This new funding from experienced investors and strategic partners in the cardiac field shows their confidence in the “V-sling” system and will enable us to accelerate our clinical development to provide a treatment option for these heart failure patients.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately one hour ago Respawn Entertainment published a fix that it believed would resolve the issue. An hour has passed and the Apex Legends developer has happily confirmed that the game has resumed normal operations.

""We’ve confirmed that matchmaking has been restored"" read a tweet from Respawn updating players on the situation. ""We’re keeping an eye on things but believe the issue to be resolved. Thanks for your patience Legends.""

Our original story continues below.

An Apex Legends hack is currently underway disabling the ability to play the game on PC and consoles and highlighting the ""Save Titanfall"" campaign which raises issues with Respawn's previous games.

Apex Legends is a Battle Royale game created by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It's proven to be fairly popular and has been running for well over two years now. Unfortunately the Titanfall games that came before it aren't doing too well — and now a hacker has taken the initiative to bring attention to this problem by hacking the game itself.

What's Going On With the Apex Legends Hack?

I couldn't view the Apex Legends hack after first booting the game. However playing and completing one match revealed the above message which directs people to the ""Save Titanfall"" website — the homage page for the ""Operation Red Tape"" Titanfall initiative.

Following the completion of a match the hack displays an ""Important message"" which implores people to visit the Save Titanfall website. The ability to queue for a game is then replaced with a ""Save Titanfall"" message as shown on the bottom left of the below screenshot.

The Apex Legends hack isn't just changing some text however — players affected by the hack are unable to queue for a new game after this message is displayed.

I tested it out myself and got the exact same results as other players have reported:

Sure enough I was unable to actually queue for anything after clicking on the ""Save Titanfall"" button on the bottom left. Restarting the game didn't help either — once this message appears it seems that you're locked out of playing Apex Legends entirely.

This Apex Legends hack is not just on PC either. Early reporting on Reddit has some players stating that they have not been affected by this issue. However a recent update from Dexerto's Apex Legends News Twitter account is reporting that players on Xbox are beginning to see the message and a subsequent report notes that it has spread to PlayStation too.

'Operation Red Tape' Denies Association with 'Save Titanfall' Apex Legends Hack

The Apex Legends hack is certainly troublesome especially for people who were hoping to enjoy their July 4th with some games. The entire point of it is to direct people towards the Save Titanfall campaign so we went ahead and checked it out.

Before we go on it's important to note that the Save Titanfall campaign has flatly denied any association with the Apex Legends hack in a message posted to the top of its website:

IMPORTANT MESSAGE This website nor the Discord servers listed below are in no way associated with the recent Apex Legends hack.

In addition to the above message one of the group's Discord server admins released a public statement on the group's Discord server explaining the situation.

Titanfall 1 seems to be currently in a playable state at the moment. Enjoy playing it while it lasts. However do not get fooled. Respawn has nothing to do with it and they did not fix any issues. It has happened numerous times before – whenever our cause goes into [the] spotlight for any reason and everyone's looking the attacker takes down his bots for a while as a means of self-preservation. It's worth [noting] that at the same time Titanfall 2 is still under [attack]. I want to say that we are not the people/server behind the Apex situation and the messages you have seen directing you here and we don't know who it is. It appears that someone did want to spread the info about [the] Titanfall situation and we feel them we want to play our game again as well. Our site is probably the best source of information packed into one place so it's probably logical they have selected that one to link with such [a] goal in mind. So please don't be angry at us those who are. While this was [pretty] surprising news to us in the morning we would like to welcome all the new players and express a hope that Titanfall will soon be in [better] condition and that you will stay with us while awaiting that to happen. Make sure to pick platform roles to see the rest of the server if you want to play with us. We're sorry though for any Apex players who were unable to play their game in this situation. This should be possible to mitigate by selecting a different data center in case it's happening to you. At the same time please imagine that we've been dealing with something worse for [the] past three years most of the time being unable to play our game Titanfall 1 at all with no workarounds possible anymore. The servers were and are taken hostage by a hacker and his friends out of hatred towards our community and Respawn fails to do anything about it despite fixes and exploits used being so trivial (yet there's many of them – it's what you get if you fix none of them). Spread the word there is no excuse for letting this happen knowingly for 3 years meanwhile releasing the game on Steam and putting it on numerous sales like nothing's wrong while people who buy the game can only watch the main menu screen since it's [an] online-only game. TLDR:

~ welcome everyone new

~ we are not the people behind [the] Apex situation (also raiding/spamming won't help will only get you banned)

~ Titanfall 1 is currently temporarily playable for now but not thanks to Respawn

~ stick with us for more news in the future

It should be noted that the Apex Legends hack appears to have been recently updated with a message from the hacker denying any association with the website. We've reached out to EA the Save Titanfall campaign and the hacker for comment and will update this article when we receive a reply.

The Save Titanfall campaign aims to bring attention to the state of Respawn Entertainment's earlier game Titanfall the same universe that gave birth to Apex Legends. The game is doing fine on consoles but the PC version reportedly has a bunch of issues including rampant DDOSing of servers and hackers in the game.

The campaign takes issue with the fact that Respawn and EA are still selling Titanfall despite these issues making it wholly unplayable in multiplayer for some players. This is supported by several links at the bottom of the website which highlight players who have repeatedly reported these problems to both Respawn and EA seemingly with no response. The lack of communication however was partially resolved when Respawn Entertainment publicly commented on the matter back in early April 2021.

""We're aware of ongoing DDOS attacks affecting [Titanfall]"" read a tweet from Respawn Entertainment. ""To the Titanfall community: Help is coming ASAP.""

Since then however there hasn't been much in the way of public commentary on the matter presumably because Respawn is still working on correcting the issue. Neither Respawn Entertainment EA Help nor the public Apex Legends social media accounts have commented as of yet on this ongoing hack. We have yet to discover any working solution for the current issue with Apex Legends either; it seems that anyone who wants to play the game will have to wait until Respawn and EA resolve the problem on their end.

For now you can check out the Save Titanfall website to learn more about the issue that was apparently a driving force behind today's Apex Legends hack. You can play Apex Legends for free on PC and consoles via its official website and you can purchase the Apex Legends Champion Edition for PC via Steam for $27.99 a 30% discount as part of the Steam Summer Sale.

Update (07/04/21 4:47 PM ET) – Respawn Entertainment has put out a tweet acknowledging the issue and stating that they are working to resolve the problem.

""We are aware of and actively investigating issues impacting [Apex Legends] playlists that are preventing players from getting into matches"" read the tweet.

Update (07/04/21 7:15 PM ET) – There's another update from Respawn about the Apex Legends hack. While the servers are still not yet online Respawn has determined that players' personal information or accounts are not at risk.

""We’re testing a fix now and will update when we have more confidence"" read a follow-up tweet. ""Additional updates may be required. ""In the meantime we’ve determined that this attack—while disruptive—has not put players’ personal information or accounts at risk. More updates to come as we make progress.""

BioWare and Electronic Arts announced that Legacy of the Sith will be released later this year. This is only the beginning of the celebration for the 10th anniversary of the highly successful Star Wars MMO according to BioWare.

Some of the more in-depth changes coming to the Star Wars MMO include getting the overall level cap a boost to a much-needed 80. And for those wanting more co-op missions you will be in luck as they will be including not only more co-op missions for Legacy of the Sith but also a new Flashpoint. Combat Styles will be something all players old and new will have to get accustomed to. BioWare explains them as such:

Combat Styles will allow players to fulfill their ultimate Star Wars fantasy independently choosing a specific class story and combining it with ability sets from other related tech or force wielding classes. Existing returning and new players can look forward to improvements in creating their next Star Wars character through a refactored character creation system. In addition updates to itemization and loadout experiences as well as streamlined class design further enhances the Star Wars: The Old Republic experience for new returning and existing players”

Beyond those fun things BioWare is also looking to tune up its character creator and make the overall gameplay experience even better. Although there is no official release date keep your eyes peeled for a winter/holiday release.

Legacy of the Sith Narrative

The expansion will not be doing much as far as adding anything important to the narrative already established in Star Wars: The Old Republic. You’ll still need to track down Darth Malgus but now you can do it with a higher-level cap and a battle style of your own choosing.

Star Wars: The Old Republic is available exclusively on PC."

Fun fact about yourself: I enjoy working on my family’s farm comprised primarily of vineyards in southwest Michigan.

Undergraduate School and Degree: University of Notre Dame Finance

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? Eli Lilly and Company Senior Financial Analyst

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? DuPont Management Leadership Development Program (MLDP) Intern

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School:

Dean’s Fellow (full tuition scholarship provided based upon work experience test scores undergraduate performance leadership potential and admissions interview);

Board Fellow Bloomington Community Orchard;

MBA Admissions Counselor

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I am most proud of a successful client engagement delivered through the Global Business and Social Enterprise (GLOBASE) program. Through GLOBASE Kelleys help small organizations across Africa Asia and Latin America to solve challenges grow and prosper. My team of three classmates and I engaged with Flying Squirrel Outfitters (FSO) based in Chiang Mai Thailand.

Flying Squirrel Outfitters produces sustainably handmade hammocks and custom tote bags. FSO provides professional and economic empowerment to women in rural Thailand which inspired and motivated the efforts of my team. During our partnership with FSO we built trust with the entrepreneur (Brian) dove into the details pieced together incomplete pieces of data (which is common to these projects) and crystallized the problem.

We ultimately discovered that Brian needed a stronger understanding of his costs and margins and thus built a flexible framework that allows him to negotiate effectively. We are confident that higher realized prices will improve livelihoods for both Brian and the women whom he employs.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? My impact upon people has been and always will be the yardstick with which I measure the success of my career. I am most proud of an experience during which I supervised and mentored a summer intern at Eli Lilly. The intern Ashley arrived at Lilly with basic Excel skills. This was an unforeseen challenge as her project involved some complicated spreadsheet modelling and even VBA. The situation could have been debilitating if not for a powerful tool: my professional network. With my guidance Ashley navigated the complex Lilly structure built relationships with IT and technical experts and got the help she needed. Her project yielded 160 hours of savings across the finance organization and was lauded by the vice president as an exceptional outcome. Most satisfying to me Ashley left this note on my desk: “Thanks for being the best boss.”

Why did you choose this business school? I was looking for a business school at which I felt a high level of ‘personal touch.’ I reasoned “If a personal touch is evident while I am only a candidate the school must devote that much more individualized attention and resources to its actual students!” A conversation that I had with Dean Idie Kesner sealed the deal. The call was scheduled for a Tuesday evening around 7pm. Little did I know however that Dean Kesner had just flown around the world after a trip to China and she was fighting jetlag and a busy schedule to speak with me. Dean Kesner graciously answered my questions and discussed her vision for the program. However my decision had already been cemented. Her personal sacrifice made her the type of leader I wanted to follow and I checked ‘Accept’ for Kelley.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? The “Kelley Clap” is lived every day perhaps every hour at Kelley. At the end of every class session my classmates and I break into applause. This is not to convey some fleeting enthusiasm or to signal our relief that the class session is over. Rather the Kelley Clap is a recognition of the learning that has taken place within the classroom. The tradition is linked to beloved professor Walt Blacconiere who passed away in 2007 from pancreatic cancer. Professor Blacconiere ended each class with the Clap and it now persists across Kelley as a nod to our status as a community of learners.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I would retain stronger confidence that it is possible to find a post-MBA role that simultaneously has a direct impact upon the community leverages one’s MBA and pays a competitive MBA salary. It is easy to view post-MBA career paths as ones of compromise. One might think “I’d like to have a mission- or service-based job but then I won’t make any money.” Alternatively “The corporate job sounds great but I’m not that close to the community.” I was tempted to think in those ways but ultimately found a full-time role — through Kelley recruiting — with the Department of Justice. As a special advisor I will engage on high-impact projects and will rotate through a leadership development program. I am thrilled about this role. However had I been more confident from the start in the availability of mission-based employment I could have networked in a more focused manner and developed deeper connections.

What is the biggest myth about your school? Given that Kelley is nestled in southern Indiana it is easy to view us as a regional “Midwestern school.” Nothing could be further from the truth. The largest proportion of domestic first-year students (24%) actually hail from the West Coast and Southwest; the proportion of first years from the Midwest is 22%. Furthermore one of Kelley’s top hiring companies in terms of absolute number of students is Amazon.

What surprised you the most about business school? The relationship between professors and students is highly collegial. I suppose that I had been expecting a continuation of the ‘undergraduate’ model in which students appear for a lecture and then file out at its conclusion. Instead it is extremely rare for a Kelley class to end without the professor and an MBA interacting afterward whether to relate a professional experience clarify a point or show a card trick (yes this has happened). Furthermore Kelley professors have met us out for dinner participated in charity auctions and even attended morning workouts at 6am. They respect us as colleagues and we respect them for their expertise humility and commitment to our success.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I am fastidious about my preparation so I maintained a document of potential questions and answers that was 20 pages long. Many of the prep questions were derived from interviews I had had with other schools. I do not recommend memorizing stories or answers but my preparation gave me confidence in my recall and in my ability to shape a particular anecdote to fit the question at hand.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I most admire Turner Wadington. Turner is a smart guy. Before Kelley he spent 4-plus years at a communications firm in Chicago. Following graduation he will be pivoting to healthcare. What is most impressive about Turner however is the way in which he treats others. My classmates would agree that Turner is the “nicest guy in the program” and the epitome of a Kelley. He is always patient in his listening never quick to judge and consistently supportive in his outlook. Turner is someone to whom you gravitate and who reliably puts a smile on your face. He has the full package of hard and soft skills and I am certain will achieve great success.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? The shift has been minimally disruptive. Though Kelley has pursued the hybrid modality the level of collaboration expected for each class has not diminished nor has the quality or quantity of work. In fact because Kelley has a smaller class size the first-year students were able to complete the Integrated Core effectively in-person and all of my elective classes this quarter are also in-person. Kelley benefits from the strength of its Kelley Direct program which is a top-rated online MBA. Because there are crossovers among the faculty who teach in the Kelley Full Time and Kelley Direct programs there was a pre-existing level of comfortability with the online environment. In addition I would be remiss if I did not mention the grace and humor with which my professors have handled COVID-related challenges. They navigate technological snafus with patience keep an eye on the Zoom chat box and sometimes give us a hard time when we forget to un-mute our microphone.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My father was my primary motivation. He has worked in sports marketing for most of his career and his personal triple bottom line is: “What do I get to do who do I get to do it for and who do I get to do it with?” Restated this reads “Do I enjoy my specific role do the values of the organization align with my own and do I work with great colleagues?” These questions rang true to me in college and still do because they capture the key components of a job: the mission the values and the people. Perhaps they aren’t unique to business but my father’s experience taught me that I could pursue and fulfill them all with a business degree.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

* The first is to be an executive who continues to reset expectations and norms for what an executive “should be like.” I plan to drive my current car until it dies regardless of my income; to sit with different colleagues of all levels at lunch; and to keep an open door as much as possible throughout the day. I strive to be the person who knows everyone by his or her first name from the janitor to the CEO. Servant leadership is something deeply engrained within me.

* Second I would like to help a person to advance in his or her career who otherwise wouldn’t have had the opportunity. Professor Scott Laughner encouraged us to do this in the closing remarks of his class and I found it to be profound. It takes special attention to see the overlooked potential in someone and courage to put one’s reputation on the line as a strong advocate. I hope to have that opportunity.

What made Jake such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“We saw Jake’s potential from the start and awarded him our prestigious Dean’s Fellowship an award that recognizes exceptional candidates with demonstrated academic and leadership accomplishments who also exhibit the potential for continued success. Through his tenure as an MBA student Jake has strived for excellence while truly demonstrating the qualities we value at Kelley: the talent to succeed the humility to grow and the tenacity to persevere.

Jake has always been passionate about helping others. From the start he shared with us his desire to be a business leader who gives back and develops the people around him. He has certainly made an impact at Kelley becoming a student ambassador (a “Hoosier Host”) while also proving to be an outstanding student—an academic leader in the classroom. As he completed his first year Jake was selected as a student member of the admissions team. Rarely have I met a student willing to give so much time and energy towards supporting prospective students and helping us recruit the next entering class. Jake counsels prospective MBA students conducts admission interviews and reads applications as a full member of the Admissions Committee. His candidate evaluations are insightful and on target. He continues to perform above and beyond expectations. Jake is playing a major role in shaping the next entering class.

I’m proud that Jake’s desire to give back to the community and make an impact will continue when he begins his post-MBA career in internal consulting and leadership development. In whatever he does I’m confident that Jake will continue to make a positive difference just as he has at Kelley.”

Ce premier bâtiment du genre vise une autonomie annuelle en énergie de 70 % une réduction de 2/3 de la consommation d’eau issue du réseau de ville et une réduction de 40 % des ordures ménagères.

Pour ce faire le bâtiment produit et stocke l’eau et l’énergie nécessaires à ses habitants :

– l’électricité produite par la ferme solaire gérée par GEG ENeR est stockée dans des batteries pour être disponible le soir lorsque les habitants sont présents dans leurs logements ;

– Une partie de l’énergie nécessaire aux habitants est également récupérée sur les eaux grises recyclées et utilisées pour les toilettes et les espaces communs tandis que l’eau de pluie est récoltée potabilisée et utilisée pour les logements. Ce dispositif s’appuie sur une centrale de traitement de l’eau mise en place par les équipes de Suez.

Deux ans de travaux ont été nécessaires pour mettre en œuvre cette idée de bâtiment autonome. Pour le rendre efficient de nombreuses technologies innovantes ont été intégrées que ce soit dans sa conception (isolant liège Weber béton bas carbone Vicat ferme solaire composée de 688 panneaux photovoltaïques triple vitrage etc.) que dans la vie quotidienne de ses utilisateurs (radiateurs à batteries Lancey des douches à recyclage application de suivi des consommations appareils électroménagers A+++ etc.).

À la suite de cette livraison les équipes suivront et analyseront durant cinq ans le fonctionnement du démonstrateur et les usages des habitants de la résidence ABC avec l’appui du pôle Expérience Client et de l’Observatoire des usages de Bouygues Bâtiment France Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Favorite Actionable Advice

Don’t follow trends: Your content should be unique and that requires doing what works for both you and your audience.

Your content should be unique and that requires doing what works for both you and your audience. Post consistently: To monetize your content you should publish it regularly to manage your audience’s expectations.

To monetize your content you should publish it regularly to manage your audience’s expectations. Make your ice cream: Tyler gained traction when she illustrated characters from the show Parks and Rec as ice cream types. Think about how to tie your content to a bigger picture.

The Story

Relatability online isn’t always about showing your face. Sometimes it’s about sharing your story. Illustrator Tyler Feder has found a way to share the most vulnerable moments in her life through her art and it’s landed her tens of thousands of dedicated fans and a handful of book deals.

For Tyler success came when she started sharing her passion online even though she wasn’t necessarily expecting it. “Ever since I was a little kid art was always my special ‘thing’” she says. “In elementary school so many kids would ask me to draw stuff for them that the teacher had to put a stop to it because it was disrupting class. In high school I took as many art classes as I could fit into my schedule. Drawing was my favorite thing to do but I never thought of it as something that could be a career. It was just a hobby.”

Her hobby found a platform when Tyler began sharing her illustrations on Tumblr. That was long before she made the leap to Instagram and eventually monetized her content established a client base and accepted publishing opportunities to create a content business.

Much of her work follows Tyler’s own experience with mental health grief body acceptance and being a woman in her 30s navigating the ever-changing world. While her content is often specific to her own life Tyler’s posts are relatable. A quick scroll through the comments on nearly any picture proves how Tyler has captured her audience: sharing the raw parts of herself as she meets them and allowing the world to be her mirror.

Unexpected hit

Tyler hasn’t forgotten her first viral moment. A stroke of luck and a post that hit the heartstrings of television workplace comedy fans started it all. “My big career aspiration at the time was to write for TV and I was taking classes at Second City. I came home from a particularly hard class one day feeling really down about myself and I drew this silly doodle of each main character on Parks and Recreation represented by a type of ice cream” Tyler says.

“When I posted it on Tumblr it immediately got shared around way more than any of the other art I’d done. I started making similar food-themed illustrations for other TV shows and most of them did similarly well. Selling prints of them gave me a real boost both financially and psychologically.”

Tyler’s story is proof of how much good social media can do. After her digital illustration company Roaring Softly took off online Tyler connected with Penguin Random House where she’s published two books. Released in 2020 Dancing at the Pity Party takes a close look at the loss of Tyler’s mother her battle with cancer and Tyler’s life as a grown woman looking back. It’s a guide to grief for young adults without demanding immediate healing. The message translates to what may be the best part of Tyler’s online presence: She accepts and welcomes each viewer for exactly who they are no matter what they’re going through.

In June she released a children’s book Bodies Are Cool which tackles body positivity and is designed for kids of all ages. Tyler worked intently writing the content and illustrating to represent a variety of body shapes skin colors abilities and more. Readers can see themselves on the pages.

Advice for content entrepreneurs

Tyler reminds content entrepreneurs that it takes time to find success from posting their art online. “Don’t get discouraged if it feels like you’re shouting into the void” she says. “If you keep trying maybe eventually the void will shout back.

“Don’t make art that doesn’t feel authentic to you. It’s no fun it’s not sustainable and art that you enjoy making has an extra spark to it that audiences can sense” she said. “When I started posting my art on Tumblr I was trying all these things that I thought were trendy and no one was biting. When I started drawing things that appealed to my own tastes that’s when I slowly started to gain traction.”

She continues “The advice I always give artists looking to monetize their work is to post lots of [content] online as consistently as possible. You never know what’s going to resonate with people and the internet is unpredictable. Every single career opportunity I’ve gotten has resulted from some nice person seeing my art on the internet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbXBlci5jb20vcGFyZW50aW5nL3BvcHVsYXItbnVyc2VyeS10aGVtZXMtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Popular 2021 Nursery Themes & Colors,"Designing your baby’s room is one of the most joyful parts of pregnancy. Everything from who your baby will look like to sometimes even their name and sex feels so mysterious during those nine months and designing a space you love just for them (and honestly for you too) is a way to picture your little one in the world. If you’re in the process of planning your baby’s room (or if you just like to be in-the-know because nurseries are so dang cute) then check out these popular nursery themes colors and design elements for 2021.

I spoke with Etsy Trend Expert Dayna Isom Johnson and Naomi Coe founder of Little Crown Interiors and author of Your Perfect Nursery: A Step-By-Step Guide For Creating The Nursery Of Your Dreams about their predictions for popular nursery themes. If you’re wary of ideas that seem trendy or super current try them out in a small way that lets you change it up as your baby grows. “You can layer them in using decor and accessories that are easy to replace in coming years. That way you can avoid going overboard with a trend or theme and also avoid spending a ton of money on something you might get sick of in a few years” Coe says. “The nursery is the perfect place to experiment!”

Outer Space Etsy Outer space decor is about to create some out of this world nurseries. “I predicted that outer space motifs would be a huge kids trend in 2021 – from room decor to clothing and everything in-between – and parents prepping or revamping their nurseries this year have definitely caught on” Isom Johnson tells Romper. “At Etsy we’ve seen a 77% increase in searches for space-themed wallpaper and a 24% increase in searches for moon-shaped shelves in the last three months [in comparison to last year at the same time].”

Safari Little Hands Wallpaper Lions and tigers and bears oh my; safari themes have arrived. “An emerging trend I’m seeing on the rise is safari nursery decor” Isom Johnson tells Romper. There’s been a 46% increase in searches for safari-themed baby mobiles in the last three months compared to the same time last year she says which she foresees continuing to grow in popularity through 2022. If you want to try this trend without going the wallpaper route try a safari-theme rug some framed pictures of animals a cute mobile or crib bedding.

Removable Wallpaper Removable wallpaper in the nursery is a trend that’s been around for awhile but it doesn’t show signs of going out any time soon. “Every year there are more and more wallpaper companies that make removable wallpaper and my clients are loving it” Coe tells Romper. “With so much emphasis on the home coming out of Covid removable wallpaper is a fairly inexpensive and easy way to really have some fun with a design but without the commitment of regular wallpaper” she adds. Removable wallpaper is a good option too if you’re opting for a trendier motif or something that looks young because it can be cleanly removed down the line without wrecking the walls.

Soft Layered Texture Shada Bahu-Loh Soft neutrals and cozy textured elements seem to have replaced geometric prints and black and white motifs at least for now. “2021 seems to be all about coziness and texture. I’ve been getting a lot more requests for nurseries with woven accents” Coe tells Romper. I love how the painted arch above creates soft layered dimension. To add comfy inviting texture try a glider or pillows in a boucle fabric (which is also big right now) woven wall hangings a fuzzy mobile or a shaggy kid-friendly rug.

Butterflies Butterfly decor in baby nurseries may be the next big thing. Coe says she’s been getting a lot of requests for butterfly nurseries and Pinterest Trend Tracker shows searches for “butterfly nursery” are steadily on the rise. This is a theme that could go bold with a wallpaper or a mural or stay understated with a mobile or a few decals.

Lavender Mauve & Blush Walls Pehr Neutrals don’t always have to mean white beige and gray. “Neutrals and light wood tones have been very popular this year” Coe tells Romper. “Whereas the past few years have been more about bright crisp whites more people are choosing to warm things up a bit with soft layered neutrals instead. I’ve also been using more lavender and mauve tones but the blush trend is still going strong!” Choosing a paint color for the nursery can be tricky and don’t be afraid to buy several sample sizes and try each color on the wall (which is almost always more accurate than the paint chips). Check the colors at different times of day too including nighttime when you’ll be in the nursery oh you know a lot.

Sculptural Shapes Little Crown Interiors The art deco influence has been popping up in everything from sculptural candles to rounded furniture so it makes sense that it would make its way into baby nurseries too. “In general most nursery clients seem to be moving away from ultra modern and are instead looking to achieve that comforting appeal with layers of soft texture and sculptural shapes” Coe tells Romper. This 1920s-inspired glamorous and sometimes bold look translates into nurseries in the form of oval cribs sculptural gliders gilded accents or arched mirrors and shelves. Instead of leaning fully into the theme you could take aspects like the rounded rocker and luxe table in the photo above (captured by David Casas and designed by Little Crown Interiors).

Nature & Greenery Shutterstock Plants are a beautiful way to add a bit of the outdoors into your baby’s nursery. “I’ve been getting a lot more requests for nurseries with touches of nature and greenery” Coe tells Romper. You could get a house plant for their room though a hanging or a faux plant is probably best if you want to avoid dirt getting all over the floor the second your baby becomes mobile. You can also opt for a leafy wallpaper floral touches or nature-inspired art.

If you’re hoping to create a kid’s bedroom that feels timeless and inviting “I suggest opting for nursery decor that easily transitions into their child’s toddler years and beyond” Isom Johnson tells Romper. “Try natural wood accents a chic play mat or kid-friendly boho rug muted shades instead of a bold color scheme and adaptable furniture that ages with their children.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9nYXJhZ2Utc2FsZS15YXJkLXNhbGUtdGlwcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tips for a Successful Garage Sale,"Q: We’re moving and have so much stuff to get rid of. Is it worth the effort to hold a yard sale? And how do we make sure it’s not a dud?

A: This may be a banger year for yard sales and if you put the time into setting yours up right you could have success. “There are avid garage-sale people who do this every weekend” said Ava Seavey who owns the website GarageSaleGold.com. “They have pent-up energy to do this because they couldn’t do this for a year because of the pandemic.”

Here are some ways to help make yours succeed.

Consider your inventory: Before you commit to a sale look at what you actually have. Yard sales work best if you have a variety of stuff to appeal to a wide range of shoppers — do-it-yourselfers looking for tools young parents looking for baby gear antiquers on the hunt for funky finds. If your goods are limited consider asking a neighbor (or a few neighbors) to join you for a group sale. A multifamily sale has other benefits too. It’s easier to spread the word and you can set up the sale at the busiest location.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3R3aXR0ZXItaXMtbG92aW5nLXRoaXMtc3VwZXItY3V0ZS1mbG93ZXItc2hhcGVkLWNhdC10cmVlLTM2OTQ0NTQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter Is Loving This Super Cute Flower-Shaped Cat Tree,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/twitter-is-loving-this-super-cute-flower-shaped-cat-tree-36944544 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3R3aXR0ZXItaXMtbG92aW5nLXRoaXMtc3VwZXItY3V0ZS1mbG93ZXItc2hhcGVkLWNhdC10cmVlLTM2OTQ0NTQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The musician 40 and the former Coronation Street actress 37 shared the news shortly after they got engaged and bought a new home together.

Everest told Hello! magazine: “We know we’re very lucky.

“With the new house the engagement and the baby we feel very blessed.”

Darren Everest and Rhea Bailey (Hello!/PA)

The couple have said they plan to have the baby at home following the example of Bailey’s sister the singer Corinne Bailey Rae.

Bailey who played Caz Hammond in the ITV soap said: “My sister had two really successful home births with an independent midwife and she had really beautiful experiences.

“I wanted to have a similar experience and statistically it’s actually safer to have your baby at home.

“It can usually reduce the amount of time you’re in labour as well so that was really appealing to me plus Darren gets to be with me the whole time.

“Corinne has been encouraging me and guiding me and we’re using the same independent midwife team.

“Our kids will be close in age so we are excited about that; it will be nice to have cousin playmates.”

The couple  who first met at a birthday party thrown for Bailey’s former Coronation Street co-star Kym Marsh got engaged in March when they moved into their first home together and Everest said: “We can all get this idea of perfection when you want it to be at sunset on a lake etc.

“But the perfect moment was just us being in our new house with the dog at the start of a new journey.”

Bailey added: “There was this beautiful big red bow around the house.

“Darren gave me a massive bouquet of flowers and he had had two champagne flutes engraved with our names and the date.

“We opened the champagne and he started talking about our relationship and then he started quivering! I was wondering why and then he got down on one knee.

“I just burst into tears – we were just both completely overcome with emotion.”

However the new Vette can do more than just beat up on European nameplates – it can also perform well in the real world as you know a car. As such we’re taking a closer look at the Corvette C8 Stingray’s available cargo room specifically how it compares to the available trunk room of the front-engined Corvette C7.

To find out GM Authority Executive Editor Alex Luft is putting the Corvette C8 Stingray alongside a Corvette C7 for a direct hands-on comparison test. The whole thing is captured in the following 4-minute 17-second video.

First things first we get a look at all the cargo packed into the rear of the C7 Corvette where Luft has two carry-on bags an enormous sports bag stuffed with hockey gear and two hockey sticks (incredibly Luft still has all his teeth). Notably the hockey sticks don’t intrude into the passenger compartment and all the gear mentioned fits neatly under the C7’s hatch.

Taking the gear out Luft then lifts the rear engine cover on the Corvette C8 Stingray and attempts to fit as much of it as possible into the mid-engine sports car’s rear cargo area. Unsurprisingly only some of the items make it specifically the two carry-ons while the hockey bag and hockey sticks do not. While there is some space leftover around the two carry-ons the majority of the Corvette C8 Stingray rear cargo area is occupied. Meanwhile the front trunk (or “funk”) isn’t large enough to fit the remaining pieces.

Nevertheless the Corvette C8 Stingray’s frunk is far from useless offering enough space for some ski boots or a standard carry-on bag.

To note the Corvette C8 Stingray offers a total of 12.6 cubic-feet of cargo room (including both the front and rear cargo compartments) whereas the Corvette C7 offers 15 cubic-feet of cargo room.

Apropos of nothing here's Bill Nye extolling the wonders of offshore oil drilling in the Disney World ride Ellen's Energy Adventure which was sponsored by ExxonMobil pic.twitter.com/HMpa7QnjoN — Peter🌲Brannen (@PeterBrannen1) July 3 2021

In the video shared on Saturday on Twitter by writer Peter Brannen the two celebs can be seen going on a fantastical adventure flying through the sky and plunging under the water to see an offshore drilling rig. (The ride sponsored by Exxon through at least 2004 closed in 2017.)

“Many of the easily reached petroleum deposits have been tapped” says Mr Nye whose work on projects like his television show “Bill Nye Saves The World” often touches on the climate crisis. “Most new discoveries will come from ones in inaccessible or hard-to-reach places.”

Ellen frets that undersea oil is hard to reach but Mr Nye reassures her: “Oh hey don’t give up. We can reach the oil with offshore drilling platforms like this!”

Later in the video from the pavilion which began in 1996 Ellen asks about “global warming”.

“It’s a hot topic with lots of questions” Mr Nye responds before pointing to natural gas as promising because it’s “clean burning” even though gas leaks often release methane a super-charged greenhouse gas far more dangerous than carbon.

Representatives for Disney Exxon Ellen and Mr Nye did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.

The video is not the oil company’s first attempt to reach the thousands of young people who visit Disney World each year.

In 1985 Gizmodo reported Disney and Exxon partnered on a comic book called Mickey and Goofy Explore The Universe of Energy at Epcot Energy in 1985 about the need to seek out new fossil fuel sources. In it they mention the port of Valdez in Alaska the site of one of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 one of the largest in US history. Exxon knew about the threat of the climate crisis as early as the 1970s reporting has revealed and it became widely known in the late 1980s thanks to the 1988 congressional testimony of James Hansen and other efforts.

Still the company spent decades refusing to publicly acknowledge the climate crisis and funded misinformation efforts about the topic according to Scientific American.

(Chevron Australia) as operator and the Gorgon joint venture participants will proceed with the approximately $4-billion (AU$6 billion) Jansz-Io Compression (J-IC) project.

Jansz-Io will be the first gas field outside Norway where the subsea compression technology comes to use. It is located around 200 kilometers off the Australian north-west coast at a water depth of approximately 1350 meters (4429 feet).

The J-IC Project objective is to unlock low pressure reserves from the Jansz-Io reservoir and maintain plateau production rates to the Gorgon Project facilities on Barrow Island (BWI).





A modification of the existing Gorgon development J-IC will involve the construction and installation of a 27000-tonne normally unattended floating Field Control Station (FCS) approximately 6500 tonnes of subsea compression infrastructure and a 135km submarine power cable linked to Barrow Island.





Construction and installation activities are estimated to take approximately five years to complete.

Nigel Hearne Chevron Eurasia Pacific Exploration and Production president said J-IC represents Chevron’s most significant capital investment in Australia since the sanctioning of the Gorgon Stage 2 project in 2018.

Using world-leading subsea compression technology J-IC is positioned to maintain gas supply from the Jansz-Io field to the three existing LNG trains and domestic gas plant on Barrow Island. This will maintain an important source of clean-burning natural gas to customers that will enable energy transitions in countries across the Asia Pacific region. —Nigel Hearne

J-IC follows the Gorgon Stage 2 project which is nearing completion of the installation phase to supply gas to the Gorgon plant from four new Jansz-Io and seven new Gorgon wells.

The Chevron-operated Gorgon Project is a joint venture between the Australian subsidiaries of Chevron (47.333%) ExxonMobil (25%) Shell (25%) Osaka Gas (1.25%) Tokyo Gas (1%) and JERA (0.417%).",,,,,,

July 4 falls on a Sunday this year meaning no work the following day. (Call it a National Hangover Day if you’d like.)

It’s a holiday that goes hand in hand with grilling lounging by the pool and spending the day with friends—especially after forgoing the latter last year. But if you’ve got business to conduct or errands to run it can be a bit challenging to get all of those things done.

As more and more retailers struggle with staffing issues store closures are going to be more prevalent this year—and will often take place on a case-by-case basis rather than a companywide one. Many stores likely will offer reduced hours to manage the issue. And some essential services as you might guess will be closed on the holiday and the day after.

Here’s a look at what stores and services will be open as you prep the fireworks in 2021.

Are banks open on July 4 and July 5?

July 4 falls on a Sunday this year so of course banks will be closed that day. Because it’s a federal holiday though banks will also be closed on Monday the 5th. As always you can use ATM machines to get cash or put money into your account.

Will there be any mail delivery on July 4 and July 5?

Just like banks mail service doesn’t run on Sundays. UPS and FedEx normally don’t make deliveries that day either—so don’t expect to receive any packages on July 4. (UPS will also close its UPS Store locations for the holiday.)

On July 5 the U.S. Postal Service along with UPS will observe the holiday and not offer delivery service. (UPS Express Critical is still available though.) UPS stores will be open. FedEx plans to offer Ground and Home delivery (though FedEx Express will not be delivered). And FedEx Office Print & Ship Centers will be open both days with modified hours.

Is the stock market open on July 4 and July 5?

Nope. The New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq and bond markets are all closed. They’ll reopen Tuesday July 6.

Which department stores are closed for Independence Day?

In a normal year July 4 is primetime for seasonal sales—especially furniture. But 2021 is not exactly normal. Retailers and restaurants are struggling to find employees so many locations will be closed even if their parent chains are technically open. Others simply like to give their employees a chance to relax. Costco will be closed on the holiday. And many locally owned small businesses that might normally be open on Sunday may choose to take the day off as well though fewer will opt to be closed on Monday.

A FedEx Express MD-10 had a runway excursion while landing in Indianapolis. As a result both the plane and the runway suffered some damage.

The occurrence happened on Thursday the 1st of July. The MD-10 crew were landing on runway 32 at Indianapolis International (KIND). They were performing flight FX-1601 from Dallas Fort Worth (KDFW). The landing took place at 1:47am local time in heavy rain/thunderstorm conditions. It appears that weather played a key role in this event.

This is the METAR from the time of this accident:

KIND 010544Z 25005KT 1 3/4SM R05L/4500VP6000FT +TSRA BR BKN009 BKN055CB OVC060 23/23 A3000 RMK AO2 LTG DSNT SW AND W TSB21 OCNL LTGICCC OHD TS OHD MOV E P0004 T02330228=

After vacating the runway the MD-10 crew advised the tower that there had been heavy rain on final approach and landing. At this time it appears that they did not mention a runway excursion. The tower cleared more aircraft to land at runway 32. But it appears that subsequent inspections on the MD-10 and/or the runway showed the trouble the crew had.

MD-10 Runway Excursion – FAA Statement

The next day the FAA released this report:

“AIRCRAFT LANDED AND VEERED OFF RUNWAY AND A FLAP WAS DISCOVERED ON THE RUNWAY AS WELL AS MISSING PAVEMENT INDIANAPOLIS IN.”

However it seems that it took several hours before authorities realized what happened to the MD-10 and the runway. A NOTAM in the evening of July 1st indicated the closure of the runway. More NOTAMs came the following day (Friday). They informed crews that the ILS PAPI lights and the approach lights for runway 32 are inoperable.

At this time there is little information about where on the runway the event happened. As of this writing the FedEx MD-10 in this runway excursion accident is still on the ground in Indianapolis. The aircraft with tail number N313FE started life as a DC-10-30F. It left the factory a bit over 33 years ago in 1988. FedEx has been its only operator over its time in commercial service.

As we saw recently the ‘MD-10’ designation refers to aircraft that have undergone substantial flight deck upgrades to bring them closer to MD-11 standard. The MD-10 in this runway excursion accident got its upgrade in 2009. FedEx intends to retire the remaining MD-10-30F aircraft in its fleet by 2023.

Danial Sebhatu scored in his professional debut while Darwin Matheus netted his first goal of the season.





Atlanta controlled possession early in the match and saw an early opportunity in the third minute when Caleb Wiley drove to the end line and served a cross to an open Robbie Mertz but the midfielder placed the ball too high over the goal.





However Memphis found the back of the net first in the 21st minute. Andre Reynolds played a through ball to Kyle Murphy who poked it past Alec Kann and finished the play on an open net. A few minutes later in the 27th minute Murphy tallied his second goal for Memphis when the ball fell right to his feet near the top of the six-yard box.





Before the conclusion of the first half a scuffle and some words were shared between the two clubs which resulted in red cards for Matías Benítez and Mark Segbers as well as a yellow card for Kann. Both sides entered the second half with ten men on the field.





ATL UTD 2 began to chip away Memphis’s two-goal lead with a goal of its own in the 54th minute. Aiden McFadden drove down the right flank and sent in a cross. Brady Scott tried to punch the ball away but he misplayed the ball and it hit off the chest of Raul Gonzalez and fell to Sebhatu. The 16-year-old forward hammered home a left-footed shot off the half-volley.





Then in stoppage time Atlanta found the equalizer to earn the point at home. Matheus took on Reynolds near the right corner of the 18-yard box. As the Venezuelan forward cut the ball back to his left Reynolds tripped him inside the box and the foul resulted in a penalty kick. Matheus stepped up and buried a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner of the goal while Scott guessed the other corner.





ATL UTD 2 (3-4-4 13 points) will return to action against Indy Eleven July 7 at Fifth Third Bank Stadium (ESPN+ 7:30 p.m. ET).

ATL UTD 2 is owned and operated by AMB Sports & Entertainment and is the United Soccer League (USL) affiliate of Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United. ATL UTD 2 joined USL for its expansion 2018 season and plays its home matches at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Georgia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy8wNy0wMy1wYWRkb2NrLWJ1enotbWlkLW9oaW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paddock Buzz: Rossi Rebounds O'Ward Struggles in Qualifying,"If Pato O’Ward wants to close his points deficit to leader Alex Palou he’s going to have to rally from the rear in Sunday’s The Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio Presented by the HPD Ridgeline with a 20th starting position.

O’Ward struggled in NTT P1 Award qualifying putting together a best lap time of 1 minute 6.8679 seconds in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

The two-time race winner this season said his team struggled to find the right balance between the Firestone primary (black) tires and alternate (red) tires but he also blamed himself for the low starting position. O’Ward had a big moment in Turn 2 losing control on corner entry. He gathered it back up and narrowly avoiding sending the car off into the grass.

“We’ve had inconsistency from tire to tire” a frustrated O’Ward said. “I wasn’t the best either but the car wasn’t even there on lap three and it should have been. I don’t know what to say man. We’re starting from the back so we’ll see what we can do tomorrow. I don’t want to point any fingers. I screwed up. We’ve had pace. It sucks – sucks – to be starting so far back.”

Starting from the rear at a track like Mid-Ohio is always frustrating because it’s a course that rewards those who start up front. But with this year’s race at 80 laps instead of the usual 85 or 90-lap race that means O’Ward and his Arrow McLaren SP team could jump through the field depending on if they choose to execute a different pit stop strategy -- two or three stops.

O’Ward’s situation is amplified by the fact that he is second in the points standings in the closing stages of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES season. He held the points lead briefly after the Chevrolet Dual in Detroit but he lost it to Palou after Palou won at Road America.

O’Ward is currently 28 points behind Palou who starts seventh in Sunday's race. Just like at Road America when Palou started ahead of O’Ward the Mexican driver will start The Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio Presented by the HPD Ridgeline behind the 8-ball 13 positions behind Palou.

Palou isn’t worried about where O’Ward is starting. The Spaniard said his focus is always to score the most points and wins possible regardless of where his closest opponents are.

“It doesn’t change much” Palou said. “We still want to get points and wins. It always feels super good when you are able to get wins. Every weekend we’ve been able to fight for wins so we’ll try and continue that. Tomorrow is going to be a bit more difficult starting seventh but it’s not over. We’re going to be good. The championship still has six or seven races so there’s a lot of points to go.”

Rossi on Cusp of Best Back-to-Back Races

Alexander Rossi’s back-and-forth season continues this weekend at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course but the driver of the No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda looks poised to put together his best two consecutive races of the season.

With a best lap time of 1 minute 7.2181 seconds Rossi qualified sixth for Sunday’s race. It’s his fifth consecutive top-10 starting spot dating back to the 105th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge and sixth of this season. But his results haven’t been as consistent.

The Andretti Autosport driver has failed to put together two consecutive top-10 finishes this season. His best finish is seventh which he has done three times most recently at the REV Group Grand Prix presented by AMR at Road America June 20.

Statistically speaking Rossi is due to finish outside the top 10. But if his consistent run this weekend at Mid-Ohio continues it appears that trend will come to an end.

Rossi has shown speed throughout the weekend. He was fourth fastest in Friday’s practice session and although he was 14th on Saturday morning's speed chart amid cool conditions Rossi continued to show he has speed in the car with a solid qualifying performance.

Rossi almost didn’t get the opportunity to qualify in the Firestone Fast Six as a late session spin by Jack Harvey in Group 1 of qualifying hindered his last lap and saw him sit seventh on the board. However because Harvey caused a local yellow he lost his fastest lap which put Rossi back in the top six and allowed him to advance to the second round of qualifying.

Mid-Ohio has been good a good racetrack to Rossi having won here in 2018. In six starts he has five top-10 finishes including four consecutive top fives since that 2018 win. Last year he finished third and second respectively in the doubleheader weekend.

If Rossi can pick up where he left off at Mid-Ohio last year he could end his winless drought that dates back two years to Road America in 2019.

Miscommunication Derails Harvey’s Good Qualifying Result

Jack Harvey who has been one of the most consistent qualifiers in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES was poised to back up what he’s known for Saturday at Mid-Ohio until a late session spin turned it all around.

Harvey had the second fastest lap time of Group 1 of qualifying with a time of 1:06.4515 behind Josef Newgarden’s 1:06.0168. However Harvey had a spin off Turn 9 and stalled the car forcing a local yellow in the final seconds of the session.

His stalled No. 60 AutoNation/SiriusXM Honda impeded the laps of Alexander Rossi and Simon Pagenaud. Per the INDYCAR rulebook Harvey’s fastest time was disallowed. Because of that he did not advance to Round 2 of qualifying and instead starts 23rd in Sunday’s race.

However the reason Harvey was pushing so hard at the end of the session even though he was solidly in the next round of qualifying was due to a team miscommunication the Englishman said. Harvey was told what his target lap time was but he was not told where he ranked on the timing sheet. Therefore he unnecessarily pushed the car beyond its limits.

“They told me that a 1:06.3 was the cutoff and I had no idea we were P2” Harvey said. “I kept pushing because at that point I didn’t think there was anything to lose. Disappointing miscommunication there but hopefully we can work on that for the future and try to prevent what happened.”

Harvey has shown speed in his Meyer Shank Racing car all weekend long. In Friday’s practice session he was third fastest behind Josef Newgarden and Pato O’Ward. In Saturday morning’s practice session he clocked in eighth and in final practice he was 12th.

That gives Harvey who has two top 10 finishes in four starts at Mid-Ohio reason for optimism in his team’s home race. Team co-owner Mike Shank is from nearby Columbus Ohio and the team’s shop is in Pataskala Ohio just an hour south of Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.

“The pace has been good all weekend” he said. “We should have gone through qualifying in P2. Clearly we’ve got pace. The race car is good.”

Odds and Ends

Josef Newgarden’s pole position marked the first time in six years that a driver scored three consecutive NTT INDYCAR SERIES pole positions. The last driver to do so was another Team Penske driver -- Will Power in 2015 -- when he qualified first at Belle Isle-1 Texas Motor Speedway and Toronto. Qualifying at Belle Isle-2 was rained out.

James Hinchcliffe driving the No. 29 #ShiftToGreen Honda of Andretti Steinbrenner Autosport scored his best qualifying result of the season with a best lap time of 1:06.6134 good enough for ninth on the starting grid. His previous best start this season was a 12th-place starting spot at St. Petersburg. His best finish thus far is 14th at Belle Isle-2.

Columbus Ohio-native Graham Rahal the other hometown hero racing at Mid-Ohio this weekend will start eighth in the No. 15 Fifth Third Bank Honda of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. The weekend is twice as special for him as he takes pride in racing on July 4. “It means the world to us; it’s a special place and to be here on Fourth of July – I’m a very patriotic guy – in particular it’s a special weekend” Rahal said.

AJ Foyt Racing announced Road to Indy veteran Tatiana Calderón will test for the organization Tuesday July 6 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car course. She will drive a ROKiT-liveried No. 14 Chevrolet in her first taste of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES. Calderón is spending the weekend with the team.

NHRA drag racing champions Shawn Langdon and JR Todd were at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course today visiting with fellow DHL-sponsored driver Ryan Hunter-Reay. Langdon and Todd took in the practice and qualifying action and got to hang out with the legendary Mario Andretti.

Rinus VeeKay’s return to the NTT INDYCAR SERIES has looked good. The Dutchman was 18th fastest in Friday’s practice as he reacclimated himself to the car. He had to put a bandage over his shoulder incision due a seam on his suit rubbing it. The team also had to add more padding between his HANS Device and his shoulder. The Ed Carpenter Racing driver of the No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet was 13th fastest Saturday morning and 19th in the afternoon session. He starts 11th in Sunday's race.

Felix Rosenqvist also continued to reacclimate to the racetrack well. He was 10th in the morning practice session in the No. 7 Vuse Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet and 22nd in the afternoon session. He will start the race from the 13th position.

NTT INDYCAR SERIES rookie Scott McLaughlin narrowly missed advancing to the second round of NTT P1 Award qualifying. His best lap time of 1:06.7313 was good enough to advance out of Round 1 of qualifying until James Hinchcliffe jumped into the top six with the last lap of the session. That knocked McLaughlin down to seventh in the session just behind VeeKay’s best lap time of 1:06.7250. He starts 14th.

This rollercoaster of a racetrack threw even the best NTT INDYCAR SERIES athletes for a loop today. Drivers that went off course Saturday included Alexander Rossi Simon Pagenaud Scott Dixon Max Chilton Will Power and Jimmie Johnson.

Michael d’Orlando took the opening round of a busy USF2000 weekend Friday leading seven laps en route to his second win of the season. Kiko Porto dominated Saturday’s race leading all 20 laps on his way to victory.

Christian Rasmussen won the Indy Pro 2000 race by leading all 25 laps. It’s his fourth win in the last five races for Jay Howard Driver Development.",,,,,,,,,

The company which functions similarly to a crowd-funding project allows corporations to invest in the number of solar panels that would reverse the effects of their 2020 carbon footprint therefore “closing the loop” on clean energy.

“We’ve been talking a lot about Jackson and we’re really excited it’s coming together” said Lauren Zapata co-founder of Clearloop. “We were really excited that we will be making our first solar project happen in Jackson.

“Seeing all these companies come together—companies that may have not invested in Jackson before and are investing in the solar project--really excites us.”

With the final goal of producing 1 million watts of solar energy Clearloop has almost reached that milestone with the recent investment made by software investment company Vista Equity partners who will be producing 222000 watts or 510 solar panels.

This investment alone will power 44 homes in Jackson for 40 years.

Clearloop’s 1 million watt-goal will require an estimated 2300 solar panels and will be built on the western edge of Jackson adjacent to Silicon Ranch’s facility near McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport and TCAT Jackson.

Silicon Ranch is also a developing partner on the project.

“Our goal is 1 million watts enough to power 200 homes” Zapata said. “We are almost there—we have a couple of announcements coming up but the Vista Equity project is the most recent largest one. We are about 95 percent of the way there as of this announcement. “

The energy will be flowed into Jackson Energy Authority and dispersed throughout the city.

Clearloop was the brainchild of Zapata former Governor Phil Bredesen and renewable energy entrepreneur Bob Corney who all agreed on one thing: Tennessee’s need for clean energy and the state’s unique ability to provide valuable opportunities for such an investment.

“The three of us really came together to sort of try to figure out how to get more companies and more private sectors to invest in our part of the country and help us clean up the grid” Zapata said. “And we could help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.”

According to Zapata about 0.4 percent of Tennessee’s electricity comes from solar energy.

“That is very surprising to many people because we are in the sunbelt” she said. “So it’s one of those things that we could really power up and really invest in in this part of the country. There’s a lot of opportunity for us to build more and really invest in the communities that they’re going in.”

The hope to invest in the broader community will come in many forms including tax and infrastructure benefits.

“We think it’s important to recognize that these sort of infrastructure investments are not just good for the environment—it’s more of a question of equitable access to clean energy here in Jackson” Zapata explained. “We should have just as much access to energy as folks in California or New York or other larger states.

“But also on the economic aspect by building new infrastructure these types of projects will be there for the next generation over the next 40 years generating clean energy. That means the piece of infrastructure is not just adding to the resiliency of the grid for Jackson community but Tennessee in general as well as helping boost local taxes and being part of the local tax base.”

The solar farm plans to host their groundbreaking event in early September and expects to be fully operational by July 2022.

“This is just the beginning” Zapata said. “This is just the first project—we’re really excited to be the first project to be funded like this in the U.S. We can’t wait to do more of these—this one just happens to be right here at home in Tennessee where we’re excited to be able to make that kind of investment.”

Florida Power & Light plans to build a new solar plant on the outskirts of the rural farming town known for its tomatoes and citrus.

The project is a first for Collier County.

County commissioners granted the final approvals for the multimillion-dollar plant at a board meeting June 22.

The board greenlighted a conditional use to allow the plant to be built on agricultural land and signed off on several variances to the county's landscaping requirements which could have made the project cost-prohibitive.

County commissioners didn't discuss the project giving it a thumbs-up as part of the summary agenda which the board typically doesn't talk about.

Property records show the land for the new solar plant changed hands earlier this year with FPL paying nearly $5.5 million for it.

The seller Barron Collier Cos. had used the land to grow citrus but the grove had reached the ""end of its useful life"" said company CEO Blake Gable.

The Naples-based company has worked with FPL for years to find a site for the solar center in Collier.

No one objected to the chosen site or the plans for it.

""It's a great use"" Gable said.

The property spans about 578 acres. It sits on the east side of the intersection at State Road 29 and State Road 82.

On a mission

Ashley Fogg Schutz a spokeswoman for FPL said the project is part of the company's “30-by-30” plan to install 30 million solar panels by the year 2030.

Since launching the initiative in 2009 the company has achieved 40% of its goal with more than 40 solar energy centers operating across 22 Florida counties. The plants meet FPL’s mission to ""deliver America’s best energy value — energy that’s not just reliable and affordable but also clean"" Schutz said.

From our archives:Want to go solar? There's a new co-op for that in Collier County

More:East Naples businessman building steel solar home; target price under $300000

In 2009 the company built Florida’s first solar energy center in DeSoto County the largest of its kind in the nation when it opened.

""For perspective the solar energy centers we are building today are three times as large and cost less to build"" Schutz said.

Locating a solar plant near Immokalee made sense for many reasons she said.

""Land that is affordable close to existing transmission lines flat and with minimal environmentally sensitive areas is ideal for universal solar projects"" Schutz said. ""Additionally Southwest Florida has always been fundamental to our solar expansion efforts.""

FPL plans ahead to ensure it's prepared to meet the future needs of its customers she said.

""Accordingly we routinely purchase parcels that we believe would help us meet those needs whether they be for distribution facilities service centers or solar energy centers. By being proactive and thinking long-term we’re ensuring that we maintain low bills and high reliability for all our customers today and for years to come"" Schutz said.

Big investment

The energy the local solar plant generates will flow directly into the grid benefiting customers not just in Southwest Florida but statewide.

It's a big expense as each solar energy plant generally represents an investment of $90 million Schutz said.

""Importantly though our solar expansion is one example of the smart investments to modernize our entire power system that have saved FPL customers $11 billion since 2001 eliminated more than 165 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions and reduced our dependence on foreign oil by 99%"" she said.

The center in Collier County similar to others built by FPL around the state will have the capability of producing up to 74.5 megawatts of energy annually enough to power 15000 homes.

The solar plant will have nearly 300000 photovoltaic panels. The emissions savings will equate to removing 14000 cars from the road each year Schutz said.

The project will take six to 10 months to build creating about 200 construction jobs. FPL anticipates completion by March of next year.

""We may build additional solar energy centers in Collier County in the future as Southwest Florida is an important part of our plans for solar expansion"" Schutz said.

The closest plants to Collier are in Charlotte and Hendry counties on the west coast. There are also ones in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties in South Florida.

FPL is currently building the Ghost Orchid Solar Energy Center and the Sawgrass Solar Energy Center both near Clewiston in Hendry County.

""Solar energy centers provide benefits to local communities. A solar energy center will provide millions in tax revenue to the community’s tax base over its expected life which county leadership can apply as they see fit including to benefit local schools or improve infrastructure and services"" Schutz said.

Typically the plants don't face public opposition.

""Unlike traditional power plants solar energy centers require no vertical construction so there is little or no visual impact and the facilities generate no noise light heat or odors"" Schutz said. ""Solar energy centers make great neighbors.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL3dpL2dyZWVuLWJheS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvd2lzY29uc2luLXMtc29sYXItdHJlZXMtLXJlZGVmaW5lcy10aGUtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLWJldHdlZW4tcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1hbmQtcHVibGljLXNwYWNlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Wisconsin company's commitment to a carbon-free future with a solar tree,"EAU CLAIRE Wis. — A different kind of tree is taking form in Eau Claire.

What You Need To Know A new type of tree is planting its roots in the Chippewa Valley and giving solar technology a boost



Wisconsin-based company can now move with renewable energy into areas that hadn't been able to before



The prototype built by the Eau Claire-based company Solar Forma stands around 18 feet tall

The E-Cacia solar tree is being built at Artisan Forge MetalWorks in Eau Claire. The protype is built by Eau Claire-based company Solar Forma and is around 18-feet-tall.

It is the first solar tree in the United States to be incorporated into the city's Cannery District Redevelopment Project.

Brian Graff and Greg Johnson of Solar Forma merged their talents to create a solar product that's both functional and beautiful.

""We can now move with renewable energy into areas that we hadn't been able to before we kind of decided we wanted to reimagine and redefine the integration of renewable energy into human spaces"" Graff said. ""With these kinds of products and these designs we've been able to do that.""

The E-Cacia solar tree provides lighting at night among other features that include being able to charge electronic devices.

Each tree costs about $80000. It's expected to be installed by late September 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LXNvbGFyLWZhcm1zLXNoZWVwLWNvbWUtYmFjay1mb3ItbW93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At solar farms sheep come back for mower,"An emerging trend in pairing solar projects with agriculture is solar grazing the practice of using livestock — typically sheep — to manage the grass that grows under the panel arrays.

Solar grazing has multiple benefits. Livestock owners get extra income. No (gas-powered) lawn mowers are needed. And while the landscape crew may nap in the shade under the panels it doesn’t take a lunch break.

In Skowhegan sheep owned by Michael Dennett of Crescent Run Farm in Jefferson have started munching under the 10500 panels at a solar farm developed by ReVision Energy that supplies power for a handful of municipal buildings and a public school. Fortunat Mueller a ReVision Energy co-founder said it’s the first solar grazing arrangement in Maine.

Pairing solar and agriculture presents an opportunity for farmers who have some marginal acreage Mueller said and are looking to diversify their income. He said Dennett’s flock is scheduled to work at other solar projects this summer.

Solar grazing is becoming common in Massachusetts and New York and developers working in Maine are bringing that experience here.

Boston-based Nexamp has eight projects underway in Maine and is identifying “shepherd partners” for the 2022 growing season according to Keith Hevenor a company spokesman.

Nexamp also is using a pollinator seed mix that features native vegetation to increase bee activity.

This also is a national trend. A couple of big seed companies have teamed up to produce Fuzz and Buzz Seed Mix for solar sites in the Northeast according to the American Solar Grazing Association which promotes sheep and solar.

Last year in perhaps the most audacious cyber attack in history Russian military hackers sabotaged a tiny piece of computer code buried in a popular piece of software called SolarWinds. As we first reported in February the hidden virus spread to 18000 government and private computer networks by way of one of those software updates we all take for granted. After it was installed Russian agents went rummaging through the digital files of the U.S. departments of Justice State Treasury Energy and Commerce –among others—and for nine months they had unfettered access to top-level communications court documents even nuclear secrets.

Brad Smith: I think from a software engineering perspective it's probably fair to say that this is the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.

Brad Smith is president of Microsoft. He learned about the hack after the presidential election this past November. By that time the stealthy intruders had spread throughout the tech giants' computer network and stolen some of its proprietary source code used to build its software products. More alarming: how the hackers got in… piggy-backing on a piece of third party software used to connect manage and monitor computer networks.

Bill Whitaker: What makes this so momentous?

Brad Smith: One of the really disconcerting aspects of this attack was the widespread and indiscriminate nature of it. What this attacker did was identify network management software from a company called SolarWinds. They installed malware into an update for a SolarWinds product. When that update went out to 18000 organizations around the world so did this malware.

""SolarWinds Orion"" is one of the most ubiquitous software products you probably never heard of but to thousands of I.T. departments worldwide it's indispensable. It's made up of millions of lines of computer code. 4032 of them were clandestinely re-written and distributed to customers in a routine update opening up a secret backdoor to the 18000 infected networks. Microsoft has assigned 500 engineers to dig in to the attack. One compared it to a Rembrandt painting the closer they looked the more details emerged.

Brad Smith: When we analyzed everything that we saw at Microsoft we asked ourselves how many engineers have probably worked on these attacks. And the answer we came to was well certainly more than 1000.

Bill Whitaker: You guys are Microsoft. How did Microsoft miss this?

Brad Smith: I think that when you look at the sophistication of this attacker there's an asymmetric advantage for somebody playing offense.

Bill Whitaker: Is it still going on?

Brad Smith: Almost certainly these attacks are continuing.

Brad Smith

The world still might not know about the hack if not for FireEye a three-and-a-half billion dollar cybersecurity company run by Kevin Mandia a former Air Force intelligence officer.

Kevin Mandia: I can tell you this if we didn't do investigations for a living we wouldn't have found this. It takes a very special skill set to reverse engineer a whole platform that's written by bad guys to never be found.

FireEye's core mission is to hunt find and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks of their clients - mostly governments and major companies. But FireEye used SolarWinds software which turned the cyber hunter into the prey. This past November one alert FireEye employee noticed something amiss.

Kevin Mandia: Just like everybody working from home we have two-factor authentication. A code pops up on our phone. We have to type in that code. And then we can log in. A FireEye employee was logging in but the difference was our security staff looked at the login and we noticed that individual had two phones registered to their name. So our security employee called that person up and we asked ""Hey did you actually register a second device on our network?"" And our employee said ""No. It wasn't it wasn't me.""

Suspicious FireEye turned its gaze inward and saw intruders impersonating its employees snooping around inside their network stealing FireEye's proprietary tools to test its clients defenses and intelligence reports on active cyber threats. The hackers left no evidence of how they broke in – no phishing expeditions no malware.

Bill Whitaker: So how did you trace this back to SolarWinds software?

Kevin Mandia: It was not easy. We took a lotta people and said ""Turn every rock over. Look in every machine and find any trace of suspicious activity."" What kept coming back was the earliest evidence of compromise is the SolarWinds system. We finally decided: Tear the thing apart.

They discovered the malware inside SolarWinds and on December 13 informed the world of the brazen attack.

Kevin Mandia

Much of the damage had already been done. The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged the Russians spent months inside their computers accessing email traffic – but the department won't tell us exactly what was taken. It's the same at Treasury Commerce the NIH Energy. Even the agency that protects and transports our nuclear arsenal. The hackers also hit the biggest names in high tech.

Bill Whitaker: So what does that target list tell you?

Brad Smith: I think this target list tells us that this is clearly a foreign intelligence agency. It exposes the secrets potentially of the United States and other governments as well as private companies. I don't think anyone knows for certain how all of this information will be used. But we do know this: It is in the wrong hands.

And Microsoft's Brad Smith told us it's almost certain the hackers created additional backdoors and spread to other networks.

The revelation this past December came at a fraught time in the U.S. President Trump was disputing the election and tweeted China might be responsible for the hack. Within hours he was contradicted by his own secretary of state and attorney general. They blamed Russia. The Department of Homeland Security FBI and intelligence agencies concurred. The prime suspect: the SVR one of several Russian spy agencies the U.S. labels ""advanced persistent threats."" Russia denies it was involved.

Brad Smith: I do think this was an act of recklessness. The world runs on software. It runs on information technology. But it can't run with confidence if major governments are disrupting and attacking the software supply chain in this way.

Bill Whitaker: That almost sounds like you think that they went in to foment chaos?

Brad Smith: What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the United States. But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine.

For years the Russians have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. NotPetya a 2017 attack by the GRU Russia's military spy agency used the same tactics as the SolarWinds attack sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks but instead of spying - it ordered devices to self-destruct.

Brad Smith: It literally damaged more than 10% of that nation's computers in a single day. The television stations couldn't produce their shows because they relied on computers. Automated teller machines stopped working. Grocery stores couldn't take a credit card. Now what we saw with this attack was something that was more targeted but it just shows how if you engage in this kind of tactic you can unleash an enormous amount of damage and havoc.

Bill Whitaker: It's hard to downplay the severity of this.

Chris Inglis: It is hard to downplay the severity of this. Because it's only a stone's throw from a computer network attack.

Chris Inglis

Chris Inglis spent 28 years commanding the nation's best cyber warriors at the National Security Agency – seven as its deputy director – and now sits on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission – created by Congress to come up with new ideas to defend our digital domain.

Bill Whitaker: Why didn't the government detect this?

Chris Inglis: The government is not looking on private sector networks. It doesn't surveil private sector networks. That's a responsibility that's given over to the private sector. FireEye found it on theirs many others did not. The government did not find it on their network so that's a disappointment.

Disappointment is an understatement. The Department of Homeland Security spent billions on a program called ""Einstein"" to detect cyber attacks on government agencies. The Russians outsmarted it. They circumvented the NSA which gathers intelligence overseas but is prohibited from surveilling U.S. computer networks. So the Russians launched their attacks from servers set up anonymously in the United States.

Bill Whitaker: This hack happened on American soil. It went through networks based in the United States. Are our defense capabilities constrained?

Chris Inglis: U.S. Intelligence Community U.S. Department of Defense can suggest what the intentions of other nations are based upon what they learn in their rightful work overseas. But they can't turn around and focus their unblinking eye on the domestic infrastructure. That winds up making it more difficult for us.

He says history shows that once inside a network the Russians are a stubborn adversary.

Chris Inglis: It's hard to kind of get something like this completely out of the system. And they certainly don't understand all the places that it's gone to all of the manifestations of where this virus where this software still lives. And that's gonna take some time. And the only way you'll have absolute confidence that you've gotten rid of it is to get rid of the hardware to get rid of the systems.

Bill Whitaker: Wow. So unless you get rid of all the computers and all the computer networks you will not be sure that you have gotten this out of the systems.

Chris Inglis: You will not be.

Jon Miller: We've never been left with a breach like that before where we know months into it that we're only looking at the tip of the iceberg.

Jon Miller

It's not everyday you meet someone who builds cyber weapons as complex as those deployed by Russian intelligence. But Jon Miller who started off as a hacker and now runs a company called Boldend designs and sells cutting-edge cyber weapons to U.S. intelligence agencies.

Jon Miller: I build things much more sophisticated than this. What's impressive is the scope of it. This is a watershed style attack. I would never do something like this. It creates too much damage.

Miller says with the SolarWinds attack Russia has demonstrated that none of the software we take for granted is truly safe including the apps on our telephones laptops and tablets. These days he says any device can be sabotaged.

Jon Miller: When you buy something from a tech company a new phone or a laptop you trust that that is secure when they give it to you. And what they've shown us in this attack is that is not the case. They have the ability to compromise those supply chains and manipulate whatever they want. Whether it's financial data source code the functionality of these products. They can take control.

Bill Whitaker: So for instance they could destroy all the computers on a network?

Jon Miller: Oh easily. The malware that they deployed off of SolarWinds it didn't have the functionality in it to do that. But to do that is trivial. Couple dozen lines of code.

Since our story first aired the hacks have kept coming. And one of the people you just heard from former NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis was chosen as the country's first national cyber director reporting directly to President Biden. President Putin for his part still denies Russia's involvement in SolarWinds.

One attendant handed out disposable masks to the waiting fans wishing them a ""happy Fourth of July"" as he passed by.

Following the Milwaukee Bucks' historic win over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night the most coveted items for sale Sunday were merchandise commemorating the milestone: hats and $25 Finals T-shirts.

After 15 minutes large and extra-large sizes of the T shirts — laid out in bundles on four tables surrounded by crowds — were almost gone in-store. By noon one hour after opening an employee told latecomers that all of the NBA Finals-themed tees had apparently sold out — at least for the day.

The line promptly evaporated and people dispersed some murmuring about going to Kohl's or Dick's or checking online. Others lingered outside to chat about their team's historic win.

""This is what our city needs"" said Milwaukee native Brian Davis of the Bucks' success standing outside the Pro Shop alongside Yulonda Horton a lifelong fan born one year after the last time the Bucks won the Finals in 1971.

""There's a lot of pride involved in it"" said Davis. ""We've gone to game after game after game.""

Davis was hoping to get a Finals hat but they sold out.

Anna Harkensee & Jon Hansen joined the Jewelers Mutual “Shoot Your Shot Sweepstakes” in hopes to be the lucky winners of an engagement photoshoot at Fiserv Forum.

To their surprise they were selected.

“I kind of poked fun at her for doing this because I thought there was a zero percent chance” said Hansen. “It was really a cool experience.”

Tyler Krowiorz is the Director of Marketing at Jewelers Mutual. He said this is the first time the company has partnered with a sports organization and the purpose of the sweepstakes was to celebrate love.

For this couple Milwaukee is a special place.

“We love the city of Milwaukee” said Harkensee. “This is where we met dated and fell in love. So the city is really special to us.”

The most special addition to the engagment photos was ia Bucks hat. After Harkensee’s father passed away in 2019 she kept his Bucks hat close.

“He caught the Bucks fever in the 70s when he lived here” said Harkensee. They’re excited to see their love grow even more and as dedicated fans they’re hoping the bucks bring another championship back to Wisconsin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRtajQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy90aWNrZXQtcHJpY2VzLXZhcnktYXMtYnVja3MtcHJlcGFyZS10by1ob3N0LW5iYS1maW5hbHMtZ2FtZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket prices vary as Bucks prepare to host NBA Finals games,"The watch parties and games are only going to get bigger and better from here on out according to Bucks Chief Marketing Officer Dustin Godsey.

Godsey has seen the games and watch parties snowball into larger events that have brought the city together through the pandemic.

""To start you know a late season in the bubble last year and to come through and now to have you know 25000 people packing out here is incredible"" said Godsey.

The crowd outside of Fiserv Forum in the plaza is expected to grow.

""We’re getting to the point where we’re keeping track. We’re having 1000 people come thru every 5-7 minutes at its peak.""

Godsey believes those numbers are equating to ticket sales as they begin to sell quickly. But they're not cheap by any means.

According to StubHub On Sunday evening the cheapest ticket price listed ranges close to $600 and the highest is close to $9000.

For fans still trying to attend a finals game at Fiserv Monday at 10 AM the Bucks are expected to begin selling standing section tickets.

The Taurus car had a development budget of $3 billion and managed to save the company from bankruptcy in the early 80s.

Hagerty Media recently uploaded an informative video on its YouTube channel giving us all a lesson in Ford’s most popular car in the 80s and 90s the Taurus family sedan.The original Taurus family sedan was a godsend in 1980 when Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses and was desperate to climb back the stairs of success. In a final and desperate attempt to recover Ford invested the equivalent of today’s $7 billion in a new revolutionary design that gave birth to the first generation of Taurus vehicles.The design of the Taurus was so groundbreaking that the 1986 Ford Taurus was featured in every movie depicting the future.The company had so little faith in its new endeavor that it even kept its LTD mid-size range in production just in case their new plan failed. But it didn’t. Not only that but it even became the bestselling car in America back then.However the so-called “jelly bean” or “flying potato” car didn’t come with the most performance-orientated features. Hence the Taurus SHO was developed as the performance version of the Taurus with a Yamaha-built V-6 engine four overhead cams and 24 valves. The SHO used a Mazda-sourced 5-speed manual and was the most powerful front-wheel-drive sedan in the world.But the SHO didn’t have the success of its predecessor with the original Taurus selling in 400000 units per year. The SHO didn’t even manage to get close to the company’s target of 20000 cars sold annually.

Madeleine P. Published on July 3 2021 by

The Ford GT40 is a sports car designed in only 126 examples in the 1960s with a history well known to car enthusiasts but also amateurs the rivalry between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari has inspired more than one movie. In any case the vehicle is the focus of today’s topic: In the United States vintage car enthusiast Chris Ashton used 3D technology to modify and customize his Ford GT40 using Artec Space Spider and Artec Eva 3D scanners. The collector was able to reproduce complex shapes very quickly as close to the real thing as possible and hopes to get back on the road as soon as possible.

3D scanners are often used to digitize objects and parts from the past allowing users to obtain a digital copy. This copy can then be modified customized and then 3D printed to become a physical model. This is particularly interesting in the automotive sector for designing spare parts: on vintage cars most spare parts are no longer produced complicating maintenance and repair tasks and increasing costs considerably. However thanks to a 3D scanner the user can easily digitize his original part and recreate a model first digitally and then physically thanks to additive manufacturing.

Artec’s solutions for customizing the Ford GT40

Chris Ashton has a passion for cars and was able to combine this passion with his business: Ruffian Cars is a California-based company that builds and modifies sports cars. They’ve been using additive manufacturing to reproduce parts for a few years now but the process required many iterations before getting a model as close to the original as possible. That’s why the company invested in Artec Space Spider and Artec Eva scanners aiming especially to reproduce the car’s wideners.

Chris Ashton explains “Previously I would have needed to sculpt the flares out of foam or clay right on top of the car and take the whole car to a shop for them to pull the molds (or do it myself which is messy and involves a lot of chemicals.) And I would have had to do the job twice because you can’t mirror a part in the real world. The big advantage here is that the fender flares were built digitally on a scale scan of the actual car so we know they’ll fit properly and the left and right sides will be exact mirrors of each other.”

Chris says the Artec Eva scanner was used to scan the entire vehicle while the Space Spider was used to scan smaller parts and zoom in on the components to be integrated. It is a scanner that is particularly well suited to applications that require fine detail and accuracy ideal for capturing the reality of small objects. The company can then retrieve all the data from the vehicle on 3D software see in real time the nesting of parts etc. Chris continues: “Since the scans come into the computer at real-world scale I can model my new parts around them and print them without any scale issues which is a huge improvement over what I was doing before which was taking measurements building on those and hoping they were correct.” This makes the 3D printing process easier and more accurate.

Chris Ashton’s work doesn’t stop at reproducing the Ford GT40’s wideners: the customization work goes as far as the seatbelt buckles but also on the fenders and side skirts. In November he will present his Ford GT40 at SEMA 2021 a trade show where car manufacturers exhibit their products. More information on Artec 3D scanners can be found HERE.

PITTSBURGH — Unlike most other states electric scooters (which are motorized stand-up scooters with handlebars and a platform that riders stand on) are illegal in Pennsylvania. They don’t currently fit under any classification of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code so while private versions can be seen zipping around some city streets Pennsylvania cities don’t have the shareable e-scooters available in most other major U.S. cities.

But Pittsburgh will soon have shareable e-scooters thanks to a provision written into the recently signed Pennsylvania budget bill. Pittsburgh has been granted a pilot program for scooter share and according to the provision only a city of the second class can carry out the pilot. Pittsburgh is the only second class city in Pennsylvania. The pilot will last two years.

E-scooters are ridden while standing and typically travel the speed of cyclists. They are different from electric mopeds (like Scoobi) and electric-assist bikes aka e-bikes.

Karina Ricks the director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure told Pittsburgh City Paper that the low-speed scooter pilot program will be part of a larger micro-mobility pilot program the city will announce next week. She says she is grateful to the state legislature and the governor for granting the city of Pittsburgh the opportunity to test e-scooter share.

“We need to take an all-of-the-above kind of approach for mobility” Ricks said. “We have people that don’t have access to high-frequency transit or access to a vehicle. It is not in our best interest as a city to throw up barriers to things that might have utility.”

Ricks said 25 percent of automobile trips are less than a mile and believes the city needs to do more to give people more options for short trips and e-scooters can be a part of that.

She also understands that e-scooters have become a source of consternation in many cities with scooters left all over sidewalks and inconvenient locations and people zooming past pedestrians on sidewalks. However she is hopeful Pittsburgh’s pilot will address those issues. For one Pittsburgh’s e-scooters must be ridden on streets bike lanes or trails and are prohibited on sidewalks. “We have narrow sidewalks and the feeling for our city is that [e-scooters] should not be on the sidewalk at all” Ricks said."

Fox – who first found mainstream fame in 2007’s Transformers – has previously spoken out against the pervading misogyny that impacted her career.

“I think there has been a pervasive perception of me as a shallow succubus if that makes any sense for at least the first decade of my career” she told The Washington Post.

“And then that started to change more recently as people revisited my interviews listened to me speak and started to see me in a different way.”

Because of her physical appearance Fox said: “I was never really established as having been talented.”

The 35-year-old added that she noticed “people were surprised” to find she was funny when she starred in the hit comedy series New Girl as Reagan.

“More than being overlooked for my ability to handle comedy sometimes I’ve always been surprised by how easy it was for people to overlook that I’m relatively intelligent” she said.

“I was like how does that get so lost when there’s ridiculous amounts of material that can educate you otherwise?”

The This if 40 star reflected on her early career stating: “I was so lost and trying to understand like how am I supposed to feel value or find purpose in this horrendous patriarchal misogynistic hell that was Hollywood at the time.

“Because I had already been speaking out against it and everyone including other women received me in a very negative way for doing it.”

Elsewhere in the interview Fox said that she would like to see her 2009 horror film Jennifer’s Body rebooted as a TV series.

Despite an initial negative critical reception the film – directed by Juno’s Diablo Cody – has since become a cult classic.

Fox – who first found mainstream fame in 2007’s Transformers – has previously spoken out against the pervading misogyny that impacted her career.

“I think there has been a pervasive perception of me as a shallow succubus if that makes any sense for at least the first decade of my career” she told The Washington Post.

“And then that started to change more recently as people revisited my interviews listened to me speak and started to see me in a different way.”

Because of her physical appearance Fox said: “I was never really established as having been talented.”

The 35-year-old added that she noticed “people were surprised” to find she was funny when she starred in the hit comedy series New Girl as Reagan.

“More than being overlooked for my ability to handle comedy sometimes I’ve always been surprised by how easy it was for people to overlook that I’m relatively intelligent” she said.

“I was like how does that get so lost when there’s ridiculous amounts of material that can educate you otherwise?”

The This if 40 star reflected on her early career stating: “I was so lost and trying to understand like how am I supposed to feel value or find purpose in this horrendous patriarchal misogynistic hell that was Hollywood at the time.

“Because I had already been speaking out against it and everyone including other women received me in a very negative way for doing it.”

Elsewhere in the interview Fox said that she would like to see her 2009 horror film Jennifer’s Body rebooted as a TV series.

Despite an initial negative critical reception the film – directed by Juno’s Diablo Cody – has since become a cult classic.

ISTANBUL

Shares of D-Market Electronic Services and Trading also known as Hepsiburada rose nearly 12 percent in their U.S. stock market debut on Thursday giving the Turkish e-commerce platform a market value of $4.38 billion.

Hepsiburada’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) opened at $12.75 and closed the day at $13.43 above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $12 per ADS. Hepsiburada the first Turkish company listed on the Nasdaq exchange sold 56.7 million ADS earlier in the day to raise more than $680 million with existing shareholders putting up a little over 15 million of the shares on offer. Founded in 2000 Hepsiburada operates online platforms on which consumers can order items ranging from groceries and essentials to airline tickets.

The company launched its marketplace in 2015 and has an in-house logistics network touting that 64 percent of its orders are delivered the next-day. With 9 million active customers Hepsiburada’s revenue and gross merchandise value which refers to the total value of products sold more than doubled in 2020 compared with a year earlier a regulatory filing showed. “Turkish e-commerce is at an inflection point and we have ambitious plans to continue leading digitalization of commerce. Our story resonated with international investors” Hepsiburada’s founder and Chairwoman Hanzade Doğan Boyner told Reuters.

The company plans to use the proceeds to invest in logistic infrastructure as well as expand in new initiatives including grocery delivery and digital payment services. Its gross merchandise value a benchmark of trade on its marketplace rocketed 89 percent to 17 billion Turkish Liras ($1.96 billion) last year.

The Doğan family holds 65.4 percent and Franklin Templeton’s stake was reduced to 14.6 percent after the listing.

Some thoughts/observations after a month driving:I heard most of these concerns raised 8 years ago when the touch-centric Model S was released--I'd argue this has not shown itself as an issueThe provide haptic feedback when pressed. The point is to be able to press the buttons without having to look at the yoke so not sure localized feedback is necessary. Is does take some time to understand what the car considers a long vs sort pressTested as this has been raised before--work with latex gloves and thin leather gloves but not with thick fleece gloves--OTOH the yoke is heated so maybe not a need to drive wiht thick gloves onNot really an issue can reach it by extending my left thumbHas happened once in. 1K mile of drivingThey are--by location:The bump in the wheel help you tell between thumb high and thumb low the other two are hard to confuse and they have pretty bit hit boxes. Again the idea is to be able to do this with wihout having to look--kinda like using a gaming controllerThey are lit when the car is on--have not had an issue seeing them even if bright mid-day sunThis is partially correct. Each button had a long and short pressed mapped to it. To turn you need a single long press and the the turn signal stays engaged until you complete your turn or you cancel it. A short (really soft) press engages your turn signal as long ad you thumb remains in place--I assume this is for lane changes. I would like to see this re-mapped so a short press gives you 3 blinks.Probably something to do with the airbag--if you press on the right side of the yoke wiht your palm (as you might press in the center of a steering wheel) the horn will also sound.I've driven with a touchscreen for 8 years now so I guess I am used to this. I can see this being disconcerting but I think folks underestimate their ability to adaptThey are by locationIn use it is obvious is you have hit or missed a button as something immediate happens you get the haptic buzz and some action immediately happens (turn signal is lit horn sounds voice command box posts up).In the last week or so I have really come to appreciate the ergonomics of the the yoke + stalkless controls. The yoke forces a 3/9 o'clock hand position which means the control buttons stay in know portions which facilitates muscle memory and being Abel to do things without having to look. Anyone that has used a gaming controller will be familiar with the concept. I find it an improvement to have controls always available under my thumb while still retaining a firm grip on the yoke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bmV4dC5pbi90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvMDcvMDQvZ2FybWluLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5hdmljLWVuYWJsZWQtaGFuZGhlbGQtZGV2aWNlc9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bmV4dC5pbi9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2dhcm1pbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1uYXZpYy1lbmFibGVkLWhhbmRoZWxkLWRldmljZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin launches 'NavIC' enabled handheld devices,"Bengaluru

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) also called NavIC- is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by India.

Acknowledging Garmin's initiative to incorporate NavIC in handheld devices GPSMAP 66sr and GPSMAP 65s the space agency also urged the company to make NavIC an integral part of all their upcoming satellite navigation based devices launched in India.

''NavIC enhances the accuracy and availability of signals in the hilly terrain as well as urban canyon and the NavIC enabled handheld devices can harness this benefit'' ISRO said.

NavIC is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary which is its primary service area.

According to ISRO IRNSS will provide two types of services namely Standard Positioning Service (SPS) which is provided to all the users and Restricted Service (RS) which is an encrypted service provided only to the authorised users.

The IRNSS System is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20 metres in the primary service area it said.

This watch’s core fitness abilities aren't all that different to others in its family with features that you'd often find on the best running watches. You still can’t see maps as you hike upload GPX route files to use the Honor Watch GS Pro as a bike computer control a bike turbo trainer or hook up a heart rate chest strap.

However most people don’t need advanced features like these. The Honor Watch GS Pro performs well as one of the best exercise watches with reliable GPS and heart rate readings that match those of a chest strap fairly well.

Plus it lasts absolutely ages off a charge; 25 days use if you go easy and at least a week if you hammer it with the always-on screen mode and lots of GPS-tracked activities make this one of the lowest upkeep watches around.

Honor Watch GS Pro: price and features

The Honor Watch GS Pro was released in September 2020 and retails at $319.99 in the US or £249.99 in the UK. This puts it in contention with fitness watches like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 Apple Watch SE and Garmin Instinct.

It sits somewhere between these two 'fitness smartwatch' and 'runner’s watch' camps. It has a rugged appearance and ultra-long battery life but the color-rich OLED screen has plenty of the glossy tech charm some of you may want.

The main Honor Watch GS Pro caveat you’ll find in the breakdown below is the watch does not have the depth of features you’ll find in some of the best fitness watches. This is something to consider if you are a keen cyclist or hiker or like to plan out run routes on roads you don’t know by heart (if the latter is you check out Fit&Well's edit of the best running watches).

Honor Watch GS Pro: fitness tracking

The Honor Watch GS Pro has a bunch of extra hardware for health and fitness tracking but the core elements you should care about most remain the reliability of its GPS and heart rate readings.

This heart rate sensor is good enough for all kinds of exercise. It’s fast enough to keep up with interval workouts and its readings are usually within a couple of bpm of my Wahoo Tickr heart rate strap which I use as a reference.

On one run the Honor Watch GS Pro recorded a peak heart of 171bpm to the Tickr HR’s 168bpm. But after overlaying the graphs the Honor’s results looked like a near-identical twin.

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

There are also none of the tracking issues I encountered with the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro which is a sister watch of sorts. That watch has a tendency to miss out chunks of data with certain types of exercise as if the sensor went to sleep briefly when exertion levels dropped. The Honor Watch GS Pro performed much better.

GPS accuracy is good too. After an 8km run the Honor Watch GS Pro was within a couple of hundred meters of the reading of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 using its internal GPS for a third result.

Your data ends up in the Huawei Health app (Huawei being former owners of the Honor brand) complete with the usual stack of heart rate pace cadence and altitude graphs. And here we come to the first potential road block.

Huawei Health only lets you sync up your data to Google Fit and MyFitnessPal. This may be an issue if for example you are a cyclist who wants to link up to Strava.

You could link to Google Fit and then export data to Strava. But you don’t have to look far online to find many cyclists annoyed Huawei does not offer proper integration. Huawei has been limited to MyFitnessPal and Google Fit for years and any plans to expand this are at best vague.

Honor Watch GS Pro: exercise modes

The Honor Watch GS Pro has a huge stack of exercise tracking modes. You see this across all of Honor's latest trackers beyond the basic bands.

However as I said about the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro don’t give it too much credit for this. Only a handful of them have anything approaching an admirable level of depth.

A huge number of the “100+” modes only show your session duration and heart rate. Beyond this a great many of the Honor Watch GS Pro’s modes are thin. There’s no rep counter in the Strength mode. You can’t record your scores in Archery or Darts. And unlike the cheaper Watch Fit there are no guided exercises for things like Yoga.

That said the Honor Watch GS Pro tracks the essentials perfectly well. Go for a run and you’ll see four stats on-screen at once: all the basics you need.

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

There are separate pages for ascent other metrics and even an “AI ghost” that shows your pace versus a fictional opponent based on your general performance level. It’s a bit silly but may keep the more competitive among you motivated.

Other modes have stats tailored to the specific pursuit. There’s an SPO2 (blood oxygen) page in the Mountain Hiking mode for example. Skiing highlights your max speed and descent. The Indoor Swim mode attempts to record your laps based on the pool length which you set manually.

The Honor Watch GS Pro's “serious fitness watch” design reminds me of the advanced features you get in a dedicated exercise watch - but not here. You can’t see maps when you go for a walk run or cycle. You can’t hook up a chest strap heart rate monitor a cadence sensor or power meter. You can’t upload a GPX file to let the Honor Watch GS Pro act as a bike computer or navigation tool.

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

The closest you get is Route Back which is a “breadcrumb” view that shows a line of your route but without the context of any map data. Garmin’s closest rival in price the Instinct doesn’t have full mapping either but you can upload routes to it so you know when to take a turn.

These issues highlight the problem with Huawei’s higher-end 2020 watches. The build and surface-level features have been given a big upgrade but the underlying software is really much the same as that of the older Huawei watches and the cheaper Huawei Watch Fit/Honor Watch ES.

I love this software in a $150/£150 watch but its limitations become a little too clear at this price point.

The add-on running features are friendly ones made for people starting out with running as a hobby. A set of guided runs tell you when to speed up slow down or aim for a level of exertion. It’s a bit like a couch-to-5K app on your wrist.

Honor Watch GS Pro: advanced features

The Honor Watch GS Pro doesn’t have real depth so what are the new features that can attempt to justify the added cost?

This watch has a blood oxygen saturation monitor support for music a barometer and compass. The first blood oxygen/SpO2 is one of the most talked-about wearable features of 2020 even though it has been around for years. The Withings Pulse Ox was one of the first and that launched in 2014.

Blood oxygen readings use red and infrared lights built into the heart rate sensor array. As more and less oxygenated blood absorbs differing amounts of red and IR light the Honor Watch GS Pro sensor can estimate your saturation level as your heart pumps.

I don’t find blood oxygen data as useful as normal heart rate readings. It takes longer is more picky about movement when capturing data and these wrist-worn sensors are not terribly accurate. I recorded 100% and 89% which is abnormally low within the space of two minutes. The lower rate was likely because I wasn’t still enough but it ensures the best time to use this feature is while you sleep.

Blood oxygen is arguably more of a health stat than a fitness one and has gained prominence this year because the way Covid-19 attacks your respiratory system can seriously decrease SpO2.

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

Music is arguably more important for some as it may affect how you use the Honor Watch GS Pro day-to-day. There’s 2079MB of space for tracks which gives you enough room for a good set of playlists which you curate on your phone via the Health app.

There’s nothing here for those who have fully moved over to streaming though. You can only transfer files as there’s no support for third-party services like Spotify. And no you cannot send over tracks you have downloaded from Spotify to the Honor Watch GS Pro.

Pair a set of the best workout earbuds and your music will play through them and there’s a mini app on the watch to control playback. This same app can be used to control your phone’s music to a limited extent if you’d rather listen to Spotify on your phone.

Alternatively tracks can play through the integrated speaker. It’s predictably thin-sounding but can put out respectable volume for a watch driver.

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

There’s another reason to use headphones here. Whenever you hit a km on a run a voice pipes up with your stats for that kilometer. It makes much more sense for these to be played over earphones than the watch speaker particularly if you run in areas full of people.

I must have attracted a lot of odd looks in the local park running with this watch.

The manufacturers could do more with these Honor Watch GS Pro vocalized stats. You can’t tweak what this virtual person says and he blabbers on for about 10 seconds each time. I only really want to know my pace for that kilometer. To be able to snip out some of these stats would be handy because as is I’m always tempted to turn them off altogether.

Finally there are the Honor Watch GS Pro’s compass and barometer. These power two separate mini-apps that show the air pressure and you guessed it a compass view. They may appeal if you read my previous complaints about the lack of full on-watch navigation and didn’t care because you like to hike with a paper map and consider using Google Maps “cheating”.

Honor Watch GS Pro: design

The Honor Watch GS Pro is larger than other Honor watches in order to fit in that large battery. I’m not a particular fan of big bulky watches but this one avoids the part I find most problematic.

Honor’s Watch GS Pro may be fairly big but it is not that heavy. You don’t feel its watch face take on its own momentum and try to move about on your wrist as you run. The only real downside here then is the potentially off-putting macho aura of a big casing.

I dug out the scales to find out the real weight difference including strap next to some top wearables:

Honor Watch GS Pro: 77g

Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar (47mm): 84g

Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm) 66

Samsung Galaxy Watch 3: 67g

Huawei Watch Fit: 36g

(Image credit: Andrew Williams)

The Honor Watch GS Pro is heavier than the rivals from Apple and Samsung but is noticeably lighter than the top Garmins. And 10-11g is a low price to pay for incredible battery life.

Honor achieves this by using practical rather than overtly expensive materials. The Honor Watch GS Pro’s casing is a tough plastic. Only the bezel and side buttons are stainless steel. And the screen covering is normal toughened glass not the harder Sapphire.

Overall this style is far removed from the ultra-high-end Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro but the design looks and feels more like that of a fitness watch. Its screen is partially protected by the slight lip between bezel and display glass for example.

Speaking of the screen this is a 1.39-inch 454 x 454 pixel OLED similar to the displays of all the other higher-end Honor trackers. I found that it was big enough and bright enough to stay clear on a very bright day.

Honor Watch GS Pro: battery life

Battery life is the number one Honor Watch GS Pro stand-out feature. Honor says it lasts up to 25 days almost double the longevity of other Honor and Huawei watches that use the same software.

It’s all thanks to a huge — for a wearable — battery. The Honor Watch GS Pro has a 790mAh cell roughly twice the capacity of the average larger smartwatch or watch-style tracker.

What can I say here other than that it comes up with the goods? A 2.5 hour hike took just five per cent off the Honor Watch GS Pro battery. Hour-long runs again take off around five to six per cent. And this is in-line with Honor’s own claims.

It says the Honor Watch GS Pro can handle 40 hours of GPS tracking between charges and that’s true when you walk or hike. My testing shows the runtime is roughly halved when you use a mode that demands more GPS calls such as running or cycling. Expect up to 20 hours of GPS run tracking not 40.

There’s no deceit here. All of the very best fitness watches have battery-saving GPS profiles for when you won’t move all that quickly.

It’s difficult to get the Honor Watch GS Pro to die in the space of a week with the way I exercise at present anyway. Using it for daily indoor cycling sessions and a couple of runs it was not even close to running out by day seven of testing with around half its battery life left.

This is the longest-lasting wearable with an OLED screen I have ever used. And as someone who likes to be able to act lazy with tech and save the effort for actually going out to exercise this is a very good thing.

Battery life is roughly halved if you use the “always on” screen mode which I usually recommend. This makes it display a watch face when not in use. But even then only a diary packed full of longer GPS-tracked runs or rides will see the Honor Watch GS Pro last less than seven days.

Honor Watch GS Pro: verdict

The Honor Watch GS Pro looks feels and lasts like a true top-tier fitness watch. And if your routine mostly consists of well-worn running and cycling routes it has the exercise features you need.

However it’s not so strong if you’re an enthusiast who wants to load up routes onto your watch or navigate using on-screen maps. The Honor Watch GS Pro doesn’t have either of these because Huawei’s software does not support them.

A few extras aside the Honor Watch GS Pro’s fitness features are much like those of the Honor Magic Watch or the Huawei Watch Fit. That’s more than enough to keep us happy in a tracker at that sort of price but this one costs double. Exercise tracking here is relatively shallow next to other watches that look like this one making ultra-long battery life the main appeal.

Still as USPs go up to 25 days’ use between charges is a damn good one.

Also consider

A Garmin alternative

The Instinct (pictured) Vivoactive 4 and Forerunner 245 are the obvious Garmin watches to choose at the price. None have as punchy-looking a screen as the Honor but the Instinct lasts about as long between charges. All have more advanced fitness features like the ability to connect to external sensors and use pre-planned routes that allow for better on-watch navigation.

Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro

Honor and Huawei are like cousins and the Watch GT 2 Pro is the closest alternative from the other side of the family. It uses higher-end materials like titanium ceramic and Sapphire. But there’s no protective lip for the display glass and battery life is only half as long. Their fitness features are near-identical. So do you want luxury style or ultra-long battery life? The Huawei is also a little more expensive.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 3

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 seems similar to the Honor Watch GS Pro but is not. This is a smartwatch that will only last a couple of days between charges if you use a lot of GPS tracking. However the interface is slicker and as it is a proper smart band you can install apps that add a little to its otherwise fairly mainstream fitness abilities. It can also broadcast its heart rate readings with the help of an app - handy for a lot of home workout gear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3Mvd2Fob28vMTU3MDgwLXdhaG9vLWVsZW1udC1yaXZhbC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wahoo Elemnt Rival review: Leap of faith?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY2tldC1saW50LmNvbS9maXRuZXNzLXRyYWNrZXJzL3Jldmlld3Mvd2Fob28vMTU3MDgwLXdhaG9vLWVsZW1udC1yaXZhbC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYWRnZXRzLzAzMDcyMS9pbmRpYS1nZXRzLWRldmljZXMtdG8taW5kaWdlbm91c2x5LW1hcC1pdHMtdGVycmFpbi1mcm9tLXNwYWNlLmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVjY2FuY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYWRnZXRzLzAzMDcyMS9pbmRpYS1nZXRzLWRldmljZXMtdG8taW5kaWdlbm91c2x5LW1hcC1pdHMtdGVycmFpbi1mcm9tLXNwYWNlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India gets devices to indigenously map its terrain from space,"Nellore: Garmin a renowned manufacturer of navigational products has recently launched in India NavIC-enabled handheld devices GPSMAP 65s and GPSMAP 66sr which enhance accuracy and availability of signals irrespective of the terrain.

Acknowledging Garmin’s initiative to incorporate NavIC in the two GPSMAP 65s and 66sr handheld devices Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO has asked the organisation to make NavIC an integral part of all its upcoming satellite navigation-based devices being launched in India.

Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) with operational name NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system which provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services.

The services are basically of two levels – a standard positioning service which will be available for civilian use; and an encrypted restricted service for authorised users like the military.

NavIC has been developed for India to become self-reliant without being dependent on foreign navigation technologies such as GPS which are controlled by foreign governments that can interfere during military operations requiring special navigation.

Kargil War became the awakening call for this initiative when the US government denied access to GPS map of Pakistan a crucial matter at that point.

As a result ISRO initiated development of NavIC by opening a new satellite navigation centre within the campus of ISRO-operated Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu in Karnataka on May 28 2013.

A network of 21 ranging stations located across the country provides data for orbital determination of satellites and monitoring of navigation signals within India. All required components have been built in India including the space segment ground segment and user receivers. The total cost of the project came to Rs. 22.46 billion.

To date ISRO has built and launched total nine satellites in the IRNSS series; of which eight are currently in orbit. Three of these satellites are in geostationary orbit (GEO) while the remaining are in geosynchronous orbits (GSO) which maintain an inclination of 29° with the equatorial plane.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi named this IRNSS constellation NavIC while dedicating it to the nation at the successful launch of IRNSS-1G satellite.

The eight operational satellites in IRNSS series namely IRNSS-1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 1G and 1I had been launched on July 2 2013; April 4 2014; October 16 2014; March 28 2015; January 20 2016; March 10 2016 April 28 2016; and April 12 2018 respectively. As PSLV-39 had been unsuccessful IRNSS-1H satellite could not reach its orbit."

By George Mills

The recent Israeli offensive against Gaza which killed two hundred Palestinians including 59 children sparked a wave of protests across Wales and much of the world.

But the war on the Palestinian people continues long after the air raids have stopped. It is a long ongoing attack on Palestinians homes villages rights and very existence.

Israel is able to maintain and deepen it’s system of racial aparheid and occupation with the help of other richer states that help fund its operations to support their imperialist objectives in the region.

Top of the pile is the US which relies on Israel to defend its interests in the Middle East. In 2020 the country gave $3.8bn (£2.7bn) in aid to Israel. Almost all of this went on military spending.

Britain is also high up on the list and plays an integral role in supporting Israel. Wales is used by the British military with the support of Welsh Government to support this reality. At the same a number of major companies operating in Wales have deep links with the Israeli regime and some have even received funding from Welsh Government.

A report by Declassified UK last year stated that ‘Wales has a major role in the UK arms industry with the Ministry of Defence spending £310 per person to support the sector in the country totalling almost a billion pounds worth of expenditure in 2017/18. This level of military spending is above average for the UK as a whole and higher than in Scotland or Northern Ireland’.

Detailed below are the alarming connections to the Israeli war machine and the arms manufacturers that supply it from within Wales.

Elbit Systems UK

Elbit Systems have hit the headlines recently due to multiple of their factories and offices being occupied and having production of the lethal drones shut down by Palestine Action a direct-action focus group whose primary objective is to shut down Elbit Systems operations in the UK.

Elbit Systems are one of the biggest arms companies in the world and the primary supplier of the Watchkeeper drones used by the IDF against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza strip. The company’s headquarters is in Haifa in Israel their CEO is Bezhalel Machlis who has been at the helm since 2013 overseeing the company as it generated $4.7billion in revenue in 2020.

Voice Wales reported earlier this month that these Watchkeeper drones have for years been tested in Welsh aerospace from West Wales Airport near Parc Aberporth. The arms company also has subsidies and links to other areas across the UK including RAF Valley in Anglesey.

The Aberporth site has also staged trials for the Hermes 900 model drone the successor to the Hermes 450 one of the most widely used military drones in the world. These drones have been cited by a variety of international Non-Government Organisations for targeting civilians. The Watchkeeper drones are also based on the Hermes models. Elbit Systems boast of the drone’s capacity for surveillance and ‘target acquisition.’

‘It features over-the-horizon persistent multi-mission multi-payload capabilities with a class-leading payload carrying capacity of 350 kg. Hermes 900 is capable of performing missions for area dominance and persistent ISTAR (intelligence surveillance target acquisition and reconnaissance)’

Elbit Systems provide 85% of all the drones used by the IDF. These drones have been used across multiple campaigns by the Israeli military including the 51-day siege of Gaza in 2014 that killed over 2000 Palestinians including 551 children.

GE Aviation

General Electric Aviation are one of the biggest manufacturing companies in the world and were ranked as the 24th largest arms producer in the world in 2018. In 2017 the aviation section of the company alone generated $27.4 billion 14% of which came from military contracts.

In the same year the Welsh Government granted the company £5million in funding for their plant at Nantgarw in Caerphilly after the then First Minister Carwyn Jones flew out to meet General Electric directors in Washington D.C. The company overall generated $122.1billion in revenue in 2017.

GE Aviation provide engines and equipment for a variety of military vehicles including Apache Helicopters and F-16 and F-15 fighter jets all of which have been used substantially by the IDF against Palestinian civilians over the years. GE Aerospace also manufactures the LM2500 gas turbines that are used in the Sa’ar 5 Israeli warships.

‘F-16 jets Apache helicopters Sa’ar ships and other weapons systems with engines manufactured by General Electric have been used repeatedly in Israeli attacks on densely populated civilian areas resulting in thousands of civilian casualties in Lebanon the West Bank and Gaza. The human rights community including Human Rights Watch Amnesty International B’tselem and United Nations commissions has ruled these attacks to be human rights violations collective punishment and at times war crimes’

The GE Aviation MRO plant in Nantgarw oversees the maintenance and repair of a variety of commercial jet engines including the GE9X for Boeing the second largest arms company in the world and the creators of the Apache Gunship.

JCB

JCB which has a large factory in Wrexham is one of the largest military suppliers of diggers tractors and other equipment dedicating an entire section of the company specifically to ‘Defence products’ according to its website.

‘Our specialised military vehicles have been used in the toughest environments on operations around the world where the levels of mobility and protection have been tested and proven by several armed forces’

One of these ‘several armed forces’ is the Israeli Defence Force. An extensive report published by War on Want highlighted how deep the company’s links are to the Israeli state;

‘The JCB High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE) is one of JCB’s military vehicles recently sold for use by the Israeli army. The HMEEs were sold through the American Foreign Military Sales programme to the Central Command unit of the Israeli army for use by their paratroopers’ division; the machines are already in use by the Israeli army’s Combat Engineering Corps’

The Israeli Central Command Unit controls much of the occupied West Bank and has overseen the mass displacement of Palestinians through the demolition of their homes and communities. JCB’s equipment and machinery have been photographed and recorded on many accounts destroying Palestinian homes.

In February 2012 ‘Silwan residents awoke to the sight of bright yellow JCB equipment demolishing the only children’s playground in their town. The playground and sports field at the Madaa creative centre was used as a football pitch and recreation ground by local children. JCB’s machines were filmed and photographed carrying out the demolition of Madaa’s playground and sports field which was carried out illegally on the instruction of the Jerusalem municipality without warning and without a demolition order’.

The Palestinian town of Silwan in East Jerusalem has been a target of Israeli destruction and forced eviction for many years. It is also one of the most impoverished communities in the occupied lands and faces an extreme shortage of community and education services and spaces.

As well as selling directly to the Israeli military through the American Foreign Military Sales programme JCB uses an Israeli distributor called Comasco to bring their products to Israel. JCB have an enormous share of the market in Israel and as such have huge vested interest in the settler state.

‘JCB dominates the Israeli market with a 65% market share of all excavators and a 90% market share of commonly used loading vehicles’

JCB Transmissions have a large factory that is located on the Wrexham Industrial Estate in Wrexham. JCB’s owner and multi-billionare Lord Anthony Bamford is a Conervative Peer who has donated over £10million to the Tories since 2001 and donated £10000 to Boris Johnson himself in 2019.

The links between Wales and Israel run deceptively deep. There are a multitude of companies operating within the country that contribute directly to the suffering and killing of Palestinians. Welsh land and resources are used in the service of the Israeli military something demanded by the British military and supported by Welsh Government.

But the workforce in Wales is dragged into this operation as well.

One of the most striking aspects of the recent international Palestine solidarity movement has been the action of workers crucially in Palestine itself but also in when workers in Italy and South Africa have refused to load Israeli arms cargo.

Without workers the war machine would grind to a halt and now more and more sections of labour are realising the power they have to stop it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sYXJyeS1maXR6Z2VyYWxkLW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtdGVhbW1hdGVzLTIyNDkyNzM1Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry Fitzgerald's most influential teammates were from rookie possibly final seasons,"Legendary receiver Larry Fitzgerald entered the NFL in 2004 and has been teammates with scores of players ever since. He has surely been influenced by many of them.

However when asked who his most influential teammates have been he named two.

He participated in an AMA (ask me anything) for Bleacher Report leading up to his gig as an analyst for “The Match” this coming week.

His two most influential teammates came from his rookie season and this past season.

His answer:

Tough to pick one. Emmitt Smith being around him as a rookie. Last year Kelvin Beachum. Two people at the different end of the spectrum but both special individuals.

Smith now in the Hall of Fame helped Fitzgerald to be a pro. Beachum who played with Fitzgerald only one season thus far has made an impact on the legendary receiver in other ways. Beachum has been active and outspoken for the past year about racial justice.

Fitzgerald’s Instagram post to wish Beachum a happy birthday indicates the respect he has for the Cardinals’ starting right tackle.

While he hasn’t officially retired it looks less and less like he will play another down in the NFL.

If that is the case it is kind of cool that his two most influential teammates came at the start and at the end of his career.

“If I’m going to buy a multimillion-dollar asset or hire a senior executive I’m going to shake his hand. I’m going to look into his eye. I’m going to have dinner with him.”

Vik Kachoria the founder president and CEO of Spike Aerospace is setting out his expectations for the future of supersonic air travel a concept many assumed had vanished in 2003 when Concorde was retired. Formerly employed in mergers and acquisitions in an investment bank on Wall Street Kachoria is bullish about the future of the face-to-face meeting and the consumer demand for making day trips in one of his private jets which will cost more than $100m.

Despite scepticism about the potential for supersonic air travel — the cost the culture the environmental damage — Kachoria is one of the investors putting his faith and money in the future of a new breed of super-planes. Besides Spike whose planned S-512 will carry 18 passengers and travel at Mach 1.6 (more than one-and-a-half times the speed of sound) Virgin Galactic is working on a commercial passenger jet that will transport up to 19 people at Mach 3 — that’s 2300mph and a flight time from New York to London of less than two hours. Boom Supersonic’s Overture will carry 65 to 88 passengers at a speed of Mach 1.7. Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation has joined forces with a UAE-owned investment company to develop a plane. And Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency is talking about a hypersonic jet with 100 seats that could fly at Mach 5 and cross the Pacific in two hours.

And yet the challenges are many: one of the biggest potential players in the supersonic private-jet market Aerion has already thrown in the towel. Despite a $11.2bn sales backlog for its AS2 jet (including orders from NetJets and backing from Boeing and GE Aviation) it closed down its operations citing funding issues earlier this year.

Three jets to watch Spike Aeronautics S-512 Passengers 18 Speed Mach 1.6 Altitude 50000ft Range 6200 nautical miles Cost $120m

Virgin Galactic Passengers 19 Speed Mach 3 Altitude 60000ft+ Range Not yet available Cost Not yet available

Boom Overture Passengers 88 Speed Mach 1.7 Cruise altitude 60000ft Range 4250 nautical miles Cost $200m

Will there truly be a demand for such machines? In addition to passengers flying to business meetings or on holiday Kachoria imagines his jet will be useful to mid-ranking employees or engineers. Say you have a car factory where something goes wrong on the production line: “You’re losing $100m a day and you need a specialist engineer fixing that problem right now. You do the math that’s an awful lot of money if the problem is not fixed.” Then there will be those who just want to show off. Private jets have always had bragging rights but a supersonic private jet? “It’s a fantasy for some” says Kachoria.

Fantasy indeed. Aerion’s AS2 had a price tag of $120m. Spike’s S-512 will cost around the same. By contrast the most spacious private jet on the market today Gulfstream’s G700 costs $78m. Then there is the upkeep. Maintenance is going to be “at least double what the Gulfstream private jets are because you’re burning the engines at a much higher temperature and much higher pressure” says Kachoria. A Gulfstream can cost anything from $1m to $3m a year to maintain — and that’s excluding fuel which will be a significant cost when travelling supersonic.

But the biggest issue is less a matter of price and more a question of physics. Concorde could only ever fly supersonic over the sea. The noise that the plane created when it passed the sound barrier was so loud that it was banned from supersonic flight over land in the US. Lockheed Martin working in tandem with Nasa thinks it has found a solution with its X-59 QueSST prototype. A demonstration model will take to the air in 2022 and the aim says Lockheed Martin is to establish “an acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard and address current regulations banning commercial supersonic travel over land”. The plan is to create a noise that is less a boom and more “a gentle thump” (at 66 decibels the X-59 should sound no louder than a car door being slammed shut next door).

It is less a sonic boom and more ‘a gentle thump’

If the supersonic ban is repealed in the US that would open up some of the world’s most popular private routes. At least an hour could be shaved off the New York to Los Angeles route. And trials in the US could convince other regulators that supersonic travel in their airspace is safe. While many countries have not banned supersonic passenger jets any new aircraft would still need regulatory approval. That would be critical to travellers in Asia and the Middle East where private jet usage in particular is growing rapidly. To further reduce noise both outside and in Spike has also designed its S-512 without passenger windows. Instead LCD screens run right down each side of the plane which can be used for work and entertainment or the showstopper to provide an unbroken view of the sky outside the plane virtually opening its walls on to the roof of the world.

But making supersonic aircraft more efficient is about more than merely reducing noise. If private jet and frequent flyers are already under fire because of their carbon footprint then what of executives flying supersonic to Dubai for lunch? Some supersonic aerospace firms have foreseen this future PR disaster and have pledged to go carbon neutral. Once its S-512 is in the air Spike wants to start work on a “hybrid” supersonic jet before developing a liquid hydrogen model. Virgin Galactic’s jet will have engines designed in collaboration with Rolls-Royce that use “state of the art sustainable aviation fuel” it says.

Boom is talking about Overture flying on commercial routes as soon as 2029. United Airlines has an agreement to purchase 15 supersonic jets from Boom Supersonic. Blake Scholl the founder and CEO of Boom believes a gap in the market has opened up after airlines spent the past year retiring large Boeings and Airbuses. “People’s tolerance for long painful flights has gone down” he says. Yes business travel might take a while to return but leisure travel will bounce back: “You don’t want to go on vacation on Zoom. You don’t want to fall in love over Zoom.”",,,,,,

The first-person shooter launched in March 2020 just as the pandemic lockdown left people looking for something to do with their unexpected free time. It offered a bit of a cathartic release at a time when we needed it most. Developed Id Software didn’t stop there. Since then the game has gotten two DLC expansions and a whole bunch of updates giving players more reasons to rip and tear.

That’s culminated in the game’s newly released next-gen upgrade which gives players one more excuse to revisit the shooter. Those who enjoyed the game on past-gen consoles can now see it in a whole new light — literally — thanks to ray tracing boosted graphics options and more.

I spoke to Doom Eternal executive producer Marty Stratton and lead engine programmer Billy Khan about the creative process that comes with upgrading a game for new consoles. Both emphasized that technology and art have to go hand in hand.

Balancing tech and art

For gamers who love boosting games to the max there’s plenty to get excited about in Doom Eternal’s new update. The game can run a ray tracing graphics mode at 1800p/60 frames per second (fps) on new consoles. It can hit HDR 10 in any graphics mode and reach 120 fps when playing at 1800p on an Xbox Series X. It’s all incredibly impressive but Khan notes that high settings aren’t enough to make a great experience.

“It doesn’t matter how good your tech is if it’s not being pushed by the art and design teams” Khan tells Digital Trends.

The intersection between art and tech was at the forefront of the conversation. For the Doom Eternal team making the jump to next-gen wasn’t about arbitrarily maxing out graphics; it was about giving designers and artists more freedom to strengthen their creative vision.

“We feel the game looks amazing as is” says Khan. “We just wanted to enhance the sections where the artists felt like they wanted to do something but couldn’t. If you play the game you can see the experience now is enhanced. You can look at the glass in Sam’s base or see a Mancubus around the corner. It wasn’t like we wanted to make a technological change and crank everything up; we always want to make sure what we’re working on is meaningful to the player.”

That’s an important distinction for Stratton who’s been with Id Software since 1997 and has gotten to watch the Doom series evolve from generation to generation. A lot has changed in that time including Id’s entire design philosophy when it comes to chasing new technology.

“The design used to follow the technology in Id’s way-back history” says Stratton. “I would say it’s a little bit more balanced now. The designers artists and technologists all elevate each other along the way.”

Designing for ray tracing

Out of all the technological boosts present in the new update ray tracing was especially significant for the team. The rapidly evolving tech significantly buffs lighting effects in games allowing for better reflections. It may sound like a minute change but it opens up a world of possibility for artists.

“The art was made for the capabilities we had before” says Khan. “If you look at the ray tracing build the artists were tweaking their assets for the capabilities we have now. Ray tracing gives you more lighting options and reflectivity on surfaces that we weren’t able to do. When we talked to the artists they said that ‘there are some spots in these levels where I toned it down but I wanted to go back and tweak those!’”

Getting to revisit the game’s lighting in that way had Doom Eternal’s designers thinking about what they could have done differently when initially building the game.

“There were cases where combat designers were saying ‘Oh man if I had this beforehand I would have placed this character in this spot so I could see them in the reflection!’” says Khan. “That situational awareness is another skill level we could have had. Seeing those things evolve as we go further and having those technologies from the beginning is going to let us make the games better.”

“I think you always feel like you could do something different with new technology whether it’s faster load times or ray tracing” says Stratton. “We might have done materials slightly differently if it were built from ray tracing from the ground up. From a design perspective there’s probably things you would do a little differently.”

There’s still more work to be done on Doom Eternal. The studio just canceled the game’s planned multiplayer Invasion mode but will be creating a new single-player mode to replace it. There’s also a current pain point with the PlayStation 5 version as players aren’t able to carry their PS4 saves over at the moment. Stratton says that Id is “going to do what we can” to address the issue.

For the time being continued Doom Eternal support is still a main focus for Id but Khan acknowledges that it’ll have to pick a stopping point eventually and start looking forward. When asked if all the work on next-gen consoles has the team excited about Doom’s future Khan laughs and teases “I think he’s asking us if we’re working on a new game… .” (Alright you got me.) While there was no news to share on the studio’s next project Khan did offer a bit of wisdom about making games in today’s day and age.

“There’s a famous quote: ‘Art is never finished it’s abandoned’” says Khan. “It’s the same thing here. You have to be comfortable saying there’s always more we can do. All the knowledge and lessons we learned will transfer to allow us to make better games in the future. And it doesn’t stop on the technology side.”

Its big selling point is its USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface which enables transfer speeds up to twice as fast as a USB 3.2 Gen 2 card reader. That might just sound like marketing hyperbole but in the case of the best CFexpress cards you really do need that extra data bandwidth to exploit their maximum read/write speeds.

Thanks to its new super-fast USB connection the Lexar Professional CFexpress Type B USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Reader boasts read speeds of up to 1700MB/s - enough to genuinely max out a CFexpress type B card in a way almost no other reader can. Included with the reader is a 30cm 2-in-1 USB Type-C to USB Type-A cable as well as a USB Type-C to Type-C cable.

But hold up! There's just one rather large problem here. While this card reader may be USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 capable chances are your computer is not. Currently there are only a handful of desktop PC motherboards which support this USB variant and your only other option is to purchase a specialist - and uncommon - PCI Express add-in board in order to add a pair of USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 ports to your existing PC tower.

You can of course connect this card reader to a much more commonplace USB 3.2 Gen 2 port but then the reader will operate at Gen 2 speeds so you loose any speed advantage.

The only other 'solution' is to connect to a USB 4 port as featured on the latest Apple M1 Mac computers or a few of the latest high-end PCs. This is because USB 4 is backward-compatible with USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (and all other versions of USB 3). But this begs the question: why didn't Lexar simply make a USB 4 card reader in the first place instead of the soon-to-be-obsolete final revision of USB 3?

And in case you're now totally confused about the infuriatingly and needlessly complicated USB 3.x naming system don't worry so are we! So here's a handy table to help us all out:

The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 therefore has a completely new case compared to the ThinkPad T14s Gen 1. The exterior of the new ThinkPad notebook looks completely different than the predecessor at least if you buy the aluminum model in ""Storm Grey."" Since that model is currently not available in Europe we are looking at the model in classic black.

In the new model the black color is slightly brighter leaning more towards dark-gray and now there is also a silver Lenovo logo on the back of the lid. There are more changes inside the lid. The speakers are now placed prominently above the keyboard. Directly next to the speakers is the power button which now also includes a fingerprint reader. In addition Lenovo has adjusted the shape of the palm rests below the keyboard in order to integrate the new flat TrackPoint buttons. As always colorful accents are formed by the red TrackPoint silver hinges and the ThinkPad logo.

Compared to the predecessor the haptics have slightly changed since Lenovo has changed the black surface covering which is supposed to show less fingerprints and smudges. This works fairly well and the surface layer is slightly more matte and grippy than that of the ThinkPad T14s Gen 1. The materials below the surface also reveal a change: the case bottom is now made from aluminum instead of magnesium. The palm rest and display cover continue to be made from magnesium and carbon fiber respectively. The combination of the different materials ensures a high - although not perfect - stability. It resists pressure on the palm rest without any trouble and the ThinkPad T14s 2021 also resists pressure on the back of the display well. The bottom of the case can be twisted slightly by pushing and pulling in opposite directions and the same goes for the display lid.

The hinges give no reason for complaint allowing for an opening angle up to 180 degrees. The display can be lifted with a single finger and the metal hinges hold the display tightly in place.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Despite the radical new ammunition designs the program seems to be a hit. According to reporting by military.com the Army expects to choose one of the three entrants early in 2022 and fielding the winning design sometime afterward.

The Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapon program will replace both the M4 and the M249 with new rifles—and a new round. Here’s why special operations love it.

NGSW

The Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program will service not only the Army but also Special Operations as well including the Green Berets and the 75th Ranger regiment. In an interview with military.com a USSOCOM spokesperson said that “we [USSOCOM] are an enthusiastic supporter of the Army’s 6.8mm Next Generation Squad Weapons.”

As I previously wrote the NGSW program aims to replace both the M4 carbine and the M249 SAW platforms with two new weapons. Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems submitted designs that include magazine and belt-fed designs.

According to the Army the NGSW program aims to make individual solders deadlier at greater ranges. “The NGSW program significantly increases lethality and probability of hit at the squad level.” The M4 and M249 replacements will use a new type of ammunition as well replacing the venerable 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm NATO standards. The Army hopes their new projectile will be superior. “Due to the nature of the General Purpose ammunition the 6.8mm projectile will outperform even the most modern 5.56mm and 7.62mm ammunition. These weapons will give Soldiers significant capability improvements in accuracy range signature management and lethality.”

Lightweights

Significantly the 6.8 mm intermediate round won’t be like traditional brass-cased ammunition. The three companies in the NGSW program use different ammunition cases including a plastic composite case a hybrid brass-steel case and a plastic telescoped cartridge. These exotic-looking cases are an attempt at weight savings despite using a heavier round to allow individual soldiers to carry more ammunition without having to hump around extra pounds.

The more modest of the designs a brass-steel hybrid round might be the most promising. The cartridge case is mated to a steel base with an aluminum washer that the manufacturer Sig says shaves off 20% of cartridge weight. The base is subjected to a lot of stress during firing and a steel base could provide a good combination of light weight and durability.

General Dynamic’s case is likely even lighter thanks to doing away with brass entirely opting for an almost-entirely plastic case. A small band of metal along the case rim probably adds additional strength. Plastic cases might not be a strong as traditional brass though.

Textron Systems’ telescoped cartridge is perhaps the most ambitious and complicated. Textron’s design buries the 6.8 mm bullet inside the case (which is also made of plastic) for a shorter overall case length. Like the General Dynamics’ case polymer ammunition may not preform as well under prolonged firing.

Despite the radical new ammunition designs the program seems to be a hit. According to reporting by military.com the Army expects to choose one of the three entrants early in 2022 and fielding the winning design sometime afterward.

Mercy Fort Smith will spend $162 million to expand its emergency room intensive care unit and the infrastructure according to a Wednesday news release. The project will expand the hospital's ER from 29 rooms to 50 and its ICU capacity from 38 to 64 allowing the hospital to increase its annual ER capacity from around 40000 to roughly 75000 said hospital president Ryan Gehrig.

Construction on the project will take roughly 2½ years once it begins in February 2022 Gehrig said.

The expansion was part of a ""four-year journey"" book-ended by money given to the hospital after its administrative staff presented a business case to Mercy's ministry stewardship committee Gehrig said.

It was granted to expand an ER seeing 55000 patients per year -- roughly 37% more than it's designed to take Gehrig estimated. He also estimated about 24% of patients leave the area for care and the hospital is ""caring for more and more complex patients"" than before.

Gehrig also said Mercy's ER receives more complaints than any other part of the hospital.

""We exist solely to serve the community and respond to their needs and today our facility is limiting our ability to do that. We're going to address all those issues through the project"" he said.

While the push for money the project began years before covid-19 Gehrig said hospital staff learned how to separate infectious and noninfectious patients. The number of ICU beds will more than double the number of rooms that can support ventilators and the building automation system incorporated into the structure will enable floors or pods to be turned into isolation areas the release states.

The expansion will add 140 parking spaces the release states.

The hospital will require more staff and providers as the hospital expands Gehrig said. While he couldn't estimate how much staff will grow he said they'll be added as the hospital expands.

The hospital will also assess whether the expansion will allow it to add to the 48 doctor's residencies it will have once the program is fully functional. Gehrig said the residency program and its partnership with Arkansas Colleges of Health Education ""plays into"" the expansion.

Kyle Parker CEO of Colleges of Health Education anticipates the school will be able to expand its residencies through the expansion.

""Mercy is passionate about creating doctors"" said Parker.

Gehrig also estimates the jobs added to the hospital from the expansion will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact. Tonya Sarlls vice president of operations for the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce said the announcement is ""timely"" with the June 3 announcement the Air Force selected Ebbing Air National Guard base in the city as the location for Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II training and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon housing. The project is estimated to generate close to $1 billion in yearly economic impact and bring around 825 people to the River Valley.

Flynn turned 90 earlier this month and is showing no signs of slowing down.

“I think seniors need to get involved” said Flynn. “They say if you retire you expire. You’ve got to be out there doing something.”

Flynn had a humble upbringing in Pennsylvania where her father deserted her family when she was very young and left her mother alone to raise them. When her mother broke her back falling off of a playground swing Flynn and her siblings were put into a youth home. Her mother eventually recovered and came to work as a laundress at the children’s home.

“She stayed right there in another building and we were allowed to see her for two hours every Sunday” said Flynn. “But she had no say in our upbringing.”

Flynn was taken from the children’s home by her sister and brought to Michigan where she first attended Lincoln High School but then went to Catholic school in Detroit at Nativity of Our Lord.

“I started smoking when I was at Lincoln so my sister Gertrude said she would straighten me out so I went to live with her on Holcomb Street in Detroit” Flynn said.

She never imagined when she got her first job sweeping the floors at MOPAR when she was over the age of 40 she would still be working at age 90. For 27 years she was a wife and a mother to seven children until a divorce prompted her to seek employment.

“I got a job sweeping the floor at what was then the MOPAR warehouse” said Flynn. “MOPAR was part of Chrysler at the time and they paid for you to go to college if you got a C or better so I decided to go to school. I ended up getting a degree in human resources with a concentration in labor studies from Oakland University after I got an Associates Degree from Macomb Community College. I was 45 when I first went to college.”

While Flynn was working at MOPAR in Warren it was bought by General Dynamics Land Systems. She worked there for 18 years first in maintenance and then in the office.

“I was driving a big scrubber and I knocked something over while I was driving it so they promoted me” Flynn said. “They were like ‘get her out of here’ and I was working in the office which was a whole new thing to me.”

Flynn worked at General Dynamics for 18 years during which time she formed a company golf league and became president of the management club.

“When I retired from there in 1994 I had to do something” said Flynn. “That’s when I decided to run for public office.”

With the support and encouragement of her second husband John Adleman Flynn ran for a spot on the Macomb County Board of Commissioners and lost her first bid but won election the second time she ran. Flynn served on the Board of Commissioners for 18 years until 2011 when she retired.

“When I was on the Board it was at a time when seniors were really worried about having their Social Security taken away and I wanted to fight for the seniors because I was a senior and there are a lot of us in Macomb County” said Flynn.

Just as she could not sit idle when she retired from General Dynamics she could not stay home after retiring from the board. She became the City of Warren’s Community Outreach Coordinator in 2011 and currently hosts Senior Update and Life is Good on TV Warren. In 2018 she was elected to the Macomb College Board of Trustees; her term expires in December of 2024.

“I’m still very outspoken” said Flynn. “Last night at the MCC meeting they were buying chairs from Utah and I said “You mean to tell me there is no place in Michigan where we can buy chairs for a better price?’ And everyone thinks ‘She’s a rebel’.”

She maintains her message to seniors to stay active and involved.

“I feel there is an opportunity out there no matter how old you are” said Flynn. “Get involved; even if you just get involved by going to a meeting.”

Outside of work and her political endeavors Flynn stays active physically and mentally. She plays golf every week at Maple Lane Golf Course she likes to bicycle is an avid gamer plays the organ and has completed several adult coloring books. If you peek in her garage you will see her new white Dodge Challenger.

“I always keep my mind going and I do have a Canadian Club cocktail every night” said Flynn.

And as important as her career has been to her Flynn remains very family oriented. Her second husband died in 2014 but she has seven children 15 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren. A tall narrow Christmas tree in her home office displays ornaments with each of her descendant’s names and pictures. As active as she is she admits there are days when she feels all of her 90 years.

“If I run the vacuum cleaner I have to rest for the remainder of the day” said Flynn only half joking.

The secret to her longevity she says is being a glass-half-full person and focusing on the positive.

“If you do right by people you will have a good life” said Flynn. “Don’t hold that bitterness in. That is the worst thing anybody can do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tYnJpdHRhaW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQzOTg5MDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Brittain Obituary (2021) - San Diego Ca CA - San Diego Union-Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/john-brittain-obituary?id=14398908 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2pvaG4tYnJpdHRhaW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTQzOTg5MDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy80NDcyMS1oZWF2eS10YWN0aWNhbC12ZWhpY2xlcy1rdXdhaXQtZm9yZWlnbi1taWxpdGFyeS1zYWxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heavy Tactical Vehicles ~ Kuwait Foreign Military Sale,"The US State Department has approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of Heavy Tactical Vehicles to the Government of Kuwait.

This proposed sale will improve Kuwait’s capability to meet current and future threats by providing tactical logistics sustainment and transportation support to the country’s Land Force Support Command. HEMTT Wreckers provide the capability to recover disabled wheeled vehicles. The other HEMTTs include Fuel Tankers and Guided Missile Transporters to perform resupply missions. The HEMTT and Palletized Load System trailers transport bulk supplies to include fuel ammunition spare parts and rations. Kuwait will use these heavy vehicles to transport and support heavy equipment including their legacy M1A2 tanks and their new M1A2K main battle tank slated for delivery in 2021. Kuwait will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and the associated services into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.

The principal contractor will be Oshkosh Defense LLC Oshkosh WI for HEMTTs HETs PLS trailers and support. The sub-contractor for commercial 635NL trailers will be Fontaine Trailers Springville AL. The sub-contractor for trailer flat racks will be Etnyre Oregon IL. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.

Implementation of this proposed sale will require the assignment of ten to fifteen (10-15) embedded US contractor representatives to Kuwait for duration of a five (5) year programme to provide training field service representatives fleet support program management and facility construction oversight. There will be no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale."

Why is Gen Z staying on the sidelines during the best job market in decades?

U.S. businesses hired 692K workers in June and 3.1 million YTD. Yet there are still > 9 million unfilled job openings. “Many employers still can’t find enough workers” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said in a Bloomberg interview “and they don’t know why.” Among the different demographic groups Gen Z stands out as the most unwilling group to jump back into the job market. Let’s take a closer look.

Higher Gen Z jobless rate

Gen Z has nearly 2x the unemployment rate of older generations. During the pandemic outbreak the overall unemployment rate was ~11.5% while Gen Z was >23%. As of June the overall unemployment rate dropped to <6.0% while Gen Z remains > 10%.

There are many explanations for why young people struggle to find and retain employment. According to Forbes the top reason cited by employers is work ethic. Today’s younger workers may not be as emotionally prepared for the workplace as previous generations.

Alternative sources of income

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius cites unusually generous unemployment benefits which in some cases exceeded minimum wage as an obstacle for hiring managers. Even as the number of new jobless claims dropped to a pandemic low of 364K in the week ending June 26th the number of beneficiaries that continued to receive unemployment benefits is double pre-pandemic figures.

At the same time more and more young people became interesting in investing. A new GOBankingRates survey found that 71.96% of Gen Z investors started investing within the last six months. Unlike older generations who opt for long-term investments many Gen Z investors are aiming for short-term profits using risky strategies such as day-trading option-trading cryptocurrencies meme stocks and SPACs. About 40% of Gen Zers check their investments every day.

Robinhood has been instrumental in attracting Gen Z investors. With a free mobile app free stock for referrals no paperwork and seamless execution Robinhood removed many barriers to entry for first time investors. Over the past five years Robinhood users increased eight-fold. The average age for Robinhood users is 31 while >30% are under 24.

Power approval comfort and control

According to Tom Brooks Head of Marketing at Guidant Global Gen Z workers are confident in their abilities and have the drive to succeed but they often suffer from career anxiety. They are willing work hard and in return expect a lot particularly when it comes to flexible work schedules company culture and technology. They value freedom and flexibility at work and look to managers for direction and structure but not necessarily approval. They also want to contribute to corporate culture and technology matters. Although Gen Z is concerned about financial security it is purpose energy and culture that motivate them. In short Gen Z’s attitude towards work is quite different from previous generations.

With rapid technology advancements transforming our world in recent years perhaps it should come as no surprise that younger workers would approach work with a different mindset.

Kevin G. Jackson who has been serving as interim chief commercial officer since January will continue in this role on a permanent basis. Mr. Jackson also will remain president of the company’s snacking and beverages division.

Prior to joining TreeHouse in February 2020 Mr. Jackson was with the J.M. Smucker Co. where he held numerous roles of increasing responsibility across sales and marketing during his 17-year tenure including senior vice president of the US retail sales and North American food-away-from-home division. Earlier he was a senior brand manager at Brach's Confections and at Constellation Brands.

He received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado and a master’s degree in business administration from the New York Institute of Technology.

Meanwhile Sean Lewis has been promoted to senior vice president and chief customer officer reporting to Mr. Jackson. He also will join the executive leadership team.

Mr. Lewis joined TreeHouse in August 2019 as vice president of sales national and regional West. Prior to joining TreeHouse he spent nearly 20 years with Kraft Heinz and Nabisco where he held several regional district category and business lead roles with increasing responsibility including the development pursuit and leadership of customer relationships to achieve revenue share and distribution growth and optimal shelving. Earlier he was customer vice president for the West area at Mizkan America.

He received a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix.

“Over the last few years we purposefully structured our commercial organization to become more customer centric and to make it simpler for customers to do business with us” said Steven T. Oakland president and chief executive officer of TreeHouse Foods. “These appointments represent an important evolution of this commitment and I am confident that Kevin and Sean are well suited to build on our past progress and drive our commercial organization forward as we execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders.

“Kevin has been a valuable asset to TreeHouse and his contributions will be important to further developing our commercial vision aligning the organization and driving our revenue objectives; while Sean will serve as a key voice with our customers solidifying top-to-top relationships and refining and optimizing our sales processes in support of Kevin's efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va3JvYy5jb20vcmVtZW1iZXItdGhlc2UtNDAtZGlzY29udGludWVkLWFuZC1zcGVjaWFsLWVkaXRpb24ta2VsbG9nZ3MtY2VyZWFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remember These 40 Discontinued and Special Edition Kellogg's Cereals?,"""K-E-double-L-O-double-good Kellogg's best to you…""

That was the Kellogg's cereal jingle you probably heard on TV. Very catchy very easy to remember and a diabolical earworm that appealed to both kids and adults.

Kellogg's had a handful of cereals aimed at the adults but let's face it...over the last 100+ years they had more pre-sweetened kid cereals than any other cereal company.

A Kellogg's Cereal for Everyone's Taste

There was a Kellogg's cereal to suit everybody's taste with two of them still around after 100 years: All-Bran and Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The Kellogg's Company was founded in 1906; but before that when Dr. John Kellogg was operating his Battle Creek sanitarium he had already created one cereal: Granose Flakes in 1895. He started the Sanitas Food Company in order to sell Granose and less than ten years later it was pushed aside by the Kellogg's Company.

Many others have survived the decades like Rice Krispies (1928) Raisin Bran (1942) Frosted Flakes (1952) Special K (1955) and Apple Jacks (1965).

These days Kellogg's is promoting themselves as ""one of the original plant-based well-being companies"".

Kellogg's has also discontinued many of its cereals over the past 100+ years. I've selected 40 former Kellogg's cereals from throughout the 1900s into the 2000s with one going as far back as 1895. Take a look at the gallery below.

LOOK: 40 Discontinued & Special Edition Kellogg's Cereals",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvY2FsbHMtZm9yLXB1ZXJ0by1yaWNvLWluZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1maWxsLXVuLWhlYXJpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calls for Puerto Rico independence fill UN hearing – The Militant,"UNITED NATIONS — Nearly 20 speakers from organizations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. testified at a June 18 U.N. decolonization committee hearing speaking out on the devastating consequences of U.S. colonial rule for the Puerto Rican people.

The committee adopted a resolution introduced by Cuba’s revolutionary government supporting “the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence.” Puerto Rico has been a colony of Washington since U.S. troops invaded the island in 1898. Working people there serve as an important source of superexploited labor for U.S. pharmaceutical and other bosses.

Puerto Ricans face catastrophic effects of “more than 15 years of economic depression” said Juan Dalmau general secretary of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. On top of that he said is “an unpayable debt” of $74 billion.

Speaker after speaker described the sharp cuts in living standards dictated by the Financial Oversight and Management Board — known in Puerto Rico as the junta. It was imposed by the Barack Obama administration and U.S. Congress in 2016 to ensure debt payments to the wealthy bondholders.

Trilce Torres of the Gran Oriente Nacional a longtime pro-independence Masonic lodge reported that “the junta has ordered increases in water and electrical utility rates and highway tolls; cuts of up to 10 percent in retirement pensions; slashing our public university’s budget to less than half of what it was.”

Others pointed to the failure of the U.S. and colonial governments to rebuild basic infrastructure since Hurricane María devastated the island in 2017 cutting off electrical power for nearly a year. Periodic blackouts continue today.

“Puerto Rico was particularly hard hit by the pandemic” noted Gabriela Malespín of New York Boricua Resistance. And with the recent blackouts hospitals “continue to go in and out of power even with back-up generators ruining needed hospital equipment. Access to doctors hospitals and critical health care on the island remains dire.”

Malespín called for abolishing the U.S.-imposed junta and canceling Puerto Rico’s debt. She said Puerto Rico needs a government “that prioritizes the needs of the working class.”

Myrna Pagán a resident of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques denounced the lack of medical facilities there since its one hospital was destroyed in the hurricane. Today she said there is only “an improvised facility in a storm shelter” and inadequate transportation to get emergency cases to the main island.

The colonial rulers’ response to the pandemic has magnified the social crisis in many ways — from high joblessness to a yearlong nightly curfew that was only lifted last month. As part of the government-imposed lockdowns schools from preschool to university “have remained closed for the last 15 months” reported Estelí Capote of the Socialist Front. In addition she said 43% of the island’s schools have been shut down over the past 10 years.

Edwin Ortiz from Call to Action on Puerto Rico and other speakers denounced the recent handing over of the public electric utility to a private U.S.-Canadian company Luma Energy. They noted that this has already dealt blows to the UTIER electrical workers union and will hike electric rates.

‘Cancel the debt!’

Martín Koppel speaking for the Socialist Workers Party in the U.S. underscored the fact that “working people in Puerto Rico are not helpless victims — they are responding.” He pointed to the island-wide protests against the privatization of the electrical authority a recent successful strike by dairy plant workers and ongoing protests by independent truckers. He joined the call to demand Washington cancel Puerto Rico’s debt.

Koppel added that “a successful fight for Puerto Rico’s independence from Washington’s rule will also strengthen working people in the U.S. We face a common enemy — the U.S. ruling capitalist class their government and their parties Democrats and Republicans alike.”

“We can’t make the mistake of believing that the election of a Democratic president in the U.S. will advance decolonization in Puerto Rico” said Manuel Rivera of Puerto Ricans United in Action. “Democrats and Republicans alike have treated Puerto Rico the same way — like a private plantation.”

Several speakers rejected the so-called Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act a bill sponsored by Democrats Nydia Velázquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a fraud. It “gives the U.S. government the power to approve or disapprove of our choices” on Puerto Rico’s status said Ben Ramos of the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign. It “proves our colonial domination.”

At the end of the hearing Cuban Ambassador Pedro Luis Pedroso introduced the resolution in support of Puerto Rico’s right to independence which the U.N. decolonization committee adopted. Pedroso affirmed the Cuban revolutionary government’s longstanding solidarity with the struggles by Puerto Ricans.

Later that day participants from the hearing joined a rally called by ProLibertad under the theme “Solidarity with Puerto Rico and Cuba: Two Wings of One Bird.” Some also attended a “dinner-dialogue” in the Bronx sponsored by the Frente Independentista Boricua (Puerto Rican Pro-Independence Front).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2xvZ29zLm5ldC9sb2dvcy92aWV3LzUzMTgvTWlsd2F1a2VlX0J1Y2tzLzE5NjkvUHJpbWFyeV9Mb2dv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milwaukee Bucks Logo - Primary Logo - National Basketball Association (NBA) - Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page,Tip: Use your left and right arrow keys to quickly scroll through our Milwaukee Bucks logo historyPlease credit SportsLogos.Net if using these logos for blog news or social media graphics

In August of last year Biden spilled the beans about GM's plans for a future all-electric Corvette creating social media buzz across Twitter.

Well he's done it again.

On Thursday Biden tweeted a 4-minute video featuring former Michigan governor and now Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and White House Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy riding in a Chevrolet Bolt EV talking about the benefits of EVs and touting Biden's proposed infrastructure plan known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework.

The Bolt's appearance was not product placement in fact GM executives were ""surprised"" by it said Jeannine Ginivan GM's manager of public policy communications.

“We obviously are very excited that they used the Bolt to promote this"" Ginivan said. ""But we were not involved.”

GM should be thrilled because the video has about 836000 views so far. The Bolt got the starring gig by happenstance said Seth Schuster a spokesman for the White House which produced the video.

The car is part of the U.S. Department of Treasury's fleet which was located right next to the White House. McCarthy's office is also in the White House.

As it turns out Granholm is very familiar with the car too. After she gets into the vehicle she quickly asks McCarthy ""Have you ever driven a Chevy Bolt before?""

McCarthy says yes noting they are in the federal fleet. Granholm says ""I have a Chevy Bolt. That is my car. I lease a Bolt and I lease solar panels so I drive on sunshine girl.""

""You are such a show-off"" McCarthy says jokingly. Then she says ""EV's are it. That's where the future is going and I'm so glad we can support it.""

The White House used the Bolt in the video to demonstrate ""President Biden’s commitment to electrifying the federal fleet and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and build up America’s EV infrastructure"" Schuster said.

There are 122 Chevrolet Bolts in the fleet that are leased by the General Services Administration Schuster said. The Biden administration will continue acquiring EVs that meet the needs of agencies he said.

When Biden tweeted the video he wrote ""Folks I’m a car guy — and I firmly believe the future is electric. Gina McCarthy and Secretary Granholm hit the road to talk about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework’s historic investments in electric vehicles and how we’re going to ensure the future is made in America.""

About 12:35 Thursday afternoon GM CEO Mary Barra responded to the president's tweet by retweeting it and writing that GM was ""loving your ride. At GM we want to bring #everybodyin on the all-electric future which includes creating EVs that are affordable stylish and especially fun to drive! The Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan can be an important part to create this future.""

More:There are dozens of projects in this US infrastructure bill: Is your town's in there?

Both Barra and Ford Motor Co. have signaled support for the EV push in Biden's infrastructure plan which includes a call for tax incentives consumer rebates and other measures to spur development and sales.

“It’s been exciting to see this Administration as enthusiastic about an all-electric future as we are"" Barra said in an email to the Free Press. ""I agree with Secretary Granholm and Gina McCarthy when they say 'EVs are it!' ""

GM has said it aspires for all its light-duty vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2035.

Currently the only EV GM sells is the Bolt EV car and the Bolt EUV a small electric SUV. They are built at Orion Assembly in Lake Orion.

But later this year GM will launch the GMC Hummer EV pickup and has promised to deliver a total of 30 new EVs to market by 2025 including a Hummer EV SUV and the Cadillac Lyriq SUV both coming next year.

To encourage EV adoption Biden wants to build a national network of 500000 charging stations along highways in rural and disadvantaged communities. That's why the White House did the video Schuster said.

""This was a key provision of the Jobs Plan carried through in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework"" Schuster said. ""So the White House decided to continue showcasing EVs in a new digital video with McCarthy and Energy Secretary Jen Granholm.""

As part of Biden’s commitment to addressing climate change in January he signed an executive order to transition the federal fleet to zero emission vehicles Schuster said. As of 2019 the federal government had about 645000 vehicles in its fleet with only a few thousand being electric.

It's Being Recalled Together With The Cadillac SRX,"An improperly adjusted toe link could become loose and lead the SUVs to sway or wander at highway speeds

General Motors has issued a recall involving 380498 examples of the Cadillac SRX and its sister model the Saab 9-4X.

In a recall notice with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration General Motors says that certain SRX and 9-4X models could have received improper servicing requiring adjustment of a rear suspension toe link. In rare instances dealers or independent repair shops may not have followed the automaker’s procedures for torquing the jam nut in the toe link adjusters to the proper specification.

Consequently the toe link can become loose over time and if it does cause the vehicle to sway or wander at highway speeds or allow water or other corrosive elements to enter the threads within the adjuster. General Motors adds that in rare cases the link could separate altogether increasing the risk of a crash.

Included in the recall are 380362 Cadillac SRX vehicles produced between April 14 2009 and January 29 2016 as well as 136 Saab 9-4X models built between February 1 2011 and September 13 2011.

Drivers of affected vehicles could receive all manner of alerts relating to the issue including a Service Traction Control message Service Stabilitrak message Service Rear Axle message and may see a Stabilitrak malfunction indicator lamp flash or stay on.

To fix the issue General Motors dealerships will simply replace the adjustable toe link with a design that prevents adjustment. The automaker will reimburse any owners that had repairs carried out to the toe link prior to the recall. Owners will be notified on August 9.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8wNy9uby1tb3JlLWNkLXBsYXllci1pbi1nbS1wYXNzZW5nZXItdmVoaWNsZXMv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA3L25vLW1vcmUtY2QtcGxheWVyLWluLWdtLXBhc3Nlbmdlci12ZWhpY2xlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No More CD Player In GM Passenger Vehicles,"Back in May of 2019 GM Authority listed the very small number of GM vehicles fitted with a CD player either optionally or as standard. In February of this year we returned to the subject with a reader poll pointing out that CD players were now available only in the 2021 Chevy Express van and its corporate cousin the 2021 GMC Savana.

Readers rent their garments in twain in the comments section of each article and we expect a similar response to the news that no GM passenger vehicle will be available with a CD player for the 2022 model year. In case you missed it check out our recent article about this item being discontinued as an option in the 2022 Chevy Express and the 2022 GMC Savana.

Those were the last models to feature this increasingly neglected item of audio equipment. It had previously been discontinued in the redesigned 2021 Chevy Tahoe 2021 Chevy Suburban 2021 GMC Yukon 2021 GMC Yukon XL and 2021 Cadillac Escalade.

In fact it’s still possible to buy a GM product in the United States or Canada with a CD player but one would need a better reason than that to make a purchase. The vehicles in question are the 2021 Chevy Silverado Medium Duty trucks – the 4500HD 5500HD and 6500HD – and the 2021 Chevy Low Cab Forward trucks. All of these are commercial vehicles and therefore of little interest to most GM customers.

It is now overwhelmingly common for a vehicle to be able to play music stored on a smartphone through Bluetooth Apple CarPlay Android Auto or even a simple USB cable although this is cold comfort to anyone who does not have a smartphone but does have a CD collection. Of course it’s possible to transfer many CDs’ worth of music on to a single memory stick but this is more appealing to some people than others.

Both GM Authority and our sister publication Cadillac Society have received from comments from readers complaining about the disappearance of CD players from GM passenger vehicles. Here are some examples:

“I have a large CD collection that I carried with me in my old Sierra. I just got a brand new 2020 Sierra and disappointed to realize a CD player isn‘t offered.”

“Why isn‘t there a CD player? The sound system in this car is incredible when I play radio but would be better if I could play CDs. I don‘t want to use a phone.”

“I would have liked to have the option for a CD player. I realize many use their phone for music but I still want to play my CDs on this Bose Panaray system.”

This is a major issue for some people and a matter of no importance whatever for others. Feel free to express your own views in the comments section but play nice.

Open banking has the potential to transform payments in Saudi Arabia. What open banking does is provide third parties with access to a bank’s systems and customer data in order to create new products and services. This access significantly lowers the barriers to entry for financial technology (fintech) startups and unleashes their potential to innovate and disrupt.

The Saudi Central Bank (previously known as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority or SAMA) has announced the launch of an open banking framework expected to go live in 2022. The announcement underscores the country’s commitment to diversifying its financial-services sector a key objective of Saudi Vision 2030 and a step toward making the country a regional and global fintech hub.

Open banking has significant implications for incumbent banks which have traditionally monopolized payment services. They must rethink their business models to remain competitive in the new era in which financial services will be embedded in customer experiences such as self-checkout and “buy now pay later” products. They will need to abandon their conventional model in which the bank is the sole producer and distributor of products and services. Banks will have to rethink their strategies moving from the traditional pipeline optimization model to a co-creation platform model that involves different players in the ecosystem. Numerous countries already have open banking initiatives underway offering some lessons for Saudi policymakers incumbent banks and fintechs as they plot their course in this new environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JjNzYyZjllLWJhZTYtNDc5NC04MzdiLTE3ZDI1MWY3MGQwOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emirates spearheads airline industry attack on credit card fees,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Herbert Prochnow an American banking executive and noted toastmaster once described a public servant as someone who hires someone to do the work that they were hired to do. Former British prime minister Tony Blair thought that bureaucracy was great at managing things but not great at changing things. Amid a new debate over public sector pay analysis from The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age has found Australia’s top bureaucrats are earning vastly more on average than their international counterparts with more than 25 of the nation’s senior public officials paid more than $1 million last year. Public sector wages have come into sharp focus as the nation’s economy recovers from a coronavirus-induced recession and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe encourages federal and state governments to pay their civil servants more to put more upward pressure on private employers to give larger pay rises. But federal parliamentarians department secretaries and other high-ranking officials have had their current level salary frozen for another year following a decision by the Remuneration Tribunal citing slow wage growth nationally and the post-pandemic economic recovery. A new analysis by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age of the nation’s top officials in security culture finance health and transport has found Australian bureaucrats are among the most generously paid in the world. Australia’s domestic spy boss Mike Burgess’ 2020 salary is almost $586000 including superannuation and long service leave entitlements. That is almost double that of both the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency director and FBI boss and well ahead of the British government’s intelligence chiefs at MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6.

Home Affairs department secretary Mike Pezzullo earned $918000 last year which is almost double the $519000 that his British counterpart the permanent secretary to the Home Office received. Executives at government-owned entities NBN Co Australia Post and Snowy Hydro were seven of the top 10 highest-paid public servants last year with Stephen Rue taking home more than $3 million as the chief executive of the company that oversees the national broadband network. Paul Broad the managing director of Snowy Hydro the electricity generation and retailing company that owns manages and maintains the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme was paid $2 million with a $934000 bonus almost doubling his base salary last year. Only the take-home $6.29 million salary of the head of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the boss of the nationalised Air New Zealand Greg Foran ($3.38 million) topped the Australian pair in 2020. Loading Mark Machin who was chief executive of Canada’s biggest pension fund resigned amid a scandal in February after he jumped the COVID-19 vaccination queue by flying to the United Arab Emirates against his government’s travel advice. The NBN – which paid out almost $78 million in personal bonuses last year – has been at the forefront of criticism of generous pay packets. The organisation had seven people in the $1 million-plus club last year including two chief customer officers the chief financial officer chief network deployment officer and chief strategy officer.

Two former Australia Post executives Christine Holgate and Bob Black were paid $1.6 million and $1.5 million each with Mr Black jumping to fourth on the list by virtue of a $640000 termination payment. Outgoing chief of the Inland Rail project Richard Wankmuller was paid $1.5 million including a $450000 bonus while Raphael Arndt chief investment officer at Future Fund Management received $1.4 million – almost half of which was in bonuses. Alison Tarditi chief investment officer at Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation received $1.2 million – with $607725 of that in bonus payments. Several department secretaries hit the million-dollar mark last year courtesy of generous redundancies packages following a restructure of the federal public service. Services Australia’s former secretary Renee Leon and deputy chief executive John Murphy both took home in excess of $1 million as did Heather Smith (Industry Science Energy and Resources) Mike Mrdak (Infrastructure and Transport) and Martin Parkinson (Prime Minister and Cabinet). The decision of ABC managing director David Anderson to take a temporary 5 per cent pay cut in 2020 resulted in him falling further behind his contemporary at Britain’s free-to-air public-service television network Channel 4 who was paid $1.6 million last year. The equivalent job at the BBC paid $1.14 million.

Mr Anderson was paid $1.14 million in the 2018-2019 year including a base salary of $799000 $73000 in superannuation and $266000 for long service leave. Mr Lowe who as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia was paid $1.085 million earned twice as much as his contemporaries at the Bank of Canada the US Federal Reserve. While Mr Lowe’s base salary is higher than all of his contemporaries the Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey received a total salary package of $2.8 million. But defenders of the current rate of pay of Mr Lowe point out that it is significantly less than the bosses of the big four banks. In November 2020 the federal government announced a review of performance bonus arrangements for senior executive staff in the Commonwealth public sector and made clear that agencies that had access to bonus arrangements should exercise restraint to “the furthest extent possible in keeping with community expectations”. An interim report released in March included a recommendation that new guidance be developed to ensure authorities remain accountable for bonus payments taking into account that some entities and companies operate in a commercial environment. The review is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks. Assistant Minister to the Minister for the Public Service Ben Morton signalled during the early stages of the pandemic that public servants needed to “share the economic burden” while “communities are doing it tough”. Labor’s assistant spokesman for government services Kimberley Kitching said Australians don’t mind public servants being paid fairly but the top of the public service had become “Morrison’s Millionaires’ Factory”.

“In this lost decade of Liberal rule the most senior snouts in the trough have been gorging themselves on grotesquely fat salaries” Senator Kitching said. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from the March quarter showed public sector wage growth of just 1.5 per cent over the past year — the lowest on records going back to the late-1990s. Economists have argued in favour of widespread pay increases particularly for teachers nurses and police otherwise private sector pay packets will need to rise to get wage growth to the 3 per cent-plus level. Defenders of the current level of pay point out that Australians overall are well paid by global standards with the average realised pay of an ASX top 100 company boss about $4.5 million a year. By comparison public sector leaders often responsible for much larger budgets and higher staff numbers than ASX 100 companies are compensated modestly. Andrew Podger a professor of public policy at the Australian National University and former public service commissioner said the salaries of senior public servants had languished until the 1990s when they were enhanced by two political decisions. Firstly they received a 20 per cent increase in exchange for loss of tenure and five-year contracts under the Keating Government and secondly the Howard government introduced performance bonuses averaging about 10 per cent of base pay. When the bonuses were later scrapped the average was built into the base pay rates.

Gallo 27 is hitting .234 with 46 runs batted in. He played in the 2019 All-Star Game and hit a solo home run that ended up being the deciding run in a 4-3 American League win.

The game will be played July 13 at Coors Field home of the Colorado Rockies.

Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game to Colorado from Atlanta in response to a voting law passed by the Georgia legislature.

The Rangers also had three all-stars in 2019 when Mike Minor and Hunter Pence were also selected. Prior to that three Rangers had not made the team since 2013 (Nelson Cruz Yu Darvish and Joe Nathan).

How do we navigate things that break our spirits as well as our bodies?

Until 24 years ago my life was uncomplicated. I was a wife a mother of three and an emergency room nurse. Then at the age of 45 I was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and given a prognosis of three to five years to live. As I began to research this horrific disease online I read that it was like “living in a glass coffin” and “being buried up to the neck in sand.” It was an unimaginable and frightening prospect. I began having night terrors. How would I get through this darkness to find light again?

Ironically years before as a student nurse I worked in rehabilitation with people who were injured and disabled. I was young and struggled to feel competent and at ease in this setting. Now it dawned on me that perhaps my progressing paralysis might be a life lesson about walking in more challenging shoes. Well here were the shoes and they didn’t fit. It was one particular morning after driving my son to hockey I came home parked in the garage and closed the door with the car still running. Kenny Rogers was singing I Will Remember You on the car radio. I didn’t want my family to watch my decline. Thirty minutes passed. I felt lightheaded. I felt guilty and I felt sad. I had three beautiful kids. I turned off the engine.

I had to make sense of this. I felt a desperate need to help the world understand ALS. Lou Gehrig’s famous last run around the baseball field waving goodbye was a romantic notion for a very unromantic disease. No one saw “the luckiest man in the world” being suctioned turned or tube fed.

I turned to the universal language of music. Inspired by the Tears Are Not Enough recording that called on Canadian musicians to raise money for famine relief in 1985 I too would invite musicians to do the same for ALS. In my naïveté I found courage. I was politely bold and I was driven. I felt lifted. In 2001 the first Elizabeth’s Concert of Hope was held in Hamilton. It led to 17 concerts over nine years from coast to coast and would raise $2.5-million for ALS research and support services.

During the fifth year of organizing these concerts – and with little time for thoughts of my own looming fate – I was suddenly reawakened to it. One day reality arrived on my doorstep. It was deluxe and slick. It was a big black electric wheelchair a “mobile monster” with headrest tilt ability and a “sip-n-puff” option. The breezy nature of those delivering the chair was in stark contrast to the darkness of my thoughts. It was steel and powerful and as it rolled into my world I felt my own power slipping away. I felt guilty. I knew I should be grateful. When they left I sat on the stairs and cried myself silly. Then I continued organizing concerts.

Two years later I received devastating news. I was on the phone when my sister came to my house. Her face was pale and stricken. She told me to hang up and then she told me my eldest son was dead. He was 25 years old an artist an athlete an honour student at Capilano University. My world stopped. Profound grief trumped everything. To survive the days I once again sought refuge in denial imagining my boy coming home hearing his voice “Hi Mom!”

I was committed to the concerts and to my grieving family but there was no rule book on prioritizing. I watched my marriage disintegrate my children withdraw and my life implode. I was left alone with my devoted service dog my best friend Kira. Darkness descended and the night terrors flourished. I dreamt the artists were burying me alive in sand. I slept with the lights on.

A few years later an old friend from my teen years happened to drop by. We were both struggling and lonely. I had become numb to feelings but he brought kindness and comfort and we shared our stories. The months passed and we became loving partners our challenges cushioned by our connection. He carried laughter and light to my darkest moments.

I am lucky to have survived ALS for 24 years and although it still shadows me it’s no longer intrusive. My physical decline has been slow and thoughts of ALS are replaced by precious memories. The painful grief of my son’s death has settled deep inside. The tidal waves of sadness rise less often and I mostly feel a quiet peace. Perhaps a portion of that peace is age and wisdom and I want to believe that some of my weakness is just age. Still a recent event has led me to believe in miracles the ones that come to the right place at the right time; unexpected blessings that can make suffering cease altogether and the will to survive even stronger.

Last March I was going through old photos making albums for my two adult children and one for my late son the one I will keep. My youngest son came to the house and asked me to sit with him in the living room. I was anxious by his formal request.

He spoke slowly and gently “You have a 15-year-old granddaughter we’ve never met.”

I was tearful as I listened to him explain that one year before his death his brother unknowingly fathered a child. My son explained that the results of his sibling DNA were a positive match and this young girl wanted to meet us; she was hungry to know about her biological father. My hope was tempered.

Two hours later my new granddaughter arrived with her Mom and Nana. Our tears flowed. When she smiled I saw my son in her face. She had his eyes his chiseled features and most notably his serenity. This bright beautiful girl brought my son home. They stayed until evening. As they were leaving I offered her my son’s beige corduroy jacket that I had kept. It was a tad big but she wrapped it tightly around her small frame and wore it home. Two weeks later I received a beautiful handwritten letter telling me that we were the missing piece in her life and how filled-up she was to have found that piece.

“There is a crack” Leonard Cohen wrote “a crack in everything that’s how the light gets in.”

Over the last 24 hours the Royals have traded both Alcides Escobar to the Washington Nationals and Kelvin Gutierrez to the Baltimore Orioles for cash considerations.

#Nationals are indeed getting Alcides Escobar from the Royals. They're sending cash. Escobar was in KC for part of their rebuild and won the 2015 World Series. Named ALCS MVP in '15. Ned Yost liked to refer to him as a shark because he didn't appear to have bones/was very durable — Maria Torres (@maria_torres3) July 3 2021

We have traded INF Kelvin Gutierrez to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for cash considerations. #Royals — Kansas City Royals (@Royals) July 3 2021

As former Royals beat writer Maria Torres notes Alcides Escobar does not need introduction to Royals fans. The longtime Royals shortstop was voted an All-Star in 2015 when he would later go on to win a Gold Glove ALCS MVP and be a core cog in the 2015 World Series victory machine. The Royals acquired him earlier in the year for middle infield depth and has hit .274/.311/.452 in 133 plate appearances for Triple-A Omaha. Escobar has not played in a MLB uniform since 2018.

Kelvin Gutierrez was originally acquired in 2018 from the Nationals in exchange for Kelvin Herrera. Gutierrez spent 2018 in the minor leagues and made his big league debut in 2019. After only 24 combined games played at the MLB level in 2019 and 2020 Gutierrez finally got an extended look in 2021 after injuries and underperformance opened the door. Unfortunately for Gutierrez he looked wholly overmatched. In 38 games he hit .215/.254/.296 while playing poor defense at nearly 27 years of age. Five days ago the Royals designated him for assignment. He will now be shipped off to the Orioles where he will once again serve as depth behind Maikel Franco.

Both Escobar and Gutierrez were traded for “cash considerations” which is a fancy version of saying that the Royals sold the rights to their professional services for money. Neither deal is liable to impact the big league club significantly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvY293Ym95cy9uZXdzL2RhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lzLW5ld3MtZmlyZXdvcmtzLTI0NS1yZWFzb25zLWNlbGVicmF0ZS1zcG9ydHMtZm91cnRoLW9mLWp1bHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas Cowboys Fireworks: 245 Reasons To Celebrate Sports Fourth of July,"Fourth of July be damned around here in terms of DFW sports it’s all red white and boo.

Happy Birthday America’s Sports!

Good news: In 2021 sports returned.

Bad news: As they’ve done since 2011 Dallas-Fort Worth teams receded.

After a cheer-less 2020 thanks to COVID this year is much more festive. Sports are back. Fans in the stands. Championships being won.

At least that is in some parts of the world and most of America. But in DFW our decade-long “lockdown” – a pandemic of playoff pratfalls – drags on.

Fourth of July be damned around here it’s all red white and boo.

Fireworks? Sure. Victory cigars? Sorry.

It’s been 3677 days since the Dallas Mavericks vanquished the Miami Heat and we last celebrated a championship. How long ago was June 11 2011? Re-visit those iconic photos of the Mavs on the victory stage hoisting the Larry O’Brien trophy in Miami’s American Airlines Arena.

Dirk Nowitzki has retired. Rick Carlisle has resigned. Don Carter passed away. Donnie Nelson was fired. Mark Cuban remains of course. But none – zero – of the players from that roster remain in the NBA much less in Dallas.

The one player who is still here is back … as the head coach: Jason Kidd.

Even with superstar Luka Doncic producing eye-popping record-setting statistics the Mavs haven’t won a playoff series in 10 years. Their failure has friends.

The Texas Rangers haven’t flirted with a title since that same 2011 when Nelson Cruz failed to catch thefly ball in Game 6 of the World Series in St. Louis. The Dallas Cowboys haven’t won two playoff games in the same season in a quarter century. The Dallas Stars made an inspiring run to 2020’s Stanley Cup Finals but flubbed the encore by missing the postseason and remaining 0-for-this-millenium.

The bigger picture unfortunately isn’t much more positive.

America used to dominate. But what once was Mike Tyson (boxing) and Lance Armstrong (cycling) and Pete Sampras (tennis) and Mike Modano (hockey) and Tiger Woods (golf) hogging championships has slowly deteriorated into first place being owned by a bunch of foreigners named Tyson Fury and Egan Bernal and Novak Djokovic and Nikita Kucherov and Jon Rahm.

Not long ago we set our watches by the championship appearances of LeBron James and Serena Williams but both were recently knocked out of their first rounds of the NBA Playoffs and Wimbledon.

The NBA’s last three MVPs have been from Serbia (Nikola Jokic) and Greece (Giannis Antetokounmpo). We lost the Ryder Cup. The Davis Cup. We won’t win the Tour de France. We’ve only won one World Baseball Classic. We never sniff advancing in the men’s World Cup. We’re not even a lock any longer to win sailing’s America’s Cup.

Of course all is not lost. The Olympics beckon in Tokyo in three weeks. And if all else fails we’ve won the last 13 July 4th Hot Dog Eating championships thanks to Joey Chestnut.

We may have to squint a little harder to see them but there are still countless reasons to be proud of American and DFW sports. On this Fourth of July – between the burgers and bikinis – take time to admireand appreciate each unique candle on this homemade 245-candle cake.

Here’s hoping it reminds you how fortunate we are to have a variety of sports and the freedom to choose which ones we love and/or loathe.

Couple that with the overall market decline and you’ll notice that his cards are down 50% in the past 50 days; now is the time to buy.

We all know how incredible he can be at the plate. In last year’s shortened season he posted a 202 wRC+ a feat only achieved by Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire in the last 30 years. Despite his power numbers being down to this point in the season he’s someone whose cards you should be buying any time they dip like Apple stock. My guess is that his play rebounds in the second half and so do the value of his cards. If you can get your hands on his cards do it now. I mean he’s Juan Soto.

Will Smith – Bowman Chrome Auto: $160

I am not a huge fan of projecting the value of catchers when it comes to either fantasy or cards. That being said I have two of them on this list – Will Smith and Gary Sanchez. Smith is fun to watch a top three catcher in my opinion and I think he only gets better.

He has improved his framing and positioning behind the plate which is great but offense is what sells sports cards. Rest assured this man can hit. My hunch is that Will Smith’s “clutch factor” goes a long way for the Dodgers in the playoffs this year. This is a slightly more long-term flip; think buy now and look to sell in three to four months as the Dodgers approach the playoffs.

Sandy Koufax – 1955 Topps PSA 5: $2100

We are turning back the clock for this card. Sandy’s 1955 PSA graded cards are down an average of 33.1% across all grades. The good thing about cards like Sandy’s is they have a consistent history to follow. If we look at each dip in the market we see one Hall of Famer dip more than the rest. Usually that is due to a big collector getting out of the hobby.

I am not certain that this is what is driving Koufax’s cards down but he is a card that is worth the investment and most likely worth a long-term hold. If Juan Soto is Apple stock Koufax is a mutual fund. If you are looking for a safe investment graded Koufax cards are a good place to put your money."

The second half of 2021 won't be as strong as the first half Goldman Sachs said in a Friday note.

The S&P 500 will end the year flat as markets navigate higher interest rates the note said.

These are the top stocks to own in the second half of 2021 according to Goldman Sachs.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Investors should not expect another strong six months for stocks after the S&P 500 finished the first half of the year up about 15% Goldman Sachs said in a note on Friday.

Instead the stock market is likely to consolidate sideways for the next six months as investors navigate higher interest rates. With the 10-year US Treasury yield currently at 1.43% Goldman expects it to climb to a cycle-high of 1.9% by the end of the year.

That expected surge in interest rates will likely weigh on high growth stocks and benefit cyclical stocks the bank said. To benefit from the market setup going into year-end Goldman recommends investors buy stocks that have short duration high growth investment ratios and pricing power according to the note.

While long duration growth stocks have outperformed their short duration value stock counterparts in recent weeks Goldman expects this trade to reverse especially if its forecast for higher interest rates materializes.

Some well-known stocks in Goldman's short duration basket include Ford CVS Intel and AT&T.

""Companies that have consistently invested for growth have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date and are best positioned to continue growing despite the expected slowdown in economic activity"" Goldman said.

Some well-known stocks in Goldman's high growth investment ratios basket include Facebook Alphabet General Motors and Costco.

""We recommend investors focus on stocks with high pricing power as demonstrated by their high and stable gross margins. High pricing power stocks outperformed in 2018 – 2019 as wage growth accelerated and profit margins declined"" Goldman explained.

Some well-known stocks in Goldman's high pricing power basket include Activision Blizzard Etsy Procter & Gamble and Adobe.

Goldman outlined its expectations that while the S&P 500 will end the year at 4300 it will jump 7% to 4600 by the end of 2022 as the unemployment rate falls to 3.5%.

“An outgoing funny personable dependable caring friend.”

Hometown: London England / Burke Virginia

Fun fact about yourself: I have visited 43 Countries which is almost 20% of the world!

Undergraduate School and Degree: University of Arizona- BA in Political Science

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? PayScale – Customer Success Manager

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? Goldman Sachs – Dallas TX

Where will you be working after graduation? Goldman Sachs – Private Wealth Financial Advisor

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School: Rugby Club Captain United Way Metropolitan Dallas- Homeless Outreach Support Program SMU MBA Admissions Ambassador Black graduate Student Association member Marketing Club member.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I was part of a two-person group in a practicum course that had us analyze the stock market pick a value stock perform a deep dive analysis on the company and the valuations and pitch the stock to a panel for the SMU school endowment to buy. Working long nights and weekends with my partner (big shout out to Marco Peña) we pitched the SMU endowment a stock they in turn purchased. Since our presentation the stock has grown 28%! This was a great way to really get our hands dirty and put all the educational aspects of the class into real world application.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? I’m most proud of securing my job at Goldman Sachs. I was very unsure of what I wanted to do as a career and I knew pursuing my MBA would help me decide that. Although I had a lot of thoughts my older brothers (Donald George and Henry) gave me some good advice to never pigeonhole myself and keep all options open. I’m not much of a finance guy when it comes to excel tabs and doing calculations but I was infatuated with the stock market love interacting with different people from all walks of life and really enjoy personal finance. After speaking with family peers SMU faculty and staff and SMU alumni I finally found my calling. I spoke with over to 35 financial advisors which led me to realize being a financial advisor fit me like a glove. From there I told myself if I am going to do this I have to do this right and went straight for the cream of the crop. Four rounds of interviews later I landed what is renowned as the best job on Wall Street with the best firm on Wall Street.

Why did you choose this business school? I chose SMU for the family aspect feel. Out of the gate there is a feeling of the next person has my back like I have the next person’s back. SMU Cox did a great job of meshing personalities that fit well together interlocking different professional experiences as well as future aspirations. Most of our classes involved group work which is a great representation of how the real world is but my classmates faculty and staff were able and willing to help no matter what. That family ambiance of wanting to see students succeed at all costs is what made SMU such an easy choice.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? My favorite professor was Maribeth Kuenzi. She was very tactical in her teaching—having students not only understand the concepts she was teaching but the ability to use them out in the real world. She taught her classes in a way that makes students able to see different angles problem-solve in unique ways and think in ways we have never done before. I really enjoyed her courses and her teaching style. As I always say…Shout out Maribeth!!!

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? The Boulevard. Pre-COVID we used to get together as a business school and tailgate together before home football games. This tradition allowed us to get to know our classmates in a different setting. Most importantly it allowed us to bond with the entire SMU Cox community (Professional MBA One-year MBA Alumni etc.). We even had some companies that were recruiting come and set up next to our tailgate which was very unique and showed how much SMU wanted us to succeed no matter the setting.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I would get to know the second-year class a little more. Networking is such a big dynamic while getting your MBA. Even though I connected with some second-year students during my first year I would have liked to get to know more of them before they graduated to understand how they were able to navigate the tough waters when they were in my shoes a year ago.

What is the biggest myth about your school? Financial firms only recruit within their own state or region. It was always a myth that the bigger financial firms especially out of NYC only go to Harvard Wharton Columbia NYU etc. to recruit. This was far from the truth when I arrived here. Within our first days on campus our Career Management Center team already had a very structured schedule of who was going to be on campus when they would be here and different contacts within the firm that we could reach out to and start networking with. Companies are looking for bright ambitious reliable candidates that will bring value to the company no matter what school they are from.

What surprised you the most about business school? My personal growth most surprised me. Coming into business school I thought this would be similar to college. It was a whole different ball game but in a good way. I started to see a change in my business skills interpersonal skills problem-solving abilities and an overall different way of thinking. I knew coming to business school I would be furthering my education but I was shocked at how much I grew as an individual.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I leveraged my uniqueness when applying to SMU. I was not born in the USA; I went to an all-boys military academy (Fork Union Military Academy) for 6 years and had traveled and seen other cultures around the world. Being able to convey being different and looking at the world from a different view allowed me to gain an edge during the application process and showed SMU Cox that I wasn’t a “regular” candidate. I could bring something unique and diverse to the table.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? It’s hard to choose just one but I would have to say Sabrina Nayeb. Sabrina embodies the word business but makes it look easy! While being in school full- time she has businesses in the DFW area that are thriving at an alarming rate. She isn’t afraid to speak her mind or be the first to come up with a unique idea. She is kind funny generous sociable and the true definition of GIRL BOSS!

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? Not going to lie it was tough. Being in lockdown trying to stay safe monitoring the pandemic and continuing school was a hard task! SMU did a great job adapting to make the switch seamless but it was hard not only on the students but the faculty and staff as well. This was a good lesson for myself and my classmates to show how quick things can change and the ability to adapt quickly and continue moving forward.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? Definitely my parents (Mercy and Andy Sr.). Both of my parents are from West Africa and didn’t have much growing up but they have worked EXTREMELY hard over the years to become successful in life. I was able to see first-hand all the hard work they put in and a common denominator (in my family at least) was to always further your education. All the materialistic things in the world can be taken from you one day but nobody can ever take your education away from you. Doing business is a something everyone is going to encounter so why not be the best at it they asked. My parents really showed me the benefits of “school after school “and it became a standard in our family to learn about business work to be the best at it and thrive in your respective careers.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list? My top two items on my professional bucket list are the following: 1) Work and live in another country for at least 2 years in order to continue to expand my cultural awareness; and 2) Work tremendously hard and become successful so that I can retire early and spend more time with my family.

What made Andy such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“I am pleased to recommend Andy Tembon for consideration as a Poets & Quants MBA Best & Brightest 2021 honoree. Andy started with Cox in fall 2019 and is currently an active student in the Cox’s School’s Two-Year MBA program. He will be graduating this May and beginning his post-MBA career at Goldman Sachs in their Consumer and Investment Management Division. I have the unique perspective of having worked with Andy throughout his admissions process as well as the later segment of his career coaching experience at Cox. We first met in Seattle when he was applying to MBA programs. He immediately stood out from other candidates with his passion for developing sincere connections and uplifting those around him. Throughout his employment history and engagement in college Andy showcased this innate ability to build relationships among peers and colleagues. At the onset of his college career he took initiative to launch an on-campus event management organization to enhance student connectivity within a large public institution. During his pre-MBA career Andy continued to utilize his emotional intelligence to focus on developing thoughtful client solutions and increasing retention. At SMU Cox Andy has continued to build community by serving within multiple social and industry clubs including Black Graduate Student Association Marketing Club and captaining our Rugby Club. He has been active as an MBA Admissions Ambassador by hosting applicants and connecting with newly admitted candidates.

When I transitioned to the role of an MBA career coach Andy once again stepped up to volunteer his time to support our new first year MBA cohort this past fall through virtual coffee chats and recruiting interview exercises. The advice he shared in his experience navigating a career pivot into private wealth management as well as adjusting to virtual networking was integral to our student success during this ongoing pandemic. Outside of Cox Andy dedicates time to United Way Metropolitan Dallas where he contributes in outreach and support of our local homeless population. Andy has been an asset to the Cox community and the community beyond campus. His ability to remain true to himself and share his contagious enthusiasm with those around him has undoubtedly enhanced our culture. What sets Andy apart is his authenticity and drive to empower those around him to achieve success.”

Brendan McDermid | Reuters

From Krispy Kreme to China's Didi Chuxing the busiest week for U.S. IPOs in 17 years produced a windfall for Wall Street's top investment banks. A cybersecurity company drug developers and a Turkish e-commerce platform were all in on the action. At least 14 companies raised $100 million or more in offerings on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange the most active stretch for debuts since 2004. In total underwriters generated close to $400 million in fees for assisting with the IPOs. They're sitting on an additional $259 million in paper gains as of Friday's close assuming they exercise their options to purchase all of their allotted shares at the IPO discount. The pace of offerings underscores the demand for growth and shows that IPOs remain the preferred route to the market despite the rise of direct listings which have no underwriters and come with much lower advisory fees. It's a highly lucrative business for Wall Street and there's no slowdown in sight.

Robinhood filed its IPO prospectus on Thursday and is poised to be one of the biggest offerings of the year. Surging demand for crypto assets led to a quadrupling in first-quarter revenue to $522 million while the company's loss swelled to $1.4 billion in part because of an emergency fundraise tied to GameStop trading mania. The stock trading app will likely command a premium valuation on the market while simultaneously playing a broader role in the IPO boom by giving retail investors a way to invest in deals that historically targeted big institutions. Robinhood is reserving up to 35% of its IPO shares for customers. ""I think this is going to be one of the greatest meme stocks of the future"" Thomas Peterffy chairman of Interactive Brokers told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""They have negative equity they have roughly zero earnings and they're growing fast. So it's the kind of thing the market seems to like lately. I'm looking forward to them coming into the community bringing more and more people into the market.""

Goldman Morgan JPM the big winners

In the past week's IPOs underwriting fees ranged from 2% of the total amount raised in the case of ride-hailing company Didi's massive financing to 7% for smaller deals like the offerings from health companies CVRx Aerovate Therapeutics and Acumen Pharmaceuticals. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  as usual reeled in the highest fee revenue by serving as the lead managers for the IPOs of Didi and cybersecurity software vendor SentinelOne  the two biggest offerings of the week. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were the lead underwriters in the IPO for Turkish online shopping company D-Market Electronic Service & Trading legal services site LegalZoom and Krispy Kreme which were the week's third- fourth- and fifth-biggest offerings respectively.

In addition to advisory fees underwriters also make money on IPOs by getting the option to buy stock at the offer price so they can benefit from the pop that typically ensues. Not all of last week's offerings had big initial rallies but they all led to gains for the banks that were in position to receive an allocation. Even with Didi's muted gains in its first three days of trading the stock's 11% rise means that underwriters are up $66 million if they exercise their options. The paper gains on SentinelOne sit at $46 million after that stock jumped 27%. Manufacturing marketplace Xometry climbed 58% in three days producing potential gains thus far of $26 million while airport security company CLEAR has delivered an increase of $34 million after jumping 53%. For Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan the record IPO stretch comes a week after the two banks were the leads on the IPOs for health-tech company Doximity and cloud software vendor Confluent . Those two offerings paid combined underwriter fees of $74.7 million and the Doximity deal included stock allocation that's produced $83 million in gains based on the IPO pop. However Confluent took the unusual step of not issuing underwriters the option to buy at the IPO price. The company highlighted the potential significance of that decision in the risk factors section of its prospectus: ""Without this option the underwriters may choose not to engage in certain transactions that stabilize maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our Class A common stock such as short sales stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales to the extent they would have engaged in any such transactions had we granted the underwriters such an option"" Confluent said. Doximity CEO Jeff Tangney told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that while an IPO was the right choice for his company he's glad to see the rise of direct listings and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) as alternatives because the competition is bringing down the costs. Doximity paid a fee of 5.5% of the offer size which is about inline with this year's average but below the top rate of 7%. ""It improved the economics for us"" he said. ""Banks are charging less and doing more which is good.""

Connecticut's Old State House in Hartford. (CT General Assembly/CT.gov)

HARTFORD CT — OK ... how can a significantly historic building right smack in the middle of the capital city be hidden? Now think about how many times residents went zooming past Connecticut's Old State House on their way to a hospital a sporting event a business meeting or the ""new"" center of government without even thinking about it.

Yes ... the Old State House is a Hidden Gem. The circa 1796 building is the very spot where Connecticut's democracy was born and visitors learn about how it happened and who made it happen.

But it's also about ""360-degree democracy"" which means the displays are interactive and designed to make visitors think about the history and where they fit into democracy themselves. And academics aside there are light-heated displays like a two-headed calf Mark Twain's bicycle and dozens of other pieces of Connecticut's ""amazing and eccentric history.""

And there's added incentive to visit the Old State House in 2021 because until Sept. 6 Connecticut children 18 and younger plus one accompanying adult can visit participating museums free of charge through the Connecticut Summer at the Museum program. The Old State House is run by the Connecticut General Assembly.

Should that pace continue this year would be the third-most deadly since 1985 topped only by the 55 murders recorded in 1994 at the height of the gang wars in the capital and the 44 murders in 2003 when an arson at the Greenwood Health Center killed 16 in a single night a Courant review of historical police data show.

The large increase in homicides in 2021 follows a massive spike in nonfatal shootings in the capital last year and tracks with a national trend of increased gun violence and homicide rates in cities across the country over the past 18 months.

Those trends began well before the police reforms proposed in the wake of protests following George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis and even before the COVID-19 pandemic reached the U.S. in March despite broad consensus that the massive disruptions to everyday life prompted by the virus likely have played some role in increased violence.

The violence has rattled neighborhoods across the city especially in the Upper Albany and North End areas where homicides have been most concentrated. Police and community-based groups have poured new resources into their shooting prevention and response teams.

“This was a heartbreaking spring for our community and it’s no comfort that what we’re seeing here is happening all across the country. And one of the challenges is that there’s not one single or simple cause” Mayor Luke Bronin said Friday.

“We have seen some group-driven retaliatory cycles of violence which we work hard to interrupt but we’ve also seen so many personal conflicts or minor disputes that escalate into gun violence as well as several tragic domestic disputes. “

A 3-year-old gunned down

The increase in homicides has been further intensified by especially violent incidents and on three days so far this year — Jan. 29 April 10 and June 9 — the city recorded two homicides within hours and in one case even minutes of each other.

On April 10 3-year-old Randell Jones was shot and killed in the back seat of his mother’s car when three people pulled up in another car on Nelson Street and opened fire on a man in the front passenger seat. They missed — killing Randell and triggering hours of chaos across the North End as gunfire erupted multiple times and police scrambled from scene to scene while neighbors looked on in shock.

Just two hours later and less than a mile away 16-year-old Ja’Mari Preston was killed in a hail of gunfire behind a home on Magnolia Street. Police have indicated the two shootings were connected and officers found about 75 shell casings at the scene from various different weapons including rifle rounds.

Hartford Police Chief Jason Thody said the increase in homicides and other violent crime has frustrated officers over the past year and a half. “Even though the detectives are doing such a great job solving these quickly I think you get a feeling of desperation that you’re not doing enough” he said.

The afternoon of June 9 Sylvia “Pebbles” Cordova died while cooking dinner when gunfire from an AK-47 rifle ripped through her first-floor apartment on Sisson Avenue after missing its intended target on the street outside. Just 20 minutes later 22-year-old Trelique Ward was killed in an apparent drug sale or robbery gone wrong on Kent Street that was unconnected to the Sisson Avenue incident police records show.

Emotional vigils have pulled friends family and neighbors from their homes to grieve with the rest of their community. Anguished mothers and siblings tended to impromptu memorials sprouting up throughout the city instead of actual spring gardens.

Bronin Thody detectives and teams of violence prevention specialists grieved alongside families at those vigils and pledged to do all they could to stop the violence. But on many occasions those families called on community members themselves to step in.

After a year that turned the word “unprecedented” into a cliché families of victims pleaded with young people mourning their friends to see that the violence is not preordained and can be stopped.

“The T-shirts are nice the memorials are nice but it’s time for this to stop being normal” a crying Malaika Hardrick told attendees at a vigil for her slain son 19-year-old Makhi Buckly. “It’s time for us to get un-numb feel all of it all that hurt and pain feel all that anger feel all of it. Don’t be scared of it.”

“I want y’all to get tired because we can’t lose one more Black man” she continued. “Who will carry us on? Who will carry on this legacy that we’ve been robbed of?”

Prevention a challenge

Police have made at least one arrest in each of those high-profile cases except Ja’Mari’s and three involved multiple shooters.

Randell and Ja’Mari’s deaths also appeared to involve members of loosely connected street groups that detectives believe have driven “a lot” of the violence in the capital city over the past several years according to Thody and a series of court records reviewed by the Courant. Those groups are closer in nature to friends from the same blocks than they are to older organized gangs like the Latin Kings or Los Solidos which makes the new groups much more difficult to track and disrupt Thody said.

“The officers know most of the players most of the people who are involved” Thody said. “The trick is being able to predict the next shooting and what we can do to prevent it; can we get someone in custody that we know is ramping up whether that’s based on street intelligence social media just watching the cameras and seeing who’s moving around certain areas or someone’s crossed a line in an area they shouldn’t be.”

But even when detectives know who is most at risk to either commit violence or be a victim of it it is not always possible to interrupt those crimes before someone is hurt.

On Memorial Day 19-year-old football standout Makhi Buckly was shot and killed during an apparent gun trade gone awry in the backyard of a Southwest neighborhood home. Buckly’s death came as a particular shock because he was the grandson of Carl Hardick who has dedicated his life to street-violence prevention work throughout Hartford.

Police have arrested and charged Buckly’s former football teammate 18-year-old Jaquan Graham with evidence tampering and weapons offenses in connection with the murder. Graham is one of those young men connected to street groups whom police followed over the past several years and he was implicated in the murder of 71-year-old grandmother Yvonne Smith in October 2019 while he was still a juvenile. Graham was under house arrest and around-the-clock GPS monitoring when Buckly’s murder occurred in the backyard next to Graham’s court records show.

Detectives began to expand how they respond to shootings both fatal and nonfatal last year when shootings with injuries rose precipitously at the end of last summer and into early fall. More than a dozen state police detectives descended on the city to help Hartford investigators review incidents follow leads and catch stolen vehicles which are often used in these violent crimes.

The department has further expanded that this year by assigning several detectives to work specifically as a shooting response team plus weekly intelligence meetings and shooting review meetings with top command staff the morning after every shooting incident.

Those efforts are being supplemented by community-based violence prevention groups like COMPASS Peacebuilders and Hartford Communities That Care some of which have increased their manpower in recent months and may be able to obtain more funding under President Joe Biden’s new gun violence prevention program that will send some COVID-19 relief money to such organizations.

“Our officers and community partners are working around-the-clock to prevent and solve these shootings working hand in hand with state and federal partners” Bronin said. “Our police have made arrests in eight out of the last twelve homicides and have taken nearly one hundred and fifty illegal guns off the street so far this year which is tremendous work — and sends a powerful message that if you engage in gun violence in our city you will be caught and you will pay a heavy price.”

Hartford is not alone

Both the increase in homicides and the combination of police and community group responses to the violence match the trends being recorded in cities across the country where violent crime generally is beginning to rise again after falling for decades to historic lows in the early 2010s from the highs of the early 1990s.

A study by the Council on Criminal Justice of 32 cities across the country — not including Hartford — found homicides rose 24% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and 49% over the first quarter of 2019. Yet despite the 2020 increases the homicide rate in those cities was only a little over half of what it was 25 years ago the study found.

Although crime stats can fluctuate dramatically from year to year the increase in Hartford homicides so far in 2021 is the largest annual increase since 2015 when the city ultimately recorded 32 murders. The city also recorded 33 murders in 2009 32 in 2008 and 31 in 2007 historic police data show.

But those data also show the city generally records about as many murders in the second half of each year as the first and should that hold true in 2021 the capital is on pace to reach 40 murders for only the third time in the past 35 years.

Stemming that wave of violence will require a mix of both law enforcement and community-based interventions officials and community leaders said.

It also demands more involvement from community members themselves to help spot potentially explosive situations before they occur and help police track down perpetrators who are often involved in repeated acts of violence once violent incidents do happen Thody and Bronin said.

“I have noted certainly a lot more cooperation from neighborhoods and community members and I do think that while crime was lower people kind of took an attitude that it’s fine ‘It’s not really affecting me’ and they were less likely to get involved” Thody said this week.

“I do think now as we’ve seen these increases the people who live in these neighborhoods are fed up and we are seeing a lot more people stepping up telling us ‘Hey I got video’ or ‘I got a ring camera I saw this I saw that.’ Which if there is a light at the end of the tunnel I guess that’s something you’d consider.”

Steven E. Sims 41 was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident in the 900 block of West County Road 700-S in Salamonie Township.

Philip Zahm Huntington County's chief deputy coroner said Sims was struck — reportedly in or near the abdomen — by shrapnel from a mortar tube explosion about 12:20 a.m.

""An initial investigation into the incident determined the mortar shell exploded inside the tube causing the pressure to breech the side of the tube and striking the victim"" Zahm wrote in a news release.

Efforts to resuscitate the Blackford County man were unsuccessful.

JOE Season,"Hasbro and World of Tanks: Modern Armor Partner Together for New World of Tanks G.I. JOE Season

World of Tanks: Modern Armor launched a new 1980s G.I. JOE themed season in partnership with Hasbro on 29th June. The season known as World of Tanks: Modern Armor: G.I. JOE lets players play as the G.I. JOE mission force or as the evil organization Cobra in one hundred levels of new content.

Released on 27th April earlier this year World of Tanks: Modern Armor is a free-to-play online multiplayer game that features authentic 20th-century era tanks and is an enhanced console update to the original game World of Tanks. Some features included in World of Tanks: Modern Armor are new maps eras items and a Cold War mode.

“Following the release of Modern Armor we wanted to add on to the excitement this summer by launching content based on the classic G.I. JOE franchise” said World of Tanks: Modern Armor creative director TJ Wagner. “With such a fitting theme our studio worked hard to integrate iconic tanks such as the MOBAT and H.I.S.S. and we look forward to releasing more G.I. JOE content as this season progresses!”

World of Tanks: Modern Armor: G.I. JOE includes 100 levels new missions and challenges and complimentary rewards such as in-game currency key cards the T-54 First Prototype tank and two Cobra themed skins. Season Pass holders will have access to more challenges and rewards including the G.I. JOE MOBAT tank. Ultimate Season Pass holders will have access to all of that and will be given the Cobra H.I.S.S. tank and commanders.

World of Tanks: Modern Armor: G.I.

Unlike the animated/retro Venom revealed on Thursday it’s a safe bet that no one (including us) saw this one ever getting made.

Feast your eyes upon the Marvel Legends M.O.D.O.K. World Domination Tour Collection featuring the character unofficially known as Elvis M.O.D.O.K.

The other guy is a character known as The Captain but we’ll get to him in a bit. First we absolutely have to discuss what might be the most bizarre Marvel Legends figure ever produced.

While I don’t claim to be a M.O.D.O.K. aficionado I still have enough background knowledge of the character to laugh at most of the deep cut Marvel jokes from the first season of his Hulu series. This variation however is completely foreign to me.

Marvel Toy News (a site all Marvel Legends collectors should have bookmarked) did about as good as anyone could providing a brief explanation of the character’s origins but they’re still pretty confusing. All you “need” to know is that a group of these fellas were created by something called the Beyond Corporation and subsequently defeated by a group called the Nextwave Squad.

So yeah…still completely over my head. If you’re a M.O.D.O.K. and/or Elvis fan however then the figure is an absolutely must buy.

As for The Captain he’s an obscure member of Nextwave a laughably redundent designation. I’m sure the guy has some fans out there but he’ll likely end up as custom fodder for most folks.

Both figures will come packed in a stylized case that even looks cool/worth saving to an opener like me.

While no release date has been announced yet the set is priced at $73.99 and will be available from Hasbro Pulse at some point this fall.

If there was ever an action figure set that epitomized what toy exclusives are and why they exist it’s this one. That being said I might not be able to resist having Elvis M.O.D.O.K. on my desk once it becomes available.

Next up in our annual prospect review and forecast series is Joe Snively forward for the Hershey Bears. (You can access all of our Capitals Prospect Reports and player analysis on our “Prospects” page or right here.)

VITALS

Snively is a 25-year-old left-handed winger who played for Yale prior to graduating in the spring of 2019. The Herndon Virginia native was never drafted but signed a two-year contract with the Capsitals in 2019 for $925000 per year on March 18 2019. The Capitals re-signed Snively to a one-year two-way contract extension on June 3 2021.

CAREER

Snively played three seasons (2012-15) for the Sioux City Muskateers in the United States Hockey League (USHL) improving in goals and assists each season.

Snively then played four seasons at Yale University. During the 2015-16 season he scored 10 goals and had 18 assists and was the Ivy League Rookie of the Year. During the 2016-17 season he scored 14 goals and had 25 assists. He received Honorable Mention in each of his first two seasons as Yale.

During his junior year 2017-18 he scored 19 goals had 17 assists and was First Team All-Ivy Selection and a Second Team All-ECAC Selection. During the 2018-19 season his senior year he scored 15 goals and had 21 assists. He was a Hobey Baker Award nomination and was also a First Team All-ECAC First Team All-Ivy and First-Team All-New England selections.

After signing with the Capitals Snively signed a Player Tryout (PTO) Contract with the Hershey Bears after his college season was over. Snively played in nine games for the Hershey Bears near the end of the 2018-19 season and in his short time there scored two goals and had 5 assists.

The 2019-2020 season was a breakout season for Snively. He would record 12 goals and 12 assists in just 45 games played finishing with a shooting percentage of 15.0% for the season. He also recorded his first professional hat trick on February 25th against the defending champion Charlotte Checkers. Snively finished the abbreviated season first in goals and second in points among all Bears rookies. He had 14 goals and 17 assists in just 54 AHL games.

The 2020-21 season was relatively quiet for Snively. He recorded six goals and 11 assists in 30 games played which is not bad but there was no significant step forward during the abbreviated season.

2020-2021 MONTH-BY-MONTH RECAP AND TREND ANALYSIS

The following month-by-month breakdown is an aggregation of our monthly prospect reports prepared during the 2020-21 season. You can find all of our weekly and monthly prospect reports on our “Prospects” page in the top menu.

JANUARY

Snively was invited to attend Capitals training camp which began on January 3. He would make a nice play for a goal in the camp’s first scrimmage.

He was re-assigned to Hershey on January 11. The Bears opened training camp on Saturday January 23. The season began for the Bears on February 5 against the Binghamton Devils.

TRENDING: UP

FEBRUARY

The Herndon Virginia native skated on Hershey’s top line with center Mike Sgarbossa and right winger Garrett Pilon. After failing to record a point in his first two games of the season Snively posted a two-point game against Lehigh Valley on February 14. He put the Bears in front 16 seconds into the game firing home his shot from the left circle.

He later assisted on Cameron Schilling’s second period goal. The Yale product was held off the scoresheet in his next two games but ended the month by recording a point in his last three games of the month. He assisted on Mike Sgarbossa’s second period goal at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on February 24 and then added a helper in Newark against Binghamton on February 26.

Snively started the scoring for Hershey against Binghamton on February 27 by sliding his shot in during a mad scramble in front. The first period goal would be all the Bears would need in a 3-0 victory. Snively is also tied for the team lead in plus/minus with a plus five.

TRENDING: UP

MARCH

March was a good month for Snively. He posted seven points and netted a pair of goals in the month.

One of those goals was the game winner on March 24 when he snuck his shot past Lehigh Valley goalie Alex Lyon’s right arm. It was his second game-winning goal of the season which was tied for the second most on the team.

The Herndon Virginia native had a five-game point streak from March 19 through March 28 and had points in 10 of his last 13 games. He is producing on a consistent basis.

Snively was tied for second on the team in scoring with 12 points. The winger had eight assists on the season tied for the second most on the Bears.

TRENDING: UP

APRIL

After a seven-point month in March the Herndon Virginia native cooled off a little bit in April. Part of that was due to Snively missing a week due to injury. He potted his fifth goal of the season on April 7 against Binghamton when deposited a rebound from a Brett Leason shot into the net.

Snively registered a helper in his next game when he picked up the primary assist on Aliaksei Protas’ opening goal. After going scoreless in a game against Binghamton Snively was then injured in practice and missed Hershey’s next three games. He returned for the final game of the month and had a secondary assist on Matt Moulson’s second period power play goal.

MAY

Snively had his lowest point total of the season in May. Snively recorded a goal and assist in the month. His lone goal of the month came in the second period of a 3-0 win over Lehigh Valley on May 8.

Snively was hot in March but was not the same player after being injured in practice in April. He totaled three points in his last eight games after coming back from his injury. Snively concluded the season with six goals and 11 assists. Half of his goals were of the game-winning variety tied for the second most on the team behind Connor McMichael.

TRENDING – DOWN

PLAYER FORECAST

Snively became a key player for the Bears as the 2019-2020 season progressed. He possesses a pretty good shot has excellent ice awareness and read plays quickly. He will need to work on his puck battling and play along the boards although he’s done fairly well at those skills so far in his development tract.

Snively will return to Hershey for the 2020-21 season where he will look to top the 20-goal plateau as well as continue his strong showing on special teams. He will also be looked to for more of a leadership role this coming season. His ceiling is a bottom six role with the Capitals.

Look for a call-up at some point during the 2020-2021 season for experience and for the story as the hometown-kid-makes-good storyline and plays in front of his hometown folks and family.

According to the New York Times the terse announcement issued Friday evening in China did not explain what had prompted the review nor what it would entail — only that its purpose was “to guard against national data security risks protect national security and uphold the public interest.”

The surprise intervention by Beijing immediately called to mind last year’s failed initial public offering by Ant Group the Chinese fintech giant whose share sale in Shanghai and Hong Kong was halted at the 11th hour after regulators summoned company executives to discuss new supervision.

In an emailed statement Didi said it would cooperate with the authorities. “We plan to conduct comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and continuously improve on our cybersecurity systems and technology capacities” the statement said.

Didi is China’s leading ride-hailing app having purchased Uber’s China operations in a 2016 deal that ended a period of fierce competition between the two companies. Didi’s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The company says its service had 377 million active users in China during the year that ended in March.

Marlon Wayans who co-produced co-wrote and co-starred in the 2004 comedy alongside his brother Shawn shared that Paris Hilton and her sister Nicky Hilton were their muses for the White Chicks characters they played.

“The original ‘white chick’ and I” Wayans wrote in a caption along with a photo of him and Paris at an event in Los Angeles he shared on Wednesday. “Funny story one day my brother [Shawn] calls me at 3 am saying ‘Marlon we should play white chicks.’ I replied ‘[man] you high?’ “The next day he showed me a magazine with Paris Hilton and her sister on the cover and said we should play girls like this. I immediately got it.”

Marlon went on to say “We did that film in good spirit to celebrate a special time in all of our lives. So thank you Paris and [Nicky] for being muses.”

He ended the post by announcing a long-awaited sequel “White Chicks 2” and quoted one of the original film’s famous lines “Let’s go shopping.”

The famous Hilton hotel heiresses were both pleased by Wayans’ backstory and presumably open to starring in a sequel.

“Great seeing you last night. That movie was hilarious AF” Paris Hilton 40 commented. “Love you too bro and yes let us know.”

Nicky 37 included “Happy we could be a source of inspiration! White Chicks 2?”

D.C. boasts rich cultural and historical sites a booming restaurant scene and a diverse selection of activities. So it makes sense that millions of travelers flock there each year.

Among the most popular places to visit in Washington D.C. are the Smithsonian Institution the White House the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall to name a few. If you’re thinking about planning a budget trip here's how to get to Washington D.C. with points and miles.

Getting to Washington D.C.

Nearest airports

The District of Columbia has three centrally located airports offering a large variety of flight and airline options. Oddly enough none of these airports are actually located in the district.

The airports serving the D.C. area include:

Washington-Dulles (IAD).

Washington-National (DCA).

Baltimore-Washington (BWI).

Of the three airports IAD is the largest international airport and offers by far the most airline options flights and lounges. But there are two big drawbacks to flying into or out of IAD: It’s the farthest from the city (at over 25 miles) and there’s no public transportation option aside from car services and private airport shuttles. The lack of metro service to IAD is a bummer since Washington D.C. generally has an extensive metro system.

DCA is a convenient airport since it’s only 5 miles from the city center and easily accessible via the metro and bus lines. The major downside is that it services mostly shorter domestic flights. It doesn't often offer longer direct flights within the U.S.

BWI is a bit farther than DCA from D.C. and services many airlines and international routes. It is accessible on the city metro via a short bus ride.

Major airlines flying to Washington D.C.

BWI serves as an operating base for Southwest which offers nonstops to nearly 70 cities. IAD is a United Airlines hub but is also served by over 30 airlines (including all of the major carriers).

Flying to Washington D.C. with points and miles

Because there are three airport options and service from almost every airline with a rewards program the opportunities to get to Washington D.C. with points and miles are seemingly endless. Even so a few programs stand out for those looking to get maximum value from their miles.

American Airlines AAdvantage Web Special awards

AAdvantage miles are among the best points and miles for cheap flights to Washington D.C. For example the Web Special awards start at only 6000 miles for transcontinental flights from Baltimore-Washington to Los Angeles.

In the spring of 2021 we found Web Special awards available on several routes from Washington D.C. for 7000 miles in economy and 10000 in business.

Southwest JetBlue and Delta

Southwest JetBlue and Delta offer multiple flight options with award ticket prices roughly mirroring the cash price of the ticket. We found economy flights on all three of these airlines from Washington D.C. to airports all over the country in August for less than $100.

Here are a few examples:

Baltimore-Washington to Charleston South Carolina on Delta: The cash price is $80 and the award ticket price is 4500 miles plus $6 in taxes.

Washington-National to Orlando Florida on JetBlue: The cash price is $99 and the price in TrueBlue points is 8400 points plus $5.60 in taxes.

The company already has been issued permits for minor interior work including electrical and plumbing Mayor Raul Elias said.

Also coming to the vacant site at 9200 Whittier Blvd. is a Chase bank which plans to relocate its branch from the northside of Whittier Boulevard officials said.

The 100000-square-foot Home Depot was shuttered in 2018 when the home improvement retailer opened a new store in Monterey Park.

“This is a positive” City Manager Steve Carmona said. “This site has been vacant for a couple of years. We’ve been working aggressively to replace the sales tax.”

Elias said the redevelopment of the Home Depot site is important “because of the visuals.” The site is now surrounded by green fence. “That area from an optics standpoint is not very good.”

Councilman Andrew Lara was more blunt calling site “a community eyesore with opportunities for illicit activity to take place.”

Home Depot was among the Top 10 sales tax producers in the city. State law doesn’t allow the release of actual sales tax numbers because it is considered proprietary information.

Officials from neither Seattle-based TRF Pacific which owns the property nor Burlington New Jersey-based Burlington returned telephone calls seeking comment.

When Home Depot opened in 1988 as part of the new Crossroads Plaza shopping center then-city officials heralded it as the culmination of a dream to redevelop the south side of Whittier Boulevard.

Before Crossroads Plaza and other new shopping centers on Whittier Boulevard opened there were mostly stores dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. They all have since been demolished and replaced with either shopping centers or new homes.

Marco Zapien president of the Pico Rivera Chamber of Commerce said the new Burlington store will be good for business and the city.

“It’s very important because it’s on the main thoroughfare of Pico Rivera and it’s a huge space” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvc2hvcHBpbmcvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC9qdWx5LTR0aC1ob21lLWRlcG90LWxvd2VzLWtvaGxzLXN0b3Jlcy1vcGVuLWluZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1kYXkvNzg0MzUxNjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,July 4th sale: Home Depot Lowe's Kohl's stores open Independence Day,"Target is open normal hours for the Fourth of July which vary by location.

Certification and entry into service of the feeder aircraft is targeted for 2024.

Alice is an e-aircraft for nine passengers and two crew members powered by two magni650 electric propulsion units each with 640 kW of power from magniX. The fly-by-wire system comes from Honeywell Eviation does not name the manufacturer of the battery system but emphasises that it is based on currently available battery cells and does not rely on future advancements in battery technology.

The developer describes the ensemble as a “production configuration” i.e. a setup intended for later production. “The unveiling of our Alice production design is a special day for Eviation and our partners. It also represents a final step in our iterative journey to the first flight of Alice” expresses Omer Bar-Yohay CEO of Eviation. “Electric aviation will continue to open up new opportunities for affordable sustainable regional travel around the world. Alice is poised to make that possibility a reality soon.”

As for other recent performance figures for the model the manufacturer’s website lists a range of up to 440 nautical miles a top speed of 220 knots and a maximum payload of 2500 pounds. Converted that’s a good 800 kilometres a good 400 km/h and 1130 kilograms.

Meanwhile the originally Israeli start-up has apparently moved its headquarters to the United States. Eviation Aircraft claims Arlington in the US state of Washington as its new headquarters.

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

Recent trends in the global fire protection systems market are driven by an upsurge in product launches by major fire safety equipment suppliers.

For instance in October 2020 Honeywell rolled out the first tools from its new suite of CLSS (Connected Life Safety Services) the company’s first all-in-one cloud platform for fire protection systems. The organization’s CLSS line of tools developed on the Honeywell Forge platform allows fire technicians to provide compliance minimize disruption and decrease the time required for installation design maintenance commissioning and reporting of life safety systems.

According to Sameer Agrawal Honeywell’s General Manager of Global Fire Software and Services today’s global environment requires the life and fire safety industry to innovate solutions that allow system integrators and facility managers to diagnose issues and monitor their systems irrespective of the time and location.

Similar advancements are expected to boost the demand for fire protection equipment through the forthcoming years. On this note the global fire protection systems market size is estimated to surpass USD 70 billion by 2027 cites the latest research by Global Market Insights Inc.

This growth is attributed to the rising product demand in light of the surging number of fire accidents due to the lack of fire protection systems at heritage sites.

For exemplar in 2019 the NCHA (National Cultural Heritage Administration) reported almost six fire accidents at heritage sites and buildings. For overcoming like issues the Chinese government has started the deployment of fire protection systems as prevention measures.

Some major trends driving fire protection systems industry outlook comprise:

Increasing industrialization and urbanization in the APAC

The Asia Pacific fire protection systems market is set to exhibit an appreciable CAGR through 2027 considering the rising urbanization and industrialization in the region.

Various countries comprising India Japan and China are focusing on the implementation of numerous building guidelines and codes for the fire safety of structures bolstering the demand for fire protection equipment in the region.

Rising corporate strategies by major industry participants

Prominent players in the fire protection systems market include Schneider Electric Johnson Controls International PLC Siemens AG Fire Suppression Limited Napco Security Technologies Hochiki Corporation Schrack Seconet AG and others.

These fire safety equipment suppliers are focusing on various collaborative strategies such as acquisitions and mergers for the expansion of their geographical footprint.

For instance in June 2018 Johnson Controls rolled out its fire protection system Autocall in the Middle East for its application in large as well as small projects in industries comprising oil & gas and chemical.

Surging product usage across the residential sector

An escalation in the loss of life and property damage on account of the rising residential fire accidents is slated to foster the growth of the residential segment in the fire protection systems industry through the ensuing years.

Furthermore a rise in the demand for construction activities due to an increase in population is expected to boost the deployment of fire protection systems in buildings.

In a nutshell surging government standards and regulations for the improvement of the safety of individuals and industrial commercial and residential property during fire outbreaks will augment fire protection systems market share over the assessment period.

Subway accused a group of US pork producers of conspiring to raise prices since 2009.

Producers ""unlawfully inflated pork costs for more than a decade"" a Subway spokesperson said.

Tyson Hormel and others were included as defendants in a lawsuit filed at the end of June.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Subway has accused a group of leading US pork producers of taking part in a long-running illegal conspiracy to fix wholesale prices.

In a late-June lawsuit filed in US District Court in Connecticut the chain said pork producers who control about 80% of the wholesale market in the US shared data that they wouldn't in ""a normal competitive market.""

The price-fixing complaint centered on the statistics company Agri Stats which was also named as a defendant.

Subway said the pork producers used Agri Stats to share information about ""profits prices costs and production levels."" Some of the information was forward-looking.

""The effect of this information exchange allowed Defendants to coordinate their anticompetitive conduct monitor each other's production and thereby control pork supply and price in furtherance of their anticompetitive scheme"" lawyers for Subway wrote in their complaint.

The suit named a group of defendants with more than $20 billion in annual pork sales. They were: Agri Stats Clemens Food Group Hormel Foods JBS USA Seaboard Foods Smithfield Foods Triumph Foods Tyson Foods and a few named subsidiaries. The companies did not respond to Insiders requests for comment.

A Subway spokesperson told Insider that the lawsuit was part of its efforts to protect its franchisees.

""As small-business owners our Subway Franchisees have felt the impact of artificially manipulated and unlawfully inflated pork costs for more than a decade"" the spokesperson said. ""We are vindicating on their behalf the pork industry's harmful anticompetitive behavior.""

The pork-processing market has become more concentrated over time but ""the economics of the pork market will make it difficult"" for Subway to win the case said William G. Tomek professor emeritus at Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University.

""The margin between farm and retail has increased but so have the costs of transporting processing etc."" Tomek told Insider. ""To prove that any of this increase is related to monopoly power would be difficult.""

Subway in its complaint said Agri Stats went out of its way to conceal its methods. The lawsuit included a 2009 quote from Agri Stats President Blair Snyder who said in part: ""We don't advertise. We don't talk about what we do.""

The complaint detailed the rise of pork prices after 2009 when the pork producers began using Agri Stats.







Prices had hovered around $1.40 per lb. in the decade before 2009 then ""increased dramatically"" after the companies began using Agri Stats according to the complaint. Prices averaged about 28% higher or around $1.80 per lb. in the following years.

Pork prices grew at a rate faster than other food products driven by wholesale increases instead of retail increases Subway said.

Subway's lawsuit was filed by a wholly owned subsidiary: Subway Protein Litigation Group. The complaint said Subway overpaid for pork since 2009 but won't know by how much until the lawsuit goes into discovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Latin America Hotel Investors Gain Interest in International Brands

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

""In the region there's a lot of small independent owner-operators that have their own brands with 30 or 35 hotels. They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

Host Spends $530 Million on Two Nashville Hotels

Real estate investment trust Host Hotels & Resorts purchased the fee simple interest in two Nashville hotels adjacent to each other for $530 million in cash. The two hotels are the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown.

""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive revenue per available room compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. … We expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" Jim Risoleo Host’s president and CEO said in a news release.

In Host's first-quarter 2024 earnings call Risoleo called Nashville the ""market of the future. It's the No. 2 convention market in the United States behind Orlando.""

Hilton Continues Growth of Luxury Lifestyle Portfolio

In a pursuit to expand Hilton's luxury lifestyle hotel portfolio the company acquired a majority stake in Sydell Group to expand Sydell's NoMad Hotels brand. Hilton projects that as many as 100 NoMad hotels will roll out across the world over time.

NoMad currently has two open and operating hotels: its NoMad London and NoMad Las Vegas. The Las Vegas hotel is excluded from the deal with Hilton and will be respositioned.

Hilton will be responsible for NoMad development while Sydell will spearhead design branding and management of it. All NoMad hotels will be independently owned and rolled into Hilton's commercial platforms.

New Aimbridge CEO Details Company Strategy

In the first few months of Craig Smith taking over as CEO of global-third party management company Aimbridge Hospitality he's focused on meeting with hotel owners brand representatives and corporate teams on what can be improved.

In an exclusive virtual fireside chat with Hotel News Now Smith said some of the feedback he's heard is that the company isn't using its scale to its full advantage.

""We've got to think like a small third-party management company and less like a large company"" he said. ""In other words we use our scale for things that are important to us but our [thinking] has to be like almost a small company that's really dedicated to each owner and each hotel.""

Click to expand...

That claim always puzzled me. A car as heavy as the MYP should run mid to high 12's at around 108 in the 1/4 mile if that was the available HP but they run in the low 12's to high 11's in the 114 to 116 mph range. It is possible that my charts may be complete crap.... they were made from data logs from scan my Tesla at around 85% SOC with the battery not ""exercised"" other than driving far enough to burn off 5% SOC.I think my charts may be amplified by scan my Tesla reporting the numbers in ""KW"" and me doing the conversion into HP... I am wondering if the data log results are actually in HP? I didn't question my results because I had read 1/4 mile results on the MYP and the numbers provided by scan my Tesla matched up fairly well with what I would expect out of a high 11 second car of this weight. Now I wonder if scan my Tesla was reporting in HP? If so my charts are the correct shape but amplified by 1.3Keith Just did some digging on M3 performance dyno charts (since they have dyno mode) and found someone getting 522 measured at the wheels in his M3P... doing conservative gear box and dyno losses of 10% since it is a simple drive train gets you 574 at the motors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMTAwMC1ocC1oZWxsY2F0LWR1cmFuZ28tZHJhZy1yYWNlcy03MTAtaHAtc3RvY2stc3V2LWFubmloaWxhdGlvbi1mb2xsb3dzLTE2NDU4MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1000 HP Hellcat Durango Drag Races 710 HP Stock SUV Annihilation Follows,"The Durango Hellcat is not a performance SUV it's a company statement from Dodge something cool for the hardcore buyers to get. And what do all Hellcat people want to do? Mods of course like the ones Hennessey Performance just performed.

Under the hood of what used to be a normal commuter Dodge placed the now-famous 6.2-liter supercharged V8 motor which is allowed to pump out 710 horsepower. With a top speed of about 180 miles per hour this is already an unbelievably fast vehicle.But this next video is Hennessey's way of celebrating the launch of its Durango SRT Hellcat HPE1000 . As the name suggests we're dealing with a package. This demonic Durango version boasts a new 2.7-liter supercharger as opposed to the 2.4-liter in the normal mode.In combination with the stainless steel long-tube headers and an upgraded pulley and throttle bodies the HPE1000 makes one hell of a racket. It's already been dyno-tested and put down 1012 horsepower and 969 lb-ft of torque (1314 Nm). That's not quite the 1200 hp we're expecting from the Ram TRX 6x6  but it will have to do.Sarcasm aside Hennessey has previously timed the HPE1000 at 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.8 seconds and 10.8 seconds over a quarter-mile with a trap speed of 126 mph. Pricing? Well if you've got a Durango Hellcat the battle is half-won. The sports 4x4 is supposed to start at $82500 but the markups are huge. What's another $20k on top of that when you're going to have the only such setup on the block?Amusingly the thumbnail for the drag race video is titled ""How Much Faster?"" as if we don't know Hennessey will try to make the gap as big as possible.So the two SUVs that line up at the start of the race look identical glossy black machines with equally black wheels. But you quickly realize which one has got the extra 300 horsepower. Right from the beginning of the race the HP1000 pulls away and is off to a huge lead. That's the power of the supercharger for you as we doubt a tune on something like a BMW X5 M would have the same effect off the line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZvcmQtbXVzdGFuZy1ndC1nZXRzLTgwOC1ocC1ieS1oZW5uZXNzZXktZm9yLWxlZ2VuZC1lZGl0aW9uLXJlbGVhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Mustang GT Gets 808 HP By Hennessey For Legend Edition Release,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZvcmQtbXVzdGFuZy1ndC1nZXRzLTgwOC1ocC1ieS1oZW5uZXNzZXktZm9yLWxlZ2VuZC1lZGl0aW9uLXJlbGVhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMTk1MS1oZW5yeS1qLXdpdGgtNzAwLWhwLWJsb3duLWhlbWktaXMtYS1jYW5keS1hcHBsZS1nYXNzZXItMTY0NTg3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1951 Henry J With 700-HP Blown HEMI Is a Candy Apple Gasser,"Henry J. Kaiser dreamed of bringing a new type of automotive to the American masses affordable yet sturdy. When launched in 1951 the model called Henry J was initially quite successful. However consumers in that era had a lot of leftover cash and wanted to splurge not save money.

And so the durability of the car turned it into a popular toy for hot rodders just like the Fords that it was inspired by. We've seen lots of dragsters from that era but nothing like what just got featured in this video.Owner Goose brought over a 1951 Henry J hot rod nicknamed the ""Hemmi J"" making somewhere around 700 horsepower. It's like a 1950s dragster that had access to today's engine technology and we love that idea. It's amazing to see something out of an old magazine fitted with such an engine.Let's start looking at the mods that have been done to the car. When Goose got the car it was already on its way to becoming a gasser but didn't look anywhere as sweet as it does now.In true hot rod style he moved the hood about three inches lower. The bumper is from a first-gen Camaro and the headlights have been ""Frenched."" It's an old term meaning that they were made flush with the body and given that little lip. The name comes from the end result looking like a French cuff of a shirt sleeve which has a ridge.Down the side they got rid of the drip rails and moved that massive axle forward 10 inches. Obviously the mods at the back are quite extreme. There are no taillights the gas cap is super-flush and there's a big wheelie bar sticking out.The motor is not from a modern car and it came out of a 1957 DeSoto  which is another company you rarely hear about these days. The 392 cubic-inch HEMI and it's been blown to the tune of around 700 horsepower.If nothing else you guys are going to get a kick out of the no-nonsense guy who brought the car along. He knows how to drive one of these old-fashioned rigs. And if you'd like to know more about the 1951 Kaiser Frazer Henry J check out the commercial in the second video below."

Then the coronavirus pandemic came along forcing them and other bankers to curtail branch activities and sparking a new burst in digital banking.

By February this year nearly 80% of customer transactions at U.S. Bank were digital and nearly 60% of active customers did most of their banking that way.

""If you had told me that we would be at this stage 15 months later I would have thought that would be impossible"" said Tim Welsh the Minneapolis-based bank's president of consumer and business banking. ""I thought it was a five-year journey.""

Of course some people still go to a branch to cash a check or make a deposit. But many are going in less frequently and for a different reason.

To help manage social distancing as U.S. Bank began to reopen their lobbies last year it asked customers to make appointments with bankers. U.S. Bank booked more than a million such appointments last year and is on track to double that number this year.

At the U.S. Bank branch in Mound employees help clients without roped off lines and teller windows. The company has adopted similar design in new branches across its network.

""Where you used to come in and cash a check and leave in two minutes now you come in and you talk for 30 minutes about your finances with somebody at a scheduled time"" said Welsh. ""It's a completely different way of interacting with our customers.""

The pandemic has even prodded some older Americans who were previously more likely to go into a branch for routine transactions to transition to digital banking said Greg McBride chief financial analyst with Bankrate.com.

""Just as more and more grandparents were using FaceTime to keep up with the grandkids many of them were also downloading the bank's app and depositing checks for the first time or transferring money from their phone for the first time"" he said.

But this rapid shift has also meant that banks no longer see a need to have as many branches as they once did. Last year the pandemic spurred a record number of net branch closures in the U.S. according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

U.S. Bank was the leader in culling branches in 2020 with 349 followed by Wells Fargo with 331. U.S. Bank has recently been more aggressive than other banks in closing branches catching up to the broader industry after being prevented by regulators from making changes for several years ending in 2018.

U.S. Bank announced plans to close 10 to 15% of its branches before the pandemic hit but executives decided to close more as consumer behavior changed last year. They ended up shuttering about 700 going from around 3000 to about 2300 in 26 states.

When banks close branches it often leads to concerns that people who still depend on them will have to go farther to get access financial activities particularly in low-income minority and rural communities. Having to travel farther to get to a bank can be especially challenging for people with mobility issues and those without easy access to transportation.

Last year the advocacy group National Community Reinvestment Coalition raised concerns about this trend after tallying up more than 13000 closures or 14% of all branches between 2008 and 2020. It issued a report that noted that such closures often disproportionately impact rural low-income and minority communities where few branches might have existed in the first place.

However an analysis earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that branch closures in recent years have been concentrated in areas with lots of branches. So in most cases it has led to a relatively modest increase in distance to get to another full-service branch the researchers concluded.

Still Welsh acknowledged the concern and said it was a important consideration as U.S. Bank plotted out which branches to close. A company spokesman added that the bank did not see any changes in its share of branches in rural communities and actually saw a small increase in its percentage of branches in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods.

""We want everybody to have access"" Welsh said. ""But what we're finding is if you're not coming in to cash checks you don't need a branch five minutes away. But if you're coming in for an appointment you might be willing to drive a little bit more distance because it's a more substantive conversation.""

U.S. Bank is not planning any other big rounds of branch closures for the time being and expects to have a more moderate pace of openings and closings Welsh said.

The number of bank branches in the U.S. peaked around the Great Recession and has been on the decline since then as banks looked to cut costs and to adapt to consumers' shift to digital banking.

A swell of bank mergers and acquisitions has also contributed to the trend with banks often closing overlapping locations as they consolidate under one banner. For example Ohio-based Huntington Bank is closing about 200 branches after recently acquiring Detroit-based TCF Bank. None are in Minnesota.

Banks are also taking a more aggressive look at branch closures because it's harder for banks to make money right now with interest rates so low said Nathan Stovall lead banking analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence.

A recent survey by the firm found that 64% of consumers who visited branches since the start of the pandemic expect to use them less in the future. They became accustomed to banking apps.

""After doing it for a month they were like 'Well I'm never going to go back to doing it the old way. This is simply too easy'"" said Stovall. ""So there's a lot of stickiness to digital usage that you hadn't seen before.""

At the same time U.S. Bank's Welsh says that branches are still ""critical."" Finances can be complicated and confusing. And many people may need some extra help and guidance from someone in a branch to give them a tutorial in how to use new tools in the app.

""That human connection really matters"" he said.

U.S. Bank embraced a new branch design in the last couple years that's smaller and without once-standard features such as teller line. In some there's no cash on hand other than in an ATM. Instead they have more spaces where bankers can sit down with customers for a one-on-one consultation.

It's opened some of these newer branches around the Twin Cities as well as in its newest expansion market of Charlotte N.C. U.S. Bank opened its first branch in Charlotte in 2019. It now has two with plans for eventually opening 10 to 12 branches there over time in what executives refer to as their ""digital first-branch light"" strategy.

That's a big change from the old approach in which U.S. Bank might have opened 80 or so branches in a market of that size as it currently has in some of its older more traditional markets such as Minneapolis or St. Louis Welsh said.

In the meantime U.S. Bank continues to add digital tools. Last year it ramped up use of a co-browsing technology that allows customers to share their screen with a banker. A couple months ago it added a video option to that feature.

And in late May it began offering virtual appointments with a banker who in many cases may be at a local branch.

""What we're finding is that it matters that people know that you're at the intersection of 8th and Nicollet or wherever you are"" said Welsh. ""As opposed to I'm in a call center in some nameless faceless place. I'm actually your neighbor and we're here and we're here helping you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV4dG1vc2guY29tL2RlZnRvbmVzLXJlbGVhc2Utcm9zZW1hcnktZ3VpdGFyLXBsYXl0aHJvdWdoLXZpZGVvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deftones release “Rosemary” guitar playthrough video,"West coast alt/rock/metal band Deftones have released a guitar playthrough video (featuring Stephen Carpenter) for their song “Rosemary” which appears on the group’s 2012 album ‘Koi No Yokan’ — stream the clip below.

Calvin Lawrence is a Distinguished Engineer and Chief Architect for Cognitive Computing and Innovation for IBM Global Markets. Calvin was raised in the Atlanta area where he grew up in the projects in an impoverished community that was riddled with crime. The contrast of having a sometimes adversarial relationship with law enforcement while also seeing the benefits of government assistance shaped his mindset and informs his commitment today to using tech for good.

As an IBMer working in artificial intelligence Calvin is keenly aware of the Black experience in the tech space and how technology can be misused. “For instance” he notes “if an automated voice bot called my mother up on the phone using technology you could easily determine that she's a Black woman over the age of 70 and live in a certain zip code.

From this information the bot could be trained to restrict restrain and deny her or make her overpay for goods and services. As a Black technologist I know this mainly because I understand how the technology works and how easily biases can be implemented.” As such Calvin feels that the Black technology experience comes with a unique obligation one that he readily accepts.

“I get an opportunity to work with a lot of emerging technology a lot of research technology and apply it in different geos” he says. This work is important to Calvin he says because it is in keeping with his mission to use his IBM role as an engine for change. “My goal is to try and drive change because I can sympathize with the community” he notes.

Looking at where he is today versus the struggles of his childhood Calvin says he wishes he had the chance to tell his younger self that despite his circumstances his dreams are not out of reach. And he is grateful that his children do not feel those same restrictions.

“As a young boy I didn’t have a dream” he says. “Being a distinguished engineer at IBM was never a goal. My daughter has wanted to be a vet since she was five years old. And now she’s applying to veterinary school. But that wasn’t my world. So if I had to tell the younger Calvin something it would be ‘Dream. Because you have the capacity to meet those dreams.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMS8wNy93aW1ibGVkb24taWJtLXRlbm5pcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wimbledon: The tech behind the world's top tennis tournament,"Sebastian Anthony

Update July 3 2021: It's July 4 weekend in the US which means Ars staff gets a well-deserved holiday to It's July 4 weekend in the US which means Ars staff gets a well-deserved holiday to build Lego microscopes (or maybe just to rest) . As such we're resurfacing a few classics from the Ars archives including this look behind the scenes of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. As we all cheer on Federer (or maybe Nadal) throughout the 2021 edition this look at the 2017 tournament gives everyone some idea of just how much tech powers what seems like the most old school sporting event around. This story originally ran on July 13 2017 and it appears unchanged below.

The Championships at Wimbledon which consumes some 28 tons of strawberries 10000 litres of cream and 320000 glasses of Pimm's per year is notable for its seemingly unchecked luxuriant hedonism. But while most companies organisations and institutions are looking to cut costs Wimbledon has stuck to its mantra. Don't do things cheaper; do things better.

Case in point: Wimbledon's use of technology is really quite impressive. I've been lucky enough to follow Wimbledon's tech over the last three years and it has been very encouraging to see a massive endeavour like The Championships dive deeper and deeper into technology. You might think that after 140 years Wimbledon could be stuck in its ways but far from it. When technology is the only viable way of providing consistent significant gains for players visitors and hundreds of millions of people spectating remotely you don't try to fight it; you embrace it.

Of course Wimbledon is embracing tech in a distinctly Wimbledon way. This year for example The Championships are trialling free Wi-Fi—but because they don't yet know how people will behave with free Wi-Fi it's only available in three specific locations (near the food court in the ticket resale area and on the west side of court 12). The tournament continues through this weekend but its team has already started analysing the data. It turns out that thankfully the Wi-Fi users on court 12 only use their phones between points. When play begins Wi-Fi usage stops. If the trial is a success Wi-Fi could be rolled out across Wimbledon in 2018.

The other big advance this year is that IBM (Wimbledon's official tech partner) is now scanning every tennis match and automatically generating highlight video clips of important or exciting moments. This sounds difficult but apparently it only requires IBM to track three variables: noise level action recognition and crowd cheering. These combine to generate an ""overall excitement level."" Noise level is presumably the ambient sounds of an excited audience while action recognition refers to the players. Are they running around a lot fist pumping or otherwise being emotive?

When the overall excitement level crosses a threshold (0.8?) the software goes back through its video buffer and creates a highlight clip of the point. For now a human editor still goes through every clip before being published. A human editor is still required to tease out video clips from more nuanced matches too; the IBM software doesn't yet understand the context of individual matches or player pairings. But given that other IBM software at Wimbledon tracks match context—mostly so that commentators can add some extra flavour—it seems like an obvious improvement to the auto-highlight tech in future years.

Gobbling up data

One of Wimbledon's richest assets is a vast database containing stats from more than 100 years of competitive tennis matches. As Wimbledon's partnership with IBM has matured and new data-gathering techniques and sensors have been rolled out the depth and accuracy of the data has improved.

Perhaps most excitingly Wimbledon is now storing the 3D state of tennis matches via the Hawk-Eye camera system available on some of the courts. Hawk-Eye which uses multiple cameras to track the ball and resolve line judging disputes outputs a constant stream of data that IBM can process into a useful format. But actually doing something with that data is a risky affair because it isn't clear who owns it. Some tennis players as you can imagine aren't keen for some wily big data/machine learning software to reveal the secrets of their play style to the world.

Today Wimbledon/IBM only uses the Hawk-Eye data to track each player's ""aggressive"" shots. Presumably a lot of raw data is being stored in Wimbledon's database though which could be processed at a later date. For more on the trials and tribulations of gathering using and sharing data our recent feature on football data is a good place to start.

Wimbledon also sees that new public Wi-Fi as a potential source of exploitable data. As you may already know when you join a Wi-Fi network (or indeed any network) the operator of that network can see which services and apps you're using. For example with this year's Wi-Fi hotspot trial Wimbledon can now see how many visitors are using the Line messaging app. Line is predominantly used in Asia so Wimbledon might use that data to tweak how it advertises the competition to Asian visitors next year.

On a simpler level if Wimbledon blankets the All England Lawn Tennis Club with Wi-Fi it will be able to use each device's unique MAC address to track the movement of most visitors around the venue. Not for creepy reasons I'm assured but to iron out bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Should there be another toilet here? A strawberries-and-cream stand there? An everlasting font of Pimm's here? Venue-wide Wi-Fi would also allow Wimbledon to push notifications to visitors as they move around beacon-style.

Two years ago an IBM engineer told me they were in discussions with the UK's mobile network providers to track visitors through cellular triangulation but this year I was told that no such partnership was ever struck. Doing it via Wi-Fi (and perhaps augmented with Bluetooth) is probably more sensible anyway.

Ask Fred (er Watson?) 360-degree cameras...

Finally Wimbledon has released a significantly overhauled mobile app for this year's Championships. Over the last few years there has been a big shift from people following Wimbledon on a desktop browser to following it on their mobile devices. The mobile app is meant to provide a better experience than the mobile website—but to be honest if you're into tennis you should probably just download the free app (iOS/Android) and see what you think. This year there's a new feature called Ask Fred that apparently uses some IBM Watson-type tech to answer your questions. The app also has the ability to look through some 360-degree cameras that have been placed on each court.

Now read about how evolution can only take us so far in sports but embracing technology would be far more exciting...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvamltLXdoaXRlaHVyc3Qtc3RlcHMtZG93bi1hcy1pYm0tcHJlc2lkZW50LWluLWp1c3QtMTQtbW9udGhzLzg0MDg5Mjc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Whitehurst steps down as IBM president in just 14 months,"Advt

Here are the Warnings and Solutions You Need to Know,"The first hard drive hit the market in 1956; it was a 5-megabyte drive for an IBM mainframe it weighed more than a ton and it eventually failed. All hard drives fail because despite their connection to electronic devices hard drives are (or were) mechanical in nature: a physical platter spins at thousands of revolutions per minute and a moving arm equipped with magnetic sensors reads magnetic pulses stored on the platter. Today’s solid-state drives (SSDs) do not have any moving parts and so they last longer but they too eventually wear out. When a hard drive fails it can be anything from an annoyance to a catastrophe depending on the backup system that was in place to keep that data safe and secure. Fortunately there are some warning signs of an impending hard drive failure and some things that you can do to protect yourself from a drive failure. In this article I will show you how to prepare for the worst and the warnings you should look out for.

Note that this article is written with a Windows PC in mind and the software tools I mention will generally be Windows-specific but the general concepts discussed apply to Mac or Linux computers as well.

Warnings of an Impending Failure

Most components on a PC that can fail will give some warning of their deteriorating condition before they just stop working altogether and hard drives are no exception. Here are some warning signs of a developing hard drive problem:

Disappearing files: If a file simply disappears from your system this can be a sign that the hard drive is developing issues. Computer freezing: Computer freeze up from time to time and it’s almost always solved by a quick reboot. However if you find that you need to reboot more and more frequently that could be an indication that your hard drive is beginning to fail. Corrupted data: If files on the drive are suddenly corrupted or unreadable for no apparent reason it’s possible that your hard drive is experiencing a gradual failure. Bad sectors: If you start receiving error messages about “bad sectors” “CRC” or “Cyclic Redundancy Error” that is a sure sign that your drive is developing problems. Sounds: If your hard drive is making sounds that you aren’t familiar with this could also be bad news particularly if it’s a grinding clicking or screeching noise.

Diagnosing the Problem

Diagnosing hard drive problems is generally a process of elimination. There are multiple points of possible failure and not all of them are in the hard drive itself.

What to do if Your Computer Still Boots to the Operating System

Investigate Your Hardware With Device Manager

The first thing to do is to use Device Manager to check and see whether your controller or motherboard is the source of the problem.

Run a Virus/Malware Scan

The second thing to do is to run a complete virus and malware check as malicious software can often cause problems such as freezing or file corruption that you could mistake for problems with your drive. There are many good programs available for this; read this TechJunkie article on the best antivirus programs as well as our article on the best anti-malware programs.

Use Windows Diagnostic Tools

Next use Windows’ own diagnostic software to see if it can detect any problems.

Open File Explorer and click on This PC. Now right-click on the drive and select Properties. Next navigate to the Tools tab. Then under Error Checking select the Check button. This will take quite some time Windows will identify any sectors that have gone bad. This diagnostic procedure actually can fix many minor drive problems by detecting which section of the drive has a problem and not using that part of the drive anymore. However this should be regarded as a temporary fix and you should back up your data as soon as possible.

Check Your Hardware

If you suspect your hard drive of failing you’ll want to inspect and test your hardware.

Start by replacing the SATA or IDE cable for your hard drive and testing it it’s the quickest and cheapest hardware solution. Reboot the PC and see if the problem persists. Next plug your drive with the old cable into a different SATA or IDE port if applicable or use an external disk drive enclosure. Again reboot the PC and test it. Create a Windows Recovery Tool on a USB drive and boot into it to scan your drive for errors. The various scans that can be performed at the command line exceed those of Windows Check option for drives.

What to do if Your Machine Won’t Boot From the Hard Drive

Use Windows Recovery Tool

Again you can try and boot into the Windows Recovery Tool to repair the drive or test if it’s being detected. Enter the Command Prompt under Advanced Options. Now start by running “sfc /scannow“ without the quotes this will scan your drive for errors and attempt to repair it. After running the scans attempt to boot into safe mode download anti-virus software from there and check the system. The best way to verify is to use a antivirus boot disc to scan and repair your PC. You can burn the bootable software to a CD or even install it on a USB drive (using a different computer). This will let you load the special antivirus environment to check your PC for any problems outside of the Windows environment.

You can also check to see if there are partitions on the drive at all using DiskPart or another third-party disk utility tool. If it doesn’t see any partitions it’s likely that there was a partition mess up somewhere along the line. Unfortunately recovering files from a situation like this isn’t always possible as you’ll need to repartition the drive.

Inspect and Test the Hardware

Check the connections inside the machine to make sure that the hard drive is properly connected to the motherboard. On a modern HDD/SSD this is very simple. For IDE drives there are some other things to try. Machines made before 2007 or so will often have an IDE controller rather than a modern SATA controller. Check that the red edge of the drive cable is aligned with Pin 1 of the connector on the drive. Pin 1 is closest to the power plug typically. IDE machines also use a master/slave assignment for the drives so check that the jumpers are set correctly. Boot again to the BIOS screen and see if it can auto-detect the drive. This will establish that the drive is properly connected at least. Remove your failing drive put it in an external HDD enclosure or SATA to USB cable and plug it into another PC or use a Live boot USB of Ubuntu Gparted Windows Recovery Tool etc. After booting up search for the drive and see if it’s being detected.

Attempt to Clone the Failing Drive

There are several options available to clone drives and partitions we’ll discuss Clonezilla here.

Download Clonezilla and use your USB imager of choice such as Etcher to make a bootable flash drive of it. Obtain a new HDD or SSD you’ll need another drive of equal or greater size for it to work and plug it in to your PC via another SATA or IDE port or USB. Now plug it in and reboot your device the failing drive can remain in the PC. Next enter the BIOS by typing either F8 F10 F12 or Del at the screen when the computer first loads. Now under Boot or Boot Options set the boot order so that CD/USB boots before HDD/SDD. Then click Save & Exit and boot into Clonezilla. Follow the prompt within Clonezilla until you get to the cloning/restoring options. Now you’ll want to choose either partition-to-partition or device-to-device for the cloning options if unsure just clone the whole device. Now select your source drive it’s the one that’s failing. Next select your target drive it’s the new one. Now agree to the procedure and let it run. This will take quite a while. After it’s complete reboot the PC and remove the flash drive before the boot screen loads.

Note if you’re ever unsure of what to select in Clonezilla the default settings work for most people.

Data Recovery Options

There are many options available to attempt to clone a hard drive or recover data from a failing hard drive. One such software solution is a free tool called Recuva from Piriform. The company claims that it can recover lost files from damaged disks or newly formatted drives but your mileage may vary. It works for some people and doesn’t work for others. Every situation is unique but it’s definitely worth a shot.

Plug Your Failing Drive into Another PC

Use an external HDD enclosure to try and access your documents/etc. by plugging into another PC it can be running Windows Mac or Linux. Now give the OS time to detect the device and read the contents of it. Next open the drive and locate the content you want to save. Copy the files onto another PC drive or cloud storage.

Note it’s recommended to try and backup the files before attempting to clone the failing HDD.

Clone the Drive

As mentioned above you can still try and clone the drive and its partitions with a tool like Clonezilla. Follow the above directions to attempt the process you’ll need another drive of equal or greater size for it to work.

Use a Data Recovery Service

Your last option is hiring a data recovery service. It goes without saying their services are pricey no matter what company you go with and there’s no guarantee that they can recover your data especially if it was a mechanical failure and not a electronics failure.

A Word on SSDs

It’s worth noting that SSD failure (see our troubleshooting guide here) is essentially a different ball game than HDD failure. SSDs aren’t subject to the same pitfalls of hard disk failure simply because there are no moving parts within the SSD. However they aren’t immune to failing as there are a number of things that can still go wrong.

The biggest issue is a pitfall of all types of flash memory. You have a limited number of read/write cycles. But the good news is that usually only the write portion is affected if you run into a read/write issue. In other words you’ll be able to recover all of that data still on your SSD and put it somewhere else. While an SSD is less likely to malfunction considering that there are no moving parts it’s still susceptible to the everyday wear and tear.

You can generally follow all of the steps above to diagnose the problem though SSDs generally don’t produce noises when they’re going bad. All of the other steps do apply though.

The Future

In the future there’s not much you can do to prevent SSDs or HDDs from going bad. It’s just a fact of life. Just like wear and tear on your car eventually destroys it wear and tear on your hard drives will eventually destroy them. That goes for almost everything in life and there’s no getting around it. But there are steps you can take to make the whole situation a lot less stressful when it comes around.

The main thing you can do is create backups often. Once a week is a usual timeframe. If you’re on a Mac you can do this easily through Time Machine and an external hard drive. On Windows it’s a little bit different. Your best bet is to use a service like Carbonite that automatically backs up everything on your PC and stores them in the Cloud on an encrypted server.

The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 2 therefore has a completely new case compared to the ThinkPad T14s Gen 1. The exterior of the new ThinkPad notebook looks completely different than the predecessor at least if you buy the aluminum model in ""Storm Grey."" Since that model is currently not available in Europe we are looking at the model in classic black.

In the new model the black color is slightly brighter leaning more towards dark-gray and now there is also a silver Lenovo logo on the back of the lid. There are more changes inside the lid. The speakers are now placed prominently above the keyboard. Directly next to the speakers is the power button which now also includes a fingerprint reader. In addition Lenovo has adjusted the shape of the palm rests below the keyboard in order to integrate the new flat TrackPoint buttons. As always colorful accents are formed by the red TrackPoint silver hinges and the ThinkPad logo.

Compared to the predecessor the haptics have slightly changed since Lenovo has changed the black surface covering which is supposed to show less fingerprints and smudges. This works fairly well and the surface layer is slightly more matte and grippy than that of the ThinkPad T14s Gen 1. The materials below the surface also reveal a change: the case bottom is now made from aluminum instead of magnesium. The palm rest and display cover continue to be made from magnesium and carbon fiber respectively. The combination of the different materials ensures a high - although not perfect - stability. It resists pressure on the palm rest without any trouble and the ThinkPad T14s 2021 also resists pressure on the back of the display well. The bottom of the case can be twisted slightly by pushing and pulling in opposite directions and the same goes for the display lid.

The hinges give no reason for complaint allowing for an opening angle up to 180 degrees. The display can be lifted with a single finger and the metal hinges hold the display tightly in place.

Intel appears to have changed just that with their newest Intel NUC 11 Pro Kit NUC11TNKV7 and you are going to want to take a close look at this. First off they have invested in Sabrent Rocket 4.0 Gen 4 SSDs for their storage. That is good…very good. In fact where it is impossible to find any PC capable of true Gen 4 storage speeds this Intel NUC measuring only 117mm x 112mm x 37mm will get you PCIe 4.0 data transfer speeds of 5GB/s. That is not all though. Follow along for a list of components that just might make this Intel NUC the Superman of mini-PCs. At least we think it truly sets itself apart from the rest.

The Intel NUC 11 Pro Kit NUC11TNKV7 contains the Intel Quad Core i7-1185G7 CPU with Turbo Boost up to 4.8Ghz running to a max of 28W. It contains 16GB of DDR4-3200 Dual Channel Memory upgradeable to 64GB has Intel’s latest Iris Xe Graphics and comes with Windows 10 Pro. The Sabrent Rocket 4.0 NVMe SSD is included with specs of 5GB/s read and just over 2.5GB/s write. The NUC 11 Pro also has Intel Wifi 6ax two Thunderbolt ports one Tblt 3 and the other Tblt 4 support for 4 displays and BT 5.1. There is even a slot for another M.2 SSD be it a smaller 2242 form factor (42mm) and SATA3.

On the front of the NUC11TNKV7 we have two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports each capable of up to 1000MB/s data transfer speeds (10Gbps) as well as the power switch.

On the back moving from left to right we have the locking arm 12-24V power port Thunderbolt 4 port which accommodates DPI 1.4a and USB4 2 x HDMI 2.0b on the bottom capable of 4K @ 60Hz. In the center we have the Intel i225LM Ethernet port capable of 10/100/1000/2500 Mbps a USB 32 Gen 2 Type-A port to the right with a USB 2.0 port below that. On the far right we have the Thunderbolt 3 port along with the other HDMI port. Did we mention that Thunderbolt 3/4 is capable of up to 2.9GB/s data transfer?

The package itself includes the NUC11TNKV7 a metal VESA adapter plate to install the NUC 11 Pro on the back of a monitor Quick Start Guide and the power brick. Perhaps just a bit unusual is that the plug itself is not included to plug into the wall/adapter. This is a typical three prong adapter that matches that found on many laptops these days. We simply used ours from one of our HP Spectre X360 laptops.

The largest component in the NUC 11 Pro is the fan and there are vents on both sides and the back of the Unit and as well there is a Kensington Lock port on the other side (not pictured). Surprisingly it was very quiet through all of our testing. That was not the case later on when we were resetting the NUC; it was rather loud at that point. Check out the Intel Nuc 11 Pro spec page.

Storage consists of the Sabrent Rocket 4.0 NVMe 500GB M.2 SSD. This SSD contains the Phison E16 NVMe controller along with 4 pieces of KIOXIA 96-layer BiCS4 TLC NAND flash memory and a DDR4 cache buffer chip on the front.

Checking out the price point of the Intel NUC 11 Pro Kit NUC11TNKV7 we are not seeing them in the US just yet but could find pricing with future availability at around $1200. One can also buy a bare bones version for around $700 and add their own SSD memory and Windows. Check Amazon for availability and pricing. Let’s get to some benchmarks…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vaW50ZWwtb3B0YW5lLXAxNjAweC1zbWFsbC1jYXBhY2l0eS1zc2QtZm9yLWJvb3QtbGF1bmNoZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Optane P1600X Small Capacity SSD for Boot Launched,"This is one of those launches in the industry which is nothing short of perplexing. The Intel Optane P1600X carries a naming convention similar to other data center SSDs. It is also specifically marketed towards the data center on its product page. Yet it is perhaps one of the stranger spec drives out there.

Intel Optane P1600X SSD

Usually we would have the specs at the end of an article like this but today we are going to put them up front. Here is the spec table for the 58GB and 118GB NVMe SSDs.

Let us get into some of the interesting parts. First these are very small SSDs that are at the capacity we usually see for SATADOMs instead of mainstream SSDs. Second they are still PCIe Gen3 drives not PCIe Gen4. Third they have features like 6DWPD which is less impressive than one may think.

Given the PCIe Gen3 interface and capacities one may immediately think back to the Intel Optane 800P 58GB and 118GB M.2 SSD series. Here are the specs:

As one can see this is a PCIe Gen3 x4 instead of an x2 drive and we get more performance. Still the raw read/ write sequential performance is nowhere near a PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD. For boot it is often the random IOPS that increase speed.

The 6DWPD claim is very interesting as well. For example 118GB at 6DWPD = 708GB written That is about 1.5DWPD for a 512GB drive or 0.7DPWD for a 1TB NAND drive. Still boot drives tend not to focus on DWPD. When an OS is loaded onto a boot drive it often sees the core OS files stay static. In some cases log files are written to the drive but the majority of the drive has data that infrequently changes.

The 2M hour MTBF number is more in-line with most data center SSDs and higher than consumer drives which are usually in the 1.6M hour range.

Final Words

To us the big challenge is capacity. In some applications we have deployed very small boot drives but we tend to deploy 256GB and larger drives these days as NAND prices have fallen. If anything one gets stung by low capacity usually before having a bit of extra capacity in a server or embedded device.

This is certainly an interesting drive but it is also one we want to see pricing on before we would buy it. The NAND SSDs offerings for boot are generally very good these days so a low capacity Optane option has some headwinds. The random performance may help to the point that for example in a firewall a reboot can happen faster saving seconds in bringing a service back. Perhaps that is the big win for this device.

Our other sense is that this may be an interesting lower cost and low-capacity log device for some servers when a NAND SATA DOM is used with low endurance and capacity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL3VzLXVrLXJ1c3NpYW4tbWlsaXRhcnktaGFja2luZy11bml00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"U.S. U.K. intel: Russian military hacking attempts ""certainly still ongoing""","United States and United Kingdom intelligence agencies said in a report Thursday that Russian military hackers over the last three years have tried to access the computer networks of ""hundreds of government and private sector targets worldwide"" and warned that those ""efforts are almost certainly still ongoing."" Why it matters: The security agencies cautioned that the military cyber unit best known for hacking the Democratic National Committee and other political targets during the 2016 election is still focusing on political consultants political parties and think tanks though they did not specify any targets by name.

The report is a joint advisory to network defenders published by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

How it works: The agencies said hackers working for Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS) first attempts to gain login credentials to governmental or private-sector networks by conducting ""widespread distributed and anonymized brute force access attempts"" using Kubernetes.

The hackers can then use the valid credentials it obtains to expand their access to the targeted network evade detection and defenses and ultimately access and exfiltrate protected data including information from emails.

While brute-force password guessing campaigns are not new the NSA said the ""GTsSS uniquely leveraged software containers to easily scale its brute force attempts.""

What they're saying: ""The advisory warns system administrators that exploitation is almost certainly ongoing"" the NSA said. ""Targets have been global but primarily focused on the United States and Europe.""

""Targets include government and military defense contractors energy companies higher education logistics companies law firms media companies political consultants or political parties and think tanks.""

The big picture: The report comes on the heels of a summit between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Biden threatened to use the U.S.' ""significant"" cyber capabilities to respond if critical infrastructure entities are targeted by Russian hackers.

Putin though claimed in a press conference after the meeting that most cyberattacks currently taking place were being carried out from the U.S.

What's next: The agencies advised system administrators for government and private entities to counter future breaches by using multi-factor authentication enforcing the use of strong passwords and implementing time-out and lock-out features for accounts after multiple failed password attempts.

They also recommended that the entities deny all inbound activity from virtual private network and other anonymization services.

Owner Ashley Lawson said The French Farmhouse will offer furniture and accessories in the “modern farmhouse style” similar to the Magnolia brand from Chip and Joanna Gaines of “Fixer Upper” fame.

“I feel like there’s nothing suited to people that have this type of style in the area” Lawson said noting that the store will reflect her personal tastes.

While the store will offer some high-end items Lawson said she’s focused on making the store “more affordable or approachable” for the average shopper. There are plenty of budget stores and high-end boutiques she said but not much in the middle.

Lawson plans also to launch a second business from the same building. The downstairs will house The French Farmhouse and the upstairs will be home to an event space called Rendezvous.

“I wanted my whole business altogether to be more of like a gathering spot for a community and I thought that the event space would kind of tie all that together” she said.

She plans to invite vendors to participate in “Virginia-made” events held in the space at least once a month perhaps more frequently if there’s interest. It could also be a space for workshops on anything from painting to putting together a charcuterie board Lawson said.

The Church Avenue building seemed like a good fit for Lawson’s businesses with exposed brick and original wood floors upstairs. A mural is currently being painted on the exterior of the building which she said will be made to look like French doors one might see in Paris.

Lawson said she’s already begun sourcing merchandise and connected with a number of wholesalers.

Renovations are in progress but Lawson said she hopes to open in August. The French Farmhouse and Rendezvous will be located at 9 Church Ave. S.E."

Didi China’s largest ride-hailing service continues to fall into deeper trouble with Chinese regulators.

The Cyberspace Administration of China on Sunday banned Didi from app stores after saying it posed a cybersecurity risk for customers.

“Didi Chuxing app is found to have severely violated the laws by illegally collecting and using personal information” the regulator said. It called on Didi to fix the issue with its app to comply with the country’s laws and to ensure its customers’ safety.

The company which has 377 million active users in China alone said in a statement it is complying with China’s demands pulling the app from stores as it works to make changes to its app to satisfy regulators. Didi said customers and drivers who have already downloaded the app will be able to continue to use it.

“We sincerely thank the … department for its instruction in troubleshooting Didi’s risks” the company said. “We will rectify and improve risk avoidance and … provide safe and convenient services to our users.”

The ban comes less than a week after Didi went public on the New York Stock Exchange in the biggest US share offering by a Chinese company since Alibaba debuted in 2014.

Just two days later on Friday China suspended the registration of new users on the app. The suspension was put in place “to prevent the expansion of risk” during a “cybersecurity review” into the company according to a statement from the country’s cyberspace administration. The company’s stock price tumbled Friday.

Sunday’s ban represents an escalation of China’s action against Didi but it’s part of a larger crackdown on Big Tech companies in China.

In March Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the need to regulate “platform” companies businesses that offer online services for customers in the country. Several tech companies in the past few months have faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behavior or breaches of customer rights leading to record fines and massive overhauls.

Several tech companies in the past few months have faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behavior or breaches of customer rights leading to record fines and massive overhauls. Chinese President Xi Jinping has endorsed the probes setting regulatory crackdowns as one of the country’s top priorities in 2021 and he has continued to call on regulators to scrutinize tech companies.

In April Alibaba (BABA) the online shopping giant co-founded by Jack Ma was fined a record $2.8 billion after antitrust regulators concluded the company had behaved like a monopoly. Days after the fine was issued Ant Group another part of Jack Ma’s business empire was ordered to to overhaul its operations and become a financial holding company supervised by the central bank.

Following these crackdowns China’s State Administration for Market Regulation gathered 34 companies and issued a warning to stop any anti-competitive behavior and ordered internal inspections. Didi was among the summoned companies.

“It’s the only ETF in the world with concentrated dedicated exposure to Pakistan in size. Therefore it’s the only viable and liquid way for foreign investors to access the Pakistani stock market” said Maurits Pot founder and CEO of Dawn Global investment manager for the emerging market ETF.

An ETF is a basket of different shares that investors can buy and sell in an exchange like a single stock.

At least 46 US-listed ETFs offer some exposure to Pakistani stocks according to ETF Database an independent website that collects and disseminates latest ETF-related information. But all other US-listed ETFs with constituents from Pakistan are passive funds and assign extremely low weights to the constituents from the South Asian economy.

Launched on June 17 Asian Growth Cubs ETF has 43 holdings from the five large but “historically difficult-to-access” equity markets of Bangladesh Indonesia Pakistan Philippines and Vietnam. Its investment portfolio has a concentration of stocks from technology media telecom healthcare fast-moving consumer goods and the financial sector.

Four Pakistani firms — Systems Ltd Meezan Bank Lucky Cement and The Searle Company — are part of the ETF which has a median market capitalisation of $2 billion. The Pakistani stocks collectively represent eight per cent of the ETF’s net asset value. The investment manager reviews the portfolio on a quarterly basis.

“If you look at other internationally listed ETFs with Pakistan exposure this is up to five basis points (0.05pc). In Asian Growth Cubs ETF the Pakistan weight is 800 basis points (8pc)” Mr Pot said.

As for the Pakistan-specific ETF by Global X that allocates a high weight to local stocks he said the fund is passive and has not scaled beyond $25 million of assets under management despite being listed for over six years.

Active thematic shares have a roughly 5pc share in the global ETF industry’s AUM of $5 trillion. Such funds constitute the fastest-growing segment within ETFs albeit from a low base he added.

Being an active ETF Asian Growth Cubs doesn’t track any benchmark. Its daily traded volume is more than 10000 units which according to the Dawn Global CEO is in line with market expectations.

The list price of the ETF appreciated from $25 a unit two weeks ago to $25.61 at the end of June 30.

Consequently with the growing popularity of the true-crime genre Investigation Discovery is giving this case’s followers an update in 2021 with Ice Cold Killers: Open Season.

Man found murdered in smalltown Missouri

In November 2000 Larry Holman was found dead in his car in Festus Missouri. Initially his death appears as a hunting accident. However that is not the case and police soon begin investigating Holman’s death as a murder. Interestingly enough it doesn’t seem to take too much time since authorities get a confession. So how much could come of a 2021 update of the Holman case?

Assumably this murder could have gone on under the guise of a hunting accident. However Holman’s wife Tammy begins to draw attention to herself and acting strangely. One strange behavior of note includes the fact that it didn’t take Tammy much time to move on with her old high school boyfriend Tim Smith. If rekindling an old romance isn’t odd enough it doesn’t take much time for Smith to move in. Reports note that this relationship milestone happens shortly after Holman’s funeral.

Details on the murder of Larry Holman

Unfortunately things just get more bizarre the longer police investigate this case. Come to find out Holman’s best friend Charlie Miller has feelings for Tammy. As things heat up with the investigation Miller begins to let more details go. Eventually Miller says that he likes Tammy and feels like Larry mistreats her. According to Miller Tammy asks him to kill Holman. This makes sense taking into account that Tammy may not have wanted a divorce at the risk of losing her children.

Remarkably all of this information isn’t the only oddity of this case. Shockingly Miller admits to attempting to kill Holman twice! He explains that the first time was on a hunting trip in Mexico Missouri. Does that have anything to do with Investigation Discovery’s 2021 update on Holman’s murder?

2021 update on the Larry Holman murder

So where are the involved parties in Larry Holman’s murder now? The Cinemaholic provides a pretty in-depth update in 2021. There is speculation that there may have been enough evidence to convict Tammy Holman. However she took an Alford plea. “Taking an Alford plea meant that Tammy did not admit to guilt but admitted that evidence against her would possibly have to result in a conviction.” Ultimately she goes to prison for conspiracy to commit murder. After her release in 2009 she moves back to Festus and remarried.

As far as Charlie Miller’s situation goes apparently his confession is part of a plea bargain. In The Cinemaholic’s 2021 update on Larry Holman’s murder they explain that Miller gives his testimony in exchange for his charges reduced to second-degree murder with a recommended reduced sentence. In addition to his confession he tells the judge that “he had been on medication and was emotionally disturbed when the murder happened.” However still gets a sentence of 25 years. At the time of this writing records indicate that he is serving his time at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center in Pacific Franklin County.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.

Michael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning good afternoon and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF’s first quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the company’s performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.

Today’s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO Erik Fyrwald and our Executive Vice President CFO and Business Transformation Officer Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Eric.

Erik Fyrwald: Well thank you Mike and hello everyone. I’m excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today we’ll focus on our financial results our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance where we now see us trending toward the upper end. Now before moving forward I want to acknowledge Glenn who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after three successful years with the company. During his tenure Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We’ve benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long term profitable market share growth.

He’s also been very helpful to me already as I’ve come on to the IFF team. Now with this announcement we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. Now turning to Slide Six we are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from scent nourish and health and biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses.

At the same time we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the Pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure address our deleveraging goal of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high growth areas of our business. With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the high end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

It’s still early in the year and there is a lot more work to be done but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. Turning to Slide Seven let me take a step back for a moment and share what I’ve learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. I’ve spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers and I’m grateful for the productive discussions and what I’ve found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities but we’re not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team we are getting back to basics and I’m optimistic about what we will do from here.

First we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves including cosmetics and pharma solutions to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model which is now business-led supported by lean functions.

This includes the appointment Ana Paula Mendonça who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our health and biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our flavors and functional ingredients units within our nourish division. With this operating model change we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions including R&D operations finance and HR to go directly into our business unit presidents so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers.

Now to make this work we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value provides a framework for standardized processes responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars; number one customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety quality continuous improvement and competitive cost structures and four; people people who are engaged across the organization.

We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers and by doing so deliver strong financial performance over time and while it’s still early I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. With that I’ll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thank you Eric and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Eric mentioned earlier we’re encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency neutral basis. Sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses including scent health and biosciences and nourish. Pricing was modestly positive inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets in particular the Argentine Peso where we like the industry have indexed pricing to US and or Euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes.

Absent of this benefit pricing would have been negative in the quarter largely in line with our plan. We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Turning now to Slide Nine I’ll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In nourish sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in flavors with improvements in both volume and price and we saw very strong growth in our flavors business across nearly all markets.

Functional ingredients volume was up low single digits the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall comparable currency neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both flavors and functional ingredients. Our health and bioscience segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio led by double-digit sales growth in cultures and food enzymes animal nutrition and grain processing and mid-single digit growth in home and personal care drove a 6% increase in comparable currency neutral sales.

Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent delivered another excellent quarter including 16% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double digit growth in consumer fragrance and fragrance ingredients and mid-single digit growth in fine fragrances. Segment also excelled in terms of profitability primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. Lastly in pharma solutions while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends which began late last year.

It’s worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also as mentioned we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. Now on Slide 10 I’d like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position.

Cash flow from operations totalled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totalled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totalled $764 million including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times at quarter end.

Our trailing twelve month credit adjusted EBITDA totalled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of three x following the transaction close which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11 I’d like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and as Eric mentioned now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter and therefore raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. On the bottom line for 2024 we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year volume trends are encouraging and consequently we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. I’ll now turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.

Erik Fyrwald: Thank you Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call my first 90 days on team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum and it’s an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and in turn helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth and with a solid start to the year I’m excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. And with that I’d like to now open it up for questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin your line is now open.

Matthew Hettwer: Thank you and good morning. This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It’s nice to see a strong start to the quarter. Eric could you give us some yeah morning. Eric could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you’ve seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days?

Erik Fyrwald: Yeah thanks for the question Matthew. As you probably know I’ve been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change. Am I joining IFF and it’s been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I’ve discerned from that is that we’ve had multiple companies coming together with different operating models different philosophies and there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we’ve done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely. I’m very proud of the team and we’ve been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we’re focused on to drive our performance.

We’ve had town halls all around the world both live and by video. We’ve touched all our employees. We’ve spent special time with our leadership and I think we’ve gotten really clear on how we’re moving the company forward and what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. I think there’s great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model for the focus on customers. The job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that we’re at the core we’re an innovation company and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we’re bringing to our customers and it’s innovation that customers value.

And then finally that we also have healthy productivity productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and innovation and doing that with smart productivity things like reducing consultants reducing layers driving functional shared service centers where it makes sense using technology information technology. So my feeling is that there’s great capabilities great people in this company and the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola your line is now open.

Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Firstly Eric you talked there about the changed operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio and following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions do you intend to pursue any further divestments or is that it for now. And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million a year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside given the upward revision or the high end that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance and could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? Thanks a lot.

Erik Fyrwald: Okay I’ll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question Nicola or questions. So on the portfolio first of all the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year and we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. But then we have the other four business units that we’re going to really focus on driving forward. Of course with Nourish both the flavors and the functional ingredients we have the scent business and we have the health and biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well to drive profitable market share growth to drive healthy productivity to make sure that we’re bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter full year 2024 but do it in ways that strengthen us for ’25 and beyond.

We’re also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses and we’ll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you’ll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years but right now our focus is all on making sure we’ve got the right strategy the right capabilities in each business the right collaboration culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thanks Eric. Thanks for the question Nicola. We’re actually trending more favourable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As you mentioned a combination of earnings momentum actually working capital is actually performing better than planned and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We’re probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. I would note that that also includes higher Reg-G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting as Eric mentioned is the balance of this year separating systems legal entities etcetera. That’s roughly about $100 million. So on adjusted basis $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis directionally $600 million. Thanks for the question.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh your line is now open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWZsYXZvcnMtaWZmLXRvcHMtcTEtMjEzMDA0Mjc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Flavors (IFF) Tops Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"International Flavors (IFF) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

However since the Industrial Revolution when fossil energy consumption increased exponentially and therefore the emission of greenhouse gases this process of climate change has been more a consequence of human action than of natural phenomena.

For some scientists such is the transformation and magnitude of the changes induced in the environment that they have formulated the idea that we live in a new geological epoch characterised by the power of humans as a force of transformation on a global scale: the Anthropocene [7 15].

At present there is broad scientific consensus [14] practically universal that our current model of production and energy consumption is responsible for the planet-wide climatic alteration unprecedented in the history of mankind. While it is currently having a serious impact on both the environment and the world economy everything indicates that it will be exacerbated in the future.

To this end since its inception in 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been informing about the causes and possible repercussions of this phenomenon as well as proposing response strategies.

The IPCC’s fifth report in which more than 830 scientists from 85 countries participated concluded that “warming in the climate system is unequivocal and human influence is clear”. Some of the indisputable evidence of this climate change which the aforementioned report includes is the increase of 0.85 °C in the average temperature of the Earth since the beginning of the twentieth century the increase of 0.2 m. of the average sea level [27].

On the other hand increasingly prolonged and severe droughts worldwide as well as extreme weather events such as devastating fires torrential rains or hurricanes are becoming more frequent and intense [50].

The impact of this phenomenon is manifesting itself virulently in some areas of the planet causing changes in the way of life of millions of people. Climate Change is destroying crops killing herds or making traditional lifestyles unfeasible in entire regions of the planet.

Such is its impact that there are studies that state that Climate Change is currently considered to be a more important driver of migration than economic and political factors in the countries of origin [34 62].

Related to this the latest report by the World Bank Group [53] concludes that if urgent measures are not taken in the fight against Climate Change and Development by 2050 the number of displaced persons as a result of this phenomenon could reach 140 million in three of the most densely populated developing regions in the world (South of the Sahara South Asia and Latin America). The people of these lands would be forced to leave their lands as a result of water scarcity poor harvests rising sea levels and tsunamis.

On the other hand recent studies have shown that Climate Change has been one of the contributing factors for the unleashing of armed conflicts such as the recent one in Syria [13 52]. Climate change caused this country to suffer a major drought during the period 2007 to 2010 leading to a series of crop failures and the consequent displacement of millions of people from rural areas to cities resulting in overcrowding unemployment and major political unrest that eventually led to civil war [1 11].

However the evolution of the concept of Climate Change has undergone changes over time [49]. Together with the deterministic conceptions that accept the reality of climate change discrepant and critical voices have arisen that call into question its existence or even reject the concept altogether (Table 1).

Table 1 Definitions of climate change Full size table

The above notwithstanding the increase in evidence that refutes the existence of the phenomenon proves that Climate Change especially in developing countries can amplify existing vulnerabilities and instabilities in these regions and cause a marked increase in the number of displaced people. According to the forecasts made by the scientific community the influence of this phenomenon on migration can lead to risks to public safety and health [55 57].

Migratory movements as a consequence of environmental causes have been studied in the past. However it has only been in recent decades that the international scientific and political community has taken a special interest in identifying and assessing the link between both variables even to the extent that the International Organization for Migration [43] has proposed a definition for people who are forced to migrate due to climate related changesenvironmental consequences.

So called “environmental migrants” are people or groups of people who due to a sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives are forced to leave their habitual homes either temporarily or permanently and who move either within their country or abroad [30].

The interest that this issue has raised in the scientific community is such that in the last decade the number of articles which link Climate Change to an increase in migratory movements that are a result of attempts to adapt to the environment [8 20 23 29 35 36 38 64]. Of note are studies carried out in Africa [22 25 39 42 58] Asia [12 17 40 56 59 65] America [21 37 41 54 63] and to a lesser extent Europe [16 28].

For this reason we believe that it is very useful for the scientific community in this area of study to know the evolution of the publications that relate these two concepts migrations and climate change as well as the main areas of knowledge in which they have been developed.

The aim of this bibliometric study is to analyse the evolution of the scientific literature related to these two concepts (migration and climate change) not only to find out the current state but also where research trends in this field are heading to.

The knowledge generated by this study can be a very useful tool for the study design and implementation of new research on the subject as well as for the formulation of policies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of populations exposed to environmental risk factors that can lead to migration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL2luZGlhZWR1Y2F0aW9uZGlhcnkuaW4vZWNvLWNsdWItZ2RjLXNpZGhyYS1vcmdhbmlzZXMtaW50ZXJjb2xsZWdlLXBhcGVyLWFuZC1jbG90aC1iYWctYWN0aXZpdHktdG8tY29tbWVtb3JhdGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wbGFzdGljLWJhZy1mcmVlLWRheS0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ECO CLUB GDC Sidhra organises Intercollege Paper and Cloth Bag Activity to commemorate International Plastic Bag ...,"Jammu: July 3 marks International Plastic Bag Free Day when the world reminds itself of the importance to reduce the usage of plastic in everyday life which has otherwise proven to be extremely detrimental to the environment.

Recent television and radio commercials and advertising on social media platforms by Walmart encourage people in the region to take a pro-diversity pledge to address systemic racism.

Then on Friday the nonprofit Walton Family Foundation and the Northwest Arkansas Council a regional group of community and business leaders joined a ""friend of the court"" legal brief along with others to get one of those laws overturned.

Most of those pro-diversity efforts outside the courts were underway long before this year's legislative session organizers said. But one of the leaders of the Walton Family Foundation criticized legislative acts directly in recent public statements.

Tom Walton and his wife Olivia and their aunt Alice Walton announced on June 10 a $1 million commitment ""to a new statewide fund to improve the quality of life of LGBTQ Arkansans."" Four days later Tom Walton chairman of the Walton Family Foundation's Home Region Program Committee issued a statement criticizing ""recent discriminatory actions.""

""As Arkansas celebrates Pride Month we feel compelled to send a message of acceptance to the state's LGBTQ community who now live their lives under new policies that discriminate against them"" Tom Walton said in the June 14 statement referring to the state's lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer community. ""These efforts hurt our communities our economy and the many LGBTQ Arkansans who are our colleagues neighbors friends and family. It also sends the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit our state.

""The recent discriminatory actions are alarming. It saddens me to think of friends and colleagues who now not only question whether they belong here but whether they are even safe.""

Efforts to promote diversity in Northwest Arkansas didn't begin with the foundation nor is the organization driving them today said Emma Pengelly interim home region program director of the foundation.

""We do not think of this as leading a charge but as joining a cause"" Pengelly said Friday. The foundation's goal is to support and amplify local groups she said.

Recent legislative action ""didn't drive our effort"" Pengelly said ""but current events can help identify gaps our work can support.""

The Walton Family Foundation announced a five-year plan Feb. 8 in which celebrating diversity was a centerpiece. The plan builds on efforts to promote diversity nationwide and in Northwest Arkansas in particular by Walton-funded groups news accounts and foundation records show.

Those efforts go back years. For example the pro-diversity group EmergeNWA began in 2013 with foundation support. The effort is also varied Pengelly said. A major goal of the foundation is to ease high housing costs in the region. Those costs are making it harder for many to move here she said.

The Northwest Arkansas Council posted the pro-diversity pledge July 22. Walmart was an early backer of the pledge a council spokesman said Friday. The council encourages businesses groups and individuals to commit to the pledge online.

""In the aftermath of the senseless killings of George Floyd and so many other Black lives throughout the country by law enforcement the council led discussions on how to work together to foster a more welcoming region"" Nelson Peacock president of the Northwest Arkansas Council said at the time the pledge was announced.

Floyd died in Minneapolis in May 2020 after a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.

Jerry Cox founder and president of the Family Council a conservative advocacy group said the message most Arkansans give hasn't changed. Arkansas is still the state where giant companies such as Walmart Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport thrived.

He said what changed is the expectations of ""a liberal elite who think they're smarter and wiser.""

""What are we doing that's unwelcoming?"" Cox asked. ""Saying that boys can't compete with girls in sports? That we don't want little boys made into little girls? Go to Mountain Home and ask them if they think that's a good idea.

""You will get the same answer you always would have gotten"" he said. ""No.""

THE BILLS AT ISSUE

The bills in question are:

• Act 626 banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed the bill but the 100-member House overrode it in a 72-25 vote. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit over the legislation. The Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce will file a ""friend of the court"" legal brief in support of the ACLU's argument to overturn the act chamber President Randy Zook confirmed in a telephone interview Tuesday.

• Act 953 gives the state attorney general a cause of legal action to use against schools that knowingly allow athletes assigned the male sex at birth to participate on female sports teams.

• Act 462 allows health care providers to opt out of procedures they don't agree with based on their religious or moral beliefs. Sponsor Sen. Kim Hammer R-Benton said it would most likely apply to abortion. Critics argued that the bill could also apply to birth control service to the disabled or others. That bill also passed in the House with 72 votes.

• Four acts -- 249 728 736 and 973 -- regarding election law. The League of Women Voters and the immigrant rights group Arkansas United filed suit against all four saying they were discriminatory against the disabled voters who need translation of voting materials the elderly the poor and minority groups.

• The Legislature managed with difficulty to enact a hate crime law -- making Arkansas the 48th of the 50 states to do so. Such laws enhance penalties on crimes that arise out of prejudice or hatred of the victim's ethnicity sexual orientation or other distinctions.

The attempt to pass an Arkansas hate crime bill which failed in previous years lasted as long as the Legislature was in regular session this year. The finished bill omitted any reference to a ""hate crime."" Votes against the final version of what became Act 681 came largely from supporters of earlier proposals who called the measure that passed a diluted hollow gesture.

The day the Legislature voted to overturn the veto on Act 626 the Walton Family Foundation released a statement by Tom Walton which said in part: ""We are alarmed by the string of policy targeting LGBTQ people in Arkansas. This trend is harmful and sends the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit our state. We support Gov. Asa Hutchinson's recent veto of discriminatory policy and implore government business and community leaders to consider the impact of existing and future policy that limits basic freedoms and does not promote inclusiveness in our communities and economy.""

Rep. Robin Lundstrum R-Elm Springs sponsored Act 626.

""That's a bill to protect children"" she said Friday. ""Let them grow up. Then they can make adult decisions.""

Gender blocking or enhancing treatments are life-changing with irreversible effects she said. She pointed to news accounts on how the Karolinska Hospital in Sweden among other centers in that country stopped hormonal treatment of youths under 18 earlier this year. Finland has added restrictions on such treatments and Great Britain has had court cases where those treated as transgender in their youth later sued those who administered the treatment.

""I'd be happy to meet with them and discuss any concerns they have"" Lundstrum said of the foundation.

On Friday the brief filed in the ACLU lawsuit to overturn Act 626 described the law as ""an unconstitutional assault on the rights of transgender people."" Groups besides the foundation and the Northwest Arkansas Council joining in the brief included the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce Acxiom LLC and The Interpublic Group Acxiom's parent company. The ACLU's suit is in U.S. District Court in Little Rock.

""TIME WILL TELL""

Just-passed state laws criticized by LGBTQ groups have had at least one effect -- protest.

""I would have come anyway but those laws convinced me to bring more people with me"" said Brad Lawless of Bentonville a participant June 24 in Fayetteville's first Trans March to support transgender Arkansans.

About 500 walked along Dickson Street to a rally at the town center where organizers and speakers such as Jewel Hayes of Fayetteville.

The just-passed laws brought the trans groups allies and a degree of support they never had before said Richard Gathright director of Northwest Arkansas Pride a LGBTQ rights group.

The outpouring of support is appreciated Hayes said but that does not change the fact that the biggest reaction of transgender Arkansans to the law's passing is ""heartbreak.""

As for any other effects ""time will tell"" if recent legislative acts will hurt economic recruiting to the state said Cameron Smith of Cameron Smith and Associates a business talent recruiter whose firm has attracted businesses to the region for 27 years. The laws are new and have made no impact on recruiting yet he said.

California's attorney general banned state-funded travel to Arkansas and four other states June 23 for what he described as discriminatory acts by those states' legislatures.

""To my knowledge no one has been dissuaded from moving to or investing in Arkansas"" over the Legislature's recent actions Zook said. Still controversies did affect getting issues such as a hate crime law through the Legislature he said.

""We couldn't get a rational discussion about some of these issues"" Zook said.

On passing the hate crime law in particular ""some of the national groups in favor of it did us more harm than good"" he said. ""They kept the temperature and the volume up. It made passing the kind of bill they wanted impossible.""

Five Arkansas-based marketing companies were called and asked for comment on the issue of what if any effect the passage of the bills would have on the state's image. All five declined comment.

SOME PROGRESS

Diana Gonzales Worthen of Fayetteville is a founder of Hispanic Women of Arkansas which has encouraged acceptance of diversity in the region since forming in 1999. She is also a member of the steering committee of EngageNWA a group formed in 2013 ""on the principle that diverse communities perform better economically and in our increasingly global economy the regions that embrace these challenges will thrive"" according to the group's website.

Asked for her perspective on this year's legislative session and diversity Worthen cited the same bills noted in an earlier interview of Mireya Reith founder and executive director of Arkansas United an immigration rights group based in Springdale and one of the groups suing to overturn recently enacted election laws.

Progress was made this session Worthen and Reith said. There were serious setbacks and the resulting hate crime bill was disappointing they said but promoting diversity and inclusion in Arkansas was never going to be a sudden success.

""We're not going to stop"" Worthen said.

• Act 513 of 2021 allows college graduates who are beneficiaries of the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to get teaching certificates. Rights groups have sought this change for years.

DACA grants legal residency to people who were brought into the country as children and are here illegally. Children of immigrants in school will now have more teachers ""who look like them and who can talk to their parents in their language and who know their culture"" Worthen said. This helps make immigrants feel included in the community encourages getting college degrees and boosts the earning potential for the immigrant community at large she said.

• Act 217 makes legal residents who are not citizens eligible for the Arkansas Governor's Scholars program.

• Act 746 grants a state occupational or professional licensing entity to issue a license ""to anyone who fulfills the requirements Federal Form I-766 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services-issued Employment Authorization Document known popularly as a 'work permit.'"" This removes another obstacle to migrants trying to make a good living in Arkansas Worthen said.

Reith said pro-diversity bills with some additional benefit such as increasing the supply of teachers stood a good chance of passing. Those that were straight social statements favoring diversity such as the hate crime bill succeeded or failed on purely partisan lines she said.

""It was very painful to watch allies who cooperated with us on passing some of these bills say they understood the need for others but those issues were just too polarizing"" Reith said.

PARTISAN DIVIDE

Sen. Greg Leding D-Fayetteville supported hate crime legislation in this and previous legislative sessions and became one of the harshest critics of some bills that eventually passed this year.

Expressions of support at home and nationwide are all fine and good but what was really missing during the legislative session was strong support in the state Capitol Leding said.

""The business community was satisfied with a face-saving move on hate crimes"" he said. He acknowledged that passing anything stronger was challenging but that support could have been stronger.

""You don't get to put a rainbow flag up one month out of the year then cut a check in contributions to the same legislators who support these type of discriminatory bills and say you support diversity"" he said referring to business contributions to local lawmakers and to the rainbow flag symbol of the LGBTQ community.

Leding said partisan primaries are the biggest factor making ""culture war"" bills harsher. Winning a primary is tantamount to winning an election and that leaves a few hundred highly partisan voters deciding who the winner will be in most legislative contests he said.

Voter participation in party primaries is much lower than in general elections election records show. For instance no party primary race in Benton or Washington county for the state House on March 3 2020 had more than 3778 votes cast secretary of state records show. By comparison every House race in Benton or Washington county in the Nov. 3 general election had less than 10000 votes cast. One race drew 18534 ballots.

Therefore Leding said lawmakers fear losing a primary more than they worry about losing a general election. That leads to them taking more extreme positions on ""wedge issue"" bills he said.

Cox disagreed and said Arkansas always was and remains a socially conservative state. This was true when Democrats had the majority as late as 2012 he said.

""If lawmakers were out of step with the people of Arkansas they'd soon know it"" Cox said. ""When it's all said and done the Legislature reflects the people of Arkansas.""

Because it’s awesome.

This one was crossing the lawn this past week headed back to the trees and probably a nearby creek. Despite the name wood turtles still favor being around water though much more inclined to regularly go walkabout on land than the painted or snapping turtles.

The wood turtle is the rarest of the three turtles that can be expected in the Upper Peninsula. While pockets of the yellow-throated Blanding’s turtle can be found in certain U.P. counties they’re not as widespread as the wood said Jim Harding an adjunct wildlife specialist at the Michigan State University Museum who spent much of his life studying the wood turtle. But the wood struggles more than the Blanding’s in the Lower Peninsula though both turtles are “species of special concern” in Michigan.

The wood usually sticks by rivers and streams — “they’re an animal of moving water” — rather than the pools preferred by the painteds. Yet females “tend to go terrestrial for the first part of summer while males often hang near the water hoping a female will come down” to mate along the shoreline Harding said.

He was unable to tell the sex of this one from photos. The behavior — quite a distance from the creek quite close to our sand and gravel driveway that each year sees a steady march of turtles to lay eggs — suggests it was a female.

Counting the growth rings on the back shell Harding judged this turtle to be at least 25 years old — which means it predates the house being on the property. While it could be older he said the very distinct ridges and general lack of wear on the shell probably means it’s close to what’s indicated by the rings.

Though in the same family as the more aquatic painted turtles wood turtles have a number of different characteristics. The shell is more domed though not as much as the box turtle with a central keel and individual plates that look vaguely like pyramids or barnacles. The legs have more prominent scales and the head more prominent eyes. The wood seems more like a “tortoise” in appearance though that name in the U.S. is reserved for one family of fully terrestrial turtles Harding said.

Another major difference between the wood turtle and its painted cousins is wood turtles hatch more quickly sometimes by mid-July and never overwinter underground in the nest Harding said. Yet they mature more slowly than the painteds not reaching breeding age until about 14 to 16 years old he said compared with 9 to 10 years for painteds.

The wood turtle makes up for that in longevity: Harding who has studied the species since 1969 has data on wood turtles 75 to 80 years old and actually has one at his Lansing area home that’s probably about 60.

But wood turtles in the wild face a number of challenges to reaching an advanced age. Harding thinks the main threat today has been the rise of the raccoon. When he first began coming to the Upper Peninsula as a child local residents would tell him raccoons were rare in the 1940s and 1950s.

During his early years of research he’d see raccoons plunder some turtle nests but most would go undetected. Then interest waned in raccoon pelts hunting relaxed and raccoons followed humans in spreading out Harding said.

By the late 1990s some turtle nesting areas had no eggs survive to hatch. Worse the raccoons are efficient predators on the turtles gnawing on legs or tail until the turtle bleeds out. He’s seen a number of wood turtles missing limbs or tails.

Though retired Harding recently visited an old wood turtle study site where he and other colleagues managed to recapture five older juvenile wood turtles that had been incubated years ago for a “head start” and then released in the wild. Though encouraged that they’d survived the lack of younger turtles indicated “natural reproduction and recruitment is still very low in the area.”

Poaching for the pet trade especially overseas continues to stunt the wood turtle population as well Harding said which is why he usually won’t reveal exactly where he finds them.

He did have some good news for the species — despite some fears about the effects of human disturbance Harding believes wood turtles can co-exist with logging and some development in their environment. Clear-cuts for example will open up nesting sites or develop foliage they prefer to feed on he said.

If the human neighbors take some care to watch for wood turtles “they’re very compatible with people as long as we don’t run them over with cars” he said.

“Wood turtles are not a species of the wilderness” he said. “As long as the turtles themselves are left alone — and the area is not totally paved over — they’re fine.”

John Soderman concluded the scoring with a two-out solo homer off of a fastball by Hunter Lancour in the fourth inning as the Indians improved to 4-5.

“That was a great boost for our team” said Gladstone manager Scott Kwarciany. “That without a doubt was the biggest hit of his career. We brought John up from the Junior Indians because we needed help at second base and the home run was such a big boost for him and a big energy boost in our dugout. Hunter’s a great pitcher but we were able to take advantage of a few errors.”

The Cubs (3-4) opened the scoring on Grant LaMarche’s single to left-centerfield in the first.

Gladstone evened the score on Ryan Polley’s single to right in its half of the first.

Riley Lamb then gave Esky a 2-1 lead on a wild pitch in the second before the Indians took their first lead on Tyler Darmogray’s two-run single to shallow center in their half of the inning.

Lancour pulled Esky even at three on a throwing error in the third.

The Indians regained the lead on Dayton Bernson’s single to center in the bottom of the third setting the stage for Soderman’s first career homer.

Esky stranded 11 baserunners including six in scoring position. Gladstone left five on the basepaths.

“We kept doing the same things to ourselves” said Esky manager Jon Bintner. “Gladstone put the ball in play in critical situations and we struck out with runners on base which is something we can’t do. Gladstone seems to be going in the right direction. They always play us tough. It seems like we don’t get up for these games as much as they do. That needs to change.”

Both teams finished with five hits with Lancour leading the Cubs with two.

Mason LaChance who pitched four innings in relief of Trevor Hanson took the win. He struck out five walked three hit a batter and gave up just one hit. Hanson fanned two walked three and allowed three runs on four hits through three frames.

“Mason is one of our team leaders” said Kwarciany. “Their top five hitters are very good. For Mason to get through the top of their order twice and give up just one hit was a great effort on his part. Trevor also pitched well. He held them in check.”

Lancour who went the distance took the loss despite 10 strikeouts. He walked four.

“Hunter battled but I think he’ll tell you he didn’t have his best game” said Bintner. “We need to make sure we have proper warm-ups between innings. We made a couple mistakes and they got a couple runs off those.”

Gladstone committed three errors and Esky had two.

Esky hosted Iron Mountain Gold Friday night and resumes with a home game against Bark River Monday. The Indians visit Marquette for a twinbill Tuesday.

Recent television and radio commercials and advertising on social media platforms by Walmart encourage people in the region to take a pro-diversity pledge to address systemic racism.

Then on Friday the nonprofit Walton Family Foundation and the Northwest Arkansas Council a regional group of community and business leaders joined a ""friend of the court"" legal brief along with others to get one of those laws overturned.

Most of those pro-diversity efforts outside the courts were underway long before this year's legislative session organizers said. But one of the leaders of the Walton Family Foundation criticized legislative acts directly in recent public statements.

Tom Walton and his wife Olivia and their aunt Alice Walton announced on June 10 a $1 million commitment ""to a new statewide fund to improve the quality of life of LGBTQ Arkansans."" Four days later Tom Walton chairman of the Walton Family Foundation's Home Region Program Committee issued a statement criticizing ""recent discriminatory actions.""

""As Arkansas celebrates Pride Month we feel compelled to send a message of acceptance to the state's LGBTQ community who now live their lives under new policies that discriminate against them"" Tom Walton said in the June 14 statement referring to the state's lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer community. ""These efforts hurt our communities our economy and the many LGBTQ Arkansans who are our colleagues neighbors friends and family. It also sends the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit our state.

""The recent discriminatory actions are alarming. It saddens me to think of friends and colleagues who now not only question whether they belong here but whether they are even safe.""

Efforts to promote diversity in Northwest Arkansas didn't begin with the foundation nor is the organization driving them today said Emma Pengelly interim home region program director of the foundation.

""We do not think of this as leading a charge but as joining a cause"" Pengelly said Friday. The foundation's goal is to support and amplify local groups she said.

Recent legislative action ""didn't drive our effort"" Pengelly said ""but current events can help identify gaps our work can support.""

The Walton Family Foundation announced a five-year plan Feb. 8 in which celebrating diversity was a centerpiece. The plan builds on efforts to promote diversity nationwide and in Northwest Arkansas in particular by Walton-funded groups news accounts and foundation records show.

Those efforts go back years. For example the pro-diversity group EmergeNWA began in 2013 with foundation support. The effort is also varied Pengelly said. A major goal of the foundation is to ease high housing costs in the region. Those costs are making it harder for many to move here she said.

The Northwest Arkansas Council posted the pro-diversity pledge July 22. Walmart was an early backer of the pledge a council spokesman said Friday. The council encourages businesses groups and individuals to commit to the pledge online.

""In the aftermath of the senseless killings of George Floyd and so many other Black lives throughout the country by law enforcement the council led discussions on how to work together to foster a more welcoming region"" Nelson Peacock president of the Northwest Arkansas Council said at the time the pledge was announced.

Floyd died in Minneapolis in May 2020 after a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.

Jerry Cox founder and president of the Family Council a conservative advocacy group said the message most Arkansans give hasn't changed. Arkansas is still the state where giant companies such as Walmart Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport thrived.

He said what changed is the expectations of ""a liberal elite who think they're smarter and wiser.""

""What are we doing that's unwelcoming?"" Cox asked. ""Saying that boys can't compete with girls in sports? That we don't want little boys made into little girls? Go to Mountain Home and ask them if they think that's a good idea.

""You will get the same answer you always would have gotten"" he said. ""No.""

THE BILLS AT ISSUE

The bills in question are:

• Act 626 banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed the bill but the 100-member House overrode it in a 72-25 vote. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit over the legislation. The Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce will file a ""friend of the court"" legal brief in support of the ACLU's argument to overturn the act chamber President Randy Zook confirmed in a telephone interview Tuesday.

• Act 953 gives the state attorney general a cause of legal action to use against schools that knowingly allow athletes assigned the male sex at birth to participate on female sports teams.

• Act 462 allows health care providers to opt out of procedures they don't agree with based on their religious or moral beliefs. Sponsor Sen. Kim Hammer R-Benton said it would most likely apply to abortion. Critics argued that the bill could also apply to birth control service to the disabled or others. That bill also passed in the House with 72 votes.

• Four acts -- 249 728 736 and 973 -- regarding election law. The League of Women Voters and the immigrant rights group Arkansas United filed suit against all four saying they were discriminatory against the disabled voters who need translation of voting materials the elderly the poor and minority groups.

• The Legislature managed with difficulty to enact a hate crime law -- making Arkansas the 48th of the 50 states to do so. Such laws enhance penalties on crimes that arise out of prejudice or hatred of the victim's ethnicity sexual orientation or other distinctions.

The attempt to pass an Arkansas hate crime bill which failed in previous years lasted as long as the Legislature was in regular session this year. The finished bill omitted any reference to a ""hate crime."" Votes against the final version of what became Act 681 came largely from supporters of earlier proposals who called the measure that passed a diluted hollow gesture.

The day the Legislature voted to overturn the veto on Act 626 the Walton Family Foundation released a statement by Tom Walton which said in part: ""We are alarmed by the string of policy targeting LGBTQ people in Arkansas. This trend is harmful and sends the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit our state. We support Gov. Asa Hutchinson's recent veto of discriminatory policy and implore government business and community leaders to consider the impact of existing and future policy that limits basic freedoms and does not promote inclusiveness in our communities and economy.""

Rep. Robin Lundstrum R-Elm Springs sponsored Act 626.

""That's a bill to protect children"" she said Friday. ""Let them grow up. Then they can make adult decisions.""

Gender blocking or enhancing treatments are life-changing with irreversible effects she said. She pointed to news accounts on how the Karolinska Hospital in Sweden among other centers in that country stopped hormonal treatment of youths under 18 earlier this year. Finland has added restrictions on such treatments and Great Britain has had court cases where those treated as transgender in their youth later sued those who administered the treatment.

""I'd be happy to meet with them and discuss any concerns they have"" Lundstrum said of the foundation.

On Friday the brief filed in the ACLU lawsuit to overturn Act 626 described the law as ""an unconstitutional assault on the rights of transgender people."" Groups besides the foundation and the Northwest Arkansas Council joining in the brief included the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce Acxiom LLC and The Interpublic Group Acxiom's parent company. The ACLU's suit is in U.S. District Court in Little Rock.

""TIME WILL TELL""

Just-passed state laws criticized by LGBTQ groups have had at least one effect -- protest.

""I would have come anyway but those laws convinced me to bring more people with me"" said Brad Lawless of Bentonville a participant June 24 in Fayetteville's first Trans March to support transgender Arkansans.

About 500 walked along Dickson Street to a rally at the town center where organizers and speakers such as Jewel Hayes of Fayetteville.

The just-passed laws brought the trans groups allies and a degree of support they never had before said Richard Gathright director of Northwest Arkansas Pride a LGBTQ rights group.

The outpouring of support is appreciated Hayes said but that does not change the fact that the biggest reaction of transgender Arkansans to the law's passing is ""heartbreak.""

As for any other effects ""time will tell"" if recent legislative acts will hurt economic recruiting to the state said Cameron Smith of Cameron Smith and Associates a business talent recruiter whose firm has attracted businesses to the region for 27 years. The laws are new and have made no impact on recruiting yet he said.

California's attorney general banned state-funded travel to Arkansas and four other states June 23 for what he described as discriminatory acts by those states' legislatures.

""To my knowledge no one has been dissuaded from moving to or investing in Arkansas"" over the Legislature's recent actions Zook said. Still controversies did affect getting issues such as a hate crime law through the Legislature he said.

""We couldn't get a rational discussion about some of these issues"" Zook said.

On passing the hate crime law in particular ""some of the national groups in favor of it did us more harm than good"" he said. ""They kept the temperature and the volume up. It made passing the kind of bill they wanted impossible.""

Five Arkansas-based marketing companies were called and asked for comment on the issue of what if any effect the passage of the bills would have on the state's image. All five declined comment.

SOME PROGRESS

Diana Gonzales Worthen of Fayetteville is a founder of Hispanic Women of Arkansas which has encouraged acceptance of diversity in the region since forming in 1999. She is also a member of the steering committee of EngageNWA a group formed in 2013 ""on the principle that diverse communities perform better economically and in our increasingly global economy the regions that embrace these challenges will thrive"" according to the group's website.

Asked for her perspective on this year's legislative session and diversity Worthen cited the same bills noted in an earlier interview of Mireya Reith founder and executive director of Arkansas United an immigration rights group based in Springdale and one of the groups suing to overturn recently enacted election laws.

Progress was made this session Worthen and Reith said. There were serious setbacks and the resulting hate crime bill was disappointing they said but promoting diversity and inclusion in Arkansas was never going to be a sudden success.

""We're not going to stop"" Worthen said.

• Act 513 of 2021 allows college graduates who are beneficiaries of the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to get teaching certificates. Rights groups have sought this change for years.

DACA grants legal residency to people who were brought into the country as children and are here illegally. Children of immigrants in school will now have more teachers ""who look like them and who can talk to their parents in their language and who know their culture"" Worthen said. This helps make immigrants feel included in the community encourages getting college degrees and boosts the earning potential for the immigrant community at large she said.

• Act 217 makes legal residents who are not citizens eligible for the Arkansas Governor's Scholars program.

• Act 746 grants a state occupational or professional licensing entity to issue a license ""to anyone who fulfills the requirements Federal Form I-766 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services-issued Employment Authorization Document known popularly as a 'work permit.'"" This removes another obstacle to migrants trying to make a good living in Arkansas Worthen said.

Reith said pro-diversity bills with some additional benefit such as increasing the supply of teachers stood a good chance of passing. Those that were straight social statements favoring diversity such as the hate crime bill succeeded or failed on purely partisan lines she said.

""It was very painful to watch allies who cooperated with us on passing some of these bills say they understood the need for others but those issues were just too polarizing"" Reith said.

PARTISAN DIVIDE

Sen. Greg Leding D-Fayetteville supported hate crime legislation in this and previous legislative sessions and became one of the harshest critics of some bills that eventually passed this year.

Expressions of support at home and nationwide are all fine and good but what was really missing during the legislative session was strong support in the state Capitol Leding said.

""The business community was satisfied with a face-saving move on hate crimes"" he said. He acknowledged that passing anything stronger was challenging but that support could have been stronger.

""You don't get to put a rainbow flag up one month out of the year then cut a check in contributions to the same legislators who support these type of discriminatory bills and say you support diversity"" he said referring to business contributions to local lawmakers and to the rainbow flag symbol of the LGBTQ community.

Leding said partisan primaries are the biggest factor making ""culture war"" bills harsher. Winning a primary is tantamount to winning an election and that leaves a few hundred highly partisan voters deciding who the winner will be in most legislative contests he said.

Voter participation in party primaries is much lower than in general elections election records show. For instance no party primary race in Benton or Washington county for the state House on March 3 2020 had more than 3778 votes cast secretary of state records show. By comparison every House race in Benton or Washington county in the Nov. 3 general election had less than 10000 votes cast. One race drew 18534 ballots.

Therefore Leding said lawmakers fear losing a primary more than they worry about losing a general election. That leads to them taking more extreme positions on ""wedge issue"" bills he said.

Cox disagreed and said Arkansas always was and remains a socially conservative state. This was true when Democrats had the majority as late as 2012 he said.

""If lawmakers were out of step with the people of Arkansas they'd soon know it"" Cox said. ""When it's all said and done the Legislature reflects the people of Arkansas.""

For the complete transcript of the earnings call please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY Financial) reported a strong quarter with a 6% increase in total revenue and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

The company experienced robust growth in its core business segment with revenue up 7% for the quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) achieved significant sales success including 11 competitive core takeaways and strong interest in new solutions like the Financial Crimes Defender.

The company's Banno Digital banking platform continues to grow now serving over 11.6 million users with approximately 200000 new users added per month.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) maintains a strong sales pipeline keeping it near an all-time high which supports ongoing optimism for future performance.

Negative Points

Despite strong sales the actual revenue recognition from these sales is expected in future years indicating a lag between sales success and financial impact.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) faces increasing competition in the financial technology space with new entrants continuously emerging.

The company noted a decrease in deconversion revenue by approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation among clients.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the banking sector could pose challenges to client operations and affect their technology spending.

Operational costs have risen including higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees which could impact profit margins if not managed effectively.

Here's what I found.,"Here’s what editors at The Salt Lake Tribune told me when I was hired in 2019:

Utah is routinely labeled as the worst state for women because it has the nation’s widest wage gap a low college graduation rate for women and fewer women leaders in politics and business. My job they said would be to analyze data like this tie it to personal stories to give more context to women’s lives in Utah and explore solutions.

At first I wondered: Is Utah’s reputation fair? As someone who moved to the Beehive State from the Midwest I was one of those people who had the impression that Utah was a poor place for women.

As I reported I later began to wonder: How long have Utah women lived with this reputation and what are the circumstances that led to it? And can both change?

More than 130 stories and 350 interviews later as well as hours spent in recent months sorting through boxes of documents at the Utah State Archives here’s the bottom line of what I’ve learned:

Some perceptions of Utah women are exaggerated and overgeneralized but there are undeniable underlying issues and statistics that give credibility to this reputation. And this is not a new phenomenon for Utah women — they’ve struggled with their national image since before statehood.

Over the next few weeks I’ll be sharing context from history and insights from Utah women today in new ways — including fact checks data visualizations and even a quiz.

During my interviews one trailblazing female Utahn told me that she thinks women “are still second class in Utah.” Another person said “there’s very much a stereotype that women in Utah are oppressed” and “they don’t even know it.”

A few people told me that it will be difficult to change outsiders’ perceptions of women in the Beehive State.

But what’s always struck me in this reporting is how in the same breath as telling me about the list of problems that women in this state face many women also tell me how much they love living here. And I’ve seen up close the many women working every day to improve the lives of other women in the state.

Utah provides a unique opportunity to cover women’s issues and looking back now I don’t think my editors could have known how this reporting would become even more relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than two million women across the country have left the workforce as women faced a disproportionate share of job losses and struggled with child care responsibilities when kids transitioned to learning virtually.

Experts worry that this “shecession” may set women back decades.

Utah’s trends for women during the pandemic have been no better. Women’s jobs declined at twice the rate as men in the state from 2019 to 2020 according to a brief from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute.

And women here are feeling “burned out” a report from the Utah Women and Leadership Project at Utah State University said.

Whenever we fully emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic it’s clear that Utah can’t go back to the status quo when it comes to the state’s women.

I’m looking forward to sharing this reporting with you in new ways in the next couple of weeks. As I begin my third year of covering the status of women in Utah I want to hear from you about where to go next. What stories do you want to read? Who should we interview? How do you think the lives of Utah women — and the state’s reputation — can change?

“America is divided as ever before. But there is one thing we all agree on no matter politics. Congress is broken and there doesn’t seem to be any way to fix it.” said Jacobs. He continued “The U.S. Constitution provides the solution in Article V which gives the states the authority to convene to propose amendments to the Constitution. Our goal is to make sure the state of Tennessee is the next state to pass a resolution for the states to add term limits on Congress to the U.S. Constitution. ”

In addition to being Mayor of Knox County since 2018 Glenn Jacobs is a three-time world champion in World Wrestling Entertainment as the infamous “Kane.” He and his wife Crystle own an Allstate Insurance agency in Knoxville Tennessee.

“We are extremely pleased that Mayor Jacobs will be taking the leadership role in our growing movement to pass term limits on Congress in Tennessee. He will bring energy and enthusiasm to this important issue as we work to pass the resolution in the volunteer state” said Blumel the President of U.S. Term Limits.

“This is a great honor for me to be chairperson for such an important effort” said Jacobs.

Blumel added “A recent survey of Tennesseeans shows that 78% support term limits on Congress including 90% Democrats 77% Republicans and 71% independents. This is a rare truly nonpartisan issue with national appeal.”

The Term Limits on Congress resolution House Joint Resolution 8 passed the Tennesse house this session. It must pass the Tennessee state senate by the end of next session in order for Tennessee to be added to the growing list of states calling for a convention to propose term limits on Congress. Once 34 state legislatures pass similar resolutions on the topic and approve the term limits amendment it must be ratified by 38 states to become part of the U.S. Constitution.

Tennessee has strong term limits advocates in Congress including Rep. Tim Burchett Rep. Diana Harshbarger Rep. Mark Green and Senator Bill Haggrty all cosponsors of the term limits resolutions in Congress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mb3JtZXItbmZsLXN0YXItcnVubmluZy1iYWNrLWJyYW5kb24tamFjb2JzLXNheXMtdGhyZWUtdGVhbXMtYXJlLWludGVyZXN0ZWQtaW4taGlzLWNvbWViYWNr0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Zvcm1lci1uZmwtc3Rhci1ydW5uaW5nLWJhY2stYnJhbmRvbi1qYWNvYnMtc2F5cy10aHJlZS10ZWFtcy1hcmUtaW50ZXJlc3RlZC1pbi1oaXMtY29tZWJhY2suYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former NFL star running back Brandon Jacobs says three teams are interested in his comeback,"Longtime New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs is looking to make a comeback after retiring from the NFL more than seven years ago and he says three teams have reached out to him.

Males are in full breeding plumage and present a vivid contrast between deep black and bright yellow with some white thrown in for emphasis.

Most species have become more secretive as summer moves along but that’s not true of the goldfinch. Goldfinches are late nesters. While most species are occupied with brooding and caring for young goldfinches continue to visit feeders. Breeding season for goldfinches begins soon. It’s timed to coincide with the ripening of thistles which provide down to line nests and seed to feed nestlings.

Always in Season/ Mike Jacobs: Elusive describes the black-billed cuckoo Cuckoos calling are a sure sign of summer. They are late migrants arriving in June after trees are fully in leaf. They don’t stay long usually departing by late August.



Always in Season/ Mike Jacobs: Mourning doves are more often heard than seen The mourning dove is best known for its call a mournful cooing sound that supplied the bird’s common name. Mourning doves call throughout the day but they are especially vocal in early morning.



Late breeding is not the only anomaly that goldfinches present. Overall they are quite complicated creatures. In addition to their “off-season” nesting goldfinches differ in appearance. Males are brilliantly colored; females are plainer more green than yellow. That’s in the breeding season. Both sexes molt into still another plumage when breeding season ends. Scientifically speaking goldfinches are sexually and seasonally dimorphic.

Plus there are transitional plumages. These can cause trouble in flocks of winter birds but goldfinches stand out because of their small size and the wings which both sexes display when they fly.

Yellow is the most obvious color in breeding males. Black occurs on the top of the head and the wings and the white bars in the wings are obvious in flight. Flight is distinctive too. Goldfinches tend to bounce as they fly. This undulating flight is often accompanied by a kind of buzzing often rendered as “tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit.” This “contact call” helps keep flocks of goldfinches together and it’s a useful tool for birders wishing to find and follow goldfinches.

Goldfinches had been considered strictly summertime birds in our area but they have become regular in winter too perhaps because winters have been warmer perhaps because habitat has improved but – perhaps most likely – because bird feeding has become widespread. This allows the goldfinches to maintain themselves with rather less effort than they would need to survive a winter unaided.

Winter goldfinches sometimes occur in mixed flocks with pine siskins. Siskins display some yellow in their plumage but they are heavily streaked overall and goldfinches have little or no streaking. They are all together nattier birds.

The goldfinch is not the only yellow bird of summer. Yellow warblers are common in back yards at this time of year. They are much more secretive than goldfinches and they don’t come to bird feeders since they are not seed eaters. Yellow warblers aren’t especially shy but their feeding habits keep them in dense foliage rather than on feeding platforms. Goldfinches don’t hesitate to come to seeds spread on the ground. Yellow warblers are rarely seen on the ground.

Either of these species might qualify for the “yellow bird” honored by Indigenous people in family names. Yellow Bird is a fairly common name at the Fort Berthold nation. An example is Dorreen Yellow Bird a longtime columnist at the Herald and an enrolled member of the Three Affiliated Tribes.

The goldfinch has another common name wild canary. Occasionally I hear reports of canaries; these almost inevitably turn out to be goldfinches. Canaries are African birds; in our area they occur only as escapees from bird cages.

Another sighting

Quite a different species has caused a flurry among local birders this season. This is the turkey vulture a huge bird that never fails to impress – especially when a flock of them settles into the bare branches of a cottonwood tree. That’s what happened in Grand Forks last week – although the birds were actually roosting on the east side of the Red River.

I’ve spotted vultures in western Grand Forks County where Suezette and I live. Sunday afternoon one dropped by our backyard. Earlier vultures showed up on the carcass of a deer killed on the road nearby.

This raised the question of whether turkey vultures – rare until quite recently – have taken up residence. So far evidence of nesting vultures is lacking but the birds have become an expected part of birdlife in the northern Red River Valley.

The vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43 with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.

Members of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker and when the last Republican to hold the post Kevin McCarthy faced a removal vote last fall Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him helping lead to his historic ouster.

This time the Democratic support made the critical difference allowing Mr. Johnson who has a minuscule majority to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtYm9vZWQtaG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greene booed as Republicans turn on her over bid to oust Speaker Johnson,"They heckled her and shouted boos as she rose to speak and some hissed at her — and those were the voices from the same side of the aisle as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).

Greene tried to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) from leadership on Wednesday but Republicans overwhelmingly opposed her bid. And that effort proved to be the final straw for many of her GOP colleagues who have expressed a growing distaste for her antics during her three years in Congress. It even led to a rare admonishment by one of her most ardent supporters — former president Donald Trump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9wb2xpdGljcy9ob3VzZS12b3RlLXNwZWFrZXItam9obnNvbi12b3RlLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtZGcvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvcG9saXRpY3MvaG91c2Utdm90ZS1zcGVha2VyLWpvaG5zb24tdm90ZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLWRn?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How members of the House voted on failed effort to oust Speaker Johnson,"1.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.

One of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of “transgressions” she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.

Greene criticized Johnson’s leadership as “pathetic weak and unacceptable.”

After Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.

An overwhelming majority 359-43 kept Johnson in his job for now.

“As I’ve said from the beginning and I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job” Johnson said afterward. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view that is leadership.”

It’s the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.

The tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson’s hold on the gavel and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.

All told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene’s effort more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers — any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.

Johnson said he hoped it “is the end of the personality politics.”

As Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels including Trump GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.

The Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.

But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.

Johnson of Louisiana marched on saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the “right side of history.”

In a highly unusual move the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York whose leadership team had said it was time to “turn the page” on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene’s resolution — almost ensuring Johnson’s job is saved for now.

“Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems” Jeffries said after the vote.

Trump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump’s hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.

Ahead of House voting Trump said on social media “I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene” but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene’s motion.

“At some point we may very well be but this is not the time” Trump said to oust the speaker.

The move now poses its own political risks for Greene a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.

Greene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote – putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.

“I’m proud of what I did today” Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.

While reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.

Rep. Dusty Johnson R-S.D. said of those trying to remove the speaker “They’re pretty good at getting attention but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.”

He said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker “I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.”

Reps. Carlos Giménez a Florida Republican said of Greene: “She doesn’t represent the Republican Party. I’m tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That’s all she wants is the attention.”

Rep. Mike Lawler R-N.Y. called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.

Had Democrats not taken the unusual move to help the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times with no votes to spare.

Last year the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker’s office and Democrats declined to help save him.

Ousting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.

A proposal to upgrade residence halls on campus is key to bringing the university full-circle on its ongoing project to add new facilities such as the Memorial Union and the newly-redesigned Chester Fritz Library. The university has invested in those buildings and others and is making inroads to partnering with the U.S. Space Force to expand its research expertise. Improved student housing will tie those projects together.

“It would be good to have housing equal to the really good teaching and research that we do here as well as the wonderful high-touch effort that we make with each and every student” said Jed Shivers vice president of finance and operations at UND.

On June 29 the State Board of Higher Education accepted UND's proposal to partner with Johnson Controls Plenary Corvias -- called JCP -- for the multi-building project. According to Shivers UND still needs to finalize negotiations with JCP but the two entities he said have a good relationship. The SBHE Budget and Finance Committee needs to sign off on the actual project at a meeting in July and following that the entire board later that month.

Under the project residential housing for students primarily underclassmen will be concentrated in the complex around Wilkerson Hall. The plan is to start by tearing down then reconstructing McVey while carrying out extensive renovations of Brannon. Selke and Noren halls would see some improvements and become housing for budget-conscious students. The demolition and rebuild of West would round out the project.

Should the proposal get the green light UND officials don’t intend to wait.

“Once we get the final board approval in July we will execute right away” said Mike Pieper associate vice president of facilities.

The completed project would create a quad for student recreation and the building would be connected to Wilkerson for easy access to dining facilities.

The idea of a housing redesign compliments investments UND has made in other areas but also reflects the Grand Forks housing market. Pieper said at one time UND had space for more than 5000 students to live on campus but as housing options improved students upperclassmen largely moved off campus. Given that availability UND is looking to “right size” its number of residential rooms to about 1900.

The project is part of the university’s plan to use its space more efficiently. Housing space would be reduced by more than 1 million square feet which would save more than $20 million in deferred maintenance costs.

While the redevelopment project focuses on the west side of the English Coulee the door remains open for future redevelopment on the east side. Buildings like Squires Bek and Walsh could be torn down to make room for space for private developers. A possible idea could be adding apartments that are more attractive to upperclassmen.

Residence halls to the south Squires including Johnstone Smith and Fulton could be turned over for academic use. Pieper said the idea is to keep student housing to the north of University Avenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3JpZGFiYXIub3JnL3RoZS1mbG9yaWRhLWJhci1qb3VybmFsL3Bvc3QtdGlhcmEtY29udHJhY3RzLWFyZS1zdGlsbC1raW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Post-Tiara: Contracts Are Still King – The Florida Bar,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/post-tiara-contracts-are-still-king/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3JpZGFiYXIub3JnL3RoZS1mbG9yaWRhLWJhci1qb3VybmFsL3Bvc3QtdGlhcmEtY29udHJhY3RzLWFyZS1zdGlsbC1raW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qc29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2phbWVzLWJyZW5uYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTkwNDg4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Brennan Obituary (1940 - 2021) - Brookfield WI - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/jsonline/name/james-brennan-obituary?id=5904880 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qc29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2phbWVzLWJyZW5uYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTkwNDg4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRyYWRlbWFnLmNvbS9maXJlLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tc3lzdGVtcy1tYXJrZXQtcmV2ZW51ZS10by1vYnNlcnZlLTUtNS1nYWlucy10by0yMDI3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fire Protection Systems Market Revenue to Observe 5.5% Gains to 2027,"Global Market Insights

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

Recent trends in the global fire protection systems market are driven by an upsurge in product launches by major fire safety equipment suppliers.

For instance in October 2020 Honeywell rolled out the first tools from its new suite of CLSS (Connected Life Safety Services) the company’s first all-in-one cloud platform for fire protection systems. The organization’s CLSS line of tools developed on the Honeywell Forge platform allows fire technicians to provide compliance minimize disruption and decrease the time required for installation design maintenance commissioning and reporting of life safety systems.

According to Sameer Agrawal Honeywell’s General Manager of Global Fire Software and Services today’s global environment requires the life and fire safety industry to innovate solutions that allow system integrators and facility managers to diagnose issues and monitor their systems irrespective of the time and location.

Similar advancements are expected to boost the demand for fire protection equipment through the forthcoming years. On this note the global fire protection systems market size is estimated to surpass USD 70 billion by 2027 cites the latest research by Global Market Insights Inc.

This growth is attributed to the rising product demand in light of the surging number of fire accidents due to the lack of fire protection systems at heritage sites.

For exemplar in 2019 the NCHA (National Cultural Heritage Administration) reported almost six fire accidents at heritage sites and buildings. For overcoming like issues the Chinese government has started the deployment of fire protection systems as prevention measures.

Some major trends driving fire protection systems industry outlook comprise:

Increasing industrialization and urbanization in the APAC

The Asia Pacific fire protection systems market is set to exhibit an appreciable CAGR through 2027 considering the rising urbanization and industrialization in the region.

Various countries comprising India Japan and China are focusing on the implementation of numerous building guidelines and codes for the fire safety of structures bolstering the demand for fire protection equipment in the region.

Rising corporate strategies by major industry participants

Prominent players in the fire protection systems market include Schneider Electric Johnson Controls International PLC Siemens AG Fire Suppression Limited Napco Security Technologies Hochiki Corporation Schrack Seconet AG and others.

These fire safety equipment suppliers are focusing on various collaborative strategies such as acquisitions and mergers for the expansion of their geographical footprint.

For instance in June 2018 Johnson Controls rolled out its fire protection system Autocall in the Middle East for its application in large as well as small projects in industries comprising oil & gas and chemical.

Surging product usage across the residential sector

An escalation in the loss of life and property damage on account of the rising residential fire accidents is slated to foster the growth of the residential segment in the fire protection systems industry through the ensuing years.

Furthermore a rise in the demand for construction activities due to an increase in population is expected to boost the deployment of fire protection systems in buildings.

In a nutshell surging government standards and regulations for the improvement of the safety of individuals and industrial commercial and residential property during fire outbreaks will augment fire protection systems market share over the assessment period.

Brendan McDermid | Reuters

From Krispy Kreme to China's Didi Chuxing the busiest week for U.S. IPOs in 17 years produced a windfall for Wall Street's top investment banks. A cybersecurity company drug developers and a Turkish e-commerce platform were all in on the action. At least 14 companies raised $100 million or more in offerings on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange the most active stretch for debuts since 2004. In total underwriters generated close to $400 million in fees for assisting with the IPOs. They're sitting on an additional $259 million in paper gains as of Friday's close assuming they exercise their options to purchase all of their allotted shares at the IPO discount. The pace of offerings underscores the demand for growth and shows that IPOs remain the preferred route to the market despite the rise of direct listings which have no underwriters and come with much lower advisory fees. It's a highly lucrative business for Wall Street and there's no slowdown in sight.

Robinhood filed its IPO prospectus on Thursday and is poised to be one of the biggest offerings of the year. Surging demand for crypto assets led to a quadrupling in first-quarter revenue to $522 million while the company's loss swelled to $1.4 billion in part because of an emergency fundraise tied to GameStop trading mania. The stock trading app will likely command a premium valuation on the market while simultaneously playing a broader role in the IPO boom by giving retail investors a way to invest in deals that historically targeted big institutions. Robinhood is reserving up to 35% of its IPO shares for customers. ""I think this is going to be one of the greatest meme stocks of the future"" Thomas Peterffy chairman of Interactive Brokers told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""They have negative equity they have roughly zero earnings and they're growing fast. So it's the kind of thing the market seems to like lately. I'm looking forward to them coming into the community bringing more and more people into the market.""

Goldman Morgan JPM the big winners

In the past week's IPOs underwriting fees ranged from 2% of the total amount raised in the case of ride-hailing company Didi's massive financing to 7% for smaller deals like the offerings from health companies CVRx Aerovate Therapeutics and Acumen Pharmaceuticals. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  as usual reeled in the highest fee revenue by serving as the lead managers for the IPOs of Didi and cybersecurity software vendor SentinelOne  the two biggest offerings of the week. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were the lead underwriters in the IPO for Turkish online shopping company D-Market Electronic Service & Trading legal services site LegalZoom and Krispy Kreme which were the week's third- fourth- and fifth-biggest offerings respectively.

In addition to advisory fees underwriters also make money on IPOs by getting the option to buy stock at the offer price so they can benefit from the pop that typically ensues. Not all of last week's offerings had big initial rallies but they all led to gains for the banks that were in position to receive an allocation. Even with Didi's muted gains in its first three days of trading the stock's 11% rise means that underwriters are up $66 million if they exercise their options. The paper gains on SentinelOne sit at $46 million after that stock jumped 27%. Manufacturing marketplace Xometry climbed 58% in three days producing potential gains thus far of $26 million while airport security company CLEAR has delivered an increase of $34 million after jumping 53%. For Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan the record IPO stretch comes a week after the two banks were the leads on the IPOs for health-tech company Doximity and cloud software vendor Confluent . Those two offerings paid combined underwriter fees of $74.7 million and the Doximity deal included stock allocation that's produced $83 million in gains based on the IPO pop. However Confluent took the unusual step of not issuing underwriters the option to buy at the IPO price. The company highlighted the potential significance of that decision in the risk factors section of its prospectus: ""Without this option the underwriters may choose not to engage in certain transactions that stabilize maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our Class A common stock such as short sales stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales to the extent they would have engaged in any such transactions had we granted the underwriters such an option"" Confluent said. Doximity CEO Jeff Tangney told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that while an IPO was the right choice for his company he's glad to see the rise of direct listings and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) as alternatives because the competition is bringing down the costs. Doximity paid a fee of 5.5% of the offer size which is about inline with this year's average but below the top rate of 7%. ""It improved the economics for us"" he said. ""Banks are charging less and doing more which is good.""

This offer is set to expire at the end of the year.

An office visit is required to get a REAL ID. During the pandemic the DMV temporarily expanded eligibility to renew online or by mail to include Californians age 70 and older and customers who had reached their limit on out- of-office renewals – customers normally required to renew in person. The DMV expects to issue about 5.7 million driver’s licenses and IDs that are not REAL IDs between March 2020 and July 2021 to customers eligible for one. A fee is paid at the time of driver’s license application for a new license or renewal. That fee will be waived for the customers who received a non-REAL ID during that time if they upgrade now at dmv.ca.gov/realidupgrade.

“We don’t want Californians to pay the price for not getting a REAL ID during the pandemic” said DMV Director Steve Gordon. “While the federal government has extended the enforcement date for a REAL ID there is no need to procrastinate. If you act now you can take advantage of this offer and upgrade to a REAL ID for free.”

Beginning May 3 2023 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will require a valid passport or other federally approved document like a REAL ID driver’s license or identification card to board flights within the United States and access secure federal facilities and military bases.

To apply for a REAL ID an applicant must provide a valid Social Security number proof of identity and two proofs of California residency. A list of qualifying documents and other helpful information can be found at REALID.dmv.ca.gov.

The DMV is taking many steps to improve its services and make getting or upgrading to a REAL ID easier. By filling out the REAL ID application at REALID.dmv.ca.gov and uploading their documents Californians can make an appointment bring their confirmation code and documents with them to a DMV office at their convenience even the same day for express service — no appointment necessary. Once at a service window it now takes less than 10 minutes to complete the REAL ID transaction.

The DMV encourages Californians to act now to complete the online application for a REAL ID before they come to the office and to be prepared with the appropriate documents to speed the process for everyone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA3LTA0L2JpZ2dlc3QtZ3VsZi13ZWFsdGgtZnVuZHMtYXJlLWZhdWx0ZWQtZm9yLWxhZ2dpbmctb24tZ292ZXJuYW5jZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biggest Gulf Wealth Funds Are Faulted for Lagging on Governance,"Sign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us @middleeast for news on the region.

Y aunque este factor puede cambiar con otras alternativas de resina en la mayoría de los casos es un beneficio substancial.

Humberto Quiroz director regional de Compras y Sustentabilidad para México Centroamérica y el Caribe de ALPLA señaló que “los números son claros reciclar plásticos para producir empaques plásticos reduce de manera significativa las emisiones contaminantes y no sólo eso sino que además promueve nuevos esquemas de cooperación económica en la sociedad para generar una mayor conciencia ambiental”.

En marco del Foro Nacional IMEF 2021 organizado por el Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas el directivo de la empresa de plásticos abordó la importancia de la economía circular y los modelos sustentables dentro de las industrias y señaló que en ALPLA han emprendido un esfuerzo a nivel global para reducir sus emisiones de carbono y alinearse así con el Compromiso 2025 de la Fundación Ellen MacArthur mediante el cual lograrán que para dicho año el 100% de los envases producidos por la empresa sean reciclables además de utilizar un porcentaje mínimo del 25% de material reciclado en sus empaques.

En ese sentido abundó “la planta de reciclaje IMER ubicada en Toluca Estado de México ha sido punta de lanza en materia de sustentabilidad dentro del país pues desde el 2005 y hasta la fecha se han procesado aproximadamente 240000 mil toneladas de PET además de que trabajamos de la mano de diversos sectores sociales para recolectar transportar y procesar las botellas de plástico antes de que lleguen a nuestras manos”. Próximamente será el arranque de operaciones para la nueva planta de reciclado de HDPE la cual estará ubicada en Toluca y procesará más de 19000 toneladas de botellas HDPE con posibilidades de expansión si así lo requiere el mercado.

Quiroz aseguró que actualmente existe una estigmatización generalizada alrededor de los productos plásticos por lo que es esencial que tanto gobiernos como empresas y ciudadanos revaloricen el material por sus beneficios y tomen en cuenta que existen modelos en los que estos materiales pueden reincorporarse a las líneas de producción pues una vez que son utilizados no tienen por qué convertirse en residuos sino que son materia prima que pueda extender su ciclo de vida y seguir siendo útil para crear distintos productos sin dañar al medio ambiente.

“En ALPLA queremos cambiar la mentalidad de las personas pues sólo reincorporando los plásticos a modelos circulares de producción podremos salvar al planeta. Estamos convencidos de que podemos lograrlo y por eso invitamos a todas las personas a que se sumen para poder juntos vivir una vida circular” finalizó Humberto Quiroz.

Klavan has put pen-to-paper on a deal on a deal with Club Paide Linnameeskond back in his home country of Estonia. The move sees the 35-year-old rack up the 10th club of his career but his new team couldn’t resist the opportunity to poke some fun at Liverpool’s bitter rivals United over their impending signing of Sancho.

Almost immediately after his signing was confirmed Club Paide took to social media to keep the Reds fans entertained.

Klavan was at Anfield for two seasons after being signed from FC Augsburg by Jurgen Klopp in 2016. He eventually left in 2018 after completing a switch to Serie A outfit Caligari.

The centre-back hardly excelled on Merseyside but was a firm favourite with the Anfield faithful. His best moment for the Reds came when he scored a late winner at Burnley as Liverpool pushed for Champions League in 2017.

The closest he came to winning silverware for Klopp’s men was when they lost the 2018 Champions League final.

In all Klavan has made 565 club career appearances scoring 29 goals in that time. He has also won a whopping 127 caps for Estonia.

PSG told to act fast over Mbappe

Meanwhile PSG have been told to take drastic action if Kylian Mbappe continues to hold out over a new deal though it could ultimately pave the way for a move to England if it backfired.

The France sensation is already lauded as one of the world’s most elite footballers. He along with Erling Haaland are widely tipped to become the pre-eminent forwards in European football. That is once Lionel Messi Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski all retire.

Transfer Chatter - Ben White transfer saga update Kane departure up to Nuno and Manchester United and Real Madrid's forward battle Everton are ready to bid for Brighton defender Ben White Tottenham will not sell Harry Kane without Nuno Espirito Santo's confirmation and Manchester Unitedwill battle Real Madrid for Everton forward all in today's transfer chatter.

Mbappe recently suffered heartache when missing the crucial penalty at Euro 2020. That cemented a monumental upset as Switzerland progressed but per a former France international that may not be the only disappointment he experiences this year.

Ex-Marseille stalwart and 23-times capped France star Eric Di Meco has laid out a scenario Mbappe would not wish to hear.

The striker has just a single year remaining on his current deal in Paris. With a seemingly endless list of suitors including the frequently touted Liverpool Mbappe may have his eyes on his next destination.

Indeed a report in June suggested the hitman has already asked to leave PSG this summer.

Drastic action needed

For now though he remains under contract but if he refuses to pen fresh terms Di Meco believes PSG should take drastic action.

“The problem in this story is that by letting him go into the last year of his contract he is the one who holds the cards” Di Meco told RMC Sport (via Caught Offside)

“What you can do when you are PSG and you are powerful is say: ‘You don’t want to continue [with us]? Well you can stay on the bench all year.’

“Paris has the means to do it. And by doing that you show the guys who arrive that they cannot run the show.”

Kevin G. Jackson who has been serving as interim chief commercial officer since January will continue in this role on a permanent basis. Mr. Jackson also will remain president of the company’s snacking and beverages division.

Prior to joining TreeHouse in February 2020 Mr. Jackson was with the J.M. Smucker Co. where he held numerous roles of increasing responsibility across sales and marketing during his 17-year tenure including senior vice president of the US retail sales and North American food-away-from-home division. Earlier he was a senior brand manager at Brach's Confections and at Constellation Brands.

He received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado and a master’s degree in business administration from the New York Institute of Technology.

Meanwhile Sean Lewis has been promoted to senior vice president and chief customer officer reporting to Mr. Jackson. He also will join the executive leadership team.

Mr. Lewis joined TreeHouse in August 2019 as vice president of sales national and regional West. Prior to joining TreeHouse he spent nearly 20 years with Kraft Heinz and Nabisco where he held several regional district category and business lead roles with increasing responsibility including the development pursuit and leadership of customer relationships to achieve revenue share and distribution growth and optimal shelving. Earlier he was customer vice president for the West area at Mizkan America.

He received a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix.

“Over the last few years we purposefully structured our commercial organization to become more customer centric and to make it simpler for customers to do business with us” said Steven T. Oakland president and chief executive officer of TreeHouse Foods. “These appointments represent an important evolution of this commitment and I am confident that Kevin and Sean are well suited to build on our past progress and drive our commercial organization forward as we execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders.

“Kevin has been a valuable asset to TreeHouse and his contributions will be important to further developing our commercial vision aligning the organization and driving our revenue objectives; while Sean will serve as a key voice with our customers solidifying top-to-top relationships and refining and optimizing our sales processes in support of Kevin's efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvcG9saXRpY3MvNi1tb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItY2FwaXRvbC1hc3NhdWx0LWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1wbGVkZ2VzLWZhbGwtZmxhdNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvYW1wL3BvbGl0aWNzLzYtbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLWNhcGl0b2wtYXNzYXVsdC1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtcGxlZGdlcy1mYWxsLWZsYXQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 months after Capitol assault corporate pledges fall flat,"PROVIDENCE R.I. (AP) — As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXNtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9saXN0cy9nbG9iYWwtbWVldHMtbG9jYWwtdG9wLTUwLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtcmVnaW9uYWwtZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1oZWFkaW5nLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Meets Local - Top 50 Regional Executives Heading International Companies,"The world today is becoming ever more globalized thanks to the power of technology improving the scalability of international businesses. Today for the first time in history there are several “non-state mandated” global monopolies controlling key sectors. The market values of the five largest companies in the world are more than the GDP of most countries.

However running a successful global company is far more complex than having the right technology and huge amounts of capital. The success of companies globally generally depends on how well they can understand specific regions. Being the regional leader of a global company is a very complex role. Regional heads need to keep in mind local culture social norms and other factors like demographics and infrastructure all while maintaining and keeping up with the ethos of the brand.

For example Ronaldo Mouchawar VP for Amazon in MENA created the White Friday sale knowing that Amazon’s traditional Black Friday would not sit well within Arab culture. Under the regional head Mwaffak Kanjee McDonald’s in the Middle East serves a McArabia wrap. And Luay Al Shurafa President and Managing Director for General Motors in the Middle East and Africa played a role in developing Middle East versions of the Chevrolet Tahoe GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade.

Global companies play a big role in nation-building in the Middle East. Many regional leaders of multinational companies have partnered with governments to bring cutting edge technologies to the region. Several companies have partnered with government bodies to build innovation centers and incubators to encourage entrepreneurship. Many of the CEOs are advisors to governments or members of industry organizations in their personal capacities. Global multinationals are also among the region’s best corporate citizens and are responsible for driving awareness campaigns whether that’s to save the environment (Schneider) to promote diversity (3M) to enable financial inclusion (Mastercard) or support healthcare (Johnson and Johnson). Often they raise awareness on new issues in the Middle East as part of global campaigns.

This is the eighth consecutive year that we have ranked the regional heads of global companies keeping in mind their achievements the role that they play within our economies and societies and the inspiration they provide to their employees and consumers.

This year there are three women on the list—more than there have ever been in previous lists. In the 2019 Global Meets Local ranking Melda Yasar Cebe Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa at Kraft Heinz made her first appearance and was the only woman on the list. This year she is joined by Reem Asaad Vice President for the Middle East and Africa at Cisco and Marzena Kulis Managing Director for the Middle East at Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices. Hopefully the number of female leaders in these roles will keep rising as more international companies choose women to head their Middle Eastern operations.",,,,,,

As retailers ramp up their supply chain networks they need partners to help them sustain both expansion and innovation. Kroger recently announced its agreement to deploy KNAPP’s software solutions as it seeks to enhance the capabilities and capacity of its existing Great Lakes Distribution Center in Delaware Ohio.

""Kroger's investment in KNAPP's latest technology allows the Great Lakes Distribution Center to improve efficiency in replenishing our stores enabling us to quickly deliver fresh food to our customers” remarked Tony Lucchino Vice President of Supply Chain and Network Strategy Kroger. “The expansion of the facility is part of the ongoing transformation of our supply chain network and this project will more than double our capacity while delivering innovation and scalability that can grow with demand.”

According to a press release the facility is currently being renovated to add modern state-of-the-art technology and is expected to be complete this summer. The distribution center currently services 115 stores in central and northwest Ohio as well as southeast Michigan and the Ohio River Valley region. During the renovation the facility will expand by 130000 square feet.

“This collaborative project will allow us to better serve customers in the region” Lucchino added. “The site uses a unique combination of KNAPP OSR (order storage and retrieval) shuttles that deliver grocery cases in an exact sequence to the RUNPICK robotic palletizers—delivering next-generation efficiency and performance increases for Kroger's supply chain network.""

KNAPP CEO Josef Mentzer also issued a statement regarding the agreement.

""The technology investment in the Great Lakes Distribution Center has been designed to add a new level of flexibility to the Kroger supply chain network and deliver a resilient approach to investments in automation” he explained.

Special to Naples Daily News

Kitson & Partners announced that Babcock Ranch has reached nearly 1400 new homes sold and surpassed 1000 closings with home sales at 1386 and closings at 1027. The fast-paced sales activity has been fueled by 342 home sales year-to-date in America’s first solar-powered town located just northeast of Fort Myers on Babcock Ranch Road/State Road 31.

“Achieving these sales milestones month after month – and sometimes week by week – is an incredible testament to the homes and lifestyle of Babcock Ranch” said Syd Kitson chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners.

Encompassing 18000 acres with 19500 planned residences and 6000000 square feet of commercial space Babcock Ranch ranked 34th on both RCLCO Real Estate Advisors’ and John Burns Real Estate Consulting’s 2020 list of the country’s 50 top-selling master-planned communities.

Construction is nearing completion at Crescent B Commons the 82640-square-foot Publix-anchored shopping center at a new entrance to Babcock Ranch about one mile south of the signature Babcock Ranch bridge.

“With homes that fit every lifestyle along with new neighborhoods and Crescent B Commons opening soon Babcock Ranch continues to fulfill our vision of a vibrant new hometown that’s full of possibilities” Kitson said. “Whether you’re raising a family or enjoying an active retirement you’ll find everything you need to stay healthy active and connected.”

Babcock Ranch began marketing new homes in 2017 with the first residents moving into the town in January 2018. Today Babcock Ranch offers homes from seven homebuilders in seven neighborhoods. Created by Kitson & Partners with respect for the natural environment and the philosophy that smart growth and sustainability work hand in hand half of the town’s footprint is set aside as greenways parks and expansive lakes providing recreation and scenic backdrops for Babcock Ranch’s homes and the Founder’s Square downtown district. Babcock National brings golf to Babcock Ranch with an 18-hole Gordon Lewis-designed course as the centerpiece of Lennar’s new lifestyle community.

Babcock Ranch homebuilders offer more than 50 home designs ranging from 1120 to more than 4000 square feet. Homes appeal to young millennials families empty nesters and retirees alike with prices ranging from the $200s to over $1.5 million.

Riverfront Park Amphitheater ushers in new era,"Crowds numbering several thousand people turned out July 4 for the grand opening of Wilmington's Riverfront Park Amphitheater in downtown Wilmington ushering in what felt like a new era for Wilmington's Northside -- if not for the Port City in general.

The concert venue and public park which officially opened on Friday during a ribbon-cutting in a rainstorm welcomed a steady stream of visitors throughout the day Sunday. People let their kids splash in a water feature stood in line for grub at one of several food trucks or crowded in front of the covered stage for entertainment from a number of Wilmington bands and comedians.

Bringing the energy the moment demanded was The Coastal Collective a longtime jazz/hip-hop/R&B combo led by the irrepressible vocalist Jared Sales. Not content to hog the spotlight for himself Sales brought up a string of guest artists including soul singer Rebekah Todd and the artist known as Louis. the rapper who dropped rhymes about ""reinvent(ing)"" Wilmington ""so we can buy this space up.""

It felt like 10-piece Coastal Collective finally got to perform on the sprawling amphitheater stage its outsize sound and ambition have always demanded.

Even as the opening felt like a glimpse into Wilmington's future however Sales made sure the past wasn't forgotten inviting up legendary Wilmington saxophone player Benny Hill for a solo or two. Previously Hill's trio had treated the crowd to a jazzy fusion of pop and rock tunes from Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature"" to Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""

""This is about staying in Wilmington"" Sales exhorted. ""Investing in Wilmington. This park is the start of that.""

Certainly the crowd sometimes felt like a who's who of Wilmington. Even Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo showed up rocking shorts from the wings of the stage.

Previously Brandon ""Bigg B"" Hickman of Coast 97.3 FM who emceed the event asked the crowd ""Isn't this park beautiful? If you're glad to be from Wilmington make some noise!""

He then introduced Wilmington City Councilman Kevin Spears who himself introduced the first band to perform on the amphitheater stage Wilmington's Omni Percussion Ensemble who delivered a pounding drum-circle-like set complete with belly dancers.

Michael Shaheen and his wife Kristen showed up because they ""wanted to see where our tax dollars are going"" he said.

The park was built with a $31 million investment from the city of Wilmington along with $4 million from the Live Nation entertainment company which will manage the amphitheater portion of the park.

Shaheen said he's ""delighted to see the growth"" in Wilmington which has been considerable since he moved here 12 years ago.

Weaver and Ashely Johnson walked to the venue from their home some five blocks away.

""We're pretty excited"" Weaver Johnson said adding that they've already got tickets to amphitheater shows featuring the Avett Brothers in August and Widespread Panic in July but ""just one"" for the sold-out Widespread show. ""Let me know if you know where to get another one.""

Rob McCord also walked from his home on North Fifth Avenue and deemed the amphitheater ""a wonderful amenity. The design is thoughtful. It has the feel of a public park.""

He added that ""it's going to be great for the neighborhood and great for property values.""

The park and venue felt more finished than it did even on Friday when groundskeeping and construction crews were completing work around the park's perimeter. The park and gardens won't be fully complete for some weeks yet.

Despite not having a dedicated parking area thousands of people clearly found their ways there.

Live music -- including by reggae band Signal Fire and country act L Shape Lot who performed after the deadline for this story -- held sway but Wilmington comedians ago got a chance to perform in front of the big crowd.

Comic Matt White who is Black said he enjoys people-watching ""Especially white people"" he said. ""And this is the best I've ever had"" drawing laughs from a crowd that was certainly mostly white but also diverse in terms of age and even race.

Timmy Sherrill co-owner of Wilmington's soon-to-reopen Dead Crow Comedy Room observed that ""this is a really nice baseball park"" a dig at the site's (unsuccessful) past life as the potential home of a Wilmington minor league team.

As the July 4 event made clear however the idea of baseball in downtown Wilmington is clearly in the past. The future of the Northside will now be defined by concerts and other large-scale events at the amphitheater events which as of Sunday are no longer on the horizon.

He was leading a nighttime formation of three Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors when he lost most of his electrical power and had to fly for two minutes with no navigation or radio not knowing where the other planes were.

“You have a detailed checklist and you rely on your training skills and years of practice the pre-flight briefing and hours and hours of reading manuals and training on simulators” Pfluger said explaining that they had their exterior lights off in their approach of an ISIS target in northern Iraq. “There were 20-30 aircraft in the same piece of sky within 100 miles.

“I turned off the different power sources and reduced the electrical load to bring the system back on. It was a hairy situation but I was able to maintain control of the aircraft and complete the mission. Those couple of minutes seemed like an eternity.”

Then commanding the 380th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates Pfluger said all the pilots were mindful that a downed Jordanian pilot had recently been burned alive in a cage.

“There was a guy with a British accent called Jihadi John who’d been beheading people and putting videos out so we had a plan to do everything we possibly could to get the aircrafts safely home” he said in a phone interview from Washington.

An F-22 can reach 1500 mph but Pfluger and his wingmen were approaching the target at 400 mph at an elevation of 25000 feet. The $140-million plane carries a 20-millimeter machine gun eight missiles and two 1000-pound bombs.

Pfluger said an analysis was done of what went wrong but he couldn’t disclose that information.

He said that in addition to deliberate strikes of ISIS targets the F-22s sometimes supported infantry with attacks of enemy troops.

“From time to time the Russians would fly through northern Iraq and get in the way of things so we had to be very cognizant of our environment and who was out there” he said.

Now a colonel in the Air Force Reserve the Republican congressman credited “the huge team around me” of aircraft maintenance men and the soldiers sailors and Marines who also fought in Iraq.

Asked how he has adapted to political life after 20 years’ active duty Pfluger said his military career has been applicable to his duties as representative of the 11th Congressional District. “I got lots of leadership experience analyzing the environment and studying what courses of action to take” he said June 25.

“I just came off the House floor opposing a Democrat bill to overregulate the energy industry. My team and I are looking at ways we can counter these threats to oil and gas and agriculture and stop attempts to defund police and deny the Border Patrol the resources it needs.

“I have a mission to do everything I can.”

Pfluger said the Biden administration’s emphasis on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power could lead to national “rolling blackouts like California has every single summer.

“I regularly meet with oil and gas and service company representatives because we have to team up to get the truth out” he said. “The energy industry has brought a billion people out of poverty who now have access to energy and clean water.”

July 4 (UPI) -- A Philippine Air Force plane pushed from the U.S. government earlier this year crashed on the southern island of Jolo on Sunday morning killing 42 people aboard and three civilians on the ground. The Lockheed Martin C-130 military plane which was carrying 96 personnel including three pilots and five crew members was going from Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao to Sulu province when it missed the runway on the island of Jolo into nearby Patikul village the head of the Philippine armed forces Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said in a report by The New York Times. Advertisement

Patikul is a stronghold of the militant group known as Abu Sayyaf.

The crash occurred at 11:30 a.m. local time CNN reported.

""Minutes after the crash troops and civilian volunteers rushed to the site for search and rescue"" according to a press release by Joint Task Force Sulu. ""Per eyewitnesses a number of soldiers were seen jumping out of the aircraft before it hit the ground sparing them from from the explosion caused by the crash.""

Forty-nine were injured and five personnel are still unaccounted for. Also four others on the ground were hurt.

The troops ""were supposed to report to their battalions today. They were supposed to join us in our fight against terrorism"" Joint Task Force Sulu Commander William N. Gonzales said.

Five military vehicles were also aboard the plane officials said.

The four-engine turbo-prop plane first flew in 1988 and it was used by the United States Air Force.

It was one two C-130H Hercules granted by the U.S. government's military financing program and valued at $32.2 million according to the U.S. Embassy in February.

""The C-130 is a proven aircraft and demonstrated its reach and capability to deliver COVID-19 supplies across the country over the past year"" Charge d'Affaires John Law said in the news release. ""We hope this additional aircraft will continue to be a steady workhorse for the Philippine Air Force for years to come.""

In 2008 nine crew members and two passengers aboard Philippine Air Force C-130 died when it crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Davao City on the southern island of Mindanao.

In 1993 a Philippines Air Force C-130 crashed killing 30 people.

Last month a newly acquired S-70i Black Hawk utility helicopter crashed during a night flight about 60 miles north of the capital Manila killing all six people on board.

In the 1950s and ‘60s American plane-makers went crazy developing new fighters bombers and reconnaissance aircraft for the U.S. armed services. Some of the most successful designs -- the F-4 the F-15 and B-52 -- remain in service today.

Other concepts failed. Some of them spectacularly. Here are a few.

Convair YB-60

In the early 1950s the U.S. Air Force wanted a turbojet-powered heavy strategic bomber to lug atomic bombs across oceans. Convair had built the piston-engine B-36 for the Air Force and decided that simply swapping out the B-36’s prop motors for jets — among other modest changes — would suffice to produce a winning new bomber.

The result was the YB-60 a 171-foot-long monster of a warplane sporting eight J57 turbojets. The first of two prototypes took off on its inaugural flight in April 1952. The YB-60 could fly 2900 miles at a cruising speed of 467 miles per hour while lugging a 36 tons of bombs.

Impressive sure — but not as impressive as the performance of the YB-60’s most direct competitor Boeing’s B-52. The eight-engine B-52 cruises at 525 miles per hour over a distance of 4500 miles while carrying 35 tons of bombs.

The Air Force cancelled the YB-60’s test program in January 1953. B-52s remain in the U.S. inventory.

Bell XF-109

In 1955 the U.S. Navy and Air Force approached Bell Aircraft Corporation with a far-out idea — design a Mach-two fighter capable of launching and landing vertically. Bell dutifully drew up a design for what it unofficially called the XF-109.

Fifty-nine feet long the XF-109 featured a startling eight J85 jet engines — four afterburning motors arranged two apiece in rotating wingtip nacelles plus another two afterburners in the rear fuselage and a pair of non-afterburning J85s pointing downward behind the cockpit.

With distinct rearward- and downward-blasting powerplants the XF-109’s basic form is not dissimilar to that of the F-35B supersonic jump jet that Lockheed Martin designed for the U.S. Marine Corps 40 years later.

But the XF-109 was clearly ahead of its time. The Navy and Air Force both lost interest and the military cancelled the Bell jump jet in 1961 before the company could build any actual prototypes. The Harrier the world’s first operational vertical-takeoff-and-landing fighter flew for the first time in 1967. The Harrier is subsonic.

Lockheed RB-12

In January 1961 Lockheed’s legendary airplane-designer Kelly Johnson delivered an unsolicited proposal to the U.S. Air Force. His idea was to take the Mach-3 A-12 spy plane — the predecessor of the iconic SR-71 Blackbird — that Kelly had designed for the CIA and modify it into a very fast strategic bomber. More or less in parallel Johnson was working on a missile-armed F-12 fighter version of the A-12.

The Air Force liked the RB-12 Mach-3 bomber idea but counter-proposed with a slightly altered design it called the RS-12. Take the A-12’s sled-like titanium airframe with its powerful J58 turbojets. Add a sophisticated long-range radar and a nuclear-tipped air-to-ground missile based on the AIM-47 air-to-air missile that also armed the F-12.

The plan was for the RS-12 to penetrate Soviet air space at Mach 3.2 and 80000 feet and fire a single missile from 50 miles away striking within 50 feet of its aimpoint within a Soviet city.

The Defense Department ultimately canceled the F-12 on cost grounds and opted not to proceed with the RS-12 as ballistic missiles were beginning to supplant manned bombers. The Air Force did ultimately acquire the SR-71 reconnaissance version of the A-12 and operated it into the 1990s.

Convair Model 49

In the 1960s the U.S. Army was growing sick of its long dependence on inappropriate U.S. Air Force planes for close-support missions. Aircraft such as the Republic F-105 were simply too fast and too vulnerable to support troops on the ground effectively.

Instead the Army wanted the versatility and forward-basing possibilities of a vertical-takeoff platform that could also hover. To excel in the tough close-support role the type would need to be heavily armed and armored. This need led to the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System program.

Convair a company famed for its adventurous designs responded to the Army’s AAFSS requirement with typical ambition. Drawing on its experience with the tail-sitting XFY-1 the company proposed a two-man ring- or annular-wing ducted-fan design quite unlike anything else in service though somewhat similar to French firm SNECMA’s experimental C.540.

The concept was bizarre in appearance but Convair believed it was the perfect configuration for an aircraft combining a helicopter’s unusual abilities with some of the offensive features of a military ground vehicle.

One of the greatest challenges was creating a cockpit that tilted so the pilot was not facing the sky in the take-off and landing and ground-based modes. This necessitated a complex hinged forward fuselage giving the type its distinctly Transformer-like looks.

Lockheed CL-1200

In the late 1960s Lockheed saw an opportunity. Anticipating worldwide demand for 7500 advanced but — in the company’s own words — “reasonably-priced” jet fighters over the next decade in 1971 it began circulating a proposal for an improved safer CL-1200 Lancer version of the speedy but notoriously hard-to-fly F-104.

Lockheed’s Skunk Works division with famed designer Kelly Johnson still in charge enlarged the F-104’s wing and fin shifted the tailplane lower on the fuselage tweaked the engine inlet added internal fuel capacity and replaced the F-104’s J79 engine with a TF33. The resulting CL-1200 was in theory more maneuverable and controllable than the F-104 and cost around $2 million per copy assuming a large production run. At the time a new F-4E cost at least $2.4 million.

Lockheed entered the CL-1200 into the U.S. military’s International Fighter Aircraft competition which aimed to select an export warplane for America’s allies. But Northrop’s F-5E won the contest and Lockheed scrapped the CL-1200 concept having only ever produced a mock-up of the plane.

The Swiss Air Force will receive F-35A aircraft a sustainment solution tailored to Swiss autonomy requirements and a comprehensive training program. The F-35 selection will deliver economic and technical advantages to the nation for decades to come. Swiss industry will have the opportunity to participate in research and development production and sustainment opportunities that will extend their capabilities into the future. As a new participant in the F-35 program Switzerland will benefit from Lockheed Martin’s dedication to autonomy and sovereignty in integrating indigenous solutions.

To date the F-35 operates from 21 bases worldwide with nine nations operating F-35s on their home soil.

The Lockheed C-130 aircraft of registration 5125 had only arrived in the Philippines recently. The website even quoted an air force spokesperson as saying the aircraft would provide enhanced capability for heavy airlift missions.

This is not the first time that the Philippines armed forces have come under scrutiny for having a patchy record on air safety. A Black Hawk helicopter crashed only last month during a training mission killing six people.

Another C-130 aircraft of the Philippines Air Force had crashed back in 1993 killing 30 people. A 2008 crash by the civilian variant of the Lockheed plane flown by the Philippines Air Force killed 11 people according to the Aviation Safety Network.

However the worst plane crash in the country's records took place in 2000 when the infamous Boeing 737 -- an aircraft that has come to the news recently for being part of several recent air disasters -- crashed killing 131 people.

The Sunday incident took place shortly before noon at the Bangkal village in the mountainous town of Patikul in the country's Sulu province military officials said. As many as 40 people have been pulled out from underneath the burning wreckage the government has said confirming that the rescue operation is currently ongoing."

In honor of the anniversary of St. Elmo's Fire which came out on June 28 1985 Lowe shared a flashback photo showing him with costars including Demi Moore and Emilio Estevez.

""36 years ago this week the world met the Brat Pack! I'm sorry (jk)"" Lowe captioned the photo. ""I love that this movie still holds a special place in so many peoples hearts.""

""Although it was a long time ago the movie was made in color. #stelmosfire #bratpack"" he added to clarify why he didn't share a color snap.

Celebrities including Jennifer Aniston and CNN's Don Lemon liked the post and a few more commented on the flashback shot.

""Best movie ever"" Gwyneth Paltrow commented.

""Uhm.... Where is your left hand?"" Rob's brother Chad Lowe posted adding a shocked emoji.

St. Elmo's Fire centered on a group of college pals who had graduated Georgetown (though Rob Lowe previously told EW the film was actually shot at the University of Maryland).

Lowe discussed how he's still recognized for playing Billy and about Paltrow's obsession with the film in an EW St. Elmo's Fire oral history in 2017.

""At least in my career Billy was the most succinct version of bad boy-man child that I've ever played. It's the most long-lasting. Not a day goes by that someone who should know better tells me they love that movie and Billy — like Gwyneth Paltrow who can legitimately recite every line in the movie"" he said at the time. ""It never ceases to amaze me the level of person who is obsessed. I think it was probably a lot of people's first guilty pleasure.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay91cy9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvZm91ci1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy1zbXVnZ2xpbmctZHJ1Zy1tb25leS1uZXcteW9yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four flight attendants charged with smuggling £6.4m in drug money,"Four flight attendants have been charged with smuggling around $8 million (£6.4m) in “drug money” between New York’s JFK airport and the Dominican Republic.

The international money laundering ring operated by exploiting the flight crew’s “trusted positions” and airport security privileges according to a complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

US officials said the investigation had “exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry” and shone a light on the methods employed by drug traffickers.

Charlie Hernandez 42 Sarah Valerio Pujols 42 Emmanuel Torres 34 and Jarol Fabio 35 were arrested by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York on Tuesday.

They are accused of taking a cut of each shipment they smuggled through airport security checkpoints and onto flights bound for the Dominican Republic.

Prosecutors said the flight attendants who worked on different international airlines that flew between the two destinations smuggled approximately $8m in cash from the sale of drugs such as fentanyl over several years.

Code word ‘lotions’

They allegedly used the code word “lotions” to mean drug proceeds and referred to the smuggling ring’s drug-dealing clients as “los tigres”.

The flight crew all had a special clearance with the US Transport Security Administration which permitted them to go through a designated security lane at John F Kennedy International Airport with less scrutiny than normal passengers.

All four flight attendants have been charged with one count each relating to unlicensed money transmission which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

They have also been charged with one count each of violating airport security requirements which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Mr Hernandez of West New York in New Jersey and Ms Pujols from the Bronx in New York were additionally charged with a conspiracy count which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ms Pujols faces a further charge relating to bulk cash smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

These days everything seems like a competition. Americans are obsessed with competition—keeping up with Joneses school rivalries—heck you could stream five hours every night for years watching nothing but competition shows about dancing singing cooking baking dating surviving restoring homes and cars or even battling robots. Perhaps in response to this Yankee fascination you can now only buy the BMW X5 M or X6 M SUVs in their most extreme Competition trims.

OK the real reason for this change is because prime competitor Mercedes-AMG only offers its GLE63 SUV and Coupe in their most extreme S trims. Buyers in other markets can still get these vehicles with less extreme powertrain and suspension setups. But let’s say you don’t yet have a gut that jiggles on bumps your threshold for kidney trauma is high and/or your local weather conditions or tax base mean you only ever drive on mirror-smooth roads. How would a BMW X5 M Competition fare in you know a performance and handling competition?

Drag Race Competition

First a quick recap of the hardware basics shared in our First Look: The M’s 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 gets help from a small electric motor mounted in the transmission kicking out a combined 617 hp and 553 lb-ft. Mercedes-AMG’s smaller 4.0-liter bi-turbo V-8 is 13 percent torquier producing 603 hp and 627 lb-ft. AMG employs an extra gearbox cog too with nine versus eight. Our test cars weighed in within a single pound on our scales and their straight-line performance was equally close. Each hit 60 mph in 3.4 seconds with the deeper-lunged BMW crossing the quarter-mile mark ahead by 0.1 second and 1.4 mph in 11.8 seconds at 116.6 mph. An Audi RS Q8 and an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Q4 Quadrifoglio would be photo-finishing with these two. That performance would put both this BMW and the Benz even with or ahead of any similarly priced Porsche Cayenne we’ve tested but well behind the way spendier trims with “Turbo” in the name.

Road-Course Competition

Braking performance is similarly spot-on with each stopping from 60 mph in exactly 104 feet. But BMW opens some daylight relative to its GLE63 rival by circulating our figure-eight test course nearly a second ahead in 24.1 seconds at 0.86 g average versus 25.0 seconds at 0.78 g. The max 0.99 g force our X5 generates in the corners is also well ahead of the AMG’s 0.93 g. Usually tires explain the difference in cases like this but here both vehicles were shod in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber (although it’s possible their individual fitment specs could vary). Staggered tire and wheel sizes vary with the BMW on 21s and the AMG on 22s so we wondered if contact-patch sizes accounted for the difference. Nope. Total static contact patch area measures within 3 square inches with the Mercedes leading at 278.

So we can probably credit the BMW’s more even weight distribution superior suspension kinematics the consistency with which the brakes tolerated hard application and smooth trailing into the turns for lap after lap and/or a higher degree of stability control system tolerance for permitting limit-handling shenanigans without intervention. As for those other leading contenders? The Audi RS Q8 runs with the BMW the Alfa Stelvio Quad with the Mercedes. Our test of a base 2024 Porsche Cayenne weighing 580 pounds less than this X5 M matched its figure-eight time and hung on with 1.02 g of max cornering grip.

How Does It Work as Transportation?

As ridiculous as a 2.7-ton track car sounds that is the only use case that makes sense for SUVs as musclebound as the X5 M or GLE63. Toward that end our test unit featured the M Driver's package (S07ME) elevating top speed from 155 to 177 mph and entitling the owner to take a BMW high-performance driving course. But a savvy track-day buyer would preserve some tire and brake replacement capital by skipping both the $3100 Executive package and the $3400 Bowers & Wilkins sound upgrade. Soft-close doors a high-mounted and heavy panoramic roof and ventilated massaging seats are utterly anathema to a track car the massaging is nowhere near as effective as the best Mercedes or Lucid systems and the stereo struggles to shout down the glorious engine noises and the tiresome tire racket.

Considering this as a dedicated track rat also helps us forgive the X5 M Competition its horrendous ride and shortcomings including an automatic climate control that isn’t (fan speed remains adjustable) and its lack of basic amenities such as adaptive cruise control and lane centering (the button to select them is there but the features cost $1700 extra).

Is the X5 M Competition Competitive?

We’re still mystified by this vehicle’s purpose in life given that nobody is likely to track it. Why would they when an M2 costs half as much and is four times more fun everywhere? Frankly a more supple-riding X5 M60i producing the same torque and just 15 percent less power equipped with all the expected luxuries at $96245 makes ever so much more sense. And for anyone hellbent on spending 50 grand more the Audi RS Q8’s balance of luxury comfort and sportiness better suits the way these trucks will actually be driven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jam1rZ253ZW0xcm_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2pta2dud2VtMXJvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish police make €3.6m drugs seizure in two operations,

View the current offers here.

It's no secret that travel is both a privilege and an expense — and with the increase in demand the cost of travel will continue to increase as more and more people begin to travel again. For a family of any size travel expenses can quickly add up and even the cost needed to redeem points and miles can be steep.

That's why my family of four uses a mix of points miles and cash to maximize our travel spending in the way that works best for us. We prioritize what's most important to us on a particular vacation and our points and miles goals vary from one trip to another. In this article I'm sharing exactly how my family does this and my one piece of advice to every family — any traveler really — that wants to use points and miles to travel more.

Redeeming points for hotel nights

Often times we choose to redeem miles for airfare or points for hotel rooms. Because there are four of us we sometimes just elect to pay cash for flights instead of redeeming airline miles for all four of us — plus I think those miles can be better spent in business and first-class which my husband and I don't fly when we're with our kids at this age (currently 1 and 3 years old). For the most part we prioritize a nice hotel over flying in the front of the plane — at least when we travel with our kids.

I stay mostly at Marriott hotels unless I'm saving my Bonvoy points for something extra special. I enjoy World of Hyatt on occasion as well because of their low points redemption rates depending on the hotel.

The reason why I love Marriott hotels is that — whether or not I'm staying at one of their luxury brand hotels like a St. Regis or a budget option like Springhill Suites — I trust that my experience will be positive and I will get what I need out of my stay. For example I know that at a Fairfield Inn and Suites I can expect a larger no-frills room and breakfast included in my stay — a clean and comfortable room that I probably won't spend much time in. And when I stay at a Ritz-Carlton I trust that I'm getting more amenities a restaurant room service probably a spa etc. No matter what type of hotel stay I need I can redeem Bonvoy points for the room and the fifth night is always free.

Some of my favorite hotel redemptions include the JW Marriott Venice Resort and Spa during our first trip to Italy and the Hyatt Regency Phuket over New Year's Eve. Next month we will spend a week at the JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort and Spa.

One reason why I prefer to focus my travel rewards accumulation on luxury hotel redemptions is because of the amenities and services available that make traveling with kids so much easier. After our stay at the Four Seasons Punta Mita when my son was 6 months old I knew that was the only way I wanted to travel from then on. Amenities like a baby welcome basket with sunscreen and face wipes a diaper genie in our room and even a Pack 'n Play for use at the pool made our first family vacation so much easier and enjoyable — they even had extra bibs and baby utensils for him to use at the restaurant.

Redeeming miles for flights

I've traveled with my children as lap infants for as long as I could and was lucky enough to travel to six countries and Puerto Rico with either one or both of my kids before the pandemic began. Traveling with a lap infant is a great benefit to take advantage of when your children are younger than 2 years old — and I will miss the savings greatly when my daughter turns 2 in September.

So now that we will soon need to purchase airfare for all four of my family members we will be redeeming our miles more often than we have in the past. Before now we stacked miles for dream trips in business and first-class that my husband and I planned to take sans kids. However after last year's dream trip to the Tokyo Olympics was canceled we've decided to make better use of them.

When traveling domestically we almost always pay cash for our flights unless we are traveling Southwest. Southwest has great redemption rates and I can transfer Ultimate Rewards instantly whenever I need to. When we travel internationally we redeem miles for at least two of us to reduce the cost of our cash out of pocket while not emptying our miles' banks.

Despite my infrequent travel on Southwest I have been loyal to American Airlines and Oneworld for as long as I can remember. Though not the largest airline alliance Oneworld member airlines include British Airways Cathay Pacific Qatar Airways Japan Airlines and more — all airlines that I have flown or plan to fly in the future.

Another caveat to whether or not my family uses miles or cash for flights also has to do with the airline we want to fly. Two summers ago when we traveled to France and Switzerland by way of London we flew Premium Economy on Virgin Atlantic and paid cash. We simply didn't have enough points or miles to redeem for the seats we wanted and decided that the cash rate was worth the comfort we'd have traveling with a then 18-month-old — not to mention I was very pregnant at the time.

Staying at home rentals

Home rentals from Airbnb VRBO and Marriott Homes and Villas are the most comfortable way to travel with a family in my opinion — and often the most cost-effective as well. You can elect to have more than one bedroom multiple bathrooms and even a yard or a pool for your kids to enjoy some outside space. I like that I can choose to rent an apartment in the center of a city or a larger space a little farther out — and is usually cheaper than renting a hotel room especially for the return on investment. We've been renting homes on Airbnb since 2015 our most recent being a home right outside of the French Quarter in New Orleans.

This year I opened the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card for the 75000 Venture miles sign-up bonus after $4000 spend in the first three months of card membership. And while I'm excited about new transfer partners and airport lounges being added this year I'm most excited about being able to use these miles to virtually cover the cost of my Airbnb stays by redeeming them for statement credits. The card also lets you use miles for statement credits on other travel expenses as well including train tickets and rental car purchases.

Utilizing perks from credit cards

I take advantage of a lot of perks that come with my cards. Even though The Platinum Card® from American Express has increased its annual fee to $695 (see rates and fees) Amex offers travel credits and Centurion Lounge access have more than made up for the annual fee for me and my family the last couple of years. I also get elite status at select rental car companies monthly Uber credits that we use for Uber Eats and I can book through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts through Amex travel for added benefits like late check-out resort credits and room upgrades at select properties.

I get Priority Pass with a few different credit cards so even if there isn't a Centurion Lounge at the airport I'm at my family and I can almost always relax and regroup in a lounge on travel days.

I exclusively use my Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant™ American Express® Card for 3x points for dining at U.S. restaurants and my Chase Freedom Flex for its rotating bonus categories. Almost all of my everyday spend currently goes on my Capital One Venture Credit Card for 2x miles.

My best advice for families traveling on points

I really only have one piece of advice that I would tell any family hoping to make the most of their vacations with points and miles: decide on the vacation you want and then earn the rewards you need to get there.

When you have a redemption in mind — whether it's flying 33 family members to Hawaii or flying one of the best luxury suites in the sky — find out what it takes to make that dream a reality and then start to accrue points and miles accordingly. By doing it this way you avoid what some call ""shiny sign-up bonus syndrome"" (I just made that up) where you sign-up for every credit card with a new big bonus and end up with points and miles in a bunch of different places but never enough in one place to actually be useful.

Bottom Line

Traveling with a family on points and miles isn't impossible — it just requires a little more planning and strategy than if you only traveled solo or with a partner. I like to stick to one hotel brand and one airline alliance — for the most part — so that I can earn as many points and miles as I can to redeem for free travel. I also don't exclusively travel on points and miles and sometimes use cash to pay for one or the other. I prefer using my travel rewards for nice hotel stays to flying premium airline cabins for the amenities and service I get at luxury resorts.

I also really enjoy home rentals and think that they are a great option for families that enjoy having more space. While home rental companies such as Airbnb and VRBO do not currently have loyalty programs you can redeem statement credits for travel expenses with credit cards like the Capital One Venture credit card.

And lastly my one piece of advice for families to best maximize their points and miles is to decide on the trip they want to take before starting to collect travel rewards. It's better to collect the right points and miles rather than having points and miles in too many places and not enough to use any of them for your family trips.

D.C. boasts rich cultural and historical sites a booming restaurant scene and a diverse selection of activities. So it makes sense that millions of travelers flock there each year.

Among the most popular places to visit in Washington D.C. are the Smithsonian Institution the White House the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall to name a few. If you’re thinking about planning a budget trip here's how to get to Washington D.C. with points and miles.

Getting to Washington D.C.

Nearest airports

The District of Columbia has three centrally located airports offering a large variety of flight and airline options. Oddly enough none of these airports are actually located in the district.

The airports serving the D.C. area include:

Washington-Dulles (IAD).

Washington-National (DCA).

Baltimore-Washington (BWI).

Of the three airports IAD is the largest international airport and offers by far the most airline options flights and lounges. But there are two big drawbacks to flying into or out of IAD: It’s the farthest from the city (at over 25 miles) and there’s no public transportation option aside from car services and private airport shuttles. The lack of metro service to IAD is a bummer since Washington D.C. generally has an extensive metro system.

DCA is a convenient airport since it’s only 5 miles from the city center and easily accessible via the metro and bus lines. The major downside is that it services mostly shorter domestic flights. It doesn't often offer longer direct flights within the U.S.

BWI is a bit farther than DCA from D.C. and services many airlines and international routes. It is accessible on the city metro via a short bus ride.

Major airlines flying to Washington D.C.

BWI serves as an operating base for Southwest which offers nonstops to nearly 70 cities. IAD is a United Airlines hub but is also served by over 30 airlines (including all of the major carriers).

Flying to Washington D.C. with points and miles

Because there are three airport options and service from almost every airline with a rewards program the opportunities to get to Washington D.C. with points and miles are seemingly endless. Even so a few programs stand out for those looking to get maximum value from their miles.

American Airlines AAdvantage Web Special awards

AAdvantage miles are among the best points and miles for cheap flights to Washington D.C. For example the Web Special awards start at only 6000 miles for transcontinental flights from Baltimore-Washington to Los Angeles.

In the spring of 2021 we found Web Special awards available on several routes from Washington D.C. for 7000 miles in economy and 10000 in business.

Southwest JetBlue and Delta

Southwest JetBlue and Delta offer multiple flight options with award ticket prices roughly mirroring the cash price of the ticket. We found economy flights on all three of these airlines from Washington D.C. to airports all over the country in August for less than $100.

Here are a few examples:

Baltimore-Washington to Charleston South Carolina on Delta: The cash price is $80 and the award ticket price is 4500 miles plus $6 in taxes.

Washington-National to Orlando Florida on JetBlue: The cash price is $99 and the price in TrueBlue points is 8400 points plus $5.60 in taxes.

Meet Tahany Taher Co-founder HAYAWIIA.

Why have you chosen to launch this platform in the UAE?

It was an obvious choice for a number of reasons both personal and professional level.

On a personal note the United Arab Emirates is my home; it is the place that has given me my greatest joys and made me the person that I am today. The country is one of the few places in the world that follows the principle that acceptance of all is a virtue. The number of different nationalities present in the UAE is a testament to that belief.

On a professional note UAE is one of the most progressive countries in the world especially on the digital front. It is a place that prides itself on being in the forefront of digital growth in this region. Innovation and perseverance are the bywords that have infused each and every aspect of life in the UAE.

That also leads to a uniqueness in the cuisines available across the country. There are numerous places catering to the entire diaspora of the UAE from American fast food to fine dining Mongolian cuisine. These are just two of the many reasons behind the birth of HAYAWIIA.

The brand espouses the same ethos. For us it is about inclusion and the uniqueness of product. Our philosophy will always be to provide as many options and cater to everyone’s needs.

Tahany Taher and Co-Founder Akram Oomer

How do you see increasing demand for healthy and organic in the region?

I think growth in terms of organic and healthy foods and lifestyle has always existed and with the advent of COVID-19 it has just urged people to move towards leading a more fitter and healthier lifestyle. This is definitely not a fad diet this is a way of living. Understanding the importance of our own health coupled with the health of the world around us is a philosophy that is espoused by a wider audience than ever before.

The surprising and ironic aspect is the fact that technology is helping that shift to take place from better farming techniques to a better understanding of how food interacts with our bodies. That is the environment that has allowed HAYAWIIA to be accepted by the general public. In the past HAYAWIIA would have been viewed as more of a niche market rather than the norm but today people have adopted such lifestyles and healthier eating habits. Our team is constantly finding new brands and vendors that will continue satisfying the needs of our fellow HAYAWIIANS aka our customers (as we’d like to call them!).

Do you think hotels and restaurants will cater to this by purchasing more of said products?

Most businesses in the past have generally been less inclined to pivot and change due to a number of constraints and biases. Consumer and brand interaction was less and there wasn’t an understanding of their needs. In today’s world that doesn’t stand true now consumers have a voice. The advent of the internet age has created an environment where businesses are given a feedback on a regular basis – with the help of digitization. A lot of that feedback is now focused on the importance of healthy and organic food. That is the catalyst that has created a shift by this business segment and others to move towards a more sustainable and healthier option profile.

Before you would have been hard pressed to find an organic vegan restaurant but now nearly every upscale restaurant will have quite a few meal options catering towards those who want to lead a healthy lifestyle. Beyond that the shift has also allowed for creation of several business models that focus on those types of eating requirements – keto gluten free vegan etc. I do see a future where healthier options would compete on a regular basis with non-healthy options. We live in times where even the largest fast food chain in the world is now moving towards offering healthier alternatives. I believe that HAYAWIIA will also help with this transition and be part of this movement.

Every step that we take to make ourselves and the world around us a happier and healthier place are steps that we are taking to safeguard our future. We hope that through HAYAWIIA we are able to contribute in our own small little way to the people and us taking those steps together. We want to bring about transformation in the way people lead their lives – give more importance to their health and eating habits."

Today for the first time in history there are several “non-state mandated” global monopolies controlling key sectors. The market values of the five largest companies in the world are more than the GDP of most countries.

However running a successful global company is far more complex than having the right technology and huge amounts of capital. The success of companies globally generally depends on how well they can understand specific regions. Being the regional leader of a global company is a very complex role. Regional heads need to keep in mind local culture social norms and other factors like demographics and infrastructure all while maintaining and keeping up with the ethos of the brand.

For example Ronaldo Mouchawar VP for Amazon in MENA created the White Friday sale knowing that Amazon’s traditional Black Friday would not sit well within Arab culture. Under the regional head Mwaffak Kanjee McDonald’s in the Middle East serves a McArabia wrap. And Luay Al Shurafa President and Managing Director for General Motors in the Middle East and Africa played a role in developing Middle East versions of the Chevrolet Tahoe GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade.

Global companies play a big role in nation-building in the Middle East. Many regional leaders of multinational companies have partnered with governments to bring cutting edge technologies to the region. Several companies have partnered with government bodies to build innovation centers and incubators to encourage entrepreneurship. Many of the CEOs are advisors to governments or members of industry organizations in their personal capacities. Global multinationals are also among the region’s best corporate citizens and are responsible for driving awareness campaigns whether that’s to save the environment (Schneider) to promote diversity (3M) to enable financial inclusion (Mastercard) or support healthcare (Johnson and Johnson). Often they raise awareness on new issues in the Middle East as part of global campaigns.

This is the eighth consecutive year that we have ranked the regional heads of global companies keeping in mind their achievements the role that they play within our economies and societies and the inspiration they provide to their employees and consumers.

This year there are three women on the list—more than there have ever been in previous lists. In the 2019 Global Meets Local ranking Melda Yasar Cebe Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa at Kraft Heinz made her first appearance and was the only woman on the list. This year she is joined by Reem Asaad Vice President for the Middle East and Africa at Cisco and Marzena Kulis Managing Director for the Middle East at Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices. Hopefully the number of female leaders in these roles will keep rising as more international companies choose women to head their Middle Eastern operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEwNzA0L2xhc2NvLWFkZHMtdmlzYS1jYXJkLWl0cy1ib2otYXBwcm92ZWQtcGF5bWVudC1wcm9kdWN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lasco adds Visa card to its BOJ-approved payment products,"Lasco Financial Services Limited LFSL is emerging as a major player in the payment card business having come to market with its second such product under approval from the central bank’s sandbox a strict and comprehensive regime by the Bank of Jamaica BOJ designed to drive fintech innovation while tightening anti-money laundering controls.

The second LFSL product is a prepaid Visa card issued by Lasco Pay the LFSL’s application that supports its other payment solution the Lasco Pay prepaid Mastercard. The new Visa-backed card is slated to come on stream between July and September this year LFSL’s Managing Director Jacinth Hall-Tracey told the Financial Gleaner.

As Visa products are typically issued by banks regulated by the central bank the new product could not have been issued outside the sandbox the Financial Gleaner learned.

The Visa card roll-out complements the company’s first product launched under the sandbox regime – a tech-driven cashless business model that was designed especially but not exclusively for business owners without bank accounts. That initiative dubbed Lasco Biz sees LFSL acting as a merchant aggregator or a super merchant to a banking institution to facilitate small business operators with or without a bank account who wish to boost their sales including through doing cashless transactions across countries.

Lasco Biz is now in its test phase which will run for up to two years under the central bank’s watch. It now involves a small group of participants approved by the BOJ but is expected to be opened to the public after the successful completion of the pilot.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

Less than a year into testing its role as a merchant aggregator LFSL is looking to secure more business in the payments market with the new deal inked with VISA making it the first non-bank in Jamaica to have a Visa card product and a principal issuer of Visa prepaid cards locally according to LFSL.

LFSL which is in the business of money transfers remittance and bill payments now uses its Lasco Pay co-branded prepaid Mastercard to serve customers receiving remittances conducting local and international e-commerce transactions bill payments and money transfers. Lasco Pay was approved under the previous Electronic Retail Payment Services (ERPS 2) guidelines which were replaced with the sandbox regime in March last year.

The prepaid Visa card will compete in the same market as the Mastercard product and is an option for employers seeking an alternative to cash payments to staff.

LFSL’s launch into prepaid Visa card issuance allows the financial services conglomerate more room for creativity Hall-Tracey said beginning with added features on the Lasco Pay Visa mobile app compared to the current Mastercard app.

For now the Lasco Pay Visa mobile app allows users to check account balances make payments and conduct transfers all in one place. Hall-Tracey said other features are in development.

“Lasco Financial Services is continuing the tradition of creating products and services that encourage financial inclusion. We are elated that Visa has invested their confidence in Lasco to bring this product to market and we anticipate immediate adoption once this product is launched” Hall-Tracey said in a statement.

While in the sandbox LFSL said both products will operate with limited service until granted full approval to scale to the general public.

The central bank’s fintech sandbox is designed to test innovative financial products and services and businesses are subject to the supervision of the BOJ. Under the initiative the BOJ will promote innovation but within an environment where risks are managed including the prospect of product failure as well as minimising the risk of jeopardising the integrity and stability of the financial system.

Copa America 2021: How it works

One of the 10 South American nations that comprise the CONMEBOL soccer confederation will be crowned continental champion at the Copa America. The 10 teams were split into two groups of five with the top four finishers in each group advancing to the quarterfinals. It's now a straight single-elimination knockout phase starting with the quarterfinals.

Group stage: After round-robin group play the top four finishers in each of the two groups advanced to the quarterfinals and the fifth-place team in each group was eliminated.

Knockout stage: The single-elimination knockouts began with the quarterfinals. The four teams qualifying from Group A faced the four teams advancing from Group B with respective top seeds facing the lowest seeds in the opposite group: 1A vs. 4B 1B vs. 4A 2A vs. 3B 2B vs. 3A.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGNoYW1wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8wNC90b25pLWtyb29zLWdyZWF0ZXN0LW1hdGNoZXMtZ2VybWFuLW5hdGlvbmFsLXRlYW0vMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toni Kroos' greatest matches with the German national team,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXJ3ZWxsLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L291cmZjLW1lbnMtdGVhbS1hcmUtdmljdG9yaW91cy1hcy13b21lbnMtdGVhbS1hcmUtZGVmZWF0ZWQtaW4tMjAyMS12YXJzaXR5LW1hdGNoZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OURFC men's team victorious women's team defeated in The Varsity Matches 2021,"Varsity for OURFC came once again not in the crisp cold of Twickenham in December but rather in the multi-seasonal July weather of Leicester. With an early wake up call at 9am ahead of a 10am coach journey from Iffley Road hundreds of Oxford students daydreamed of big hits and crisp line breaks on their way to Mattioli Woods Welford Road stadium while both the women and men’s squads stayed overnight in a hotel revising video analysis studying set plays and preparing to produce a storm.

The caveat to Oxford students’s enthusiasm was having to take their seats alongside the few Cambridge supporters dressed up in their inequivalent light blue/turquoise/greenish jumpers. However the upside for all supporters- and the stewards- was that the split crowd had to socially distance since COVID measures were still in place. Beers sunk snacks devoured and some Sandstorm (unironically) blared out through the speakers the pinnacle of amateur rugby was set to start as the women’s Blues stepped on.

First came the early try from Oxford’s Bianca Coltellini as she shuffled through various Cambridge shirts collapsing to the floor in hope of tackling the Oxford centre. On the restart the Oxford defence guarded their try line effectively with one tackle from Jessi Abele breaking the Cambridge momentum. When on the ball some slick pre-rehearsed loops from the Welsh international Manon Johnes playing at 9 for the Dark Blues kept the Tabs scuttling back at each new breakdown.

Despite Clodagh Holmes’s various quick line breaks from fullback Cambridge reacted with some zeal. Their early arrivals to rucks disrupted Oxford’s possession in the first half; the Cambridge centre Emily Bell was particularly productive as she powerfully jabbed at the Oxford forwards. Whenever the Tabs won the ball back Jenni Shuttleworth and Maggie Simpson’s impressive runs pierced the Dark Blue’s wall of defence; Simpson went on to score Cambridge’s first try by galloping down the wing. Anna Park’s impressive conversion from a difficult angle meant Cambridge led Oxford 7-5.

Cambridge escaped receiving a yellow card in the last 10 minutes of the first half having conceded three consecutive penalties for not rolling away in the breakdown. However a scare for the Dark Blues saw Cambridge intercept a ball next to the Oxford try line and subsequently score a try. This time to Cambridge’s uproar the referee Nia Parsonage cancelled the try as Oxford had an advantage from an earlier incident in the ruck. Half time Cambridge 7 Oxford 5 and the sun was fading away.

For much of the second half Oxford were stuck in their own 50 metre territory. Ruthlessly Mahnon Jones and Megan Isaac heaved the Oxford women back into Cambridge’s territory across various moments in the half.

Drizzle and tiredness also gave way to more open gameplay. This afforded Maggie Simpson some space to make some ground on Oxford but strong tackles from the likes of Maddie Hindson and Clodagh Holmes kept the Oxford defence intact.

With 13 minutes to go a penalty was awarded to Cambridge dampening hopes of a comeback. Another strong kick from Anna Park who was later awarded man of the match put Cambridge up ahead 10-5. With 5 minutes to go Oxford’s tornado attack rammed their way into Cambridge’s 22 but a connected defence from Cambridge prevented any late tries. Cambridge successfully closed in on their 13th Varsity win with the score 10-5 at full time. The cyclonic rain at the end of the women’s Varsity swiftly cleared for some revitalising sun ahead of the second Varsity Match of the day with the Oxford men’s squad out warming up before the Cambridge women’s team had finished celebrating.

After a valiant rendition of the national anthem at Welford Road stadium was sung the men’s match got underway. Cambridge flanker Hugo Lloyd Williams who had recently been awarded man of the match in the Cambridge Rugby League Varsity win over Oxford took the first hit. Yet straight off from this first breakdown Cambridge rapidly shipped the ball out wide playing various offloads with Joe Gatus finishing off a stunning attacking move with a try. Some Oxford supporters could be forgiven for looking up to the sky and expecting the rain to fall again. But Oxford were untamed putting the pressure directly back on Cambridge.

Rob Quinlan set the standard for the Dark Blues with a try only for the ball to be deemed to have gone out of play. Though Quinlan came off injured only minutes later it seems that his run down the wing inspired his substitute Henry Hackett to score a try when Tom Humberstone played a fizzing pass few metres out from the Tabs’ try line. Having scored a penalty just minutes before the score was 10-7 to Oxford. An irritated reaction from the Cambridge players sparked some ill tensions; goldie-lock-haired Cambridge captain Stephen Leonard was seen having several words with his opponents throughout the game from this moment on.

Andrew Durutalo the former Ealing Worcester and USA player led the way with some explosive runs while Oxford’s terrific line-speed in defence forced multiple errors from the Tabs. Oxford later capitalised on Cambridge’s various errors by scoring from a line-out after veteran captain George Messum popped it back inside for the prop John Aaron Henry to finish off the shrewd piece of play. Some stunning catches from Dan Stoller and Louis Jackson finished off a brilliant first half for the Dark Blues under the clear skies. Oxford 16 Cambridge 7 and Oxford’s route to victory looked promising.

However the weather was soon to change as thunder gradually approached Welford Road from the far distance. Regardless the Dark Blues’ performance refused any kind of change. Parts of the crowd gasped and the rest howled when Piers von Dadelszen kicked the second half off with a smarting tackle.

With the absence of scrums and mauls in both matches due to the RFU’s COVID “Return to Rugby” roadmap Oxford were able to play tap-and-gos near the Cambridge touchline. This benefitted Oxford’s punching attack-line; a try eventually came from Andrew Humberstone who then went on to convert his own try.

Later in the half Cambridge were suddenly on the attack themselves and seemed to have managed to peg one try back. After some confusion in the crowd and from those managing the scoreboard in the stadium it was confirmed that referee Andrew Jackson ruled out the try. Jackson then dramatically sin-binned Matt West and dished out a red card to Bertie Watson who had came on 15 minutes before as a hooker for the injured Will Barker. Watson’s foul play coincided with the return of rain. Such ominous signs nevertheless were brutally dismissed by the Dark Blues. Instead the incoming lightning weather was matched by sturdy lightning runs from captain George Messum lock Jasper Dix and flanker Andrew Durutalo. Tom Humberstone later scored from a penalty emulating the work that had been done by his brother.

Fortunately the enthused Oxford crowd seemed to have beaten the disheartened Tabs off the pitch as well with various chants. Henry Hackett matched the crowd’s enthusiasm with another terrific Oxford try intercepting a wayward Cambridge pass to sprint down the wing bring Varsity home and complete the successful shoeing of the Tabs. Torrential rain or a cloudburst or possibly a typhoon (?) ensued at full time but final celebrations were led by the Oxford Blues. One is sure that the night will be somewhat brighter at Park End and at Varsity Club when everyone is back.

Two tries from Joe Cokanasiga helped set an unfamiliar-looking England on their way to a 43-29 victory against a spirited USA side in Sunday's international at Twickenham.

England head coach Eddie Jones named a team that saw eight of the starting XV win their first cap including skipper Lewis Ludlow the first man since Nigel Melville in 1984 to captain England on debut and a further four uncapped players among the replacements.

The visitors who had only come together on the Wednesday prior to their first game in 21 months asked plenty of questions of Jones' side and crossed for four tries during the contest.

But ultimately England had too much for the Americans as Cokanasiga's double plus scores from Sam Underhill Ollie Lawrence Jamie Blamire Marcus Smith - who kicked four conversions - and man of the match Harry Randall sealed the win.

It was the USA who were first on the board after six minutes with debutant Luke Carty landing a penalty from halfway following some early errors and struggles at the scrum from the home team.

But England who also had three other possible tries ruled out during the game clicked into gear straight from the restart as Max Malins caught Smith's kick and burst down the left touchline before flicking a pass back inside for back row Underhill to finish for an unconverted try.

Sam Underhill got England up and running with their first try of the afternoon

Harlequins fly-half Smith posed the USA plenty of questions with his in-play kicking too and one of those led to England's second try in the 15th minute as Cokanasiga got up to make a catch setting up an attack which saw Henry Slade break and flick a pass out to midfield partner Lawrence to finish.

Cokanasiga then helped put the hosts in control at the break with two more first-half scores the first coming on 24 minutes following a quick tap penalty from Randall and a smart grubber kick into the USA's in-goal area from Freddie Steward which gave the winger a simple finish.

The Bath man struck again nine minutes before half-time as England worked a move from a line-out with Smith drawing in the American defence and releasing Cokanasiga through a gap in the line to race in from around 40 metres out.

Marcus Smith dives over for a second-half try for England

Trailing 26-3 at the break the USA were quick out of the blocks when play resumed by punishing back-to-back penalties against the hosts as Jamason Fa'anana-Schultz drove over for an unconverted try following a line-out in England's 22.

Jones' team were soon on the board again though this time through replacement hooker Blamire who made up for having a line-out stolen by charging down an attempted clearance from Ruben de Haas and regathering the ball to grab a try less than a minute into his debut.

At the other end of the field though the USA repeated that trick as scrum-half Randall's kick was charged down by Cam Dolan for him to finish - but the Bristol Bears No. 9 atoned for that by offloading for half-back partner Smith to cross for a try following a five-metre scrum.

Scrum-half Harry Randall capped a man-of-the-match display with a try

Then 11 minutes from time Randall produced a piece of individual magic as he broke from the base of a ruck threw a dummy and held off American replacement Calvin Whiting to score under the posts.

The visitors were not done yet though and another line-out deep in England's 22 led to their third try of the afternoon as replacement Hanco Germishuys and then moments after Lewis Ludlam had a try chalked off the USA finished with a flourish with a flowing attack which was finished by Christian Dyer."

Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8va2V5c3RvbmVuZXdzcm9vbS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHJvZml0ZWQtZnJvbS0yMDA4LWNvbGxhcHNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Dave McCormick profited off the 2008 financial collapse,"US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David McCormick speaks during a press conference as part of the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' Meeting in Sao Paulo Brazil on November 9 2008. (NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"The Pittsburgh Steelers made it an emphasis to improve their offensive line in the 2024 NFL Draft selecting Troy Fautanu Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick with three of their first five selections. While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoZS1wcmVzZW50L21jZG9uYWxkcy1yZXBsYWNpbmctaHVtYW4tZHJpdmV0aHJ1LWFpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's is replacing human drive-thru attendants with AI,"This article was originally published on our sister site Freethink.

As if drive-through ordering wasn’t frustrating enough already now we might have a Siri-like AI to contend with. McDonald’s just rolled out a voice recognition system at 10 drive-throughs in Chicago expanding from the solitary test store they launched a few years ago.

But when will it come to your neighborhood Golden Arches?

“There is a big leap between going from 10 restaurants in Chicago to 14000 restaurants across the U.S. with an infinite number of promo permutations menu permutations dialect permutations weather — I mean on and on and on and on” admitted McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski reports Nation’s Restaurant News.

Are we ready for AI? For those of us still dragging our heels on technology unwilling to enable Siri on our phones this might sound like a premature leap forward. But it isn’t. We’ve been engaging with artificial intelligence in numerous ways — from chatbots to farm equipment — sometimes without our knowledge.

One of the biggest challenges actually has been training the employees to take a step back and not help the AI when it struggles.



AI helps online shoppers get a personalized experience. AI is creating art and diagnosing medical conditions. AI is even keeping company with isolated people during the pandemic.

Whether the bots will leave human workers jobless only time will tell. Many McDonald’s restaurants already had self-serve kiosks where customers can place their order on an iPad-like screen and many orders are now placed online or with apps.

Robots and artificial intelligence are taking on other roles in restaurants too.

Flippy the robot flips burgers at a California restaurant grilling up to 150 burgers in an hour. And Spyce a Boston restaurant employs seven automated woks to cook food — and zero human chefs.

Some say this trend toward automation will improve food safety since robots are easy to clean and never sick. Others hope robots will serve as the reliable backup staff in an industry with a high employee turnover rate recently hit with post-pandemic labor shortages.

Is it working for McDonald’s? Yes and no. The technology is still in its infancy and only about 85% accurate. One in 5 orders needs a little help from an actual human — though Kempczinski says that one of the biggest challenges actually has been training the employees to take a step back and not help the AI when it struggles. But the CEO estimates that it might only take five years for a national rollout to happen reports Futurism.

How it came about: McDonald’s purchased voice technology from the startup Apprente in 2019. From there they built their voice assistant.

“There’s still a lot of work but (…) we feel good about the technical feasibility of it and the business case” Kempczinski said in a conference transcript from FactSet.

McDonald’s isn’t the first to move in this direction: White Castle and Sonic restaurants added some voice automation last year along with Ohio’s Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken Restaurant according to voicebot.ai.

Even though they are eager to test out automation in the drive-through line at Mickey D’s Kempczinski says they aren’t ready to replace line cooks who operate the fryers or grills.

“Most of those are not ready for prime time nor will they be ready for prime time over the next five years or so” he said. “The level of investment that would be required the cost of that equipment we’re nowhere near to what the break-even would need to be from a labor-cost standpoint to make that a good business decision for franchisees.”

One question remains — do we call the new AI “Ronald” or will it be immortalized with a new name?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dlaXJkLW5ld3MvZW50aXJlLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1zdGFmZi1xdWl0LW1pZC0yNDQ1NTc3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's workers all quit unexpectedly leaving blunt note restaurant is closed,"An entire team of workers at a McDonald's walked out and quit midway through their shift leaving the restaurant deserted after reportedly arguing with their managers

The video which has racked up more than 2.3million views already shows the journey into an unstaffed McDonalds with a note explaining the absence of workers.

""Everyone quit we're closed"" it says.

The camera then pans around the back of the kitchen to demonstrate not a soul is there with no customers waiting and no orders on the screen ready to be collected.

She then explained in the comment section the reason that the whole team quit that day after it was suggested it was a row over pay.

""Y'all we didn't quit from our pay"" she wrote.

""The store was ran by teenagers and it was a terrible work space. The higher ups had trouble helping us when needed.""

She continued: ""It's a bad job to start with but that's where most teenagers start for experience so that's where I put myself.""

Another video posted later on gave more depth into the story as Zoey documented her shift in more detail complaining about her bosses.

She captioned the post: ""Story time? Here's a little more I barely recorded that day that's why. But idk why y'all are so interested on what happened.""

With the video reaching millions of people in a matter of days many viewers who have worked in the service industry particularly in the pandemic offered their support in the comments.

One wrote: ""Worker solidarity here! I'm glad everyone quit. That tells me more about how terrible the work place is than the employees. Good for y'all"".

""I think anyone whose worked service is collectively agreeing good for you guys"" added another.

A third asked: ""Can this become a trend in toxic work environments? This is great.... lol"".

Japan has a surprisingly rich burger culture and so we’re always on the lookout for the next culinary creation. So no sooner had we finished digesting Burger King’s Tokyo Teriyaki Tower than a new burger temptation from McDonald’s Japan caught our eye.

Oh wait sorry. It turns out that that’s actually not a burger at all but a macaron. See select McDonald’s branches in Japan offer the chain’s sub-brand of McCafé by Barista café-style beverages and desserts and they recently added a new salty caramel macaron to the menu.

Still it really does look like a hamburger doesn’t it? At a glance you could mistake the smooth cookie portions at the top and bottom for buns and the two ruffled sections (each called a “pied”) for a pair of patties.

▼ How McDonald’s salty caramel macaron initially looked to our burger-focused brains

Of course McDonald’s itself doesn’t offer officially offer anything as weird as a Salty Caramel Macaron Burger…so we had no choice but to make one ourselves.

▼ To those of you saying “Wait isn’t just not making a dessert burger an option?” we’d like to say thank you for visiting SoraNews24 for the first time!

For our recipe we’ll need:

● 5 McDonald’s Salty Caramel Macarons

● 2 regular McDonald’s hamburgers

The reason for using regular hamburgers as opposed to something more deluxe like a Big Mac isn’t because we’re cheap but because we’re going to be removing everything except the meat and buns in keeping with the simplicity of the deluded mental image we got from McDonald’s macaron tweet. And while we’re unapologetic gluttons the reason we’re using two burgers is because we need two patties.

Once we’d removed all the burgers’ extra toppings and sauce we turned out attention to the macarons. To scoop out their caramel cream filling we used a chopstick but a spatula should also do the trick.

The generous volume of filling for each macaron is a testament to the high quality of McCafé by Barista’s desserts. As we removed it from the cookies we started layering it on top of one of the patties and we ended up with an impressive mound that looked a little like the topping of an unidon (sea urchin rice bowl)/

Now all that was left to do was the final assembly of placing the second bun on top of the filling…

…and crowning it all with the top bun.

▼ Viola (macarons are a French confectionary after all)

Curious to see if our madness was also delicious we took a bite. It’s kind of hard to brace yourself one way for another for a flavor combination as unorthodox as this so we were startled when the taste was somehow familiar despite the fact that we like everyone else on the planet had never eaten a Salty Caramel Macaron Burger before. So we took another bite and then we had it…

…it tastes like peanut butter! It’s not an exact match but something about the mixture of the caramel and meat gave it a nutty heartiness and the flavor isn’t nearly as weird as we’d initially imagined it was going to be.

That said this is still using a dessert as a condiment and the sweet sensation gets strong pretty quickly. If we were going to try this again we’d use less cream (five macarons’ worth turned out to be more than we’d expected) and maybe add a dash or two of pepper to balance out some of the sweetness. Still our flash of strange inspiration turned out better than it had any right to and considering that it’s both a sandwich and a dessert in every bite this really does qualify as fast food.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Pavilion of Turkey at the Biennale di Venezia by Neyran Turan | The Strength of Architecture ...,"Description of project by Neyran Turan



In light of the current climate crisis what can architecture contribute towards a new planetary imagination of our contemporary environment beyond environmentalism and technological determinism? Rather than limiting the role of design simply to a solution to the problem of climate change can we speculate on architecture as a measure through which the environment might be imagined? Architecture as Measure positions climate change as a cultural and political idea that requires a renewed architectural environmental imagination.



The Architecture as Measure project defines the planetary as the vast geo-temporal scales through which climate emergency accelerates. But it starts with the provocation that instead of seeing planetary imagination purely as an isolated idea of preserving nature or as technological management or as visualization it is important at this moment for architecture to consider its potential from within its inner workings. Architecture as Measure proposes that architecture needs to see larger planetary questions and the everyday aspects of its own making as one and the same thing. The planetary is about the here and now; it is embedded in everything we do and it is waiting for a long-overdue radical change.



Presented through an installation a website publication and storytelling the Architecture as Measure project for the Pavilion of Turkey at the 17th International Architecture Exhibition la Biennale di Venezia titled How Will We Live Together? focuses on the politics and nuances of the seemingly mundane aspects and sites of architectural construction juxtaposing them with their respective planetary counterparts through geographies of material extraction supply chains maintenance and care in Turkey and beyond.



In the context of climate emergency Architecture as Measure positions architecture as a measure to provoke an alternative planetary imagination that can help assess our place on Earth and our role in relation to those with whom we live together: as architects with the actors of other disciplines and domains of work and as a species alongside more-than-human others.



Taking the exhibition curator Neyran Turan’s recently published book Architecture as Measure (New York and Barcelona: Actar Publishers 2020) as a theoretical preamble the exhibition speculates on architecture as a measure against which such an imagination might be read.



Why the emphasis on imagination at this moment when urgent action is already overdue? It is precisely because of the exigency of our current moment that we are driven to the significance of imagination. First imagination matters because as evidenced with the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests throughout the world the intricacies of systemic injustice and climate emergency call for unconventional approaches that can make sense of the collision between the quotidian and the planetary—the vast geo-temporal scales through which climate emergency accelerates. If there is a close link between the pandemic and the proliferation of deforestation biodiversity loss unrestricted agriculture extraction and urbanization in remote areas this means that the planetary scale of climate emergency and our everyday lives are not only intricately correlated but are exactly the same thing.



Second imagination matters because as has been pointed out by many geographers climate change is not about a self-righteous battle between “nature” and “humans” but the consequence of centuries of extractivism colonialism dispossession and racism. Simply put the humans who are the most responsible for climate change are the most insulated from its effects whereas those who are the least accountable feel the greatest effects of this slow violence. Consider for instance how the pandemic has been disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable communities (lower-wealth communities people of color Indigenous people and the elderly etc.) which correlates to their susceptibility to other ongoing environmental problems. In other words the pandemic is yet another reminder that the idea of the planetary is not a theoretical concept in isolation. On the contrary the planetary is about the here and now; it is embedded in everything we do and it is waiting for a long-overdue radical change.



Third imagination matters because it is the ultimate and most necessary ingredient for meaningful structural change in architecture and related design disciplines. This means re-assessing decolonizing and re-structuring—individually and collectively—the worlds we design the institutions we build and the systems of knowledge and value through which we see the world. An alternative environmental imagination is an important step towards that.



Instead of on the one hand pretending that inequalities of labor colonialism and resource extraction are external to the work that we do as architects and on the other dismissing questions of aesthetics and technique as trivial matters what kinds of worlds are possible if we are truly willing to understand the embeddedness the collision and the specificities of these aspects within our practices and disciplinary imaginations? How can we bring a sensibility of care to the violence brought about by these inequalities and what is architecture’s role in that change? These questions are important not only for dismantling archaic assumptions and abolishing entrenched power structures in our discipline but also for rebuilding future foundations towards alternative worlds.



As elaborated in Turan’s book we invoke two complementary definitions of the term “measure” in the exhibition. Measuring something means to ascertain its degree by using an instrument and also to scrutinize to consider by taking pause and focusing inwardly. This alternative focus on the politics and nuances of the inner workings of architecture can have profound effects in triggering unconventional environmental imaginations. Think for instance of our contracts building codes technical standards specification requirements and other conventions of material extraction and supply chains construction assembly labor maintenance and inspection. All of these components and many others not only have profound effects on the material practice of architecture but also at a much broader level reflect our values and assumptions about what constitutes the idea of “the environment” for architecture. In other words architecture’s imagination of its familiar interior is the very image of its planetary exterior.



The installation component of the exhibition comprises four dioramas each focusing on specific sites of architecture from resource extraction and material supply chains to construction maintenance and care in Turkey. In addition to the installation the exhibition extends onto a website as its main publication platform. Exploring topics of focus through four different formats—Paperwork Episodes Conversations and Essays—the website presents content by the Pavilion’s curatorial team and the invited contributors which will be published at regular intervals over the course of the Biennale.



The Paperwork section presents the exhibition’s main research content on the bureaucracy of architectural documents that enact facilitate and normalize the protocols of extraction maintenance logistics and construction. Ranging from tables to photographs schemes maps reports regulations emails lists plans certificates spreadsheets standards receipts schedule diagrams contracts timesheets drawings engravings legends and labels this section presents material curated by the curatorial team along with invited contributions.

Happy Fourth of July!

Before the fireworks go off across the Tri-State area Jets X-Factor looks back on the most lucrative fourth quarters in terms of points in New York Jets history.

T-4. 9/28/08: Cardinal Offense (22 vs. ARI)

Technically speaking we should be commemorating the best second quarters in Jets history. The Continental Congress after all made the vote for independence on July 2 but it was only declared two days later.

Fortunately the Jets’ 2008 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals gives us ample opportunity to do both. After a scoreless first the Jets put up a jaw-dropping 34 points on the future NFC champions. Laveranues Coles was the recipient of three Brett Favre touchdown passes while Darrelle Revis took back a Kurt Warner interception.

Nonetheless the firey Cardinals struck back with three third-quarter touchdowns on the ground two coming from Edgerrin James. But the Jets put up 22 in the final frame with Favre finding Jerricho Cotchery twice to rebuild the lead.

Five years before Taylor Swift did the Jets felt 22 when they opted to go for a double after Favre’s sixth touchdown pass this one to Dustin Keller. Leon Washington punched in the final couple scores in the Jets’ 56-35 triumph.

T-4. 12/12/99: Key Party (22 vs. MIA)

Perhaps the Dolphins should’ve seen the Monday night fourth-quarter onslaught coming. Less than a full calendar year before the Jets put 22 on Miami in a much more humble comeback as they trailed 13-6 entering the final frame of what became a 28-20 win.

Playing out the stretch after losing Testaverde to an injury in the opening week of their AFC East title defense the Jets’ comeback erased the Dolphins’ lead through two Keyshawn Johnson touchdown passes from Ray Lucas. The latter came on a jaw-dropping one-handed reception of a 24-yard pass giving the Jets the lead for good.

After kicker John Hall made it a two-possession game Omar Stoudemire ended Miami’s desperate comeback effort by taking an interception of Dan Marino back 67 yards for the clinching score. That pass wound up being the final attempt for Marino at Giants Stadium as he would retire in the ensuing offseason.

That win over Miami set up an inspirational final stretch for the Bill Parcells era. It was the first of four final victories to round out the season all of them coming against playoff-bound squads (Miami twice Dallas and Seattle).

3. 12/10/78: Here’s To You Mr. Robinson (24 @ CLE)

The Jets’ finest fourth-quarter output on the road alas came in a crucial loss.

Entering the penultimate week of the 1978 season New York needed a win over the Cleveland Browns to keep their playoff hopes alive sitting at 8-6 and one game behind Houston for the final wild card. The dream appeared dead with 15 minutes to go as the Jets trailed the Browns 27-10.

But Matt Robinson overcame four interceptions to keep the Jets’ postseason dream alive. The quarter opened with two scoring passes to Mickey Shuler and Bruce Harper before a Pat Leahy field goal and Kevin Long’s rushing score appeared to give the Jets the crucial victory. It was part of an otherwise career-best afternoon for Robinson (289 yards three touchdowns overall) a ninth-round pick pressed into starting service after Richard Todd’s early injury.

Alas for the Jets Cleveland had a miracle of its own in store. Brian Sipe would find Calvin Hill with 14 seconds to go to send the game into overtime before Don Cockroft snuffed out the playoff light with a 22-yard field goal in overtime.

2. 10/27/68: Joe’s Brewin’ Boston (28 vs. BOS)

The Jets’ Super Bowl season is often remembered for the rushing efforts of Matt Snell and Emerson Boozer. But on a Sunday at Shea Stadium reserve rusher Billy Joe became one of the finer one-game wonders in Jets history.

Joe the 1963 AFL Rookie of the Year almost single-handedly put away the Boston Patriots. After backup quarterback Babe Parilli opened the frame on a short scoring rush Joe earned the last three six-pointers to score an AFL-record three touchdowns in a single quarter. The Jets would win the game 48-14 their best scoring output en route to the championship in Miami.

Away from New York Joe went on to become one of the most accomplished head coaches in the history of historically black college and university football. His 245 HBCU wins over 39 seasons (1972-2010) are second only to Eddie Robinson.

1. 10/23/00: Testaverde’s 30 (30 pts. vs MIA)

Perhaps the most shocking thing about the famous “Monday Night Miracle” is that it wasn’t a slow and gradual effort. Rather the Jets’ comeback from a 30-7 Miami Dolphins lead was made entirely over the final 15 minutes.

Things started inconspicuously enough through a 30-yard scoring hookup between Vinny Testaverde and Laveranues Coles followed by a missed two-point conversion. Testaverde however made up for the missed double with three more passing scores.

Jermaine Wiggins and Wayne Chrebet caught the first two while Jumbo Elliott’s tackle-eligible tally re-tied the game with 42 seconds to go. John Hall earned the other points through extra points and a 34-yard field goal before winning it in overtime from 40 yards out.

Nate has always been in good shape. He’s even participated in marathons and an Ironman and he has always done about 50 push-ups a day. But in 2019 he upped the ante in a big way.

The single dad always strives to be a great example for his kids. He works as a social worker providing mental health services to state prison inmates at the Wisconsin Resource Center. When he learned about the Tunnels to Towers 1.5 Million Push-Up Challenge his interest was instantly piqued.

The Stephen Siller Tunnel To Towers Foundation is a nonprofit named after a firefighter who died during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Their mission is to support the nation’s first responders and military heroes through donations events and other fundraising efforts.

Nate entered their push-up challenge and got to work. In order to meet his goal he knew he had to do at least 2740 push-ups every single day.

He documented his push-ups with time-lapse videos and photos hoping to beat the existing Guinness World Record set by the “World’s Fittest Man” Paddy O’Doyle in 1989. Nate was confident he could do better while also raising money for a worthy cause!

“I try to weave my push-ups into my daily activity” he said. “To set aside time to do 4000 push-ups is impossible. You have to really make it a priority and be willing to commit to it and embrace the fact that you have to weave that into your day.”

“Trying to balance this amount of push-ups with being a father and working full-time sometimes creates obstacles that you sometimes have to overcome” Nate said.

In June 2021 Nate met his goal! He decided to finish off the challenge at a very special and appropriate event the 48th annual Fun City Bowl. This football game for New York City first responders is held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and Nate couldn’t wait to celebrate his victory among the same people he’d chosen to support.

During halftime the dad dropped down onto the turf to complete his 1500231st push-up within a span of 12 months. Not only did he complete the final nine push-ups to finish the challenge but he also threw in an extra 11 to break the world record and honor the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

“I’m grateful to have passed this record with my children watching and in the presence of the brave men and women of the NYPD and FDNY” Nate wrote on Instagram. “I will continue doing push-ups until this challenge is officially over June 13th. Please consider making a donation to The Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Thank you all for supporting me and the Push Through challenge.”

Guinness World Records still needs to verify and approve Nate’s record but either way we think he’s won! Nate is proof that with the right incentive there’s really nothing we can’t do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGhpbnBoYW5hdGljLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2Nhbi10aGUtbWlhbWktZG9scGhpbnMtc2Vjb25kYXJ5LXN1Y2NlZWQtd2l0aG91dC14YXZpZW4taG93YXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Miami's secondary succeed without Xavien Howard?,If Xavien Howard does end up leaving Miami Nik Needham is a player to keep an eye on.

In recent sessions of the Nevada Legislature lawmakers have taken several steps forward on gun safety.

Bump stock ban — passed. Universal background checks — passed. Red flag law — passed. Ban on ghost guns — passed. And so on.

So when lawmakers introduced a bill this year to allow casinos to become gun-free zones in a similar manner to schools government buildings and even the Nevada Legislative Building the legislation might have appeared likely to sail through the process to become law.

Wrong. The measure Senate Bill 452 would run into opposition from an unlikely alliance of groups and would be blocked in the Assembly after passing narrowly in the Senate.

It was a stunning and frustrating setback for gun-safety advocates who had argued that the bill was an appropriate reaction to a recent rise of gun violence on the Las Vegas Strip and would provide casino operators with an important tool to protect visitors and staff from harm.

The defeat of SB452 would also raise thorny questions about the balance between protecting public safety versus reducing the disparate impact of the justice system on communities of color.

In the end it left the state’s casinos in a status quo that allows them to ban guns on their properties but according to the bill’s proponents places security staff and patrons at risk of violence in doing so. The situation has prompted worries of more gun violence that could dampen the tourism industry and thus the entire state economy if visitors feel they won’t be safe while in Las Vegas.

Here’s the story of SB452.

Guns and casino a primer

Under state law open carry of weapons is allowed on the Strip as is concealed carry with a state-issued permit.

Casinos aren’t required to ban guns but as private property owners they are legally allowed to do so. Some Las Vegas resorts prohibit firearms on casino floors and some don’t.

Those with no-weapons policies can remove violators despite the failure of S.B. 452 through a process that was in place before the legislative session.

That process: Staff must confront suspected violators ask them to comply with the ban and if the individuals refuse remove them from the property for trespassing.

But leading proponents of SB452 which was spearheaded by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro D-Las Vegas say the trespassing enforcement method is problematic. A main reason is that casino security staff most of whom are unarmed must approach and interact with the armed violators which creates a potentially volatile situation and puts staff members directly at risk. It also raises the possibility of confrontations that jeopardize the safety of guests as well.

SB452 would have allowed casino staff to immediately call law enforcement officers for violations of gun bans and it would have established a specific misdemeanor crime for those violations. The bill’s purpose proponents said was to give resort operators a preventative tool to get guns off premises before further problems arose.

“It is essential that we signal to our customers all over the world that Las Vegas is the safest place to be and this bill will help send that signal” Ayesha Khanna Molino MGM Resorts International’s senior vice president of public affairs said during video testimony to lawmakers in May.

MGM whose Mandalay Bay property was the site of the Oct. 1 2017 mass shooting was a strong supporter of the bill. Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui D-Las Vegas a survivor of that shooting championed it as well as did the influential gun-safety advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety. Other supporters included the politically powerful Culinary Union.

The bill was spurred partly by a rash of gun violence on the Las Vegas Strip in 2020 as resort properties began to reopen from coronavirus shutdowns.

Seven shootings including a gun discharging on the MGM Grand casino floor occurred on the Strip from mid-July through October last year and Metro Police confiscated 64 weapons during that three-month span.

Such violence persisted into 2021 including a March 9 murder-suicide in the Wynn parking garage and an April 25 shooting on Las Vegas Boulevard near Harmon Avenue that left one person dead and two injured.

Jauregui warned a joint judiciary committee that the shootings were a threat not only to Strip resort workers and locals patronizing resorts in the tourist corridor but to the tourist economy.

“While we have made progress in the years since (Oct. 1) we’ve also seen continued violent incidents that have left both Nevadans and the economic engine of our state — Las Vegas tourists — questioning the safety or our community” she said. Jauregui later added: “In a post-COVID world we know we need to show visitors and residents alike that we are a place where you can come and forget your problems not come to find more. We know we need every single selling point we can to get our tourism economy back on track.”

SB452 didn’t impose gun restrictions at all casinos but instead was to be instituted on an opt-in basis.

It required properties to post uniform signage to notify visitors of gun bans and in an acknowledgement by proponents that visitors might be confused going between casinos with and without restrictions required law enforcement to allow violators to comply with bans before arresting them.

Exemptions were included for people who are required by their employers to carry guns such as police officers and for special circumstances such as for guests purchasing weapons at a trade show such as the annual SHOT Show. It also would have exempted anyone with written consent from the casino operator to carry a firearm.

Sen. Fabian Donate D-Las Vegas who collaborated with Cannizzaro and other proponents in drafting and amending the bill told the Sun that his motivation in getting involved was to protect Strip workers. Donate’s father is a longtime employee at The Strat where Donate himself got his first job working the amusement rides at the top of the tower. Several members of his family also are employed on the Strip.

“I’ve talked about this many times that gun violence is a public health crisis” said Donate a graduate of the School of Public Health at UNLV. “The most useful tactic to improve public health behaviors is modifications to private industry. So I saw this as an opportunity from the public health lens to not only protect workers but to really make the entire community a safer place. And SB452 was a good public health bill that would have strengthened the safety net.”

Fault lines form

The provisions of SB452 were originally written into a larger gun bill that included the ban on ghost guns or weapons that are generally home-assembled using component parts without serial numbers. The casino portions of the original bill were carved out however and placed in SB452 which was introduced as an emergency measure late in the session.

To no one’s surprise the bill ran into opposition from Republican lawmakers who raised concerns about Second Amendment infringement. Nothing new there — GOP legislators routinely reject gun-safety bills.

But what hadn’t been anticipated on the casino portion of the bill and what would eventually derail the bill is that it drew backlash from Democrats claiming it would lead to racial profiling and stop-and-frisk practices against minority casino patrons particularly Blacks. Police unions also opposed it.

This was highly unusual politically speaking: Groups that normally might have been at odds — such as the American Civil Liberties Union the National Rifle Association and law enforcement union groups — found themselves aligned. Metro Police took a neutral stance.

“It covered the entire spectrum — left right and center — who opposed this bill because of the potential outcomes” Athar Haseebullah executive director of the ACLU of Nevada said in an interview with the Sun. “People didn’t take issue with the intentions but rather the probable outcomes.”

But proponents said they took several measures to address concerns over disparate policing stop-and-frisk and other potential outcomes raised by opponents.

Donate for instance worked with Sen. Dallas Harris D-Las Vegas to include a requirement for opted-in casino operators to provide security officers with training on de-escalation techniques cultural diversity and implicit bias. These requirements would have come on top of existing federal and state anti-discrimination regulations for casino operators.

The requirement for law enforcement officers to allow suspected violators to comply was another step toward addressing the social justice concerns.

Proponents went as far as to offer to make the bill apply only to weapons being openly carried and to instances when patrons were suspected of trying to bring semiautomatic weapons into casinos.

“I don’t think (SB452) is either a front or back door to racial profiling or stop-and-frisk frankly” Cannizzaro told the Sun. “It’s not a stop-and-frisk policy period. It still requires evidence that somebody has a firearm on them and it would require law enforcement to give (suspected violators) an opportunity to comply. Additionally these properties that are working to entertain visitors and have them feel comfortable while they’re staying here and encourage people to come to Las Vegas are not engaged in the business of ‘How can we increase racial profiling on our properties.”

When the bill came before the Senate Cannizzaro managed to keep that chamber’s slight majority of Democrats largely on board with the bill and it passed on an 11-10 vote with only one Democrat Dina Neal of North Las Vegas voting against it.

But that was as far as SB452 progressed.

According to sources familiar with the situation Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson made an attempt to galvanize support for the bill. But Democratic lawmakers formed a bright line over the criminal justice issues which made the bill a lost cause.

Despite the provisions for voluntary compliance implicit bias training etc. Assembly Democrats wouldn’t budge and the bill was not brought to a vote on the Assembly floor.

Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong D-Las Vegas in the joint judicial committee meeting summarized the concerns: “We know that every single time there is an interaction with police for Black and brown people the opportunity for it to go sideways is great and we just don’t want that.”

Meanwhile a common thread among both Democrat and Republican critics of the bill was to castigate casinos specifically MGM for the security problems on the Strip.

One GOP senator Ira Hansen berated MGM for attempting to get more help from law enforcement as opposed to adopting more aggressive security measures.

Hansen went so far as to say that the “only person responsible” for the Oct. 1 shooting was “the MGM people that allowed those dozen or whatever long guns to go through their service elevators and cause that kind of a mass shooting.” The remark was eyebrow-raising: What about the responsibility of the actual shooter Stephen Paddock?

What now?

Supporters of SB452 said they wholeheartedly agreed with the need to address implicit bias and racial profiling in security and law enforcement.

But they noted that the issue was already being addressed in several bills this year that were designed to reform law enforcement practices and policies with regard to policing of minority communities.

The proponents were left feeling frustrated that a bill intended to improve public health and safety couldn’t exist on a separate track from the social justice legislation.

“I do think there is rightfully a concern about making sure that when we entrust law enforcement to do a job that they do it properly” Cannizzaro said. “But I think it’s unfortunate that folks continued to characterize this as a stop-and-frisk bill because this is the same policy we have for a number of places where we don’t want firearms. And not being able to see around that made people more apprehensive about what we were trying to do. I honestly still think it is good policy.”

The situation begged a question: Using the logic that SB452 was fundamentally flawed because it would result in disparate treatment of minorities wouldn’t that also be a fundamental flaw of any law enforcement-related bill that would increase criminal penalties and lead to more interaction between police and minorities?

Let’s say there was a bill to increase the penalties for speeding in a school zone for example. Couldn’t lawmakers defeat it on the grounds that it would lead to more minorities being racially profiled pulled over and arrested?

Supporters of SB452 said they were disappointed that the bill’s critics came to see the two issues — public safety and police reforms — as mutually exclusive. As Cannizzaro put it “That issue (of police bias) is not solved by SB452 passing but it’s also not solved by SB452 not passing.”

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D-Nev. a behind-the-scenes supporter of the bill offered similar sentiments in a statement to the Sun.

“Gun safety and police reform are among the most pressing and important issues facing our country” Reid said. “It was unfortunate however to see legislation designed to prevent gun violence at our tourist destinations fail due to some pairing the bill with issues related to policing. We must address how our communities are policed — and I was pleased to see the passage of several reform bills this session — but we must also do all that we can to keep our communities and visitors safe. Gun safety and police reform are not conflicting issues. Preventing gun violence at our resorts and businesses like police reform should be a top priority for our Legislature. It must be addressed as soon as possible.”

Coming out of the session supporters of SB452 say they’re undaunted in their efforts to address gun safety on the Strip and beyond.

The stakes are certainly high not just in terms of providing a safe environment for casino workers and guests but for protecting the economy of Las Vegas and by extension the entire state. As Jauregui stated serious consequences could arise if ongoing gun violence leaves tourists and convention goers feeling like Las Vegas isn’t a safe place to visit.

It’s well worth remembering that after the Oct. 1 shooting tourism in Las Vegas took a significant dip overall for several weeks and bookings at Mandalay Bay took months to recover. The lull sparked speculation that MGM might close or rebrand the property although neither came to pass.

Meanwhile Southern Nevadans have indicated strong support for improved gun safety at the ballot box in recent years. In 2016 a statewide ballot question on universal background checks passed by more than 100000 votes in Clark County enough for the measure to carry statewide even though Clark was the only county in the state where it drew a majority of “yes” votes. Similarly the Las Vegas Valley’s support of pro-gun-safety candidates played a key role in Democrats currently holding all but one statewide office and having majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.

Las Vegas also made global news in gun-safety advocacy recently when an organization led by the parents of a victim of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting tricked two prominent gun rights advocates into appearing in viral videos decrying gun violence. The project involved inviting the two to speak at what they were falsely told was a high school commencement rehearsal at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds where 3044 chairs had been set up. What the men weren’t told was that those chairs signified the number of students in the nationwide 2021 graduating class who lost their lives to gun violence. The ensuing videos revealed the purpose for those chairs and featured recordings of the men’s speeches interspersed with 911 calls from terrified students.

Meanwhile security and law enforcement remain on high alert for gun violence on the Strip. At 3:15 p.m. this past Monday Metro issued an alert saying officers had responded to reports of an armed person on the MGM Grand casino floor. Afterward Metro reported finding no evidence that anyone had displayed or waved a handgun although officers arrested an individual for disorderly conduct.

Supporters of SB452 say the ongoing potential for gun violence leaves them undaunted in their efforts to address security on the Strip.

“The safety of our guests and employees is paramount to our community industry and economy” Molino said in a statement to the Sun. “As a top tourism destination it’s essential that Nevada makes clear that our state and resorts are the safest place to be. Businesses must have the tools and support they need to keep their properties safe and enjoyable for everyone. While we are disappointed that legislation failed to pass during the most recent legislative session we will continue working with state leaders and others to address this vital issue for our state and economy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZWxlYnJpdHluZXR3b3J0aC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtbmV3cy9mcm9tLWdyZWF0LWRlcHJlc3Npb24tcmFncy10by1tdWx0aS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS12ZWdhcy1yaWNoZXMtdGhlLWluY3JlZGlibGUtbGlmZS1zdG9yeS1vZi1raXJrLWtlcmtvcmlhbi1yaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Great Depression Rags To Multi-Billionaire Vegas Riches. The Incredible Life Story Of Kirk Kerkorian,"From Great Depression Rags To Multi-Billionaire Vegas Riches. The Incredible Life Story Of Kirk Kerkorian

On June 15 2015 a billionaire named Kirk Kerkorian passed away at the age of 98. Kirk may not have had the widespread name recognition as fellow billionaires like Mark Cuban Donald Trump or Warren Buffett. And that's kind of a shame because Kirk was probably one of the most interesting billionaires who has ever walked the earth. Don't believe me? This is his incredible life story…

Early Life

Kerkor ""Kirk"" Kerkorian was born on June 6 1917 in Fresno California. His parents were dirt poor Armenian immigrant farmers trying to survive the Great Depression. When Kirk was three years old the family lost their land. They moved to Los Angeles to seek better prospects. His father eventually operated a fruit stand. The family was so poor that Kirk was forced to drop out of school in the 8th grade to get a job.

When he wasn't working Kirk took up boxing as a hobby. His older brother trained him to the point where Kirk was able to win the Pacific Welterweight boxing championship under the name ""Rifle Right Kerkorian"".

""I didn't go to school but I went into buying and selling businesses at an early age. I got into a lot of different businesses. I had to have a lot of luck."" – Kirk Kerkorian

World War II and Aviation

When he wasn't boxing he was installing water hearing furnaces. At 22 he installed a furnace for a many name Ted O'Flaherty who happened to be an amateur pilot. One day Ted invited Kirk to go flying with him along the California coast. Something magical happened during that flight because from that point on Kirk was hooked on planes.

With World War II looming Kirk knew that he would be the perfect age for an eventual draft that would place him in the general infantry division. Fearing the infantry would not have a high survival rate Kirk started taking flying lessons in the Mojave Desert from a woman named Pancho Barnes. He couldn't afford the lessons so as payment he agreed to milk and look after Pancho's cows.

It took six months for Kirk to earn his pilot's license. He quickly joined the British Royal Air Force and began flying cargo missions that brought supplies from North America to Scotland. The planes he flew had fuel capacity for 2300 mile trips. The average length of the supply missions was 2200 miles. Not a lot of room for error. One out of every four planes that set out on this journey crashed.

Kirk was one of the lucky ones. Just seven months before he joined the Royal Air Force Kirk had never been in a plane and had barely ever left California let alone the United States. By the time WWII was over he had flown 33 different types of planes logged countless hours in the air and traveled to four continents.

During the war Kirk was very thrifty with his wages. In fact he managed to save most of everything he was ever paid. When the war was over Kirk spent his entire savings $5000 to buy his own Cessna plane ($5000 in the mid 1940s is the same as $67000 today). He then began working as a general aviation pilot chauffeuring rich people from Hollywood out to Las Vegas and back.

On one of these early piloting jobs Kirk found himself in Las Vegas Nevada for the first time. He immediately became hooked on gambling. Specifically craps.

In 1947 Kirk took $60000 he managed to win at the craps tables (roughly $635000 today) and purchased a small air-charter service company called Trans International Airlines that specialized in transporting gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

Over the next 20 years Kirk's business boomed. He expanded by buying up more planes and adding new routes up and down the west coast. In 1968 he sold Trans International to the Transamerica Corporation for $104 million (roughly $707 million today).

Viva Las Vegas

Aviation wasn't Kirk's only business interest. Back in 1962 he bought 80 acres of land in Las Vegas for $960000 ($7.5 million). Four years later his plot of land was the new home for a little casino called Caesars Palace.

Kerkorian didn't actually own Caesars Palace he simply rented them the land it was built on for $2 million per year ($15 million today). When Caesars was bought in 1968 Kirk agreed to sell the land for a $9 million payday ($61 million today).

One year before the Caesars sale Kirk purchased 82 acres of land on the strip for $5 million and began construction of the International Hotel. When construction was complete the International was the largest hotel in the world. Barbra Streisand and Elvis were the hotel's first performers. Elvis sold out every single show 4200 seats per show for 30 days straight.

Kirk soon came to own the Flamingo Hotel. He sold both the Flamingo and the International to the Hilton Hotel Corporation.

In 1969 Kirk bought movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer. He then opened the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Once again he broke the record for world's largest hotel. This is not the MGM Grand we know today because in 1986 Kirk sold his MGM Grand properties in Las Vegas and Reno to Bally Manufacturing for $594 million ($1.3 billion today). The Las Vegas property was renamed Bally's. He then built the MGM Grand most of us know today.

In 2000 Kerkorian bought Steve Wynn's Mirage Resorts for $6.4 billion. In 2004 he bought Mandalay Resorts for $4.8 billion.

Today MGM Resorts International owns the Bellagio the current MGM Grand New York – New York Circus Circus Mandalay Bay The Luxor The Excalibur and the Mirage. They now also own the newly built Las Vegas CityCenter complex.

During the last decades of his life Kirk Kerkorian literally owned more than half of all the hotel rooms in Las Vegas.

Kirk lived most of his later years on a 30 acre estate in Beverly Hills. He almost never gave interviews and rarely appeared in public. He donated $180 million to his homeland of Armenia after the country experienced a devastating earthquake in 1989. His charitable foundation distributed more than $400 million to various causes over the years. Despite performing these impressive acts of charity Kirk has famously never allowed anything to be named in his honor.

Kirk Kerkorian died earlier today at the age of 98. His most recent personal net worth was $4.2 billion. That's a far cry from the dirt poor Fresno farm boy he started out as! During his life Kirk was a boxer pilot war hero gambler hotel tycoon auto tycoon movie studio tycoon philanthropist and much more. We should all be so lucky to live such an impressive and long life as Mr. Kerkorian. Rest in peace!",,,,,,,,,

Researchers believe the innovation could drastically change the daily health of people without the need for cumbersome laboratory set-ups.

Cortisol and other stress hormones regulate many aspects of physical and mental health including sleep quality. High levels of cortisol can result in poor sleep which increases stress that can contribute to panic attacks heart attacks and other issues. Researchers used the same technology used to make computer chips to build sensors thinner than a human hair that can detect biomolecules at low levels.

The scientists were able to test the device on 65 blood samples from patients.

“The use of nanosensors allowed us to detect cortisol molecules directly without the need for any other molecules or particles to act as labels” says Reza Mahmoodi a postdoctoral scholar at Rutgers University in a statement.

Mehdi Javanmard an associate professor also with the university’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering says patients can monitor their hormone levels and better manage chronic inflammation and stress at a lower cost. “Our new sensor produces an accurate and reliable response that allows a continuous readout of cortisol levels for real-time analysis” he explains. “It has great potential to be adapted to non-invasive cortisol measurement in other fluids such as saliva and urine.

“The fact that molecular labels are not required eliminates the need for large bulky instruments like optical microscopes and plate readers making the readout instrumentation something you can measure ultimately in a small pocket-sized box or even fit onto a wristband one day” he adds.

Stress may have hit levels unseen for many Americans thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. In one recent survey half of Americans admit they don’t think they’ll ever fully recover from the stress they battled during the pandemic.

The research was published in the journal Science Advances.

Adobe released its Acrobat Reader DC app onto the new Windows 11 Microsoft Store.

The app is a full-featured x86 viewer for signing and sharing PDFs.

Acrobat Reader DC is just the latest of many ""classic"" Win32 apps appearing in the new store thanks to Microsoft's relaxed policies.

With Microsoft's new Store for Windows 11 comes looser restrictions on the types of apps allowed to appear. Even though it has only been a few days since the Store went live in the latest Insider preview for Windows 11 several classic apps have already appeared including OBS Studio Zoom Canva Microsoft Edge extensions and WinZip.

Now as spotted on our Discord channel Adobe has brought its full x86 Acrobat Reader DC app to the Microsoft Store.

Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)

Acrobat Reader DC is a free full-featured app for ""viewing printing signing sharing and annotating PDFs"" and is considered the gold standard if you deal a lot with PDFs. While Adobe has other apps like Adobe Reader Touch on the store for Windows 10 it is a bit more basic and much older going back to the Windows 8 days back in 2012.

Even though Acrobat Reader DC goes back years for Adobe it is also regularly updated usually for security and continuous support with the latest appearing on June 8.

Because of how the new Microsoft Store works the version listed is the latest from Adobe as it comes from the company direct. Indeed updates for this app won't go through the Microsoft Store at all. Instead it is all handled via the app as it can ping Adobe's servers just as if you had installed it from their website.

There are still at least four months before Windows 11 is released which leaves plenty of time for even more apps to appear. It'll be interesting to watch to see which other ones show up in the coming weeks.

One day the dream came true and I landed up at Microsoft where I saw much success across many roles. As an alumnus of Sharda University Delhi where I completed my master's degree in marketing I worked at the company for more than two years but as they say destiny had some other plans. Covid struck! The conditions were such that I had to pack my bags and come back to my hometown. During the lockdown the Covid stress took a heavy toll on my body and my mental health. I used to overthink a lot and that used to give me anxiety.

It all started last year during the lockdown. While I was trying to fix myself emotionally a Pakistani drama called ""Alif"" started. It depicted the art of Islamic calligraphy marvellously that it struck me from within. So I thought to myself that why don't I start doing the same as I was fond of Arabic calligraphy since my childhood. So I decided to follow my childhood instincts and translated my passion for art and calligraphy into a commercial venture. I would try my hands to draw lines names phrases initially. I got engrossed in it gradually and found myself at peace. Calligraphy has given me a new lease on life.





Amid the Covid 19 lockdown I couldn't buy the necessary pieces of equipment that this art requires. So I started with a simple pen and paper invested all my time into it the contentment it used to give me was unmeasurable. I'm neither a fine art student nor I had any prior artwork experience it's all self-taught.



My Abu is fond of Arabic calligraphy as well so when I used to make any art during my initial days he used to appreciate and encourage me for my work. It's been more than a year now and I can proudly say I have evolved as an artist. Now I master mandalas coasters leaf calligraphy besides sketching.





It's so important to get virtually connected and recognised by customers on social media platforms. Since I'm a marketing student I know the tools for promotion. What started as a passion has now turned into a business all praises to the Almighty. I don't try to copy anyone; I have my way of presenting art to the audience. I add beautiful colours to the backdrop so that my calligraphy grabs everyone's attention. It's so overwhelming when my customers give me positive reviews and trust my work. Initially I used to do it for free but then I realised people can't value free products. So I started charging. Half of the amount from my art goes to charity.



It's such a thoughtful idea to gift your loved ones a piece of art that has their names written in beautiful calligraphy. Only one piece in the whole wide world and that will last forever.

Almost all people hospitalized for Covid-19 are not vaccinated — 99.9% as of May to be exact according to a recent Associated Press report. Yet 13% of U.S. adults said they will ""definitely not"" get a COVID-19 vaccine as recently as late May according to Kaiser Family Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. Another 12% wanted to ""wait until it has been available for a while to see how it is working for other people."" Vaccinating the majority of the population is the best way to help avoid further surges from constantly evolving variants like the current delta variant which is quickly spreading in the U.S. and other countries. Still Moderna co-founder Noubar Afeyan understands the hesitation to get a new vaccine. ""The vaccines came out in such a [short] timeframe that people assumed automatically it can't possibly be safe"" Afeyan said during a talk at a Solve at Massachusetts Institute of Technology event in May. ""In fact many many people were on television espousing the view that — experts for that matter — that if it's done in less than five years it's got to be unsafe all of which is untrue. ""Nevertheless people get confused."" What people might not understand is that extensive research was being done on mRNA technology and other mRNA vaccines for years. That decade plus of experience and the innovation of mRNA technology itself is what allowed Moderna to produce its Covid mRNA vaccine so quickly as the pandemic struck. And it could also change the future of medicine. Here's what you need to know about how the Moderna Covid-19 mRNA vaccine was developed.

The timeline: A vaccine in under a year

It is true that Moderna's mRNA vaccine was ready remarkably fast as was Pfizer's. Chinese scientists put the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus online on Jan. 11. Over the next two days the NIH and Moderna used it to plot out a vaccine. Afeyan remembers getting a key call about the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. ""January 21st my daughter's birthday.... I got a call from Davos [during The World Economic Forum] from the CEO of Moderna"" he says. Bancel had been approached by a number of public health groups at the conference ""urging"" him to work on a vaccine. ""We literally decided overnight...to try and do this"" Afeyan said at MIT. Moderna delivered the first doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the NIH for testing on Feb. 24 2020 and ""the first Moderna shot went into a volunteer's arm in Seattle on March 16 2020"" according to Afeyan. After testing the Moderna vaccine on 30000 volunteers on Dec. 18 2020 the FDA authorized it for emergency public use and three days after that the first Moderna vaccines were administered to front-line health workers according to Afeyan.

Over a decade of research to innovate mRNA as a 'bioplatform'

One of the reasons Moderna's mRNA Covid vaccine development moved so quickly is because scientists had been working with mRNA for years. ""Messenger RNA technologies have been in development from a basic science perspective for over 15 years"" Kizzmekia Corbet the scientific lead for the Coronavirus Vaccines & Immunopathogenesis Team at NIH who helped make the vaccine possible told the NIH Record. And Moderna has been working with mRNA technology ""since its inception in 2010 for myriad therapeutic areas"" including cancer therapies Afeyan tells CNBC Make It (by way of a spokesperson) and with clinical development of mRNA-based antiviral vaccines since 2015. What Moderna did over many of those years was develop mRNA as what scientists call a bioplatform which allows for speedier vaccine development. Bioplatforms are systems that can easily be scaled and tailored for many different diseases. Traditionally developing any vaccine essentially has been a bespoke effort. ""The benefits of a bioplatform is the ability to quickly redeploy the platform once established and refined — in the case of Moderna's mRNA platform to create and test new vaccines based on new viral sequences"" Afeyan tells CNBC Make It (by way of a spokesperson). All of this makes mRNA vaccines virtually programable. Corbet and Bancel describe the process as ""plug and play."" ""MRNA is always made of four same letters Bancel said on the December Andreessen Horowitz podcast ""Bio Eats the World."" (MRNA is genetic material similar to DNA so its ""code"" is expressed with letters.) It's ""the four letters of life like zeros and one in software"" said Bancel. ""This is like software or LEGO."" ""The only difference between"" mRNA vaccines is ""the order of the letter; the zeroes and ones of life"" Bancel said. ""The manufacturing process is the same the equipment is the same with the same operators. It's the same thing. And so this is why we could go so fast.""

Amex Platinum cards come in several different “flavors”. One of the best is arguably the Morgan Stanley Platinum Card because it offers one authorized user card for free. The authorized user gets many of the same perks as the primary cardholder (see our Platinum guide for a list of perks along with which ones apply to authorized users).

Another benefit available exclusively to Morgan Stanley Platinum cardholders is the $695 Annual Engagement Bonus. Morgan Stanley customers who meet certain requirements get back the card’s $695 annual fee each year. Those requirements used to be very hard to meet. The old requirements were to maintain a minimum of $1000000 in eligible assets and liabilities with Morgan Stanley or have paid at least $10000 in managed fees/commissions. Now as we originally learned from Andy at Deals Points there is a better option…

Morgan Stanley Platinum CashPlus Account

Through Morgan Stanley’s Platinum CashPlus Account you can earn the annual $695 engagement bonus without anything close to a million dollars invested.

The following steps should qualify you for the $695 Annual Engagement Bonus:

Here are a few key considerations:

You must establish your Platinum CashPlus Account before signing up for the Morgan Stanley Platinum card.

signing up for the Morgan Stanley Platinum card. The Platinum CashPlus Account normally costs $45 per month ($55 per month starting 2/1/22). This would wipe out a big portion of the engagement bonus unless you meet the criteria to maintain the CashPlus Account fee free.

Platinum CashPlus Account monthly fees are waived if you maintain the following: $5000 in total monthly deposits AND $25000 in Average Daily Cash Balance (in the Bank Deposit Program) Additional eligible Morgan Stanley investment account (the Access Investing account should qualify) Morgan Stanley Online enrollment

Eligible deposits in order to meet the above $5K per month deposit requirement include: Direct Deposit of payroll Incoming Transfers Mobile Check Deposit Branch Check Deposit Incoming Send Money with Zelle® Incoming Wire Any Social Security Deposit Distributions from a Morgan Stanley Retirement Account



Is it worth it?

Assuming you meet the requirements to keep Platinum CashPlus Account fee free here are the costs involved in earning the $695 Annual Engagement Bonus:

Access Investing account annual fee: 0.35% = $17.50 per year if you maintain exactly $5000 in that account. Then there are also fund-specific fees and expenses. Let’s round up the former and assume the latter is about $30 and call the total $50 per year.

per year. Cost of money for keeping $25K in the Platinum CashPlus Account. The Access Investing account doesn’t earn interest. So the cost here is the opportunity cost of keeping $25K here vs. in a growth account. This cost could vary from almost nothing (which is the current interest rate of most interest bearing checking accounts) to quite a lot if the alternative is investing in the stock market (for example). To come up with an estimate let’s just call this a 1% cost: $250 per year of interest not earned .

. Cost of time for making sure to make $5000 in deposits each month. There must be an easy way to automate this so I’m not going to estimate this cost.

Total estimated cost: $300 per year.

Well… is it worth it?

You can think of the $300 estimated cost as being the cost to get two Morgan Stanley Platinum cards: a primary card and a free authorized user card. Consider that both users get airport lounge access and elite benefits and that the primary user has access to many hundreds of dollars in rebates for airline fees prepaid hotel bookings digital entertainment Uber and more. In my opinion it is definitely worth it.

Brendan McDermid | Reuters

From Krispy Kreme to China's Didi Chuxing the busiest week for U.S. IPOs in 17 years produced a windfall for Wall Street's top investment banks. A cybersecurity company drug developers and a Turkish e-commerce platform were all in on the action. At least 14 companies raised $100 million or more in offerings on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange the most active stretch for debuts since 2004. In total underwriters generated close to $400 million in fees for assisting with the IPOs. They're sitting on an additional $259 million in paper gains as of Friday's close assuming they exercise their options to purchase all of their allotted shares at the IPO discount. The pace of offerings underscores the demand for growth and shows that IPOs remain the preferred route to the market despite the rise of direct listings which have no underwriters and come with much lower advisory fees. It's a highly lucrative business for Wall Street and there's no slowdown in sight.

Robinhood filed its IPO prospectus on Thursday and is poised to be one of the biggest offerings of the year. Surging demand for crypto assets led to a quadrupling in first-quarter revenue to $522 million while the company's loss swelled to $1.4 billion in part because of an emergency fundraise tied to GameStop trading mania. The stock trading app will likely command a premium valuation on the market while simultaneously playing a broader role in the IPO boom by giving retail investors a way to invest in deals that historically targeted big institutions. Robinhood is reserving up to 35% of its IPO shares for customers. ""I think this is going to be one of the greatest meme stocks of the future"" Thomas Peterffy chairman of Interactive Brokers told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""They have negative equity they have roughly zero earnings and they're growing fast. So it's the kind of thing the market seems to like lately. I'm looking forward to them coming into the community bringing more and more people into the market.""

Goldman Morgan JPM the big winners

In the past week's IPOs underwriting fees ranged from 2% of the total amount raised in the case of ride-hailing company Didi's massive financing to 7% for smaller deals like the offerings from health companies CVRx Aerovate Therapeutics and Acumen Pharmaceuticals. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  as usual reeled in the highest fee revenue by serving as the lead managers for the IPOs of Didi and cybersecurity software vendor SentinelOne  the two biggest offerings of the week. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were the lead underwriters in the IPO for Turkish online shopping company D-Market Electronic Service & Trading legal services site LegalZoom and Krispy Kreme which were the week's third- fourth- and fifth-biggest offerings respectively.

In addition to advisory fees underwriters also make money on IPOs by getting the option to buy stock at the offer price so they can benefit from the pop that typically ensues. Not all of last week's offerings had big initial rallies but they all led to gains for the banks that were in position to receive an allocation. Even with Didi's muted gains in its first three days of trading the stock's 11% rise means that underwriters are up $66 million if they exercise their options. The paper gains on SentinelOne sit at $46 million after that stock jumped 27%. Manufacturing marketplace Xometry climbed 58% in three days producing potential gains thus far of $26 million while airport security company CLEAR has delivered an increase of $34 million after jumping 53%. For Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan the record IPO stretch comes a week after the two banks were the leads on the IPOs for health-tech company Doximity and cloud software vendor Confluent . Those two offerings paid combined underwriter fees of $74.7 million and the Doximity deal included stock allocation that's produced $83 million in gains based on the IPO pop. However Confluent took the unusual step of not issuing underwriters the option to buy at the IPO price. The company highlighted the potential significance of that decision in the risk factors section of its prospectus: ""Without this option the underwriters may choose not to engage in certain transactions that stabilize maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our Class A common stock such as short sales stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales to the extent they would have engaged in any such transactions had we granted the underwriters such an option"" Confluent said. Doximity CEO Jeff Tangney told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that while an IPO was the right choice for his company he's glad to see the rise of direct listings and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) as alternatives because the competition is bringing down the costs. Doximity paid a fee of 5.5% of the offer size which is about inline with this year's average but below the top rate of 7%. ""It improved the economics for us"" he said. ""Banks are charging less and doing more which is good.""

Undergraduate School and Degree: Maseno University: Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science; University of Nairobi MSc. in Finance

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? Centum Investment Company Plc Principal

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? Not applicable.

Where will you be working after graduation? Not known yet

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School: I am a member of the Oxford Africa Business Alliance at Oxford Saïd.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? Coming in second in the Morgan Stanley Investment Banking Challenge. I had an absolutely cracking time working with our team of 4 to dissect a packaging business for an LBO and presenting the case to the head of coverage for Morgan Stanley in the U.K. My favourite part of the whole affair was having some black pudding my quintessentially English teammate had made at one of our get-togethers – it was just like being back in Kenya!

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? Co-founding a boutique corporate finance advisory firm in Kenya and subsequently raising millions of dollars in local currency funding for businesses. Kenya has tremendous potential to be an economic powerhouse and it’s been the highlight of my career to actively contribute to the development of a new area of the capital markets industry in the country.

Why did you choose this business school?

Africa Focus – The School has a strong commitment to and focus on Africa. What attracted me to the Oxford MBA is than more than 12% of the cohort every year comes from Africa.

As I am returning to Africa post-MBA it was critical to join a programme that would provide an extensive network in Africa and have dedicated content and electives focused on doing business on the continent.

GOTO – An immersive project that leverages Oxford’s tutorial method to sharpen one’s thinking and analytical skills and applies them to wicked problems. This was extremely important to me as nations across the developing world my home country among them are still at the stage where they’re designing developing or tweaking their fundamental systems. It’s been an invaluable opportunity for me to immerse myself in system level issues. Being at the University of Oxford is also a phenomenal experience in and of itself – my GOTO team will for example be speaking directly with the researchers who created the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Professor Michael Gill: His method of debating cases made the content come alive in an astounding way – you could relate with the challenges faced by decision makers and felt as if you were in the room with them. Even when you knew they were making the wrong call you could see why they did it through their eyes.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? Pre-lockdown – punting on the Thames and hitting the pub afterward!

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? Drawing a blank here – I’d do it just the same!

What is the biggest myth about your school? That it’s a British experience. What I’ve found instead is a global experience from a wonderfully diverse group of students. There’s such a rich mix of perspectives on every issue because we all have different backgrounds it makes discussions incredibly stimulating.

What surprised you the most about business school? How close one can get to people you’ve only known for a few months. I’ve met amazing folks that I’m going to treasure for the rest of my life.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? Speaking with alums to get an insider’s understanding of what makes Saïd different and how to make the most of my time here. It helped me craft compelling essays for the AdCom.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? Shiemaa Ahmed a first-generation graduate from Sudan who won a Skoll Scholarship to attend Oxford. Over and above her day job she co-founded a platform for marketing Sudanese crafts as well as a centre for promoting critical thinking and debates among university and high school students. Her drive and ability to get things done in the face of significant challenges is spectacular.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? Not at all – the school had experience from the previous cohort and have used that to craft how they deliver content during our time here. The lockdowns have been quite sad though.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My first boss who happened to be a Cambridge alum and the smoothest most effective operator I have ever met. His delivery – on time to spec every time – was beyond belief. His ability to take on roles outside his comfort zone and master them is a trait I’ve looked to emulate throughout my career.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Close a billion-dollar transaction

Do deals in all four corners of the continent

What made Dave such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Dave brings a wealth of experience and insight into doing business in Africa. Dave is passionate about growing the private capital markets in Africa. He is applying the business skills he is learning on the MBA programme to fundamentally change the credit landscape in his home country Kenya.

Although the Oxford MBA programme will help support him in his future aims it is more his ability to educate the wider (non-African) network at Oxford Saïd on the opportunities that exist within Africa. By showcasing this to his peers who are a global audience the narrative on how to navigate the challenges and access the opportunities in Africa will be improved for generations to come.”

Shares in Morrisons are expected to surge on Monday following the acceptance of an offer led by the US investment fund Fortress the owner of Majestic Wine. Apollo has appointed the investment bank Morgan Stanley to advise on a potential offer while rival buyout firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) is considering whether to launch a renewed bid after having an offer rejected by the board.

Morrisons which operates 500 stores and employs about 118000 staff in the UK announced on Saturday it would sell to the Fortress-led consortium in a high-stakes deal valuing the company at £6.3bn. Fortress and its partners would also take on debt worth £3.2bn.

After months of secretive talks Fortress made four proposals before its accepted offer reached a total value of 252p a share as well as a 2p cash dividend compared with the retailer’s closing share price on Friday of 240p.

Recommending the offer to shareholders Andrew Higginson the chair of Morrisons said: “The Morrisons directors believe that the offer represents a fair and recommendable price for shareholders which recognises Morrisons’ future prospects.”

But within hours of the announcement details of a potential counter bid from Apollo were revealed in the Sunday Telegraph. It comes after the investment firm was beaten in a race to buy rival supermarket chain Asda earlier this year after it was sold to the billionaire Issa brothers for £6.8bn.

The approved Fortress deal announced on Saturday was the second firm offer for Morrisons dwarfing the £5.5bn bid from CD&R last month which Morrisons directors rejected on 19 June saying it “was far too low”.

Despite all the interested parties remaining tight-lipped on Sunday CD&R which has the former boss of Tesco Sir Terry Leahy as a senior adviser was said by insiders to have “plenty more petrol in the tank”. It believes that some on the Morrisons board would be more amenable to an increased offer. Under UK stock market rules the rival US investment firm has until 17 July to either make a firm offer or walk away.

It raises the prospect of a three-way battle for the company that until recently was regarded as largely unloved by investors although it remains to be seen whether the other interested groups will top the Fortress-led offer.

Supermarkets have looked vulnerable to private bidders in recent months after share price falls stemming from higher costs handling the Covid crisis which cancelled out the benefits from booming sales during lockdowns.

Morrisons is considered attractive because it owns the freehold on about 85% of its properties – including its supermarkets – and for its integrated business approach. It has long-term relationships with its farmers and suppliers as well as its own food manufacturing sites and even its own fishing fleet.

Andrew Gwynn an equity analyst at the financial firm Exane said he believedthe Fortress-led bid had a good chance.

“Fortress doesn’t seem to be proposing any aggressive change with a focus on simply empowering the management team to deliver on their longer-term strategy. The deal is conditional on 75% approval from shareholders. We think that should be achievable at this price range. The deal is very likely to succeed” he said.

Shareholders who are yet to approve the takeover could find their heads turned if another party comes in with a significantly higher offer.

Institutional investor JO Hambro which owns 3% of the supermarket said the Morrisons’ board was correct to reject the initial CD&R offer but indicated it could back a deal at a higher price. “We believe any offer for the group approaching 270p per share merits engagement and consideration” it said just last week. Before bid interest Morrisons had been trading at about 178p a share valuing the firm at about £4.3bn.

Meanwhile farmers groups and the unions have raised the alarm fearing the takeover will be bad news for their members. Morrisons describes itself as “British farming’s ­single biggest customer” and works directly with more than 2200 livestock farmers and 200 growers – some of whom have supplied the company for more than 30 years.

Workers union Unite said it wanted “unbreakable guarantees” on jobs and conditions or it would not cooperate with any sale.

Adrian Jones the national officer for road transport at Unite which represents Morrisons’ warehouse and distribution workers said the company was “unique among UK supermarkets” because it owns its supply chain unlike other supermarkets which rely more on third-party wholesalers.

Labour’s shadow business minister Seema Malhotra said the government must closely scrutinise the takeover bid and called on ministers to work with the consortium to ensure “crucial commitments to protect the workforce and the pension scheme are legally binding and met”.

If the deal goes through the bid for the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket would be the biggest private equity deal since the £11bn takeover of Boots in 2007. Saga the AA and RAC are among the big-name brands that have fallen into the hands of private equity buyers in recent years.

It comes hot on the heels of a takeover of Asda which was backed by private equity group TDR Capital and led by the Issa brothers."

This is as opportune a time as any to ask: what is it about the Pakistani capital markets that keeps some of the country’s biggest most prominent corporate names from becoming publicly listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.

Unlike most other pieces that will address this question this week we decided to use a real case study: Tapal a company that is probably worth a lot of money and by some admittedly aggressive valuation methodologies may even be worth more than $1 billion. (Wait so if we are admitting that Tapal is probably worth less than $1 billion is the headline just clickbait? Yes. Yes it is. But now that we have your attention please do read on.)

What is the story of Tapal and what makes it such an iconic Pakistani brand? What would it be valued at if it decided to list itself on the stock exchange? Why does it choose not to? And how does the decision of companies like Tapal affect Pakistan’s downgrade on the MSCI indices?

The story of Tapal

The tale of this company begins shortly after Partition in Jodia Bazar in Karachi where the Tapal family began their tea business: importing tea from Sri Lanka and then selling it wholesale in the markets in Karachi. Jodia Bazar is to this day one of the largest wholesale markets in Pakistan. It helps that it is located just a few miles from Karachi Port and is located in the city that has the single largest concentration of the Pakistani urban middle class.

The founder of the company was Adam Ali Tapal grandfather of the current CEO Aftab Tapal. The store in Jodia Bazar soon grew as Karachi went from being a relatively minor city in British India to becoming the largest city in Pakistan. The tea business outgrew the store and began marketing itself far beyond the retailers and occasional consumer buyers who would come to the store.

It took Aftab joining the family business in 1975 after having received a foreign education however for Tapal to go from being a thriving mid-sized business to becoming the household brand name it is today. The foreign educated son returning to shake things up in the family business may be a bit of a cliché but sometimes it really is true and it certainly seems to be the case for the Tapal family.

The first thing that Aftab noticed and changed was the packaging. When you are competing against the likes of Unilever with their sophistication and high-quality brand management you should probably start by at least putting your name on your product and then maybe making the packaging more appealing to the consumer.

The company began expanding in all sorts of ways. It set up a massive factory in Korangi one of three major industrial areas in Karachi to set up a packaging plant. Tapal also went beyond the Ceylon tea that was the norm in Pakistan and introduced tea from Kenya. And the company went after both the major segments of the market: the slightly more affluent urban middle class that preferred granular tea and the rural market that could only afford the tea dust.

Tapal began to make a name for itself as the third name that Pakistanis knew of when they thought of tea. Unilever was still the big name with Lipton and then there was the other British company in the tea business: Brooke Bond. For a local company to make its name in that milieu was no mean feat. For them to have continued to hold their ground even after Unilever bought Brooke Bond to become the dominant tea player in Pakistan… well that just takes a lot more than luck. It takes skill and determination.

So how big is Tapal?

In a phrase very big. As of the financial year ending June 30 2020 Tapal had gross revenues just short of Rs56 billion and net revenues (after subtracting trade discounts and sales taxes) of Rs45 billion. This is one of the biggest food and consumer goods companies in Pakistan bigger than many names that are currently publicly listed.

It has also managed to retain a market leading position in a segment that is still dominated by a well-financed foreign incumbent with all the capital and financial muscle it takes to stay number one. And did we mention that it has managed to not just grow its revenue at a healthy pace but also increase its profit margins?

Gross margins have gone from as low as 11.5% in 2010 to around 24% for the past five years meaning that even in as commoditised a market as tea Tapal’s brand name ensures that it can command hefty margins. This is especially impressive when one considers the fact that the tea is imported meaning that the volatility of the rupee is a significant factor that could easily dampen the company’s pricing power.

That does not mean that the company’s product is something people are willing to pay for even when prices rise sharply. Intuitively it makes sense though. Tea is something most Pakistani adults consume every day and for something in such daily use you want to trust the quality of the product you will be consuming. Tapal’s brand gives them that trust.

One other factor that makes Tapal’s achievement even more impressive: tea used to be categorized by the government as an essential food item and subjected to minimal sales taxes. However since 2017 tea has been subjected to a full sales tax regime. To have your core product go from facing very little in terms of sales taxes to suddenly having to pay full sales taxes – when you have several informal sector competitors who evade sales taxes – makes the company’s ability to command high margins even more impressive.

Brand-building however is not all there is to running a successful business. There are operations supply chains distribution and administrative costs all of which can start rising rapidly if a business is not managing a tight ship. On that front too Tapal appears to be a well-run company.

Operating margins – what is left over after a company is done paying its suppliers all employees all rent utilities and other expenses – went from a low of 3.2% of net revenues in 2010 to 14.1% in 2020 and have been consistently above double digits for most of the past decade. Tapal is not just a recognizable consumer brand: it is a well-run business that is able to not just maintain its profitability but grow it as it achieves economies of scale.

If this was a company that was looking for outside investors it would find them quite easily.

What is Tapal worth?

We want to state categorically: we have absolutely no reason to believe that Tapal is seeking an initial public offering or an equity sale of any kind. Owing to timing issues we were not able to speak to the company’s management ahead of the publication of this story but Profit is not in any way implying that Tapal either needs the equity investment or wants it. They most certainly do not as far as we are aware.

The point of even asking this question is to explore just how valuable one of Pakistan’s best-run private companies could be as a means of commenting on what is available to public equity investors versus what could be available to investors if the market were deeper and better functioning. With those caveats aside let us dig into our rudimentary valuation for Tapal.

To conduct a valuation of Tapal we looked at its financial metrics – revenue profits etc. – and compared them to those of publicly listed food and tobacco companies of a comparable size. We compiled a list of nine publicly listed companies that appear to be most directly comparable in terms of size. They were Pakistan Tobacco Company Nestle Pakistan Unilever Pakistan Foods Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan Rafhan Maize Products Philip Morris Pakistan Unity Foods National Foods and Ismail Industries.

In an ideal situation we would have had a tea company to compare directly but Pakistan’s economy is too small and has too few players in most markets for that to be available let alone having a directly comparable publicly listed competitor. The broader category is the best we could do and for the purposes of this analysis that is probably good enough.

We then looked at those nine companies across five valuation multiples:

Enterprise value to revenue (EV / Sales)

Enterprise value to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EV / EBITDA)

Enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes (EV / EBIT)

Price to earnings (P / E)

Price to book value (P / B)

We looked at the valuation of each of these companies based on those metrics as of their publicly traded prices at the close of trading on June 26 2021. We then compiled the average for the nine companies in question and then applied that average multiple to the relevant financial metric for Tapal from financial year 2020 to arrive at an estimated valuation for Tapal.

Like any valuation exercise we got a range of values. The lowest was on the basis of EV / Sales where the peer group had an average enterprise value multiple of 2.6 times most recent 12-months revenue. By that metric Tapal is worth approximately $556 million. The highest was through price-to-book value where the peer group multiple was 9.48 times book value which resulted in a valuation for Tapal of $1 billion.

If Tapal were to list itself on the public markets it would likely find its valuation somewhere between those two numbers. It would be one of the most valuable companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange and the third most valuable food and consumer goods company behind only Pakistan Tobacco and Nestle Pakistan. (Yes it would probably be worth a bit more than Unilever Pakistan Foods and Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan.)

So is Tapal worth $1 billion? Probably not but it is close enough to where it will probably cross that threshold within the next three to five years.

The chicken-and-egg problem

So why even talk about the valuation of a company that has no intention of ever being listed publicly or even being sold to other private investors?

Because it represents a core problem that Pakistan’s equity markets face: some of the most attractive businesses in Pakistan remain private and have no intention of ever being publicly listed. And even those that do become publicly listed tend to remain closely held which means there is often not enough trading volume in those stocks for investors who may want to buy their shares.

It becomes a chicken-and-egg problem: global investors have limited interest in Pakistan because so few of the most promising investments in the country are publicly listed and so few of them are publicly listed because not enough investors want to come into the market meaning that the companies that do consider getting themselves publicly listed do not get attractive enough prices to come to market.

Tapal for instance is a cash-rich company. Let us assume the hypothetical scenario in which they do decide to come to the market and list 20% of the company’s shares on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Assume for a minute that the valuation they receive is around $750 million. So in order to sell 20% of those shares they would get $150 million.

That seems promising enough until you realise that Tapal has very little debt on its balance sheet and that they could raise an equivalent amount in loans from banks while giving away 0% of their ownership. To entice them into the market the price they would have to receive from it would have to be quite attractive. But in order for that to happen there would need to be a bidding war for Tapal shares which means that those with big cheques to write – the international investors – would need to be interested.

In order for enough of them to be interested in Tapal however they would first need to be interested in the Pakistani market but because so many companies like Tapal are not listed (and very few interesting companies are publicly listed) most of the big-cheque international investors stay away.

You see the circularity of the problem?

The index downgrade

This is a problem that came to the fore over the past couple of weeks when the world’s leading equity investing benchmark provider – MSCI Inc. (formerly known as Morgan Stanley Capital International) – announced that it was reviewing Pakistan’s place in its widely followed Emerging Markets index and will downgrade Pakistan to the lower-prestige (and much less followed) Frontier Markets index.

What does all of that mean? Briefly investment management companies all around the world that invest in global stocks tend to use the MSCI indices as benchmarks against which to compare their performance. Each country has its own market index but if you invest outside your own country especially if you invest across multiple countries you probably use the MSCI indices as your benchmark.

Why does this matter for Pakistan? Because nearly all of the international investors who invest in Pakistan are the ones who create multi-country investing portfolios and therefore utilise the MSCI indices as their benchmarks. That means that if MSCI suddenly decides that a country no longer falls into one index investors who benchmark themselves against that index no longer feel the need to buy stocks in that country. Indeed they may actively seek to sell what they do own there.

Why is the Emerging Markets index a bigger deal than the Frontier Markets index? Let us give you a very simple set of data that will answer that question. There are currently $14.5 trillion worth of assets that use the MSCI indices as their benchmarks. Most of those track developed markets but about $1.8 trillion of that tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets indices. The equivalent number for the MSCI Frontier Markets index? About $20 billion.

The downgrade in other words matters quite a bit. And embarrassingly for Pakistan this is not the first time that Pakistan has been downgraded from the Emerging Markets index to the Frontier Markets index. MSCI first started including Pakistan in its indices in 1993 and included Pakistan in the Emerging Markets Index in 1994. However after the Karachi Stock Exchange stupidly decided to effectively shut down in August 2008 in the face of a market crash MSCI kicked out Pakistan from its Emerging Markets index in December 2008.

It took nearly a full decade of effort by Pakistan’s capital markets professionals but by June 2017 MSCI was willing to reclassify Pakistan into the Emerging Markets index. Now however it looks like Pakistan’s place in the Emerging Markets index will be short-lived and the country may get kicked out as soon as September of this year.

The better index?

The downgrade is certainly bad but there are those who believe there is an upside to this. The most sophisticated of these is Mattias Martinsson chief investment officer of Tundra Fonder the Stockholm-based investment management company that is one of only a handful that operates a Pakistan-specific fund.

In a note he published on LinkedIn Martinsson argued: “Personally I think it is a good idea. At 2 bps (0.02%) of MSCI EM Pakistan will continue to be ignored. The theoretical weight in MSCI FM would be 2% but Pakistan would probably become a 6-10% weight given its current liquidity and the theme it represents.”

He went on to suggest that the EM index is too China-dominated for any of the smaller countries to get any interest from global investors.

“Since 2010 China’s weight in MSCI EM has gone from 15% to 40% killing the interest for smaller emerging markets. Today four markets (China Taiwan South Korea and India) make up more than 80% of MSCI EM. The fifth largest market (Brazil) stands at just above 5%. For the active managers generating 6% alpha from the top four is equal to generating 30% on average from the remaining 28 markets. It is a no-brainer where they should focus. Smaller EMs like Philippines Indonesia Egypt etc are forgotten. The fact that index funds have become significantly more popular has of course aggravated the focus on the large EMs further. Neither actively managed funds nor index funds (for more obvious reasons) have incentives to become experts in small emerging markets.”

He certainly has the numbers on his side. Even if you look at just the index values alone the Frontier Markets index looks more attractive for Pakistan. At 0.02% of an index tracked by $1.8 trillion in assets Pakistan’s share of those assets comes out to a paltry $360 million. MSCI however said that if Pakistan moves to the Frontier Markets index its share of that would be 5.8%. Assume that only $20 billion track the MSCI Frontier Markets index that puts Pakistan’s share of the global index-linked investing market about $1.16 billion or about 3.2 times higher.

So what is better? What would entice companies like Tapal to list themselves on the market? The specialist investors who manage those Frontier Markets funds would certainly appreciate it more and they can clearly allocate more of their money towards Pakistan to justify a good price.

But ultimately it will take the trillions sitting in Emerging Markets funds and beyond to get that bidding war going that will offer the truly attractive price to Tapal. The solution then is to not just make it into the Emerging Markets index but also have a reasonable weight there. But for that we would first have to stay in the index and for now that looks increasingly difficult.",,,,,,,,,

And there's considerable fear among investors that we could see a recession in the not-too-distant future if interest rates rise and consumer spending slows. So where should you put your money to prepare?

In this Fool Live video clip recorded on June 21 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP and Industry Focus host Jason Moser discuss how bank stocks typically perform in inflationary environments as well as during recessions.

10 stocks we like better than Bank of America

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7 2021

Matt Frankel: TMF New Fool says ""What's the best kind of investment that I can make to hedge myself against inflation and/or recession? Are financial stocks a good way to go about it? I'm thinking Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Chase (NYSE: JPM) Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). Also is it a good time to invest in these stocks or are they too expensive right now?""

No one can tell you if they're too expensive right now. If you ask Jason and I what bank stocks are going to do over the next couple of weeks you'll get two different answers and they'll probably both be wrong. I see a piano I don't see a crystal ball back behind Jason. But generally speaking financial stocks are good ways to hedge against inflation if inflation doesn't get out of control.

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If inflation gets to the point where the Fed has to raise rates a few times that usually trickles down into higher rates on mortgages credit cards auto loans things like that for the banks. All three of the ones you mentioned have big credit card operations which are directly tied to the federal funds rate.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If the Fed hikes rates by 50 basis points credit card interest rates go by exactly 50 basis points. They make more money during mildly inflationary environments not when inflation gets out of control and people can't afford things and there's a lot of uncertainty. Then consumer demand falls and it's not good. It's really a fine line but banks tend to do well in mildly inflationary environments.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: As far as recessions go banks are bad investments. Banks are very cyclical in that sense in terms of -- you'll see housing demand drop you'll see auto loan demand drop dramatically. You'll see defaults increase dramatically during recessions. Banks can be bad investments during recessions which is why they plunged so badly during the first part of the COVID pandemic. A lot of those normal recessionary things like lower loan demand like higher defaults -- people feared that those are really going to hit it. In terms of inflation I would say yes but with a caveat. Recession I would say financials are a no. If you want recession-proof -- utility things that people will buy no matter what the economy is doing Apple.

Moser: What do you think about insurance in a time like that?

Frankel: Sure. Yeah. One of the reason Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) works in a recessionary environment. Geico -- people keep paying their auto insurance no matter what.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- people buy their iPhones no matter what the economy is doing.

Moser: Yeah. You're right. They do. The neat thing is they've come up with creative ways to finance those purchases. Like it's not just ""OK pay me $950 or pay me $1100.""

Frankel: Right. They are going to keep innovating with that.

Moser: Yeah exactly.

Frankel: Anything that sells things at a discounted nature is a good thing in a recession. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) -- Walmart was one of the very few stocks that actually went up in 2008 and it's because in tough times Walmart still has its loyal customer base that goes there because they have lower prices. But then people who normally shop at higher-end grocery stores who need to cut back will go to Walmart in tougher times. So they actually benefit in tougher times. Dollar stores are another one. Convenience stores things like that that people need -- those can actually benefit during tough times. But banks are not the best during recessions.

ISTANBUL

Shares of D-Market Electronic Services and Trading also known as Hepsiburada rose nearly 12 percent in their U.S. stock market debut on Thursday giving the Turkish e-commerce platform a market value of $4.38 billion.

Hepsiburada’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) opened at $12.75 and closed the day at $13.43 above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $12 per ADS. Hepsiburada the first Turkish company listed on the Nasdaq exchange sold 56.7 million ADS earlier in the day to raise more than $680 million with existing shareholders putting up a little over 15 million of the shares on offer. Founded in 2000 Hepsiburada operates online platforms on which consumers can order items ranging from groceries and essentials to airline tickets.

The company launched its marketplace in 2015 and has an in-house logistics network touting that 64 percent of its orders are delivered the next-day. With 9 million active customers Hepsiburada’s revenue and gross merchandise value which refers to the total value of products sold more than doubled in 2020 compared with a year earlier a regulatory filing showed. “Turkish e-commerce is at an inflection point and we have ambitious plans to continue leading digitalization of commerce. Our story resonated with international investors” Hepsiburada’s founder and Chairwoman Hanzade Doğan Boyner told Reuters.

The company plans to use the proceeds to invest in logistic infrastructure as well as expand in new initiatives including grocery delivery and digital payment services. Its gross merchandise value a benchmark of trade on its marketplace rocketed 89 percent to 17 billion Turkish Liras ($1.96 billion) last year.

The Doğan family holds 65.4 percent and Franklin Templeton’s stake was reduced to 14.6 percent after the listing. Hepsiburada entered the U.S. stock market in one of 2021’s busiest weeks for market debuts. Chinese ride hailing company Didi Global Inc’s debut on June 30 marked the biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese company since 2014. Morgan Stanley J.P. Morgan Goldman Sachs BofA Securities and UBS Securities were the underwriters for Hepsiburada’s offering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkL29uY29sb2d5LWluc3RpdHV0ZS0xYi1zcGFjLW9mZmVyaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oncology Institute Plans $1 Billion SPAC Offering,"Cerritos-based cancer treatment company Oncology Institute of Hope & Innovation announced June 29 that it intends to go public through a SPAC affiliated with New York health care-focused investment company Deerfield Management Co.

The deal is valued at $1.06 billion with a valuation of $842 million assigned to the Oncology Institute.

About $230 million will be held in a trust account managed by the SPAC known as DFP Healthcare Acquisitions Corp. And a group of health care investors including Deerfield and Fidelity Management & Research Co. have committed to purchase $275 million worth of shares through a private placement in a public entity or PIPE.

The deal is expected to close late in the third or fourth quarter with the issuance of about 106 million shares of common stock valued at $10 per share. DFP expects to be renamed the Oncology Institute and will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol TOI.

At that point the current equity holders of the Oncology Institute are expected to collectively own 48% of the new publicly traded entity. DFP stockholders (including the PIPE investors) will hold about 33%; Deerfield will have about 14%; and an individual investor sponsor of the SPAC Richard Barasch will have about 5%.

The Oncology Institute was founded in 2007 in Cerritos as a for-profit cancer treatment practice focused on patients in nearby communities. The idea is to provide a “one-stop shop” for cancer treatment through acquisitions and affiliations with existing cancer treatment practices.

The institute uses a for-profit “value-based” business model reducing incentives to prescribe high-cost chemotherapy drugs through the use of less expensive generics from an on-site dispensary and performing cancer therapy sessions in an outpatient setting wherever possible.

“By focusing on individualized care plans evidence-based medicine and great symptom control TOI patients can achieve better outcomes with reduced financial burden” Chief Executive Brad Hively said in the announcement.

“Traditional fee-for-service payment models emphasize quantity over quality of care without considering patient wellness and satisfaction as metrics of success” Hively added. “We are committed to applying the principles of value-based care to simultaneously enhance quality and manage costs.”

Over the last decade the institute has grown primarily through acquisitions of other cancer treatment practices into a multistate operation. Today it has more than 80 oncology-focused medical practitioners including physicians and nurses and roughly 600 employees spread across more than 50 clinics in California Nevada Arizona and Florida.

The institute recorded revenue of about $188 million last year according to a company spokesman.

Through the SPAC transaction the Oncology Institute is slated to receive about $225 million to use for future growth initiatives.

“Our proposed combination with DFP brings us significantly closer to expanding our presence across the United States and advancing our efforts to rebuild the nation’s health care system” Hively said.

Speaking from an investor’s standpoint Barash characterized the Oncology Institute as disrupting the status quo in cancer care.

“Brad (Hively) and his team have created a scalable replicable model with difficult-to-

duplicate capabilities that facilitate rapid expansion” Barash said. “We believe that their high-touch data-driven approach to cancer care represents the model of the future. This business combination will create a well-capitalized company that is poised to expand organically through accretive M&A activity and via strategic payor relationships.”",,,,,,

This was stated by senior officials of Kashmir Agriculture Department during the visit of Vivek Agarwal Additional Secretary Union Ministry of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare to the Potato Seed Multiplication Farm at Yarikha Tangmarg on Friday.

During the visit the Additional Secretary inspected different sections of the farm and interacted with the concerned officers and technical experts about the working of the unit.

Director Agriculture Mohammad Iqbal briefed the senior official regarding the activities being carried out in the farm for propagation of virus free seed tubers. He said that unique climatic conditions in the Valley offer a good opportunity for propagating virus free potato seeds.

The department has also embarked on the principle of 'one farm one/two products' as per the suitability and technical parameters like soil texture soil health and irrigation status of the farms.

While appreciating work done by the local authorities the Additional Secretary highlighted the importance of latest technological interventions during the production of potato seed tubers. He asked to put in all the efforts for a successful cropping season so that the Union Territory could not only become self-reliant in terms of potato seed requirement but should also be in a position to export seed to other parts of the country.

Regarding the issue of availability of breeder seeds the Additional Secretary assured that the matter would be taken up with Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR).

A delegation of progressive farmers and potato growers of Tangmarg and adjoining areas also held a detailed interaction with the senior officials during the visit. They expressed gratitude for various initiatives and farmer-friendly schemes launched by the Indian government for welfare and uplift of the farming community.

Later Agarwal also visited the Potato Seed Multiplication Farm in Gulmarg and took a review of activities being taken up there.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them is The Tomorrow War which is basically what you’d get if Avengers: Endgame and 12 Strong produced a cinematic love child. Then there’s No Sudden Move a new Steven Soderbergh crime drama on HBO Max and of course the awards-chasing sequel to 2017’s The Boss Baby arriving on Peacock  Comcast's own streaming service.

Below we round up seven of the biggest movies and TV shows now the weekend's kicked off – from brand new horror flicks to adult comedy series.

The Tomorrow War (Amazon Prime Video)

With Jurassic World: Dominion and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 not set to grace our screens until 2022 and 2023 respectively The Tomorrow War arrives on Amazon Prime as this year’s helping of Chris Pratt wisecracking-while-blowing-stuff-up.

The streamer reportedly purchased the rights to this sci-fi action adventure – which follows a group of soldiers and civilians transported 30 years into the future to fight against a deadly alien species – from Paramount for $200 million. Chris McKay architect of the surprisingly-competent Lego movies directs while J.K. Simmons Betty Gilpin and Sam Richardson also star.

Don’t expect a particularly thoughtful adventure but The Tomorrow War looks to be the first gung-ho blockbuster of the summer.

No Sudden Move (HBO Max)

Steven Soderbergh acclaimed director of Contagion Traffic and the Ocean’s franchise returns to the big (or small?) screen this weekend with No Sudden Move on HBO Max.

The movie follows a group of small-time criminals hired to steal an emerging car technology in 1950’s Detroit. When their plan goes inevitably wrong the gang embark on a twisting search to find who they were working for. That doesn’t sound like the most engaging premise of all time but with a cast that includes Don Cheadle Benicio del Toro David Harbour Ray Liotta Jon Hamm and even Brendan Fraser we’re inclined to take notice of No Sudden Move.

Critical consensus has been largely positive so far too so this one is definitely worth checking out. Sadly we're not sure how UK viewers will get to watch it.

America: The Motion Picture (Netflix)

Just when we thought we had enough adult animated comedies to last a lifetime America: The Motion Picture arrives on Netflix to tell a wildly inaccurate and expletive-laden tale of America's founding.

Archer’s Matt Thompson directs while Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) are on hand as producers. The voice cast is pretty impressive too enlisting the vocal services of Channing Tatum Simon Pegg Jason Mantzoukas Bobby Moynihan Andy Samberg Judy Greer and many many others.

That’s a lot of high-profile comedians – so America: The Motion Picture must at least be funny right?

Fear Street Part 1: 1994 (Netflix)

The first of a three-part series of feature-length R. L. Stine (Goosebumps) adaptations Fear Street Part 1: 1994 follows a group of teens who take on an evil force that’s plagued their town for centuries. Yes that sounds exactly like the plot of Stephen King’s It but there are no clowns here – just a lot of murderous psychopaths in skull masks.

Leigh Janiak directs all three films which are streaming on consecutive Fridays and explicitly aimed at adult audiences so expect more blood gore and profanity than the relatively tame Stine adaptations of years gone by.

Critics seem in agreement that this first effort is a decent watch with one outlet describing Fear Street Part 1: 1994 as a “marvelously entertaining throwback slasher.”

Summer of Soul (...or When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) (Hulu)

This one’s a mouthful so we’ll only write it once: Summer of Soul (...or When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) is a musical documentary charting the impact of 1969’s Harlem Cultural Festival which saw the likes of Stevie Wonder Nina Simone and B.B. King grace the stage in – you guessed it – a summer of soul.

Reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this one especially after it scooped both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Summer of Soul is streaming on Hulu in the US but is also playing in select theaters across the UK as of early July.

Expect heaps of previously unseen footage and a healthy dose of feel-good nostalgia.

The Boss Baby: Family Business (Peacock)

Obviously we’ve all been anxiously waiting for the return of Alec Baldwin’s quick-witted Boss Baby and thankfully The Boss Baby: Family Business lands on Peacock this weekend to abate our lust for animated corporate jargon.

In all fairness though the first Boss Baby movie was actually surprisingly funny and with the vocal additions of James Marsden Amy Sedaris and Jeff Goldblum alongside the returning Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow its sequel may actually be a laugh too. This time around with Theodore Templeton now an adult he and his brother discover a magical formula that transforms them back into babies to foil the plans of an evil toddler-corrupting genius.

It’s dropping on Comcast’s new Peacock streaming service in the US but will also be arriving in theaters across the UK in July.

We The People (Netflix)

From Barack and Michelle Obama this series of ten animated three-minute music videos aims to teach lessons in civic participation – from voting and paying taxes to knowing your rights – in a way that’s engaging digestible and ultimately cool.

Artists including Lin-Manuel Miranda Janelle Monae Adam Lambert H.E.R. Cordae and Bebe Rexha are all on hand to make the boring stuff seem not-so-boring and even if you’re already well versed in your civic duties We The People might provide you with some new favorite tunes instead.

Blame it on Google,"Here’s the scenario. You were enjoying Netflix and other streaming services with Firefox on your 32-bit Linux system. But all of a sudden Netflix just stopped working.

You updated the Firefox browser made sure that DRM is enabled in Firefox all media codecs have been installed and yet it doesn’t work.

Don’t blame Firefox for this problem. Don’t blame Linux for this problem. Blame Google.

Google killed Widevine support for 32-bit Linux systems

A little technical background for your understanding.

You can play Netflix in Firefox on Linux thanks to a proprietary solution ‘Widevine‘ from Google. It is a free to use but not open source project. It enables the playback of DRM protected streaming contents.

Firefox does not come preinstalled with Widevine. However you can install the Widevine plugin to play DRM protected content from Netflix Spotify Prime Video and other streaming sites.

Google ended Widevine support for 32-bit Linux on May 31 2021.

And that’s what caused problems for the handful of users who are still rocking an older computers with 32-bit Linux distributions.

When the browser was updated Widevine support was pulled out. Even though it shows that DRM is still enabled in the browser the plugin won’t work.

And this means no Netflix on 32-bit Linux systems. At this time I do not know if you can play Netflix on a 32-bit Windows or not.

No open source solution in sight

If Widevine were open source it would have been easier for knowledgeable and enthusiastic developers to fork it and continue the support for 32-bit systems.

But since it is proprietary the control is in Google’s hands. And by the looks of it they are neither going to bring back the 32-bit support nor they are going to open source Widevine.

I looked on the internet for an open source alternative library for Widevine that could allow DRM protected streaming but my search ended in disappointment.

It is sad to see that a huge and rich organization like Google won’t put resources on supporting older technology.

But this is the same Google who despite all its engineering might cannot fix the problem of purchased HD movies playing in standard resolution. Yes that’s true. If you rent a HD movie on YouTube it plays the movies in 480p on the desktop browser. The same rented movie will play in full HD on mobile Chromecast Android TV or gaming consoles. And this issue has not been fixed in months despite being in Google’s knowledge.

Anyway. If you are impacted by this Widevine issue I feel for you. Let’s see if an alternate comes up but don’t keep your hopes high.

Wimp 2 Warrior CEO and co-founder Nick Langton said that if not for the pandemic the business would have hit eight figures of revenue in 2020.

“This fresh capital will be used to accelerate the build of our technology super-charge our global growth and attract some of the world’s best executives to take us into the next phase of our development” he said.

“I believe that the most valuable company in the combat sports ecosystem will be the one that converts fandom into participation. Our mission is to do just that by becoming the end-to-end platform for combat sports academies to connect with and monetise MMA fans globally.”

Former Winning Group tech executive James Fleet has signed on as chief technology officer to manage the global roll-out of the platform technology in 140-plus participating gyms in nine countries including Australia the UK and USA.

There are more than three natural oil well reserve points in the Cachar Paper Mill Township and the land area is reportedly in a lease rent agreement with ONGC the Joint Action Committee of Recognised Unions (JACRU) said in a recent letter to liquidator Kuldeep Verma.

The valuation of oil reserves that is termed as 'liquid gold' has ""surprisingly"" not been disclosed anywhere in the auction notification and only the land area has been detailed the letter also addressed to the secretary of Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises pointed out.

It urged the liquidator to disclose the total volume of natural oil/gas available at the Cachar Paper Mills land area the quantum of valuation of the land and the criterion adopted to fix the price.

The unions also asked Verma to clarify the period of the lease rent agreement with ONGC and the fate of the land if the same is auctioned without adding the value of the existing oil reserves.

""As land having oil reserves is precious and a national property we request you to disclose the details prior to selling the land to any third party"" the letter said.

The issues raised require immediate intervention prior to sale of the assets it added.

The two mills - Cachar Paper Mills at Panchgram in Hailakandi district and Nagaon Paper Mills at Jagiroad in Morigaon district - both units of HPCL - have been non- functional since October 2015 and March 2017 respectively.

Representatives of JACRU had recently met the chief minister and urged him to help revive the two units and clear dues of the employees.

In June 2018 the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016 against HPCL which had earlier submitted a Rs 1995- crore revival proposal to the government.

However after several rounds of meetings among all stakeholders and a number of hearings the NCLT on April 26 this year ordered the liquidator to sell HPCL.

Accordingly the HPCL liquidator had on June 1 issued advertisements in newspapers seeking bids for e-auction of the two units.

Days after prospective bidders showed no interest in buying the defunct mills the liquidator had invited fresh bids on June 22 after bringing down the reserve price to Rs 969 crore from Rs 1139 crore.

The last date for receiving bids is July 6 and the e- auction is slated to be held on July 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L2JveGluZy9hbnRob255LW11bmRpbmUtcG9zdHMtYW5vdGhlci1hbnRpY292aWQxOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1yYW50L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvZTVkMzllMGJhOTgyOGQxMmJmNDE5M2FhZmJlNTdjZDPSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS9ib3hpbmcvYW50aG9ueS1tdW5kaW5lLXBvc3RzLWFub3RoZXItYW50aWNvdmlkMTktdmFjY2luYXRpb24tcmFudC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2U1ZDM5ZTBiYTk4MjhkMTJiZjQxOTNhYWZiZTU3Y2Qz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mundine launches another outrageous rant against ‘death wish’ Covid vaccines,"Anthony Mundine has posted another anti-Covid-19 vaccination message to his Facebook page. (Photo: NCA NewsWire / Jenny Evans)

Australian boxing legend Anthony Mundine has launched a stunning anti-vax tirade on social media urging his followers not to get the Covid-19 vaccination.

In an expletive-laden Facebook post Mundine strongly encouraged his fans to avoid receiving any vaccinations for Covid-19 suggesting a jab is a “death wish”.

Watch Tim Tszyu v Stevie Spark on Main Event available on Foxtel and Kayo Wednesday 7 July at 7pm AEST. ORDER NOW >

“My people don’t get conned in getting the shot!” he posted on Saturday.

“Do your research it’s a death wish!

“F*** the travel for now we fight that s*** in court it’s all fear mongering.

“Those who already got it don’t get another one & look to get the antidote suramin (African root) !!!”.

Mundine’s plea to his social media followers goes against all recommended health advice with medical professionals urging people to get vaccinated when they can.

Mundine followed it up by sharing a conspiracy-laden video which claims the pandemic is ‘fake’ and a deliberate genocidal plot from governments around the world.

“For you sheep watch this ! & open your eyes” Mundine wrote when sharing the video.

It’s the third time this year Mundine has spoken out strongly against Australia’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout.

In May the 46-year-old shared a bizarre post to his Facebook page calling on his followers to “do your research” about the coronavirus.

Veteran broadcaster Ray Hadley blasted Mundine for calling the Covid-19 vaccine rollout “blatant genocide” and suggesting there are “evil plans” in place to enforce global depopulation — while offering no proof to back up his outrageous claims.

Mundine claimed without any supporting evidence whatsoever the vaccine paralyses the body’s immune system. In actuality vaccines work by training the immune system to fight diseases.

“You take the shot then you will have serious health problems even death!” Mundine wrote at the time.

“In the past I’ve ignored your rantings … because I think at the base of it you’re not a bad person. But this irresponsible stupidity that you’re now posting can cause great concern for people” Hadley said.

“Anthony I’ll take my medical advice from professors and doctors not you.

“You read that somewhere on the internet did you Anthony? Or did someone read it to you?

“It’s just mind-boggling that a young man who’s reasonably intelligent one would hope could come out with such unadulterated bulls**t. Because that’s exactly what it is.”

The government’s handling of Australia’s vaccine rollout has come under fire for not matching the speed and efficiency of other vaccination efforts around the world.

In April Prime Minister Scott Morrison scrapped plans to announce a new deadline to vaccinate all Australians by the end of the year against Covid-19 in an admission over the “uncertainties” surrounding the program.

Vaccination efforts have also been complicated by a small number of cases of people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine developing blood clots. Around four to six people out of every million suffered the rare illness after receiving the AstraZeneca shot.

The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) subsequently advised everyone under the age of 50 to receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca shot.

More than 200000 Australians have participated in feeding back data on the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Some 51.8 per cent of respondents reported some kind of adverse reaction but only 1.2 per cent experienced reactions serious enough for them to seek medical attention.

Mundine retired from professional boxing following a first-round knockout defeat against Michael Zerafa in March.

The former rugby league star was an embarrassment in his final fight failing to lay a glove on Zerafa and being knocked down twice in two minutes.

Mundine had won just one fight since 2014 and lost five of his final six bouts taking his official record to 48-11.

The former world champion had “retired” several times before most notably after his brutal loss to Jeff Horn three years ago."

There are more than three natural oil well reserve points in the Cachar Paper Mill Township and the land area is reportedly in a lease rent agreement with ONGC the Joint Action Committee of Recognised Unions (JACRU) said in a recent letter to liquidator Kuldeep Verma.

The valuation of oil reserves that is termed as 'liquid gold' has ""surprisingly"" not been disclosed anywhere in the auction notification and only the land area has been detailed the letter also addressed to the secretary of Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises pointed out.

It urged the liquidator to disclose the total volume of natural oil/gas available at the Cachar Paper Mills land area the quantum of valuation of the land and the criterion adopted to fix the price.

The unions also asked Verma to clarify the period of the lease rent agreement with ONGC and the fate of the land if the same is auctioned without adding the value of the existing oil reserves.

""As land having oil reserves is precious and a national property we request you to disclose the details prior to selling the land to any third party"" the letter said.

The issues raised require immediate intervention prior to sale of the assets it added.

The two mills - Cachar Paper Mills at Panchgram in Hailakandi district and Nagaon Paper Mills at Jagiroad in Morigaon district - both units of HPCL - have been non- functional since October 2015 and March 2017 respectively.

Representatives of JACRU had recently met the chief minister and urged him to help revive the two units and clear dues of the employees.

In June 2018 the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016 against HPCL which had earlier submitted a Rs 1995- crore revival proposal to the government.

However after several rounds of meetings among all stakeholders and a number of hearings the NCLT on April 26 this year ordered the liquidator to sell HPCL.

Accordingly the HPCL liquidator had on June 1 issued advertisements in newspapers seeking bids for e-auction of the two units.

Days after prospective bidders showed no interest in buying the defunct mills the liquidator had invited fresh bids on June 22 after bringing down the reserve price to Rs 969 crore from Rs 1139 crore.

The last date for receiving bids is July 6 and the e- auction is slated to be held on July 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hzcG9ydHMuY29tLmF1L2JveGluZy9hbnRob255LW11bmRpbmUtcG9zdHMtYW5vdGhlci1hbnRpY292aWQxOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1yYW50L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvZTVkMzllMGJhOTgyOGQxMmJmNDE5M2FhZmJlNTdjZDPSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94c3BvcnRzLmNvbS5hdS9ib3hpbmcvYW50aG9ueS1tdW5kaW5lLXBvc3RzLWFub3RoZXItYW50aWNvdmlkMTktdmFjY2luYXRpb24tcmFudC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5L2U1ZDM5ZTBiYTk4MjhkMTJiZjQxOTNhYWZiZTU3Y2Qz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mundine launches another outrageous rant against ‘death wish’ Covid vaccines,"Anthony Mundine has posted another anti-Covid-19 vaccination message to his Facebook page. (Photo: NCA NewsWire / Jenny Evans)

Australian boxing legend Anthony Mundine has launched a stunning anti-vax tirade on social media urging his followers not to get the Covid-19 vaccination.

In an expletive-laden Facebook post Mundine strongly encouraged his fans to avoid receiving any vaccinations for Covid-19 suggesting a jab is a “death wish”.

Watch Tim Tszyu v Stevie Spark on Main Event available on Foxtel and Kayo Wednesday 7 July at 7pm AEST. ORDER NOW >

“My people don’t get conned in getting the shot!” he posted on Saturday.

“Do your research it’s a death wish!

“F*** the travel for now we fight that s*** in court it’s all fear mongering.

“Those who already got it don’t get another one & look to get the antidote suramin (African root) !!!”.

Mundine’s plea to his social media followers goes against all recommended health advice with medical professionals urging people to get vaccinated when they can.

Mundine followed it up by sharing a conspiracy-laden video which claims the pandemic is ‘fake’ and a deliberate genocidal plot from governments around the world.

“For you sheep watch this ! & open your eyes” Mundine wrote when sharing the video.

It’s the third time this year Mundine has spoken out strongly against Australia’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout.

In May the 46-year-old shared a bizarre post to his Facebook page calling on his followers to “do your research” about the coronavirus.

Veteran broadcaster Ray Hadley blasted Mundine for calling the Covid-19 vaccine rollout “blatant genocide” and suggesting there are “evil plans” in place to enforce global depopulation — while offering no proof to back up his outrageous claims.

Mundine claimed without any supporting evidence whatsoever the vaccine paralyses the body’s immune system. In actuality vaccines work by training the immune system to fight diseases.

“You take the shot then you will have serious health problems even death!” Mundine wrote at the time.

“In the past I’ve ignored your rantings … because I think at the base of it you’re not a bad person. But this irresponsible stupidity that you’re now posting can cause great concern for people” Hadley said.

“Anthony I’ll take my medical advice from professors and doctors not you.

“You read that somewhere on the internet did you Anthony? Or did someone read it to you?

“It’s just mind-boggling that a young man who’s reasonably intelligent one would hope could come out with such unadulterated bulls**t. Because that’s exactly what it is.”

The government’s handling of Australia’s vaccine rollout has come under fire for not matching the speed and efficiency of other vaccination efforts around the world.

In April Prime Minister Scott Morrison scrapped plans to announce a new deadline to vaccinate all Australians by the end of the year against Covid-19 in an admission over the “uncertainties” surrounding the program.

Vaccination efforts have also been complicated by a small number of cases of people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine developing blood clots. Around four to six people out of every million suffered the rare illness after receiving the AstraZeneca shot.

The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) subsequently advised everyone under the age of 50 to receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca shot.

More than 200000 Australians have participated in feeding back data on the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Some 51.8 per cent of respondents reported some kind of adverse reaction but only 1.2 per cent experienced reactions serious enough for them to seek medical attention.

Mundine retired from professional boxing following a first-round knockout defeat against Michael Zerafa in March.

The former rugby league star was an embarrassment in his final fight failing to lay a glove on Zerafa and being knocked down twice in two minutes.

Mundine had won just one fight since 2014 and lost five of his final six bouts taking his official record to 48-11.

The former world champion had “retired” several times before most notably after his brutal loss to Jeff Horn three years ago."

Members-only



Fine artist and designer Julian Victor LaMarr Gaines better known as Ju Working On Projects has a unique dual-pronged perspective on sneakers. Before finding success in the art world as a painter whose works are collected by everyone from Rick Ross to The Whitaker Group founder James Whitner Juwop (as his friends call him) was a South Side Chicago native who attended Northern Michigan University on a partial football scholarship and painted on sneakers — out of both of necessity and curiosity.

This unique blend of interests in “aesthetics and athletics” as Juwop puts it enabled him to approach sneaker culture from two vastly different — but ultimately converging — standpoints. He first gained notoriety for his hand-painted Air Force 1s and in 2018 he parlayed a strong relationship with Nike into his very own collaboration: a Sky Force 3/4 and Air Vortex dubbed “Game Worn.”

Since then Juwop has continued to explore and intermingle his love of art and sneakers all while attacking his artistic efforts with an athlete’s fervor determination and love of competition. “I want to feel like Michael Jordan every day of my life. I paint with a certain competitiveness and really challenge myself — I got that mindset from athletics and I’ve really channeled it in my artwork” he tells HYPEBEAST.

In the latest installment of Sole Mates Ju Working on Projects discusses growing up in Chicago how his artistic talent and athletic focus were fused in college becoming integrated into Nike culture in Portland his collaborative efforts and much more. See the full conversation below.

HYPEBEAST: You grew up on the South Side of Chicago in the ‘90s. Tell us what sneaker culture was like there — did everything revolve around Michael Jordan?

Ju Working on Projects: I was always immersed in sneaker culture growing up. I was born in 1991 right in the height of the Chicago Bulls’ first run of championships and there’s no childhood picture of me that I’m not wearing Jordans in [laughs]. My sister was even named after Jordan! As I got older my parents would get me shoes less frequently because I had siblings and would grow out of my shoes so fast. I’d usually just get two pairs of Air Force 1s at Christmas a white pair and a black pair. And in Chicago unlike New York we wore Air Force 1 Mids too. Outside of sports shoes those two Forces would be my only pairs for the year. I’d try really hard to keep my white pair clean and when they started to get a bit dirty I’d paint on them to prolong their lifespan.

Were you painting them other colors giving them a refresh a little bit of both?

I was painting them all sorts of colors. I’d do everything from my own colorblocking to spray-painting them gold. All the types of things that customizers would do I was doing as a kid. I think that’s why the customs I made as art objects later on in life were a bit more refined than some of the other customs I’d see. I started customizing my shoes out of necessity because I didn’t want to get teased at school for having dirty shoes. That childhood care and attention to detail carried over to my later work.

A combination of expression and necessity.

Facts. Eventually I made a business out of painting T-shirts and shoes and when I realized I could monetize my art I decided that I wanted to continue pursuing art as a career.

So as you grew up you were experiencing sneakers through the lenses of art and sport simultaneously?

Absolutely. I also played a lot of basketball and football growing up and had shoes from a lot of different brands so I experienced sneaker culture through that lens as well. One thing I never had was Grant Hill’s FILAs though. They were on that 2 for $89.99 deal at Foot Locker but if my mom didn’t like a shoe I couldn’t get it … and she didn’t like those [laughs].

Fast forwarding a bit I was still painting shoes when I graduated high school and went off to play college football. I had a partial athletic scholarship to Northern Michigan and studied art drawing and painting. I’d paint on my cleats before games and would be talking to my coaches like “yo can I redesign our jerseys?” They’d be like “dude get the f*ck out of here and go to class.” I thought our jerseys were really subpar and that’s when I realized how much aesthetics play into athletics. The former propels the latter: if you look good you feel good and if you feel good you play good.

“I want to feel like Michael Jordan every day of my life. I paint with a certain competitiveness and really challenge myself — I got that mindset from athletics and I’ve really channeled it in my artwork.”

Do you carry that same “look good feel good play good” mindset over to your fine art practice? You’re known to paint in grails like the fragment design x Air Jordan 1 and the Air Jordan 1 Hi ‘85 “New Beginnings.”

When I go into my studio I treat it like the gym. I want to feel like Michael Jordan every day of my life. I paint with a certain competitiveness and really challenge myself — I got that mindset from athletics and I’ve really channeled it in my artwork. Nobody in art school was competitive which is cool but you can’t win if you’re not competing.

Did you become involved with Nike immediately after college?

Yeah after college I started working at Station 23 in Chicago. My first role was as a brand ambassador and I really started to psychoanalyze what brand loyalty looked like on the South Side of the city learning more about how people in Oregon created the perfect shoe for my community when they’d never been to my community. Honestly my original goal was to become a product line manager.

How did you make your way out to Oregon and become known at Nike headquarters a world in and of itself?

I booked a one-way flight out to Portland after college and was just living on my best friend’s couch pursuing a career as an artist. When I came out here I didn’t have two nickels to rub together and was $20000 in student loan debt but kept grinding painting showing up at Nike HQ and taking meetings.

And you wound up with your own Nike collaboration. Of course you did both a Sky Force and an Air Vortex but we’re focusing on the former today. Tell me a little bit about the inspiration and about how you and Nike decided on the Sky Force? It’s a pretty under-the-radar silhouette.

My goal was to create the “creative’s shoe.” When I brought this idea to Nike I pointed out to them that there are thousands of brilliant people creating athletic footwear and apparel on their main campus and the majority of them can’t dunk a basketball. Their talent is their creativity and when they’re creating they need a shoe that does for them what an Air Jordan does for a basketball player — make them feel like Jordan so they can perform to the best of their abilities. The “Game Worn” theme was inspired in part by how I liked to wear old Jordans because I’d pretend that MJ gave me his shoes right off the court.

Once my pitch was “appreciated” — I’ll say it like that — they asked what silhouette I’d like to use but told me I couldn’t use the Air Force 1. I wanted to do something Force-related though so I dug deep into the Nike archives. Though I was born in the ‘90s I’ve always been very inspired by the ‘80s and what the parents of ‘90s babies were doing before they had us. During that hunt I found the Sky Force. The Sky Force High was way too high and the Sky Force Low was too streamlined so I opted for the three-quarter cut version.

Your version is quite different from the OG Sky Force — different midsole mostly altered shape and more. Why did you make those changes?

I slimmed down the upper a bit for a nod to the Air Jordan 1 which is one of my favorite shoes and I took the midsole and outsole from the Court Force because I knew it had translucent detailing that would let me add another layer into the design. The translucent outsole was also a callout to the Air Jordan 11 and how its outsole would yellow. I wanted people to wear these to work and create in them hence the “Game Worn” tag. They were made for the people that really put the work in. You can’t put ‘em on ice because the midsole will yellow so you have to wear them and you can look down mid-project and feel like Jordan.

When you were re-working the Sky Force did you know Nike was going to use your revamped take on it as an in-line release later down the road or did that come a surprise to you?

I didn’t get all the credit for that and that’s fine. I’m an artist — I have 10000 new ideas for every one that gets taken and reused. I saw the reach my ideas and vision could have and that was more than inspiring enough to propel my future projects.

What other details did you have to hone in? I noticed that the leather is a lot softer and more malleable than what you’ll find on most Nike sneakers.

Yeah it’s very buttery. I told the materials guys that I wanted the shoe to be so comfortable that you could get on a plane and not take your shoes off because I hate when people do that [laughs]. If you create on the same kind of wavelength as me you’re no stranger to 10-12 hour workdays either so I wanted that comfort and soft feel to last all day. The canvas pieces around the collar are supposed to represent the linen canvases I used to paint on. Lastly the “Working On Projects” hit under the outsole was actually kind of inspired by American Psycho the scene where Patrick Bateman kicks his feet up on the desk and the whole audience knows what’s going on. The bottom of the shoe is a way to non verbally communicate that you’re working.

Tell me about the packaging. It’s incredibly detailed especially the money print on the tissue paper.

I believe in a firm “product handshake.” If someone came up to you to introduce themselves and shook your hand with a limp wrist you’d look at them funny right? You want to appreciate something from the moment you first see it and for me as a designer I want to set that tone from first glimpse. I wanted my OGs guys like DJ Clark Kent Curren$y and Rick Ross to see that packaging and feel some crazy nostalgia like “wow I never thought I’d see money in a shoebox again.” Before Venmo and PayPal people put their money in shoeboxes and bibles. That was your first “bank” as a hustler and I wanted to nod to that to lock in that ‘80s inspiration even further.

Funny story: that’s real money in those tissue paper photographs. I didn’t have any money when I was making the shoes but I asked a very affluent friend if I could take a photo of $40000. We spread it out photoshopped it and made it look like $400000 [laughs]. I wanted that product handshake to be so good that people would save and frame their shoebox paper.

“Those green Swoosh pairs [of my Sky Force] are my version of giving out a Roc-A-Fella chain or a Jet Life chain giving credit to my friends for believing in me.”

The friends and family Sky Force has an avocado green swoosh and detailing instead of the black embellishments on the retail pair. I know there was a period when you were including avocados in a lot of your art — are there any parallels there?

To me avocados symbolize wealth and opportunity. They’re not cheap and they have a timeline. If you buy an avocado and cut it open you’re not going to be like “you know what I’m gonna eat this tomorrow” because it’ll go bad. You have to eat it right then. It’s a metaphor for seizing the day and taking advantage of opportunities in a timely fashion.

The reason I conceptualized that green Swoosh was because I wanted to create something to make the people who believed in me before I had any co-signs feel special. A love of avocados was a sort of inside joke between some of my closest friends and I as well. Those green Swoosh pairs are my version of giving out a Roc-A-Fella chain or a Jet Life chain giving credit to my friends for believing in me. I paid it forward to my neighborhood too. We had a pop-up event for the “Game Worn” collection at Notre gave out 500 scholarships brought the suburbs to the hood [laughs].

Talk about a full circle moment.

The Nike LeBron 18 Low isn’t just good for nods to Space Jam LeBron James latest creative endeavor. And though these creations may headline for quite a while — at least until the film’s debut — Nike hasn’t stopped offering new standalone versions of the silhouette.

Here the GS audience receives a playful floral-ridden offering. Roses complete with their lush green stems grow throughout the toe and heel imparting a sense of nature to the aqua blue backdrop. The petals are then complemented by the Swoosh and adjacent taping as both flaunt a deep burgundy near identical in shade. Elsewhere these ideas only further bloom: the aforementioned check features a subtle all-over pattern the laces sport a violet hue and the midsole a light Spring-esque pastel. Finally to round out the overarching themes the insole prints with “Flower in the Desert.”

By Erik Boal DyeStat Editor/Photos by Becky Holbrook

EUGENE Ore. – The girls from Saratoga Springs High in New York reached such an elite level of performance Friday in the 4xmile relay at The Outdoor Nationals presented by Nike that it can no longer be said with absolute certainty that their 82-point victory at the 2019 Nike Cross Nationals is the strongest distance showcase in program history.

Ella Kurto Alycia Hart Mackenzie Hart and Emily Bush competing as Kinetic Track Club ran 19 minutes 40.67 seconds at Hayward Field to smash the 2006 national record of 19:56.75 achieved by Suffern High from New York.

Lucca Fulkerson Mia Prok Stella Vieth and Madison Shults of Niwot High in Colorado representing Real Training placed second in 19:45.37 in the strongest 4xmile prep showcase ever produced.

Mackenzie Hart Kurto and Bush were all members of the national championship cross country lineup 18 months earlier at Glendoveer Golf Course in Portland.

And Friday provided a strong indication that the group will be favored to capture the national title again after not being able to defend its championship last year when NXN was canceled as a result of the pandemic.

Niwot was the third-place team at the 2019 nationals and has also improved significantly since with the arrival of the freshman standout Prok and the improvement of the sophomore Shults.

But even though the group was leading at the midway point and possessed veteran experience from Princeton commit Fulkerson and Vieth it still wasn’t enough to deny Kinetic which had all four girls split between 4:52 and 4:58 to smash the indoor national record 19:59.24 achieved by Saratoga Springs in 2005.

Saratoga Springs had won the 4xmile relay in 2019 in Greensboro N.C. by clocking 20:31.67 and achieved the fifth national championship in the event more than any school in the history of the meet.

Onalaska High in Wisconsin the leader following the opening leg took third in 20:11.12 the No. 18 all-time prep performance.

Lydia Malecek opened the relay in 4:51.70 and sister Kora Malecek closed in 4:49.29 for the Onalaska Hilltoppers.

Fulkerson Prok and Shults returned to the track a couple of hours later to join Stanford-bound senior Taylor James as Real Training lowered its own Colorado state record in the 4x800 relay to capture the national title in 8:52.48.

Sarah Naticchia Lindsay Colflesh Olivia Stoner and Allison Colflesh of Haddonfield High in New Jersey placed second in 9:00.51.

Real Training became the first Colorado quartet to secure the girls 4x800 championship ascending to the No. 17 all-time prep competitors. The group also became the first to win girls 4x400 and 4x800 titles in the same year since Columbia High of New Jersey in 2013.

And the success for Real Training wasn’t only limited to the female athletes as Grayden Rauba Simon Saia Curtis Volf and Zane Bergen of Niwot set the Colorado state record as well as the Hayward Field all-time prep mark by clocking 17:19.70 to win the 4xmile relay.

It marked the first 4xmile victory by any Colorado program boys or girls and elevated Real Training to the No. 19 relay in high school history.

Loyola High of California with Dylan Bissell Richard Moreno Zachary Zambrano and Arjun Vadgama leading the Cubs placed second in 17:28.58.

Valley Project representing Ridge High in New Jersey repeated as the boys 4x800 champions by clocking 7:39.06.

Will Pinto James Kisker Jackson Barna and Luke Roberts helped Ridge join Northport High in New York as the only programs to capture back-to-back 4x800 titles.

Louisville Xtreme with Roman Schrader Sami Hattab Nicholas Brooks and Nolan Hester competing for St. Xavier High took second in 7:47.84.

Following a two-hour turnaround after winning the 4xmile relay Real Training returned to place fourth in 7:53.13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9maXRuZXNzL25pa2Utc2hhY2FycmktcmljaGFyZHNvbi10ZXN0cy1wb3NpdGl2ZS1tYXJpanVhbmEtc3RhdGVtZW50LTQ4NDA0NDQ00gFtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9wc3VnYXIuY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvZml0bmVzcy9uaWtlLXNoYWNhcnJpLXJpY2hhcmRzb24tdGVzdHMtcG9zaXRpdmUtbWFyaWp1YW5hLXN0YXRlbWVudC00ODQwNDQ0NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Stands With Sha'Carri Richardson After Marijuana Test,"Nike is standing with sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson after she tested positive for marijuana. On Friday the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced the positive test and Richardson accepted a one-month suspension. She won the 100-meter race at the Olympic Trials last month and was set to head to Tokyo in a few weeks.

Richardson has been a Nike athlete since 2019. She will continue to be so after her test and suspension. ""We appreciate Sha'Carri's honesty and accountability and will continue to support her through this time"" the brand said in a statement on Friday. This message comes as Sha'Carri receives an outpouring of support from fellow athletes and fans who are upset by her ineligibility which began on June 28.

After the news broke on Friday Richardson made a virtual appearance on the Today show to apologize. ""I want to take responsibility for my actions"" she said. Richardson also explained she ingested marijuana as a way to cope after a reporter told her that her biological mother had died. This unexpected heartbreak sent Richardson into a state of ""emotional panic"" and she felt ""blinded by emotions blinded by sadness.""

It remains unclear if Richardson will still represent Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics later this month. She has been disqualified from the 100-meter event but her suspension finishes before the women's team's 4x100 relay. There's still hope that we could see Richardson perform as an Olympic athlete yet."

Shockingly Spears claimed she had no idea that she could request for the judge to remove her conservatorship entirely rather than just have her father Jamie Spears replaced as conservator.

“Ma’am I didn’t know I could petition the conservatorship to end it” she told the court in her 24-minute address. “I’m sorry for my ignorance but I honestly didn’t know that.”

The duty to have informed her would have fallen on her court-appointed lawyer Samuel D. Ingham III who is allowed to bill her estate up to $10000 per week according to court documents. He has made nearly $3 million working for Spears over the years according to The New York Times.

Ingham was appointed to Spears’ case by Judge Reva G. Goetz in 2008 although Spears had tried to retain noted trial attorney Adam Streisand to contest her father being made her conservator.

“She has expressed to me very strongly that her father not be the conservator” Streisand told Judge Reva Goetz in Feb. 2008 explaining that he had spoken with Spears over the course of two days while she was in the hospital. “There has been an estrangement for quite some time. With him as conservator that is causing her more agitation and more distress.”

Streisand had also requested for Northern Trust Bank to be named as Spears’ conservator over her estate citing concerns that attorney Andrew Wallet did not have the experience to manage her then $40 million fortune.

But Ingham who reportedly only spoke with Spears for 15 minutes told the judge that Spears “did not understand” the nature of the court proceedings and claimed she “lacks the capacity to retain counsel.” Goetz sided with Ingham and deemed that Spears was not capable of hiring her own lawyer booting Streisand from the court and leaving her with Ingham for the next 13 years.

According to Ingham’s court-submitted declaration of his credentials he has repped more than 600 conservatorship trust guardianship and probate proceedings over the course of his 46-year career. The UCLA alum who is related to former president Andrew Jackson’s U.S. Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham runs his practice out of Ojai California. His lackluster and sparse website declares he’s been certified by California’s state bar in estate planning trust and probate law.

Despite a long-spanning career as one of the court’s go-to lawyers when it comes to representing some of media and entertainment’s biggest names including Spears radio icon Casey Kasem and media mogul Sumner Redstone Ingham managed to keep a low profile.

That was until he was dragged into the spotlight in 2019 when Kasem’s widow Jean Kasem accused Ingham in a wrongful death suit of conspiring with Kasem’s three adult children from a previous marriage “to isolate and kill Casey Kasem for financial gain.”

It was a messy lawsuit with hundreds of filings predated by earlier legal disputes over whether Kasem needed a conservatorship in the first place.

Jean 67 had been married to Kasem for 33 years when the radio personality was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia—a form of Parkinson’s. A nasty family fight ensued between Jean and her step-children over the entertainer’s care and his estimated $80 million fortune. Jean claimed the children—whom Kasem allegedly was estranged from because they joined the Church of Scientology—“were intent on seizing control of my husband to terminate his life” according to court documents reviewed by The Daily Beast.

In 2013 the children tried to establish a temporary conservatorship over Kasem but a judge ruled in Jean’s favor confirming that she was taking good care of the ailing elder. Jean later reached a confidential agreement with two of Kasem’s children on visitation arrangements although his daughter Kerri Kasem refused the agreement.

“ That was until he was dragged into the spotlight in 2019 when Kasem’s widow Jean Kasem accused Ingham in a wrongful death suit of conspiring with Kasem’s three adult children from a previous marriage “to isolate and kill Casey Kasem for financial gain.” ”

The next year Kerri filed a motion for a temporary conservatorship over her father. Allegedly trying to avoid the soon-to-be media storm which was the case in the previous legal dispute Jean flew Kasem to the State of Washington without anyone’s knowledge. A judge concerned by Kasem’s disappearance ruled in Kerri’s favor granting her the temporary conservatorship in May 2014. Now in charge of his medical decisions Kasem’s children decided to transition his care to end-of-life measures and on June 15 2014 Kasem died at the age of 82.

Jean later accused Ingham of working with Kasem’s children claiming he had “misled the court by omitting the fact the first conservatorship attempt was denied with prejudice and initiated a second unwarranted temporary conservatorship of Casey Kasem to kill him for illicit financial gain” according to court documents.

She also alleged in court documents that he “ignored or defied court requests that he visit Casey in Washington state [where Casey died] to assess his needs when he was having trouble breathing because his lungs were filling up with liquid and he would likely pass away.”

While Ingham was the court-appointed attorney to represent Kasem he allegedly billed his estate hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Records show that a judge later granted Ingham’s request to deny Jean’s motion to include him in the wrongful death suit against her children and eventually both parties’ countersuits were dismissed.

Ingham has been named in at least two other federal suits in regard to his court-appointed conservatorship duties but each plaintiff has lost their legal bid.

As for Spears Ingham has still not filed a motion to withdraw from the case although Spears indicated at the special hearing in June that she would like to choose her own attorney.

“Actually I’ve grown a personal relationship with Sam my lawyer I’ve been talking to him like three times a week now” Spears told the judge. “We’ve kind of built a relationship but I haven’t really had the opportunity by my own self to actually hand-pick my own lawyer by myself. And I would like to be able to do that.”

“My lawyer Sam has been very scared for me to go forward because he’s saying if I speak up I’m being overworked in that facility of that rehab place that rehab place will sue me” Spears said at one point. “He told me I should keep it to myself.”

“My attorney says I can’t. It’s not good. I can’t let the public know anything they did to me and by not saying anything is saying it’s OK” Spears added.

At the beginning of the hearing Ingham admitted he was unsure exactly what Spears would be saying and is said to have seemed taken aback by her testimony. (Ingham did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment prior to publication.)

“It is with deep regret and sadness that the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) learned of the recent passing of our much loved former colleague and dear friend Fionnuala” the Board said.

Fionnuala McAndrew started her career as a teacher before embarking on a lifetime of service working in health and social care in Northern Ireland.

She initially led the Social Care Registration and Inspection Unit in the Southern Trust area before becoming the Assistant Director and ultimately Director of Social Care and Adult Services at the former Southern Health and Social Services Board (SHSSB).

In 2009 she was appointed as the first Director of Social Care and Children at the newly established regional Health and Social Care Board in 2009 where she retired in May 2018 due to ill health.

The Lurgan woman received an OBE in 2011 for her contribution to social work and achieved a Special Lifetime Achievement award in recognition of her contribution to developing the role and profile of social workers across Northern Ireland.

Describing Fionnuala as ‘warm passionate and caring” Martin Quinn Interim Deputy Director of Social Care and Children at the Health and Social Care Board said: “Fionnuala was an inspirational and transformational leader and advocate that helped shape the future of social care within Northern Ireland.

‘We mourn the loss of one of the great leaders in social care and beyond and our thoughts and prayers are with Fionnuala’s family and many friends at this sad time.”

Sean Holland Northern Ireland’s Chief Social Worker said: “On Tuesday June 29 our colleague and friend Fionnuala McAndrew finally left us.

Mr Holland added: ""The social work community in Northern Ireland extend our condolences to her husband John and children Eoin and Ciar.

“Their loss is unimaginable. Today every person I know who worked with her is bereft” he tweeted.

The title would probably go to the F-35 or the B-1B Lancer while the Thunderbolt would end up on the very last spot.

But that doesn’t matter one bit as far as this airplane goes. The Fairchild Republic (now Northrop Grumman) machine was introduced in 1972 not to look pretty but to be an incredible support tool for the troops on the ground.Nicknamed Warthog in part because it is as ugly as the namesake animal the Thunderbolt is a formidable war machine. It can carry 16000 pounds (7200 kilograms) of mixed ordnance dangling from its wings and fuselage including drag and cluster bombs mine dispensing munitions missiles and laser-guided bombs.The most incredible weapon it packs is however the 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun called Avenger. Making an incredible sound when fired (check video below this text for more on that) it is capable of unleashing rounds in rapid succession from 4000 feet (1200 meters) hitting the target and an area of 40 feet (12 meters) around it.Two General Electric turbofan engines give it the needed power to climb to 45000 feet (13636 meters) and fly at speeds of up to 420 mph (676 kph) for as much as 800 miles (1287 km) on a single outing.You can clearly see the engines located high up on the rear fuselage in this close-up pic (click main photo to enlarge) showing Warthogs as they retire from an exercise area. Deployed with the 25th Fighter Squadron  they took off from the Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska last week during the local Red Flag-Alaska 21 exercise.We find the amazing photo just perfect to highlight how beautiful these ugly machines are when seen by friendly forces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvb2xkLWRhbmdlcm91cy10aGVzZS1ydXNzaWFuLWJvbWJlcnMtYXJlLWhlcmUtc3RheS0xODkxMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old But Dangerous: These Russian Bombers Are Here to Stay,"If Russian military history can teach us anything the Tu-22M -95 and -160 will probably be maintained and upgraded for many years to come.

Here's What You Need to Remember: The introduction of the Tu-22M in the early 1970s was an odd time for supersonic bombers as the superiority of ICBMs was widely recognized. Despite the Tu-22M’s technical obsolescence continuous upgrades to radar and electronics combined with improved air-to-surface missiles have kept the Tu-22M platform relevant.

Most military equipment in Russian arsenals today is legacy Soviet hardware. Russian bombers are no exception. Although some airframes in Russian inventories are quite old they remain potent thanks to airframe electronics and radar upgrades along with improvements in standoff missiles and precision-guided munitions. Here are Russia’s most dangerous bombers.

Tu-95 “Bear”

In 1950 Andrei Tupolev was tasked with designing the Soviet Union’s new long-range heavy bomber the Tu-95. It was to be able to carry a 24200-pound payload with a range of nearly 5000 miles—and thus threaten important targets in the United States.

Tupolev needed to balance speed and performance with range. Jet engines at the time would given a long-range strategic bomber the needed speed but guzzled fuel limiting range. Although Tupolev was already a highly successful designer he tasked a group of German and Austrian aircraft engineers that had been captured after World War II with the design. They designed the most powerful turboprop engine ever made the venerable KN-12.

Using two sets of contra-rotating propellers the KN-12 is still used on the Tu-95 today. Although the engines are extremely powerful the are also incredibly loud. Still when mission requirements are massive payload rather than stealthiness the Bear can do the job.

Repeated upgrades have greatly extended the airframe’s service life and increasingly sophisticated stand-off cruise missiles have kept the Tu-95 potent. It is planned to operate until the 2040s.

Tu-22M “Backfire”

Sometimes called “Backfire” by NATO the Tu-22M variant was developed to address design deficiencies inherent in the Tu-22 parent design. The Tu-22M uses a variable-sweep wing design that provided a balance between favorable landing and take-off handling with good cruising and high-speed flight.

The Tu-22M carries a respectable bomb load and can fly at a maximum speed of Mach 1.88. Interestingly it has a twin-barreled 23mm cannon in the tail that is remotely controlled.

The introduction of the Tu-22M in the early 1970s was an odd time for supersonic bombers as the superiority of ICBMs was widely recognized. Despite the Tu-22M’s technical obsolescence continuous upgrades to radar and electronics combined with improved air-to-surface missiles have kept the Tu-22M platform relevant.

Tu-160 “Blackjack”

The Tu-160 is truly a beast of an aircraft with several firsts and world records to its name. Visually similar to the Tu-22M or the American Rockwell B-1 Lancer the Tu-160 was the last strategic bomber designed by the Soviet Union.

Also known as the “Blackjack” it is the heaviest bomber in service in any country and tops out at Mach 2.05. In contrast to the B-1 Lancer the Blackjack is more of a stand-off weapons platform rather than a traditional bomber although its tow large weapons bays allow it to carry a payload of 88000 pounds and allows the delivery of conventional precision and nuclear munitions. The Blackjack is the only Soviet bomber designed without any defensive weapons.

Again upgrades to radar and targeting along with the restart of airframe production in 2019 is keeping the Blackjack airborne probably for many more years to come.

Tupolev PAK DA

Although still under development the PAK DA will undoubtedly be Russia’s deadliest bomber. Once fielded the PAK DA will eventually replace both the Tu-160 supersonic bomber and the earlier Tu-95.

PAK DA is essentially a next-gen long-range stealth bomber similar to the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber. Like the B-2 the PAK DA will probably have a flying wing design although this is only known from promotional material. No known prototypes currently exist. This would be the first truly Russian bomber— not simply a legacy Soviet design or improvements upon them.

The first PAK DA prototype flight was delayed from 2019 to sometime in the 2021–2023 timeframe. As already pointed out upgraded variants of the Tu-160 are currently conducting flight trials so it will likely be some time before we have any photos or more concrete info on Russia’s first true stealth bomber.

Future Flight

If Russian military history can teach us anything the Tu-22M -95 and -160 will probably be maintained and upgraded for many years to come. When and if the PAK DA becomes operational it would put an important arrow in Russia’s quiver—a theoretically very capable stealth bomber. Still if that can be managed affordably remains to be seen. The relatively low price of oil has severely constrained Russian military spending and designing a brand-new stealth platform is no easy thing.

The charts show all the progress that has been achieved by the two main GPU makers in the industry starting and each generation of GPU shows both its strength and weaknesses.

AMD & NVIDIA GPU Silicon Progress From The Past 10 Years Visualized

The data was gathered from the Techpowerup GPU database and the top parts were used to measure the performance efficiency & cost advancements witnessed over several generations. The charts start off with the VLIW5 based AMD Radeon HD 5000 & the Fermi-based GeForce GTX 400 series graphics cards.

2 of 9

AMD Radeon HD 5000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 400 Series

So starting off with the first GPUs in comparison the Terascale 2 (VLIW5) based Radeon HD 5000 and Fermi-based GeForce GTX 400 series. Both GPU families were similar in performance & price but Fermi consumed more power and hence its energy efficiency wasn't on par with the AMD GPU lineup at the time. Radeon GPUs also offered higher transistor performance.

The main issue with Fermi was that the top-tier chips were suited for large-scale HPC workloads and as such featured unnecessary hardware units which led to a hot and power-hungry design. This was rectified with the release of more mainstream options and the next lineup in the GeForce family.

AMD Radeon HD 6000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 500 Series

Moving on we have the last iteration of Terascale and VLIW architecture as a whole from AMD the Radeon HD 6000 series versus the second incarnation of Fermi the GeForce GTX 500 series. Both GPU families saw a little gain in performance as they were widely regarded as optimized versions of what came before them but NVIDIA made some wise decisions in optimizing its broken Fermi GPU architecture for gaming and ended up delivering a slightly better product in general.

AMD did cut the costs of its Radeon HD 6000 series which were widely affordable for the masses but this generation was mostly regarded as an intermediate launch before the next generation arrived from both parties.

AMD Radeon HD 7000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 600 Series

The GCN and Kepler cards were both based on a 28nm architecture and accelerated into the next gen. AMD launched its Radeon HD 7970 first which was well received with great performance and pricing while the same happened with NVIDIA which brought a range of new features and offered a huge increase in efficiency over the GCN architecture.

The Kepler architecture could be seen as the start of NVIDIA's efficiency journey which would come into fruition in the coming generations.

AMD Radeon R200 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 700 Series

A year later NVIDIA unveiled its GeForce GTX 780 Ti graphics card as a response to the AMD R9 200 series which was aimed at the enthusiast segment. AMD Hawaii cards were both a step forward & a step back offering huge performance increases to match NVIDIA's Titan cards but also sacrificed overall efficiency.

The AMD Radeon R9 290X as a result was hot but a strong competitor to NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 780 and Titan but came short of the GTX 780 Ti. With that said both cards had similar pricing and while performance was close it was NVIDIA that was offering higher efficiency again.

AMD Radeon R300 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 Series

The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 series based on the Maxwell architecture was the biggest uplift in performance and efficiency the green team had delivered yet. The Maxwell lineup really pushed the energy that came from NVIDIA but it was still just a teaser for what was to come.

AMD didn't learn from their Hawaii lineup and moved to offer an even more power-hungry Fiji chip which was not only limited in terms of memory but also featured a pricing similar to the GTX 980 Ti while offering performance lower than that. AMD did become the first vendor to offer HBM memory on its consumer chips but that was the only good thing about the card aside from the liquid cooling variation. The GTX 980 Ti launched first delivered a massive blow to AMD in the high-end market and things started looking grim for AMD's next-gen architecture.

AMD Radeon RX Vega vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 Series

Everyone had huge hopes for AMD's Radeon RX Vega architecture which was designed by the new head of RTG Raja Koduri. But NVIDIA also wasn't keeping silent. The company launched its first 10 series cards months ahead of AMD's Vega lineup which pushed the efficiency & performance chart even further.

But it was the GTX 1080 Ti that truly crushed AMD's high-end GPU efforts for the next several years. The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti not only offered a stunning price point but its performance was the biggest leap forward for any Ti graphics card. One that remains unmatched to this day. The Vega 64 managed to offer performance close to the GTX 1080 but it was hot loud and consumed way more power than what AMD had promised.

AMD Radeon RX 5000 vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series

Enter the David Wang era the new head of RTG had different and more constructive plans for the red team. Focus on both efficiency and performance. AMD's goal changed from offering the best value to the best in all categories. This was seen in the first iteration of the Navi architecture with the Radeon RX 5700 XT which managed to offer great mainstream performance at an attractive price.

NVIDIA on the other hand knowing that they had the lead in the performance category went on to expand upon their feature set with DLSS and raytracing technologies. The Turing generation saw marginal gains over the last generation but the prices saw a huge increase due to increased wafer costs and the addition of premium GDDR6 memory modules.

AMD Radeon RX 6000 vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series

We finally come to the current generation where NVIDIA tried its best to reach new performance heights with its Ampere architecture but AMD really blew them away by offering a GPU lineup that tackles NVIDIA across the board even the flagship RTX 3090. The RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT are close in pricing and while the former offers a great feature set & superior raytracing performance the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT leads in efficiency and even manages to come up with its own feature set such as FSR which was recently revealed. Both graphics cards are great in their own rights but AMD really outdid themselves with the 2nd iteration of Navi and things are looking great with the next-generation RDNA 3 family from what we have heard in rumors.

Of course this is just a small analysis of all the generations of AMD and NVIDIA GPUs that have come in the last 10 years and we look forward to what innovations and architectural upgrades are headed our way in the next 10 years.

Try this out,"New updates to this story are being added at the bottom…

Original story (from June 30) follows:

A few days back Nvidia began rolling out an updated user interface to its Shield devices that isn’t too different from what other Android TV devices were treated to back in February.

But one change in the new UI in particular hasn’t gone down well at all with users due to which the entire OS update has been coming under fire.

The change is the new “content recommendations” feature that eats up a large part of the home screen estate.

Of course ‘recommendations’ is just another buttered-up term for ads and no one is fond of them especially when considering the fact that the previous UI never had them.

The ads may be quite relevant since they’re exclusive to movies and TV shows that can be watched on Android TV. But again they fill up a huge chunk of the home screen leaving little room for stuff that actually matters.

Thus frustrated users have been scouring the web for ways to get rid of the ads once and for all. We previously did highlight a way to do away with ads by disabling Google Play Services and uninstalling some updates.

However the method wasn’t flawless as it led to issues with apps like YouTube that have Google account dependencies. In such a case a better way to get rid of the ads on the Nvidia Shield TV would be by installing a 3rd-party launcher.

There are several 3rd-party launchers available to download on the Google Play Store including Sideload Channel Launcher 3 HALauncher and ATV Launcher.

They are designed to give your Nvidia Shield a minimalistic yet feature-rich home screen that is (of course) free from any kind of annoying ads.

The installation part is a bit tricky but the end result is totally worth the hassle.

But thanks to a Redditor who managed to give out a detailed yet easy-to-understand tutorial the 3rd-party launcher installation process is now easier than ever.

To get started you will need to enable developer options on your Nvidia Shield TV device enable adb access on your Nvidia Shield TV device and setup adb on your computer as shown below.

Next you will have to download a launcher of your choice (examples already given above) connect your Nvidia Shield TV to your PC via adb and execute a set of commands.

For the complete tutorial head over to this link. Alternatively you can also try out this ‘no typing needed’ tutorial.

Once all is done you can customize your new home screen to your liking and even make it look just like in the image below.

Update 1 (July 01)

Sharing your feedback with the developers is the only official way to grab the attention of developers (who are already aware that users are not in favor of the new UI) as has been suggested by support. More details here.

Update 2 (July 02)

An individual has shared a working method to get the ATV Home to version 2.0.10 on Shield Experience 8.2.2 (dev rooted). However this will break the OTA option meaning no more software updates via Google over the internet.

– Start with a device wipe – https://i.imgur.com/NvpymOf.png – Enter the secret code to bypass setup – https://i.imgur.com/DaLATG3.png https://i.imgur.com/B7Ui7l7.png – 8.2.2 comes with Android TV Home 2.1.3.xxx – https://i.imgur.com/eyqAll6.png This is bad as google play services will still show ads on this version. – Since you are in the dev firmware use adb to reboot to bootloader – https://i.imgur.com/UNHNHWT.png

– use fastboot to boot twrp-3.5.2_9-0-foster.img and mount the system partition – https://i.imgur.com/L9DfeKI.png – adb push com.google.android.tvlauncher_2.0.10-307630529-f-1010900306_minAPI26\(nodpi\)_apkmirror.com.apk /system/priv-app/TVLauncher/TVLauncher.apk – use adb to reboot back to bootloader and factory reset again. I tried to hotswap the package use pm to replace it but only had luck with another reset following launcher swap. – https://i.imgur.com/vwOkVl6.png

– Confirm the older version 2.0.10 is indeed the launcher – https://i.imgur.com/m1XqTAQ.png – Login to services as normal and disable auto-update on apps – https://i.imgur.com/Vyzbc2K.png – Update everything as normal EXCEPT Android TV Home – https://i.imgur.com/k8lnP1t.png – Enjoy your Shield once again and hope someone forks the launcher in the future to remove ads or nvidia forks it with official support for no ads – https://i.imgur.com/EH1neOt.png

Update 3 (July 03)

Incoming is yet another user-shared workaround for those of you struggling with the new Ad-filled UI. Here’s what the user says:

New updates to this story are being added at the bottom…

Original story (from June 23) follows:

Nvidia Shield TV officially began adopting the latest Android TV homescreen a few days back and the new Discover UI is being rolled out to users as well.

While the new interface does retain a navigation scheme similar to the previous one there is now a new “content recommendations” feature that eats up a huge chunk of the home screen estate.

Sure the ads are pretty relevant being exclusive for movies and TV shows that can be viewed on Android TV but are quite an eyesore nonetheless. As a result most of the feedback for the new update has been negative.

Bothered users have been ranting about the fresh inclusion of ads on social media and the NVIDIA forums.

New Ad Bar? Who do we need to pay to get rid this atrocity consuming a full ~30% of screen real estate on 65″ TV..is horrible.(I didn’t even accept the last update!) I will be happy donate ‘$$’ to get rid of it.

Source

I have ads on my home screen now. I do not want them. I did not agree to the update. I tried uninstalling the update but the goddamn ads are still there. I sideloaded fdroid and blokada but the goddamn ads are still there.

Source

The Android TV Home app that’s listed on the Google Play Store has also been bombarded with 1-star reviews ever since the dreaded update began rolling out resulting in its rating dropping to just 1.1.

While there hasn’t really been any official word from NVIDIA or Google to date regarding the future of the ads feature on the NVIDIA Shield TV some users have figured out a way to block them.

Yep. All you got to do is head over to Settings > Apps > See All Apps > Show System Apps > Google Play Services and disable the app.

Do keep in mind though that Google Play Services is a crucial component of Android TV and disabling it may lead to some unexpected problems like sign-in errors on apps that require login to Google accounts.

Alternatively you can also try uninstalling the latest update to the Android TV Home app by heading over to Settings > Apps > System apps > Android TV Home.

If that indeed successfully kills the ads then you would want to head over to the Google Play Store and disable auto-update for the app to make sure that the older version sticks.

The above methods to do away with ads are not endemic to the NVIDIA Shield TV as they’ll probably work on other Android TV devices as well so other device owners are welcome to try them too.

Update 1 (June 24)

Based on the information shared by one of the users at the community reset to the factory defaults is what worked for them. So you may give the workaround a try (at your own risk though).

Update 2 (June 25)

Installing a third-party launcher on Nvidia Shield TV is yet another alternative that can be used to get rid of the ads (however it goes without saying you’ll lose the functionalities of the default one by doing so).

Here is how a user explained it:

The best solution here is to simply replace the new default “Google TV” launcher. Below are steps I used so hopefully it’s clear enough that non-techies can follow. On your Nvidia Shield enter the Google Play Store and install a different Launcher Some recommend ATV Launcher but I prefer the free TVLauncher (pic) Go to Settings > About Scroll to Build and click until Developer Options are available Enter Developer Options and enable USB Debugging and Debugging over Network

Write down the IP address associated with Network Debugging On another machine ensure you have ADB drivers installed (how-to via XDA) Open a terminal / command line / powershell window Type: “adb connect [ip address from previous step]” Type: “adb devices” to ensure you’re connected Type: “adb shell pm uninstall –user 0 com.google.android.tvlauncher” There’s some chatter here about replacing the Nvidia Shield with an HTPC or switching to another solution like Roku. HTPCs are great if you’re into tweaking every detail but sometimes having an easy solution that works well is much more important. Also we own a few various Rokus in this house. They also shove ads in your face and collect a good amount of personal data but that’s another discussion entirely.

Update 3 (June 26)

In case the text-based guide is too confusing you can check out this detailed video below that shows you how to remove the pesky ads.

Update 4 (June 28)

Incoming is the information shared by one of the users who got in touch with the support and were informed that this change is basically an implementation of Discover UI as Nvidia has no control over the Android UI.

Meaning it has to do with Google not Nvidia. Here’s what the support reportedly said:

So as promised I did check with the developers team and has been informed that it is indeed an implementation of Google’s Discover UI which is part of the Android itself. Nvidia is only the manufacturer of the hardware and we do not have control over the User interface of Android. This is not just specific with Shield but is already being implemented on all Android tv boxes. Please submit a feedback from Shield tv so that the developers can check for an option in future release.”

Update 5 (June 29)

Another great launcher to install is Sideload launcher for Android TV as recommended by an individual on YouTube.

Update 6 (June 30)

For an easy tutorial on how to do away with ads by installing a third-party launcher head here.

Update 7 (July 01)

Going by the information shared by one of the Redditors the developers are apparently aware that users are not liking the latest UI. However sharing your feedback appears to be the only option (apart from the workarounds mentioned in this article) as here is what the user got to hear from support:

If you are referring about the new Discovery UI added. Then Yes it is a new feature that has been rolled out with the latest firmware update. Here : https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/software-update/ We are getting a lot of user complaining that they do no like it and need to be removed. We have already escalated to the the developers team and they are working on this as soon as possible. Kindly accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you may have experienced. AS this was rolled out with the update and there is no other option to disable this feature as of now. In this case we suggest you to submit a feedback from the NVidia SHIELD TV. Here is how : https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4075/~/how-to-send-feedback-or-device-diagnostics-through-your-shield-tv%3F Thanks for your response. We listen to every comment including feedback on the new Discover UI.

They further added:

We do our best to keep the SHIELD TV experience as close to the stock Android TV experience with many meaningful upgrades and enhancements to make SHIELD a one-of-a-kind experience. We think the new design and layout is a visual improvement from the older home screen and know the new suggestion section is a departure from the previous design. In addition to internal evaluation we’ll share your feedback with the Google Android TV team. Community feedback like yours is vital in shaping the future of Android TV and SHIELD.

Update 8 (July 02)

An individual has shared the steps to roll back to a previous version of ATV Home on Shield Experience 8.2.2. There are a couple of compromises with doing so however if you strongly dislike the new update then it could be worth it.

Check out the complete workaround here.

Update 9 (July 03)

A user has shared another potential workaround that might help you get rid of the ads. Check it out below:

However the final numbers won’t be known for months.

The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction on Thursday released an estimate of state aid for the upcoming school year and KUSD is among the state’s 421 districts that will receive additional funding. Estimated general school aid statewide totals $5 billion a $109.9 million (2.2%) increase from a year ago.

In total 276 districts statewide or 66% of Wisconsin’s school systems are expected to receive an increase.

According to the estimate Kenosha Unified will receive $149919708 an increase of $3525103 (2.41%) from the 2020-21 figure of $146394605.

The DPI which is statutorily required to estimate general school aid for districts based its estimates on budgeted data from Wisconsin districts then applied recommendations from the legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance KUSD Chief Financial Officer Tarik Hamdan said in an emailed statement.

Actual state aid for every district will not officially be known until it is certified on Oct. 15. “At that time (the) DPI will use actual spending data as reported by districts” Hamdan said.

He cautioned that the final numbers may not be how they now appear.

“While we welcome the projected increase in general aid of $3.5 million for KUSD this may end up being offset by $787370 if the exemption for personal property tax and associated aid is also eliminated (from the state budget)” he said.

The state budget approved by the Legislature late into the night June 30 sets aside about $202 million in state funds to pay for the elimination of the personal property tax which businesses pay on equipment and machinery.

Assembly members also voted with bipartisan support to formally do away with the more than 170-year-old tax.

Even if the funding for KUSD stays at its projected amount Hamdan said that doesn’t mean the district will have more money at its disposal.

“The Kenosha Unified School District fully supports the increase in general aids that will directly translate into property tax levy reductions for our stakeholders” he said. “However due to the revenue limit formula these funds will not provide any additional revenue growth for the district’s budget. That revenue growth is needed to cover basic inflationary increases for items such as salary health insurance and utility increases.”

The Department of Public Instruction indicated 33 percent of statewide districts (140) are estimated to receive a decrease in state aid while five will see no change.

In addition 68 districts will receive the maximum 15% decrease based on the state’s “hold-harmless aid provision” which is 18 more than last year. That provision states that a district’s general aid can increase or decrease because of changes in property valuation enrollment and shared costs the release states.

The estimate does not include per pupil categorical aid which will be based on the annual “third Friday in September count.” That aid is based on student counts for the past three years and will be paid in March 2022 at $742 per pupil according to state law.

The remaining parts will be published this summer. Read Part One here. For Part Two click here.

Roughly 50 steps separate the Colliers Hill neighborhood entrance in Erie and a three-pad hydraulic fracturing site. Another few hundred steps separate a site in west Greeley from backyards something a number of families didn’t expect when they moved in.

Kelsey Barnholt moved to Colliers Hill from Chicago in April 2020. Her husband graduated from the University of Northern Colorado and hails from Denver. They were attracted to the picturesque area and tight-knit community of young families.

Geoff Winterbourne and his family have been Erie residents since 2013 minus a stint in California last year. When his family returned from the Bay Area the neighborhood’s quiet but central location and landscape attracted them as well.

That’s what they and several other families got until earlier this year when 28 hydraulic fracturing wells moved in across County Road 10.

Occidental Petroleum began developing the three-pad site across from the neighborhood in 2017. The Yellowhammer and Papa Jo pads were supposed to be constructed in 2017 and the Mae J site was planned for 2019 according to a fact sheet.

“It’s not like when you see one of those typical vertical wells with a little grasshopper thing” Barnholt said. “This is serious; like multiple rows of BTEX burners and things like that.”

Barnholt’s home is about 2500 feet from the site.

Drilling was initially scheduled for completion by April 2020 roughly when the Barnholts moved in with fracking completed by March and April of this year. Occidental set site reclamation for October.

The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved Occidental’s permit for the Mae J site in 2019. It considered structures within 1500 feet of the proposed pad but Colliers Hill did not exist when Occidental received its permit.

Then things changed. The price of oil plummeted last year due to the COVID-19 shutdown and oil price war postponing further work. A developer built the neighborhood between Occidental receiving the Mae J permit in 2019 and the majority of site construction.

Barnholt Winterbourne and their neighbors didn’t know about the work until early 2021. Realtors and sellers must tell buyers whether they have mineral rights but they are under no legal obligation to provide information about oil and gas activity.

“These homes were all put up before the largest part of the infrastructure” said Winterbourne whose home is roughly 950 feet from the pads. “A lot of people ask us ‘Well did you see the walls?’ or ‘Did you see all of this happening?’ No because these homes existed before the largest portion of infrastructure was put up. It’s important to underscore that point because had that already been established we may have kept looking.”

Not what homebuyers are thinking about

Hydraulic fracturing known as fracking is the fracturing of underground shale deposits to release oil and gas. This is done through drilling and the use of high-pressure water — often mixed with sand and other chemicals — to move gas or oil to the surface according to the United States Geological Survey.

The process relies on a number of large engines trucks and tanks designed to eliminate BTEX (benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene) which is a group of volatile organic compounds found in the production of oil and gas.

Drilling is the most disruptive part of the process and often lasts three to five days per well.

The neighborhood was first alerted to the additional development when 20-foot sound walls went up in February and trucks began showing up. Residents then began receiving notices about liquid unloading and when fracking would officially begin.

Winterbourne said development information was published somewhere but it was not readily available nor well communicated.

“The moving process itself is pretty complex. You’ve got a realtor conversation that you’re having. You have lender conversations that you’re having. You’re trying to source the right place for you to build your family” Winterbourne said. “The last thing most people are thinking about is ‘What are my mineral rights?’ or ‘Do I have heavy industrial neighbors behind me or not?’”

Families said they experienced light sound and air pollution during the drilling. Operations shook some of their homes hard enough to knock photos off the walls and truck traffic woke them up at all hours of the night. Residents like Winterbourne who work remotely had no reprieve.

Since the drilling stopped they still say they experience negative side effects from the development and believe there must be a better way. The company could have drilled before the neighborhood was put in or moved the pads further on the property to get its “financial win” and job creation Winterbourne said.

The property where the pads are located according to Occidental’s original fact sheet shows additional land farther from the homes. Winterbourne said the company could have slightly moved the sites and created more space between the operations and homes.

“Those are the decisions I just don’t understand” Winterbourne said. “I think that has no impact on people’s jobs if you move it 100 feet to the left or the right. Finding the appropriate location for these operations is what’s lacking.”

‘It doesn’t belong’

A west Greeley neighborhood off 71st Street is home to the Triple Creek development. Conversations about the site began nearly seven years ago but for some it’s still an unwelcome neighbor.

Lowell and Margie Lewis moved to Greeley from Connecticut 35 years ago and have been in their current home for 19 years. They never expected to see an oil and gas drill site a short walk from their porch.

The Lewises got notice of the plans and attended multiple informational meetings but they don’t feel like it was sufficient nor was it written in a way for people who aren’t in the industry to fully understand.

Extraction Oil and Gas approached residents in fall 2014 with the intent of building a tankless site and relying on pipelines. The company told residents a year later a tankless site would not happen Lowell Lewis said. By the time construction began however the Triple Creek project received necessary permits and regulatory approval to use pipelines.

“We thought it doesn’t belong in the middle of a neighborhood” Margie Lewis said. “The planning commission felt that it did not belong in the middle of a neighborhood and they voted it down unanimously. Extraction appealed of course to the city government. The city council overrode the planning commission and voted for it.”

Minutes from the Jan. 8 2016 Greeley Planning Commission meeting indicate that the members voted 0-6 against recommending the project to the Greeley City Council. City Council minutes and a Greeley Tribune report from March 2016 show a 5-2 approval. Former Councilman Randy Sleight at the time called the site “too intense” but voted for approval because Extraction followed regulations.

Several neighbors appealed to the COGCC to at least designate the site as a large urban mitigation area. The commission approved the request and imposed additional regulations on Extraction.

Still the Lewises say the neighborhood experienced light sound and air pollution including times when the BTEX burners caught fire. A neighbor who lives closer to the site experienced significant sound issues broken windows and needed door frames reset multiple times Margie Lewis said.

A drilling site near Bella Romero K-8 also by Extraction has been shrouded in controversy receiving positive and highly critical feedback. Some families expressed concern about the health and environment aspect while employees of the industry supported the site.

Greeley Evans District 6 Chief Communications Officer Theresa Myers said there haven’t been major impacts. District 6 has worked closely with the company and provided input on mitigation measures to protect children and their families Myers said. Extraction also reduced the number of wells on the site.

“This particular well site has brought a lot of attention to wells going in near schools” Myers said. “The truth is there are wells all over Weld County and there are wells all over Greeley. It’s difficult to construct anything without it being close to an oil and gas site so we continue to monitor that but it’s just the reality of living in an oil and gas-rich area.”

Unknowns leave residents wondering ‘At what cost?’

Oil and gas development can be messy and risky. The American Petroleum Institute and several production companies acknowledge this fact. There are unknowns with the long-term health and environmental impact.

“I’m OK with data and facts and if the facts show that everything is safe and there’s no problem and there’s no reason to be worried I’m OK with that” Winterbourne said. “The problem is we don’t know what we don’t know. Data-driven decisions for me are what’s important.”

Winterbourne’s home features a CDPHE air quality monitor which allows the organization to evaluate emissions from the site. He previously had Summa canisters from the town of Erie that were used to calculate VOC levels and types of particulates in the air. Unfortunately most findings are not readily shared and must be requested through a public records request.

Occidental releases monthly reports but those are insufficient the residents believe. They say the reports are often hard to understand and it’s too late to take any precautions if there was a spill or high levels of VOCs in the air.

An ongoing study from Anschutz Medical Campus at the University of Colorado indicates children ages 5 to 24 who develop acute lymphocytic leukemia are four times more likely to live in an area with a large number of oil and gas developments.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Environmental Protection Agency warn that benzene a common VOC can cause drowsiness dizziness changes in heart rhythm headaches confusion and death when inhaled in at high levels. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene is linked to leukemia anemia and issues with menstrual cycles.

CU Clinical Assistant Professor Lisa McKenzie head of the Anschutz study said in a release benzene has not been specifically linked but also has not been ruled out. McKenzie received a four-year $792000 grant from the American Cancer Society to continue her research and provide a better understanding of oil and gas development with potential health risks.

“It’s a major stressor. You can’t really look away now that you know what you know” Barnholt said. “It feels like we’re just setting all these kids up to just have cancer.”

Since the Bella Romero site installation District 6 health professionals tracked headaches nose bleeds and other symptoms that could be attributed to the site. It has not found an uptick in these occurrences Myers said.

There was a scare several years ago regarding high emission levels but the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn’t found any more instances of dangerous emission levels.

In fact the site featured CDPHE air quality monitoring tools but they were removed several months ago. Myers said the tools were not registering any unusual readings and the CDPHE needed the equipment elsewhere.

Margie Lewis said her asthma worsened after work began behind their home. She attributes the increased breathing concerns with the site which was the only thing that changed for them. Additionally she said symptoms subside when she is away from the Front Range.

Residents also expressed significant concerns for the environment. Even with technological advances to make the process safer drilling isn’t a process without risks. Companies still run the risk of leaks dust and dirt pollution potential earthquakes when fracking wastewater is re-injected below the surface and water contamination.

“It’s a dirty process. Of course there are going to be some issues from that process” Margie Lewis said. “How long are we going to have those problems and at what cost? What must we incur to have clean air clean water and have vehicles on the road? We all like our cars but we can’t drink dirty water and we can’t drink oil.”

When production is done proper steps must be taken to prevent gas leaks and explosions as well Barnholt and the Lewises said.

They cited the 2017 Firestone house explosion that killed two people and injured two more after a natural gas well was turned back on — with a still-connected flowline that was supposed to be cut in 1999.

Weld County produces roughly 87% of the state’s crude oil and 43% of Colorado’s natural gas according to a report from June 2 providing substantial income. The Lewises and Barnholt however aren’t convinced the potential economic benefits outweigh the risks.

“It’s easy to say it creates great jobs and these people bring taxes into the area and the city is growing. That’s all wonderful but we need to take the long view” Margie Lewis said. “We’ve made that mistake so many times not as a country but in the world taking the short view and dealing with the mess that it creates.”

Developers say transparency is essential

Both production companies say they have been steadfast in following all regulations and being transparent with neighboring property owners.

Occidental finished “completions” at the three pads in late May and have moved to the production phase. Director of Communications and Public Affairs Jennifer Brice said the pads were safe and compliant with all regulations.

“This property had been in our development plans since 2017 before the nearby subdivision was built and we received state permits in September 2019. While we were hoping to complete the work early last year the pandemic interrupted the timeline” Brice said in a statement. “We’ve communicated our plans with the developer residents HOA and homebuilders throughout the process and then directly communicated with residents when drilling operations began in October 2019. As new residents moved in we reached out again when operations resumed.”

Brice said residents and homeowners associations can contact Occidental’s stakeholder relations team. The company expects to return all calls and emails within 24 hours.

Extraction media representative Brian Cain said the company finished the operations phase at Triple Creek in 2018 and has not received any complaints or critical feedback since then.

Cain said the company worked alongside residents in the neighborhood during the development process including the Lewis family.

“We engaged in an extremely transparent process that included dozens of conversations and in-person meetings with Mr. Lewis as well as walking neighboring properties with him and discussing the intricacies of our development plan” Cain wrote in a statement. “All of this collaborative effort was in addition to the broader neighborhood meetings we held to discuss the project.”

Extraction has demonstrated “again and again” its intention to use the best management practices and technology — oil pipelines electric rigs and quiet fleets — even when the company is not required to mitigate the impact of developments according to Cain.

“Since the operations phase concluded Triple Creek has been producing reliably quietly generating the energy resources we all use every day” Cain said.

What do they do next?

These oil and gas sites are not going away and will likely be in place for another several years. Maybe longer. That leaves residents with concerns about their proximity wondering what to do.

Do they move? Do they stay and risk possible health concerns and further development?

Winterbourne doesn’t think it’s feasible for his family to move so he will probably remain at Colliers Hill. He hopes to work as an intermediary between the industry and his neighbors to work together and figure out a way to make the development process better.

“I recognize that the world is currently dependent on these oil and gas operations because that’s one major fuel source used throughout large parts of the world. What I see as more of the negative aspect is that it’s so close” Winterbourne said.

Meanwhile Barnholt said her family may leave. The family can’t do it any sooner than April 2022 due to financial constraints and tax law but they’re evaluating the possibility.

Erie has done a good job lately to try and balance homeowner rights and development Barnholt said. Still she feels the risk is too high and she doesn’t want to damage her family’s health.

“I just did this. I just moved across the country” Barnholt said. “I shouldn’t have to move just because this plan was happening.”

Lastly the Lewises acknowledge things have been better since the drilling stopped. They don’t expect to move right now at least not solely because of this but wish they could do things over again.

“If we’d known how distressing it was going to be and how bad it turned out being I wish we had” Margie Lewis said. “Now that it’s quieted down we’re kind of here. There are other issues living here (in Colorado) like the wildfires but in retrospect we should’ve moved. There were several people who did and they were the smart ones.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS90aGUtYWlyLXRoYXQtaS1icmVhdGhlLXBhcnQtMy1lbmNvcmUtZWRpdGlvbi10aGUtdXNzLWV4aXN0aW5nLWFuZC1wbGFubmVkLWNvMi1waXBlbGluZS1uZXR3b3Jrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Air That I Breathe Part 3 Encore Edition - The U.S.'s Existing and Planned CO2 Pipeline Networks,,,,,,,,,,

Morgan Loyola University Chicago

University boards of trustees hold considerable power over the institutions they govern but get attention only when they’re hiring a new president or if there is a crisis.

Yet increasingly boards aren’t navigating or mediating crises – they are creating them. On June 30 after deliberating in a closed session the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees voted 9-4 to grant journalist MacArthur Fellowship recipient and Pulitzer Prize winner Nikole Hannah-Jones tenure. But that decision came only after a firestorm of public criticism after Hannah-Jones was initially not granted tenure during earlier deliberations by the board.

Hannah-Jones’ case had been supported at every level of the tenure process at UNC-Chapel Hill – including the provost who serves as the chief academic officer and the president – except for the Board of Trustees. That was an oddity. While the system’s statutes delegate personnel decisions about faculty to the board it is common for the board to support faculty and administration’s tenure recommendations at the institution level.

In this case the board initially avoided a final vote on Hannah-Jones’ case and questioned the validity of her work and ability. Similar concerns were not brought up in previous evaluations of candidates for the same position. Initial concerns of the board echoed talking points spread via conservative broadcast media.

In emails obtained by North Carolina journalism outlet The Assembly it also appears board members were in communication with a major donor who disagreed with Hannah-Jones’ approach to journalism. If true that would undermine principles of academic freedom and shared governance among faculty administration and the board – central aspects of tenure evaluation. If donors can influence personnel decisions this undermining is exacerbated.

We are higher education governance scholars who investigate issues of board composition organizational culture and decision-making.

The Hannah-Jones case and other similar episodes demonstrate how board composition and board culture can affect how boards make decisions inserting seemingly political interests and personal values into an arena that is supposed to be free of them. This ideal of objective or at the very least democratically representative decision-making is important to ensuring that the best interests of the institution remain the primary motivation for decisions made.

Boards and equity

Governing boards hold a fiduciary duty to the institution or system they serve. Their role is to support and protect the institutional mission make sure the institution is effectively executing the mission and ensure the institution can continue to execute its mission. Boards often focus on fundraising external relations accountability and oversight.

When functioning well boards make decisions driven by the institution’s best interests – not their own or those of their friends allies or associates.

Although that is the expectation it is not always the practice in decisions ranging from budget allocation to policy setting and presidential hires. The controversial and highly politicized hiring of Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen as University of South Carolina president in 2019 highlighted these concerns and how political connections and motivations can cause board practices to go off course. Caslen has since resigned after admitting to plagiarism.

There’s not much diversity on public universities’ boards. Currently according to an industry survey most of their members are older white men from the business sector.

Yet as higher education becomes increasingly concerned with diversity we have observed that the issue of board diversity seems to be left off the table.

This lack of diversity matters because even when aiming for objectivity research has suggested that board members often find their personal or political values more than intertwined with the decision-making process. Their values are figuratively making the decisions.

State politics’ influence

Public institution boards are mostly appointed by a governor or state legislators.

This can mean that sometimes it is not simply personal or individual political values driving the decisions about everything from academic program approval to presidential hires. Researchers have found that state political climates and ideologies can influence what decisions are made by boards.

One example of this problem is when a board selects a president with strong political alliances but with little or no higher education experience. These decisions can be more troubling if they are made without input from faculty and other institutional stakeholders who customarily weigh in on these important choices.

One study noted that trustees sometimes go beyond their formal roles getting involved in university operations through donations and support to specific areas. They build or broker connections creating external partnerships that may or may not benefit the institution.

Governing boards led by partisan appointees can make higher education institutions arenas for political contests such as the closing of research and academic centers that produce research or hold missions in opposition to a board’s dominant political ideology. These contests in turn take the boards’ focus away from serving students and other members of the university community.

Is there accountability?

It is sometimes suggested by higher education experts and commonly understood by the university community that boards should be independent and autonomous entities unconcerned with the day-to-day and operational issues of diversity and equity. That allows them to provide institutional accountability and oversight.

As scholars who study higher education boards we believe that politicized board composition can reinforce the vestiges of patriarchy and white supremacy among other forms of hegemony within today’s institutions.

Some scholars have also expressed alarm at the increasingly political nature of board decision-making in the form of denials of tenure or presidential turnover.

The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill situation as noted by The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education a non-partisan group that defends free speech on campuses removed the veil of autonomy and independence under which boards have traditionally operated. It has raised concern that governing boards could be motivated by loyalty to political parties and ideologies.

Up until now boards have mostly been invisible players in higher education’s conversation about diversity equity and inclusion.

But boards’ invisibility is eroding. That exposure raises two issues: If board members are accountable to the political figures who appoint them can they still be representative of the institution they govern? Can they contribute to the growing drive for greater diversity equity and inclusion on campuses?

Navigating the challenges

We believe boards can become more accountable and equity-focused by developing and implementing practices that allow them to navigate ever-changing social and political landscapes.

We recently developed a framework to guide boards in carrying out their duties called “Culturally Sustaining Governance.” We show how board decision-making can intentionally prioritize equity as state political realities and cultural wars continue to exert pressure.

Frameworks like ours aid boards in being more accountable while at the same time ensuring the protection of an institution’s viability and reputation. Our framework urges boards to consider the questions of equity as foundational to deliberation and decision-making as opposed to being an afterthought.

Board members operate at the highest levels of university administration. They can make decisions that truly center diversity and equity while carrying out their responsibilities with excellence and diligence. That in the end leads to stronger more equitable institutions that benefit everyone into the future.

Shaffer said he has made some changes to the courtroom and has received a lot of feedback on how the changes have helped. He said he and former Circuit Judge Robert C. Halbritter both attended Tunnelton High School and it was both an honor and privilege to follow in his footsteps.

“As I travel around the state I believe our courthouse is the most beautiful in the state” he said. “And it’s good to have all the courts in one building.”

Changes made by Shaffer are not the only changes the historical courthouse has seen. It has a long and varied history. In fact over the years circuit court in Preston County has been held in a number of different “Court Houses.”

Judge Steve Shaffer stands in front of an early portrait in the courtroom.

The first court convened in storekeeper John Robert’s building. It was known as the Old Red Courthouse. The first term of the Circuit or Superior Court (as it was known then) was held on the first Monday after the fourth Monday in April 1818. Judge Daniel Smith from Rockingham County presided. The building held a jury room space for the clerk of the county and circuit courts a bench and bar. The jail was constructed of logs and near it stood a whipping post.

In 1821 a two-story “Stone Courthouse” was built on the site of the present courthouse. It was constructed by Major William G. Zinn. A stone jail with a whipping post in front of it was also built. In 1845 a movement to move the county seat to Tunnelton failed and it remained in Kingwood. In 1856 it was decided the Stone Courthouse was too small. There was also discussion about moving the county seat to Albright.

The county court appropriated $8000 for the new building. However the lowest bid was $16000. The county court declined raising its appropriation to that amount. A member of the supervisory committee James C. McGrew was given permission by his associates to go forward on his own initiative. McGrew gathered together a workforce of men and began work on the courthouse in the fall of 1856.

McGrew didn’t give up when a storm blew in the unfinished walls. He immediately began rebuilding the courthouse. The cost when completed was $8000 plus and additional $1500 to cover the storm damage. The courthouse built by McGrew served the county from 1857 to 1869.

On March 7 1869 the courthouse burned to the ground from what appeared to be an incendiary act. Elihu Gregg a local landowner was suspected of the act and was indicted. On June 21 1869 Governor W. E. Stephenson issued a proclamation ordering the Circuit Court to be held in the Preston Academy in Kingwood.

Gregg was tried in the Preston Academy on July 12 1869 and was convicted. At that time incendiarism in West Virginia was punishable by death. He was sentenced to be hanged September 2 1869. Before the sentence could be carried out his attorney obtained an order from the Supreme Court for a new trial. That trial also ended in a conviction and Gregg was re-sentenced to be hanged on January 2 1870. A few days later he was told he could have a choice between life in prison or being hanged. Gregg escaped from jail on November 1 1869. He was tracked down arrested again and was eventually pardoned by the Governor.

A clipping at Newspapers.com from Redding PA (The Times Dec 20 1888) speaks of Gregg’s death: “Word has been received here that Elihu Gregg who for 50 years had been the terror of the border farmers of Pennsylvania West Virginia Ohio and Maryland was found dead a few days ago on the West Virginia mountains with a bullet hole in his breast. Gregg who was over 80 years old had just been released from prison in this county for horse stealing and went at once to West Virginia swearing he would kill certain persons whom he charged with treachery to him. It is supposed that he met his death at the hands of one of these mountaineers while trying to carry out his threat. Gregg was a desperate character. In his long career as a horse and cattle thief he managed to elude justice with rare and cunning and skill.”

In 1870 a new brick courthouse was built to replace the one that was destroyed. McCafferty Samlley & Menear constructed the building at a cost to the county of $11000. The building was two stories high. An attempt to move the county seat to Terra Alta was made in 1910. The proposal promised a “new modern up-to-date county courthouse fireproof from basement to top of the dome donated by Terra Alta.” Information at the time promised an $80000 courthouse and a free site for it to be built on. Once again it was decided to keep the county seat in Kingwood.

The brick courthouse was torn down in 1933 and the current courthouse took its place. The sandstone for its facades was quarried locally. The final cost of the courthouse was $113500.90. It was dedicated on August 25 1934.

The soldiers’ monument located on the courthouse lawn was placed there to honor Preston County’s Civil War soldiers. In 1903 the Preston County Commission appropriated $1000 to aid in the construction of the monument. The statue rests on top of a 36-foot-high granite monument inscribed with the words “To the soldiers and sailors of Preston County.” The 40-foot-by-40-foot plot the monument stands on was leased from the county court for $5 in 1895. The lease was for 99 years. The monument was scheduled to be dedicated October 17 1903 but a severe snowstorm delayed the dedication ceremony until October 31 1903. Five thousand people attended the dedication including 100 Civil War soldiers.

In memory of Soldiers and Sailors of Preston County cannon barrel

The cannon a Columbian Siege Gun located on the courthouse lawn was last fired in April of 1861 during the battle of Fort Sumter. The cannon is 12 feet long and has an eight-inch bore. William G. Brown the Kelly Post of the Grand Army of the Republic made arrangements for the cannon to be brought to Kingwood. It was sent by rail to the Kingwood Rail Station. It took three teams of horses to carry the 8500-pound cannon to its final destination in Kingwood. The cost of delivery was $100. Although battles fought during the Civil War demanded more portable weapons the Columbian and other guns developed by Thomas Rodman Robert Parrott and John Dahlgren accounted for most of the heavy artillery used during the war.

On May 30 2021 the Vietnam Veterans Monument will be dedicated on the courthouse lawn. The monument was purchased by Vietnam Veterans Chapter 977 in honor of all Preston County Vietnam Veterans who served during or remain missing in the Vietnam War.

Due to a need for more space an annex was added across the street from the present courthouse. The first floor of the current courthouse is occupied by the Family Court. Magistrates Court is held on the second floor. The Circuit Clerk’s Office and the Judge’s chambers are on the top floor as is the court room.

The courthouse annex across the road from the main courthouse is where the Sheriff’s Tax Office the County Clerk’s Office and the Assessor’s office is located on the first floor. The Prosecuting Attorney’s Office County Commission Office and the Preston County Health Department are located on the second floor of the annex.

The Quad Cities River Bandits first baseman never looks too far ahead never lives in the past.

""I try to never be satisfied"" Pasquantino said. ""We still have two-and-a-half months left in the season and every day is an opportunity to have some good at-bats play some good defense and help my team win.""

Pasquantino is doing just that.

Named Friday by the Kansas City Royals player development office as the organization’s Quad Cities player of the month for June Pasquantino is putting up some big numbers for the River Bandits.

In addition to batting .268 for Quad Cities he leads the High-A Central League with a .571 slugging percentage ranks second in the league with 53 hits third with 15 doubles and 13 home runs fourth with 39 RBIs and is tied for eighth with three triples.

In the month of June the statistics were even better for the Old Dominion graduate from Moseley Va.

Pasquantino hit .346 with 13 doubles three triples and four homers during the second month of the season but he remains a student of the game.

Part of the education Pasquantino receives is delivered in the experiences and thoughts others share during the offseason when he co-hosts a podcast with journalist and broadcaster Alex Feuz.

In 63 episodes since 2020 their podcast ""A Whole New Ballgame"" has featured the stories of people in and around the game.

Featured interviewed guests have included former major leaguer Darryl Strawberry Boston Red Sox play-by-play voice Dave O’Brien NBC Sports Bay Area digital correspondent and podcast host Jessica Kleinschmidt University of Iowa baseball and basketball player Connor McCaffery front-office personnel and some of the game’s top prospects.

The podcasts are available on Apple Podcasts and virtually everywhere podcasts can be found.

During the past two offseasons a pair of podcasts have been released most weeks. No podcasts are produced during the season.

""When I agreed to be part of it I wanted to limit it to the offseason so that I could focus on my own season when it was that time"" Pasquantino said. ""Alex has his own things then as well so it has worked really well.""

Pasquantino was approached about being part of the project shortly after the 2019 season when the 11th round draft selection began his career by batting .294 over 57 games with short-season Burlington (N.C.) in the Appalachian League.

Feuz was supposed to broadcast games for the team in 2020 and the club was looking to pair him with a former Burlington player to interview players who had competed there in the past.

""I was coming off of instructional league and heading into the offseason it was something that sounded interesting. It was Alex’s idea and it was something we started and it has just kept going"" Pasquantino said.

""Alex does the heavy lifting all of the production-type things and he does a great job with that. It’s been a fun experience.""

A communications major at Old Dominion Pasquantino has found it all to be beneficial in a number of ways.

In preparing for interviews he formulates the questions he wants to ask and then learns from the answers he receives.

""I’m learning with every interview. We’re talking with people for a short time but we’re talking to them about major events and experiences in their lives"" Pasquantino said.

""I’m learning a lot about what drives people how they have created their own success stories and there are things I’m learning that I try to apply to my own personal situation.""

Those words those experiences of others are helping Pasquantino progress as his first full-season assignment in baseball continues.

After joining the rest of the country in sitting out the 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic Pasquantino puts to use what he has learned from his coaches — dating back to the defensive mindset of Chris Finwood at Old Dominion — and from those he has interacted with off the field.

""There was a real anxious feeling coming into this season just about getting back to normal"" Pasquantino said.

""I think it was that way for the players the coaches the fans the PA guy who hadn’t done his thing for more than a year I think everybody was anxious. I’m proud of my team and the way they have handled returning to action.""

Pasquantino sees that in the way the River Bandits compete and the way they prepare daily for competition.

""There is always work to do. That never changes in baseball but I think we all enjoy coming out to the ballpark and working together to make something good happen as a team"" Pasquantino said. ""That is always the top priority.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ocGVuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy9yb2NrZXJzLW5vdGVib29rLWJsYWtlbmV5LWhlbHBzLXJvY2tlcnMtaW4tYS1waW5jaC9hcnRpY2xlX2Y5NTdlMzk1LTVkOTEtNTlhMS04Y2EwLTE0MDkxNDVkNmJmNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ROCKERS NOTEBOOK: Blakeney helps Rockers in a pinch,"High Point NC (27260)

Ford Swoons. Toyota after Hoarding Chips Blows Away GM for ...,"Toyota pioneer of just-in-time inventory goes: Hahahahaha…

Ford Motor was the last major automaker to report US sales for June on Friday. Most others reported US sales on Thursday. GM and FCA don’t report monthly sales; they only report quarterly so Q2 sales. Tesla doesn’t report US sales at all; it only reports quarterly global sales and the industry guesses its US sales. The semiconductor shortage and supply-chain fiasco were written all over auto sales in June.

For the auto industry overall sales plunged in June.

June sales for the industry overall fell to 1.30 million vehicles down 14.2% from June 2019 after a strong March April and May (data by Bureau of Economic Analysis). In terms of the Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) of sales which takes the number of selling days and other seasonal factors into account and then annualizes the result vehicle sales came out this way:

June: 15.4 million SAAR -9.5% from June 2019; except for the collapse last spring it was the lowest for any month since January 2014.

May: 17.0 million SAAR -1.0% from May 2019.

April: 18.6 million SAAR highest total for any month in 16 years +7.4% from April 2019.

March: 17.9 million SAAR +7.9% from March 2019.

But don’t cry for automakers. They’re making it up with price.

Automakers have shifted production to their highest profit-margin units; and they’ve cut incentives and dealers are charging record prices over sticker in many cases. As a result the average transaction price and average per-unit gross profits have spiked to records in June as consumers have adopted a new attitude that I have never seen on dealer lots before.

Rather than haggle till they get the price down or go on buyers’ strike as they had done for a couple of years during the Great Recession consumers are paying whatever it takes to get a new or used vehicle as their whole mindset about inflation has changed.

Ford sales hobbled by massive production cuts due to chip shortage.

Ford sounded pretty chipper in the headline of the news release focusing on the few things it did sell more of: “Ford Electrified Vehicle Sales up 117 Percent in June – Delivering New First Half Record – Mustang Mach-E Sales up 27 Percent Over May…”

But Ford’s total sales in June plunged 26.9% year-over-year to 115789 vehicles with retail sales down 32.5%. These are deliveries by dealers to their customers or by Ford to large fleet customers such as rental car companies.

Ford has given up on cars. The only “car” it still manufactures is the Mustang. It killed all its other car lines. And that sales volume just went to Toyota Honda Nissan Kia etc. And total car sales after having collapsed every year for years collapsed by another 82% in June year-over-year to just 2868 Mustangs and a handful of leftover Fusions that were still sitting on dealer lots.

F-150 sales plunged 30% year-over-year in June to 45673 trucks. In terms of SUVs Escape sales plunged 40% to 8871 units Explorer sales plunged 38% to 9445 units and Expedition sales plunged 43% to 7453 units. These are all popular models with plenty of demand.

The problem wasn’t lack of demand but lack of supply. At the end of April Ford announced that it would likely cut global production in Q2 by half. The entire first half was marred by production cuts at various plants. On June 30 Ford announced further production cuts for July and August. The culprit is the same every time: semiconductor shortages and parts shortages.

Toyota paragon of just-in-time inventory blew everyone away by having stockpiled chips.

Following the Fukushima disaster in 2011 which massively tangled up its just-in-time supply chain Toyota demanded from its suppliers that they stockpile two to six months of semiconductors of all kinds for Toyota to deal with supply shocks Reuters reported in March based on sources.

Because of this “business continuity plan” (BCP) when the semiconductor shortages hit suppliers were obligated to prioritize Toyota’s orders. The sources told Reuters that the microcontroller units (MCUs) that often combine CPUs flash memory and other devices and that control functions such as braking acceleration steering ignition combustion tire pressure gauges and rain sensors were hit the hardest by the chip shortages.

A Toyota spokesman told Reuters that one of the goals of its lean-inventories strategy was to become sensitive to inefficiencies and risks in supply chains identify the potentially most damaging bottlenecks and to devise a system to avoid them.

“The BCP for us was a classic lean solution” a spokesman told Reuters. But Toyota pays the suppliers for this service. Turns out those costs were a good investment.

In June Toyota blew everyone away. While inventories were super tight due to production cuts with other automakers Toyota had the supply and could meet demand and demand was huge because people wanting to buy Ford or GM products had trouble finding them and Toyota dealers had product.

And in June Toyota’s total sales skyrocketed by 40% blowing away GM and Ford and everyone. The hated cars that Ford threw under the bus so to speak? Well Toyota sold 68771 cars up 57% year-over-year. Ford sold 2868 cars in June. Ford’s idiotic decision to walk away from cars just handed this market to Toyota and others.

Toyota also sold 77944 SUVs up 19% year-over-year. And it sold 138560 trucks up 33% year-over-year.

GM was bypassed in Q2 by Toyota for the first time ever.

General Motors doesn’t report monthly sales. It only reports quarterly. It reported Q2 sales of 688236 vehicles up 40% year-over-year – including record sales for its EV the Bolt. But it was surpassed for the first time ever by Toyota (688813 units in Q2).

Q2 included May when there was still more inventory and it included April which was the biggest month for the industry since 2005. By reporting only quarterly GM obscured the results of June under the strength of April and May and it still got bypassed by Toyota.

The automakers’ changed data game.

All automakers used to release monthly sales data on the same day a ritual that had been finely honed for many decades. They got these figures from their dealers added them up and released them with sales details by brand and model.

Then came Tesla which didn’t play ball. It didn’t release US sales figures at all but only global sales figures and only quarterly.

Eventually GM stopped releasing monthly figures as well and switched to quarterly then Ford stopped then FCA stopped then others stopped. Last year Ford backtracked and started releasing monthly figures again but usually a day after everyone else. Go figure.

Monthly industry sales totals – both unadjusted and SAAR of sales – are released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis which relies on industry estimates. There are other industry estimates available behind paywall. Getting all the detailed monthly data from automakers directly by brand and model is no longer possible for all automakers including the biggies GM and FCA and that was apparently a good thing because their sales in June were dismal.

UNDERSUPPLY: The firm’s chairman said that the memory and logic chip situation prompted construction of a new factory at the Tongluo Science Park in Miaoli County

By Lisa Wang / Staff reporter





Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (力積電) a power management IC supplier expects to debut on the Taiwan Stock Exchange by the end of this year after shareholders yesterday approved the initial public offering.

The result of the vote indicates that the Powerchip group has emerged from woes caused by a severe industry slump after restructuring efforts Powerchip chairman Frank Huang (黃崇仁) told the firm’s annual general meeting.

Powerchip in 2008 was spun off from Powerchip Technology Corp (力晶科技) a technology holding company.

Powerchip Technology which started as a DRAM chipmaker incurred debt of NT$120 billion (US$4.29 billion) because of an overcapacity-driven industry slump. It paid the debt back over the past few years.

Powerchip Semiconductor has a rosy business outlook for this year after transforming into a supplier of power management chips image sensors and memory chips given a persistent global chip crunch Huang said.

“We are seeing an undersupply of memory and logic chips” he said.

“That is why we started building a new plant at the Tongluo Science Park (銅鑼科學園區)” in Miaoli County he added.

“Our capacity is fully booked for the whole of next year” he said.

“Not a single wafer is left” Huang said dismissing shareholders’ concerns about another round of oversupply.

“It [a supply glut] is not likely to happen” he said.

The new fab would have an installed capacity of 25000 12-inch wafers per month in the first phase when it enters mass production in 2023 Powerchip Semiconductor said.

The company plans to invest NT$278 billion over the next 10 years to quadruple its capacity to 100000 wafers a month the company said.

The capacity expansion plan comes as Powerchip Semiconductor has had difficulty keeping up with orders it said.

Given the demand Powerchip Semiconductor president Brian Hsieh (謝再居) said that revenue would grow 30 to 40 percent this year from last year.

It made NT$45.68 billion last year.

Net profit growth would be even faster Hsieh said adding that it is expected to be much better than last year when Powerchip Semiconductor earned NT$3.81 billion or earnings per share of NT$1.23.

For the whole of this year the chipmaker expects quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue and net profit he said.

The company expects gross margin to keep rising perhaps surpassing local rival Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp (世界先進) in the near future said Huang citing price hikes.

Vanguard posted gross margin of 38.1 percent in the first quarter.

Powerchip Semiconductor did not disclose its first-quarter gross margin but said that pretax profit was NT$2.57 billion.

US said it would review

Heightened geopolitical tensions remain a challenge for the acquisition. Just last month the US said it would review the proposed acquisition of South Korean chip maker Magnachip by Chinese tech-focused private equity fund Wise Road Capital despite the fact that the deal did not involve cutting-edge technology.

News of the deal comes as Beijing pushes for technological self-reliance which has led to resources being poured into developing the domestic semiconductor industry. US sanctions have cut off Chinese companies from chips made with technology of US origin as part of a protracted tech war

Dutch semiconductor company Nexperia a subsidiary of Chinese technology firm Wingtech Technology  is said to be in talks to acquire Newport Wafer Fab (NWF) the UK’s largest chip maker for £63 million (US$87 million) according to a report from CNBC citing anonymous sources on Friday.

CNBC reported that some UK experts have expressed national security concerns about the deal.

A Nexperia spokesperson said the company was still in conversation with NWF and the Welsh government declining to comment further until a conclusion has been reached according to CNBC.

Wingtech did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Saturday.

Founded in 1982 in Newport South Wales NWF is one of the few semiconductor manufacturers in the UK. It is known for its silicon fabrication processes and compound semiconductors according to company information.

In mainland China companies such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) the country’s largest contract chip maker have been cut off from more advanced chip manufacturing technologies that rival foundries in Taiwan and South Korea can still import to advance their chip-making processes. Domestic chip makers have instead focused on building up capabilities in mature nodes and have increased acquisition activity overseas.

This is what Wingtech did in 2019 when it paid 26.8 billion yuan (US$4.14 billion) to buy and consolidate multiple stakes in Nexperia . This gave Wingtech an 80 per cent stake in the Dutch firm which it increased to 98.2 per cent last year after buying out four remaining shareholders for 6.33 billion yuan.

Nexperia has its origins in a separate Chinese acquisition. The company was created in 2017 when a consortium led by Beijing-based finance firms Jianguang Asset Management and Wise Road Capital bought the standard products business unit of NXP Semiconductors for US$2.75 billion.

Nexperia caught the eye of Wingtech as the hardware maker sought to expand into semiconductors. With the acquisition Wingtech got a global leader in gallium nitride (GaN) technology which is considered a third-generation semiconductor technology. The compound which can operate at higher temperatures than silicon has risen in popularity as a way to produce small high-wattage chargers for smartphones and laptops.

Wingtech was founded in 1990 by Zhang Xuezheng who built the company into the world’s largest smartphone original design manufacturer after its start in producing copycat mobile phone motherboards. Some of China’s biggest hardware brands have been Wingtech customers including Huawei Technologies Co Lenovo and Xiaomi

Wingtech’s revenue reached 51.7 billion yuan in 2020 up 24.4 per cent year on year with profit increasing 92.7 per cent to 2.41 billion yuan according to financial filings.

And to be fair the idea of having a mini-computer that you can mold into your hands like play-dough does sound quite fascinating. Well as futuristic as it might be it appears that we are closer to seeing it happen than we might think.

Stanford University researchers have been working on skin-like integrated circuits that can be stretched bent twisted and folded while still functioning at full capacity. This may sound like something out of a sci-fi movie but companies like Samsung are already on their way to develop a stretchy ""electronic skin."" The engineers from Stanford have been focusing on the commercialization of this product namely how to produce this new technology in large quantities for the public. Zhenan Bao a chemical engineer and her colleagues have recently published a new study describing how they have been working on printing stretchy integrated circuits on rubbery skin-like materials. For this method the group used the same equipment that makes solid silicon chips.This allowed them to fit over 40000 transistors in a single square centimeter of stretchable material. And if these digits sound like a lot the team is pretty confident that it can double them. According to the team that number would be enough to make simple circuits for on-skin sensors body-scale networks and possibly implantable bioelectronics.The method they used is called photolithography and it enhances elastic-transistor density by up to 100 times. It uses UV light to transfer a circuit layer by layer onto a solid surface. It's not a new process. It has been used for a long time in the semiconductor industry but stretchable circuits were just not a thing up until now.The issue was that the chemicals used to dissolve and wash away the light-resistant materials also washed away the skin-like polymers aka the base for stretchy circuits. Scientists used the new discovery to create flexible circuits with electrical performance comparable to transistors used in today's computer displays.For now the method is still being tested and developed but who knows we might actually see stretchable electronics commercially available sooner than we might have thought."

Held at the Paramount Miami Worldcenter ""One World One Prayer"" a global anthem produced by renowned artist Emilio Estefan and performed by the Bob Marley and the Wailers cover band will be played at the event. Speaking on the importance of the song Estefan explained that “the tower-lighting signals the critical importance of worldwide unity and prayer at this time of tragedy.”

The iconic skyscraper with will host a digital display of world flags making it the largest mosaic of its kind in America.

It is requested that radio stations play the song at the nighttime. The song will be played at the onset of every hour for two minutes commencing at 5:00 A.M and ending at sunrise. The cycle will then continue at sunset and finish at midnight.

Seen as the tallest digital electronic lightning system in the world the mosaic will exhibit 132 world flags.

Indonesia as part of its ongoing diplomacy with current and potential defense industry partners recently announced discussions between its officials and their counterparts in Romania and South Africa. The talks parallel Jakarta’s efforts to upgrade the capabilities of its Armed Forces and to integrate advanced technology into its defense industry.

Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ Regional Forum Security Policy Conference on May 27 2021 Indonesia’s director general of defense strategy Rodon Pedrason emphasized the importance of capacity building and technology transfer for closing the capabilities gap in new and developing technologies and for “building the trust that enables developing countries to take advantage of these technologies.”

Two days earlier Pedrason was among the Indonesian defense officials who met with a Romanian delegation to discuss boosting the nations’ defense cooperation as well as possible collaboration on a technology transfer project for the Indonesian military according to Indonesia’s Defense Ministry known as Kemhan.

The talks followed 2020 visits by personnel from Indonesia’s embassy in Romania’s capital Bucharest to Romanian defense firms including a helicopter manufacturer and firearms and ammunition makers.

A defense cooperation agreement between Indonesia and South Africa also is nearing completion according to a June 2021 Kemhan news release.

The countries work together to design manufacture and sell armored vehicle systems such as the one pictured for the Indonesian Armed Forces. The collaboration dates to a 2019 agreement between Indonesia’s state-owned defense firm PT Pindad and South Africa’s Paramount Group a global aerospace and technology company.

Jakarta has big ambitions for restocking the Indonesian military online magazine Defense News reported May 10 2021. These include requests for a dozen diesel-electric submarines for the Navy as well as improvements to existing vessels and new fighter squadrons for the Air Force. The plans emphasize domestic production.

The fourth quarter of 2020 also saw a flurry of similar outreach by Indonesia to other countries according to The Jakarta Post newspaper. A defense cooperation agreement was signed with Sweden in September; talks were held with France in October to perform defense equipment upgrades; and acoustic torpedo countermeasures — jammers and decoys — were imported from Turkey in November.

Over the past five decades Musk has become the CEO of Tesla founded SpaceX and The Boring Company and co-founded OpenAI and Neuralink all while focused on his long-term goal: escaping Earth and colonising Mars.

But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Musk. He went from getting bullied in school to becoming a small-time entrepreneur almost going broke then inciting lawsuits and government scrutiny as his wealth and influence grew. Today he is one of the most controversial figures in the world of business.

His South African beginnings

Elon Musk was born on June 28 1971 in Pretoria South Africa.

His father is Errol Musk a South African engineer pilot sailor and property developer.

Musk’s mother Maye is a professional dietitian and model . She has appeared on boxes of Special K cereal and the cover of Time magazine. In 2017 at the age of 69 she landed a contract with cosmetic company CoverGirl.

After their parents divorced in 1979 nine-year-old Elon and his younger brother Kimbal decided to live with their father. It wasn’t until after the move that Musk’s now notorious troubled relationship with his dad began to emerge. “It was not a good idea” Musk said in a Rolling Stone interview about moving in with his father.

In 1983 at the age of 12 Musk sold a simple game called Blastar to a computer magazine for US$500. Musk has been widely quoted as describing it as “a trivial game ... but better than Flappy Bird”.

Still Musk’s school days weren’t easy – he was once hospitalised after being attacked by bullies who threw him down a set of stairs and beat him until he blacked out.

After graduating from high school Musk moved to Canada with his mother Maye his sister Tosca and his brother Kimbal and spent two years studying at Queen’s University in Kingston Ontario.

Degrees earned – and given up

Musk finished his studies at the University of Pennsylvania earning degrees in physics and economics.

While there Musk and a classmate Adeo Ressi once rented out a 10-bedroom frat house and turned it into a nightclub – one of his first entrepreneurial experiments.

After graduating Musk moved to Stanford University for his PhD – but he barely started the programme before leaving it. He deferred his admission after only two days in California deciding to try his luck in the dot-com boom that was just getting under way. He never returned to finish his studies at Stanford.

Early dot-com ventures

With his brother Kimbal Musk launched Zip2. A cluster of Silicon Valley investors helped fund the company which provided city travel guides to newspapers like The New York Times and Chicago Tribune.

While Zip2 got off the ground Musk literally lived in the office and showered at a local YMCA. The hard work paid off when Compaq bought Zip2 in a deal worth US$341 million in cash and stock earning Musk US$22 million.

Musk next started X.com an online banking company. He launched the company in 1999 using US$10 million of the money he got from the Zip2 sale. About a year later X.com merged with Confinity a financial start-up co-founded by Peter Thiel to form PayPal.

Musk was named the CEO of newly minted PayPal – but that wouldn’t last long. In October 2000 he started a huge fight among the PayPal co-founders by pushing for them to move its servers from the free Unix operating system to Microsoft Windows. PayPal co-founder and then CTO Max Levchin pushed back hard.

While Musk was en route to Australia for a much-needed holiday PayPal’s board fired him and made Thiel the new CEO. “That’s the problem with vacations” Musk told Fortune years later about his ill-fated trip in late 2000.

But things worked out for Musk – he made another windfall when eBay bought PayPal in late 2002. As PayPal’s single biggest shareholder he netted US$165 million of the US$1.5 billion eBay paid.

Even before the PayPal sale Musk was dreaming up his next move including a wild plan to send mice or plants to Mars. In early 2002 Musk put up US$100 million to found the company that would be known as Space Exploration Technologies or SpaceX. Musk’s stated goal was to make space flight cheaper by a factor of 10.

Joining Tesla

Musk has also been keeping busy pushing progress here on Earth particularly with Tesla Motors. In 2004 Musk made the first of what would be US$70 million of total investments in the electric car company co-founded by veteran start-up exec Martin Eberhard.

Musk took an active product role at Tesla helping develop its first car the Roadster. The all-electric model debuted in 2006 when Musk was serving as Tesla’s chairman. He’s now also its CEO.

In 2007 Musk staged a boardroom coup at Tesla first ousting Eberhard from his CEO seat and then from the company’s board and executive suites entirely.

In 2008 with the financial crisis seriously limiting his options Musk personally saved Tesla from bankruptcy. Musk invested US$40 million in Tesla and loaned the company US$40 million more. Not coincidentally he was named the company’s CEO the same year.

But between SpaceX Tesla and another venture SolarCity Musk nearly went broke. According to various media he describes 2008 as “the worst year of my life”. Tesla kept losing money and SpaceX was having trouble launching its Falcon 1 rocket. By 2009 Musk was living off personal loans.

Family life

Musk’s love life was in upheaval too: he divorced his wife Justine a Canadian author in 2008. The couple had got married in 2000. Their first son – Nevada – died of SIDS at 10 weeks old but they went on to have twins and triplets all boys.

Musk started dating actress Talulah Riley later that year. They went on to get married in 2010 then divorced in 2012. In July 2013 they remarried. In December 2014 Musk filed for a divorce but withdrew the paperwork. In March 2016 Riley filed for divorce which was finalised that October.

Changing fortunes

At Christmas 2008 Musk got two pieces of good news: SpaceX had landed a US$1.5 billion contract with Nasa to deliver supplies into space and Tesla had finally found more outside investors.

By June 2010 Tesla held a successful initial public offering. The company raised US$226 million becoming the first car company to go public since Ford in 1956. To get his finances back on track Musk sold shares worth about US$15 million in the offering.

Musk’s extraordinary career was starting to get noticed in other circles too most notably in Hollywood. Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of Tony Stark in the Iron Man films is at least partially based on Musk. He even had a cameo in Iron Man 2 (2010).

SpaceX racks up successes

By the end of 2015 SpaceX had made 24 launches on assignments such as resupplying the International Space Station setting lots of records along the way. In 2016 the SpaceX Falcon 9 achieved an especially important goal: making the first successful ocean landing of a reusable orbital rocket.

In late 2015 Musk co-founded OpenAI a non-profit dedicated to researching artificial intelligence and ensuring it doesn’t destroy humanity.

Musk has expressed concern that the race for better AI could end up sparking a third world war.

In February 2018 Musk announced he was stepping down from the board of OpenAI to avoid any potential conflicts of interest with Tesla which has made strides into artificial intelligence for its self-driving car technology.

Musk courts controversy

After a year of dating Aquaman actress Amber Heard the two broke up in 2017 . Musk later said in an interview with Rolling Stone that the break-up was very hard on him.

The year was a bit rocky from a political standpoint as well. Musk joined president Trump’s business advisory council a move which caused a huge public backlash. He initially defended the move but he quit after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change . Musk said he tried to convince Trump not to withdraw.

In the spring of 2018 there was a new development in Musk’s personal life – he and the musician Grimes struck up a relationship . They reportedly hit it off after they both made the same nerdy joke about artificial intelligence.

SEC vs Musk

Musk ran into trouble in 2018 when he sent a tweet declaring he was considering taking Tesla private at US$420 per share and that he had already secured funding. Just a few days later the SEC sent Tesla subpoenas about the company’s plans to go private and Musk’s comments.

By September the SEC had formally filed a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of making “false and misleading statements”. Musk settled with them which resulted in both he and Tesla paying a US$20 million fine and Musk agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board.

Additionally Tesla was required to appoint a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

New arrivals

In November 2019 Musk debuted a new Tesla vehicle: the Cybertruck the company’s first – and very highly anticipated – pickup truck.

Since the unveiling Musk has been spotted a few times cruising around in the truck including on a night out to dinner at Nobu with Grimes.

Grimes then dropped a bombshell in January 2020 when she posted a photo of herself where she appeared pregnant. The musician later confirmed that she was expecting a baby with Musk.

Outspoken on Covid-19

Musk has been outspoken about the coronavirus crisis in the US since early March when he first tweeted that panic over the virus was “dumb”.

Since then Musk has gone on to promote a malaria drug as a potential treatment for Covid-19 patients despite a lack of scientific proof has caused confusion over his promise to deliver ventilators to hospitals and has promoted misinformation such as a tweet that said “kids are essentially immune” from the virus.

Soon to be homeless

Despite having a substantial real estate portfolio at the time Musk said in mid-2020 that he “will own no house” and would sell almost all of his physical possessions. By June 2021 he had reportedly sold at least seven properties on Zillow and was planning to sell his last remaining house.

2020 milestones

In May 2020 SpaceX partnered with Nasa to complete its first launch of astronauts into space. Then in November SpaceX completed its first “operational” human space flight by sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-month stay.

Today thanks to Tesla’s stock surging in 2020 in line with other tech stocks Musk is the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of US$167.1 billion according to Forbes. His wealth surpassed Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and now is second only to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.

If so the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in Louisville wants you to think twice because there is a new scam on the rise that involves just that.

What You Need To Know BBB urges caution of messages or videos on social media by someone you know regarding something that sounds too good to be true like an investment opportunity involving Bitcoin Cash App and Venmo



Scammers have their victims make a video stating how much money they made which is posted when the scammers take over the victim’s account



People who see the video of someone they know and trust makes them more vulnerable to fall for the scam



If you are a victim of this scam report it to police and the BBB

“If it’s too good to be true it’s not true” said Joseph Thompson which is a lesson he learned the hard way because he was recently scammed out of $300.

In late May Thomson watched a Facebook story video by his son’s friend.

“It said ‘I just got a grant. They gave me so much money from the grant. You know try it out’ and it showed him there holding his driver’s license” Thompson said.

Thompson was curious so he messaged his son’s friend but unbeknownst to him it was actually a scammer who had taken over his son’s friend’s Facebook profile. That person then connected Thompson to another person on Facebook who had information on the opportunity. Thompson chatted with both of them on Facebook Messenger at the same time.

“And they are using me back-and-forth and because I feel like I’m in contact with him at the same time is why they were able to get me because I trusted him and it wasn’t him that I was talking to” Thompson explained.

Thompson said he was skeptical about the opportunity at one point asking “his son’s friend” if it was a scam. Thompson also asked to call “his son’s friend” but the scammer kept Thompson hooked.

“I kept telling him at first ‘Call me call me let me talk to you’ and then they were like ‘Man it’s 12 o’clock. It’s late; you want to talk now?’ And I was like ‘I just wanna make sure it’s not a scam.’ He’s like ‘Well it’s me man. You are talking to me. You are on here messaging me. You seen my video. I’m telling you just do what they tell you to do and they are going to give you the money” Thompson explained.

Thompson was given a Cash App link to transfer Bitcoin which is how he was told he’d make money.

“‘We’ll invest it in bitcoin and we’ll go from there and then we’ll send you a check. We’ll put the money on your Cash App for the money that you gave us. We’ll double it or triple it’ or something like that they told me” Thompson said. “And it made sense to me at the time. I think I got more caught up at the time thinking what I was gonna to use the money to do.”

Once Thompson transferred the bitcoin on Cash App he said the scammers asked for his Facebook password and driver’s license stating the information was needed to verify his identity to complete the transaction.

“After I sent the money then I was gullible for anything after that because I wanted to make sure that I got to the end so I got my money” Thompson said.

They also asked Thompson to make a video which he did. You can watch his video below.

“Hello out there. For everybody who thinks this is a scam; it’s not. I put in my deposit took my time answer my questions before I know it $3000” he said in the video.

However Thompson never got anything. A month after that Thompson told Spectrum News the scammers posted a story on his Facebook profile since they took over his Facebook account. The story showed a fake photo of his Cash App account with $9000 in it plus the video Thompson made.

“We have a cousin of ours who got scammed for $50. We have a friend who got scammed for $500. We have a friend who got scammed for $800 and that’s right now all that I know of people who have got back in contact with me” Thompson said.

Thompson’s wife put up a warning about the scam as her main Facebook profile photo to alert friends and family. Thompson also made a post to warn his Facebook friends about it on a new Facebook profile he created.

Whitney Adkins director of strategic marketing for the Better Business Bureau that serves Louisville Southern Indiana and Western Kentucky said this scam is new and rapidly on the rise.

“Just recently I believe it was last month we encountered a victim who had lost thousands of dollars essentially all of her savings to this exact same scam. It was heartbreaking really” Adkins said.

“I think one of the reasons folks are falling for the scam or becoming victim to the scam is because a lot of times the victims inadvertently become part of the scam themselves” Adkins explained. “We’ve seen situations where folks are messaged by whom they believe to be a close friend or family member on Facebook inviting them into a Bitcoin investment opportunity.”

Adkins advised people to be cautious of messages from someone you know that sound too good to be true like an investment opportunity with Bitcoin.

“I suggest that you reach out to the person via another channel on their phone shoot them an email or a text and say ‘Hey is this really you” Adkins explained. “Confirm that it’s them first and foremost because often the problem is that their loved one's account has been hacked and that person may not even realize it. So they are receiving Facebook messages for someone who is not actually their friend or loved one.”

Adkins also said to watch out for anything on social media that promises an immediate financial gain without much effort especially anything that involves Bitcoin Venmo or CashApp.

“It’s not that these sites or programs are in and of themselves bad. It’s unfortunately that scammers are using them to practice their scams” Adkins said.

She also said people should be weary of any opportunity requiring an immediate response.

“Because that’s how these scams thrive. They thrive on a person’s emotional response and they thrive on them acting right away and giving the scammer access to their account to their apps like CashApp or Venmo or what have you” Adkins said.

If you believe you’ve been a victim of a scam like this Adkins recommends to file a police report contact your local Better Business Bureau so they can file a report and if the scam affects your bank account reach out to your bank or other financial institution.

Thompson showed Spectrum News his chat with CashApp regarding getting his money back but was told “After taking a look at your account we can’t reverse a Bitcoin transaction once it’s completed.”

Adkins also told Spectrum News that it can be very hard to get one’s money back from digital wallets like CashApp and Venmo.

“Only use them [digital wallets] with people that you know and trust” she said.

But his fame and earnings that came with it were exploited by a small streamer who he believed to be a friend as they apparently stole $25000 from him.

Chance ‘Sodapoppin’ Morris is still one of the most-followed streamers on Twitch today but in 2015 when it was still a growing platform he was right at the very top. He averaged over 20000 concurrent viewers which at the time was almost unheard of for any other streamer bar a couple.

Just like today in 2015 Chance lived with other streamers including his ex LegendaryLea Nick ‘Nmplol’ Polom and Malena. A smaller streamer known as MatthewJk also stayed with them and allegedly abused the trust to steal tens of thousands.

Although Sodapoppin rarely spoke of the incident after it happened Nick Polom explained how it went down in a stream on July 2.

Nmplol reveals how Sodapoppin was robbed

Explaining the story to Maya Higa Polom and Malena retold how the small streamer bragged about paying for an expensive meal for the group despite actually paying for it with Sodapoppin’s money.

After revealing the total amount stolen was $25000 Nick explained “Chance at one point logged into his [PayPal on his iPad] and saved it.” It’s then alleged that Matthewjk “sent himself $25000.”

However despite initially considering legal action Nick explains that because the thief then left the state it would become a federal issue and that the time and money spent fighting the situation could be more costly than the amount stolen.

Old Tweets and Reddit posts from Nick at the time shed more light on the situation. In one Tweet from September 2015 Polom took aim at Matthewjk over the incident.

On Reddit he clarified why he made the Tweet saying: “I had enough of him tweeting about all these cases openings (500 cases like 5 different days) new PC parts and sh*t knowing full well he stole that money. Just had enough. Kid has no soul when I asked him about it he didn’t even deny it just wanted to know how we found out.

Sodapoppin himself has rarely addressed the situation outside of a Tweet also from September 2015 where he said he had all the necessary evidence to pursue charges.

However it appears the case was never taken any further.

“I’m very obsessed with the strappy sandal. I can’t get one of my lovely ladies out of this awesome affordable Femme LA heel. We literally have them in every color” said Reilly who is responsible for the street style and red carpet looks of clients Hailey Bieber Megan Fox and Ciara among others.

Though the go-to sandals may not be easy to walk in Reilly admitted the silhouette is a great style hack when looking to elevate any outfit. “Even with jean shorts in the summer wearing a strappy sexy sandal is super hot and it elongates the leg. It is very flattering” she said.

Bieber has been a prime example. Last month she was seen in Paris for instance wearing a cutout knit LaQuan Smith dress with a halter silhouette paired with her go-to Femme LA vegan sandals that retail for just $189.

Other shoe brands Reilly can’t get enough of are Amina Muaddi and Bottega Veneta.

One trend she isn’t jumping on however is the divisive flip flop. “That’s a big no for me” she said noting that slide sandals or sport sandals that offer a bit of an edge are doable.

Although when it comes to fashion it is not about following trends Reilly added.

“That’s what I love so much about what I do — each of my clients are totally different girls and what one loves the other doesn’t. And it’s my job to make sure that I’m paying attention to what each of them want to wear and who they are as women” she said. “My girls dress for themselves and what they find to be the most flattering for them. Wearing what you’re comfortable in and what is best for your body is always my go-to recommendation.”

Besides the strappy sandal Reilly said using color in ensembles this summer is a must. “Even if it’s just the bag and the shoe and the rest of the fit is really neutral that pop of color can be really sexy. A bright toenail too is an easy and simple way to embrace color” she said.

While Reilly often has the top designers at her fingertips she is a fan of mixing high and low. And to show her followers and fashion fans how easy it is to break purchases into smaller more manageable amounts the stylist partnered with PayPal to use the company’s Pay in 4 feature in order to pay in increments. To top it off she is then styling her favorite summer pieces together and will be sharing the final outfit next week.

According to research by PayPal while the return of heels and dressing up again is having a comeback 60% of Gen Z and Millennials are rethinking what items they need and how they plan to pay for them. With that in mind more consumers are leaning towards the “buy now pay later” trend with 57% feeling it’s a smarter way to shop."

A strike is set to begin Monday.,"Employees at Topeka's Frito Lay plant voted Saturday to reject a proposed labor contract with the company paving the way for a strike to begin on Monday.

While workers had previously voted to go on strike last week negotiations between Local 218 of the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union and PepsiCo Frito Lay's parent company had continued in a bid to reach a deal.

Union leadership and management reached a tentative two-year deal this week but roughly 400 of its members voted it down after two days of voting which culminated Saturday.

Union members have criticized the company for working conditions at the plant and have pressed for a pay hike in their next deal.

More:Members of Topeka's local Frito-Lay union just voted to strike. Here's what we know.

Mark Benaka business manager for Local 218 said the vote was ""overwhelming"" in its opposition to the proposed deal which would have brought a 2% pay raise as well as limits on mandatory overtime among other items.

While Benaka noted management had come around on the overtime element after initial opposition he said members likely felt the wage package was not sufficient as they voted against the offer.

""It was very decisive"" Benaka said. ""It is obvious we're far apart on the discretions forced on employees over the last ten years. Basically they're not going to take it anymore.""

Benaka said last month it would be the first time since the union was started in 1973 that a strike will take place.

Workers had been operating under a two-year agreement which ran out in September of 2020 and was extended through Sunday.

More:'Ready to walk': Topeka's Frito-Lay workers take a vote that may prevent strike. Union president isn't optimistic.

In a statement PepsiCo argued it had worked to meet the demands of workers and committed to fully continue operations at the plant in light of the strike.

""That the union membership rejected this fully recommended agreement suggests union leadership is out of touch with the sentiments of Frito-Lay employees"" the statement said. ""Because the union had fully recommended our tentative agreement we do not anticipate any further negotiations with the union for the foreseeable future.""

According to John Nave executive vice president of Kansas AFL-CIO the state's labor federation a strike is the last thing workers want when negotiating union contracts. He expected donations from the community and other labor unions throughout the state as the strike date nears.

""It's kind of like the last line of defense"" Nave said. ""And that's a hard decision because it affects many many people. Union members don't want to do that. ... But when the company fails to do a fair negotiation at the bargaining table — and history has shown (Frito-Lay has) repeatedly failed to do that — then there's no other alternative.""

PepsiCo's seven divisions include Frito-Lay one of the largest snack-selling companies in the U.S. whose Topeka plant is at 4236 S.W. Kirklawn Ave.

“Optimist and sunshine-seeker passionate about inclusion brands and people-focused marketing.”

Hometown: Sugar Land TX

Fun fact about yourself: I got my literal 15 seconds of fame on a Turkish reality TV show. My friends and I were approached by a TV crew in a Macao club and were asked to pretend to be the main character’s friends for a few scenes. We got a free table out of it!

Undergraduate School and Degree: The University of Texas at Austin; Bachelor of Business Administration in marketing minor in anthropology

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? I was a digital operations manager at the Target Corporation (digital media specifically AdTech)

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? PepsiCo Frito-Lay

Where will you be working after graduation? PepsiCo Frito-Lay

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School: Haas MBA Association (Full-time MBA student government association) VP of Communications; Haas Marketing Club VP of Careers; Berkeley Board Fellow (served on local non-profit board); Haas Career Management Group Peer Advisor; Oski (Berkeley Haas student cohort) Communications Representative

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? The extracurricular achievement I am most proud of is serving as a peer advisor for Haas’ Career Management Group (CMG). It’s been amazing to coach the Class of 2022 in their internship search which is actually more soul searching than anything! I’ve enjoyed sharing my passion for brand management and marketing especially in the CPG/retail industries with interested and brilliant peers. We’ve had a record number of people pursue recruitment for brand management this year which is especially exciting given the disruption in DTC and e-commerce and the growing importance of purpose-driven strong brands in this pandemic era and beyond.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? The achievement I’m most proud of is being an advocate for inclusion at Target. I’ve worked with courageous and brilliant colleagues in official employee resource groups and organizations and unofficially within my team and department to create and maintain a work culture that celebrates authenticity. The work culture not only shapes the employee experience but also the output and product that consumers see from the brand.

Why did you choose this business school? Sometimes you get to choose who your family is and I’ve found that to be true at Haas. I chose Haas for the amazing culture hands down. Haasies are the most consistently loving welcoming genuine group I have come across. I was worried b-school would be like college with distinct groups and internationals living lives separate from the American students but Haas truly does feel like one big family. For a business school experience that was disrupted immensely with some real lemons I feel lucky to be able to make lemonade every day with my Haas family.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Veselina Dinova. Veselina is a trusted friend and an expert in her field. Even in Zoom class Veselina creates a classroom atmosphere that promotes asking questions without fear. She explains complicated concepts simply and makes an effort to ensure that everyone is understanding and feeling above water. Furthermore Veselina makes an effort to personally get to know every student in her classes by reaching out to individual students for virtual coffees or connecting with project teams. She teaches accounting-focused classes. To say that those have been some of my favorite classes as a poet (and very much not a quant) has to say something about her as a professor.

What is the biggest myth about your school? The biggest myths about Haas are that the class size is too small and the alumni network is not as robust. It’s my last semester and I am still finding new people to get to know! The benefit of the small class size is that we know everyone’s names and we truly get to know our classmates on a deeper level. Also Haasies are everywhere! While there are definite regional and industry trends when it comes to Haas graduates I have found and connected with Haasies in unexpected places such as skincare/beauty CPG VC (where I hope to end up) and in the Texas suburbs.

What surprised you the most about business school? The academic rigor. I’ve been enjoying the personal professional and academic challenges as well as learning from my classmates. I am blown away by how brilliant and humble my classmates are—we’ve got a goldmine!

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I didn’t decide to apply to business school until the fall application cycle so I had to move quickly to make round two deadlines. I turned a wall in my studio apartment into a Memento-esque board full of post-its and taped pieces of paper that included personal reflections deadlines and proposed timelines and notes from calls with current students at my target schools. I think the rapid pace of my application process made me focus on tightening my personal statements and essays. I didn’t waste time writing additional essays for schools I wasn’t in love with. This approach allowed me to focus on Haas the culture clubs and courses via in-depth conversations with current students. By the end I was even more certain in my decision to apply.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I most admire my classmate Akonkwa “Akon” Mubagwa. He is the most generous kind-hearted and gregarious person I know. Akon has been crucial in creating a sense of community not only within our class but also facilitating bonds between second-year and first-year students (which is much harder given that our campus and beloved courtyard has been shuttered due to the pandemic). I admire his open-heartedness and open-mindedness; he is a deep listener and non-judgmental. On top of all that his work ethic is impeccable. He is getting his social impact-focused startup off the ground in addition to everything else in the b-school flurry.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? VERY disruptive. Haas is not a commuter school and a large reason the culture is so distinct is because most Haasies live within a mile or two of the school. We all hang out on and around campus. Quarantine and the sudden shift to remote instruction dramatically impacted our experience and essentially halted everything except classes for a while. As a student leader I learned a lot about how the school operates within the public university system the city the county the state and the federal government when it comes to navigating something as unprecedented as this pandemic and how to mitigate it. Despite all the hardship we’ve been counting our blessings coming together as a community and making the most of what we can for our experience.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My mom influenced my decision to pursue business in college. I tell her my goals and dreams and she reminds me of them when I am feeling stuck. I couldn’t have asked for a more invested cheerleader coach and best friend in my personal and professional life. When my parents were moving out of my childhood home in 2018 I found a drawing I had made in 4th grade. The prompt on top of the page said “Draw yourself at age 30.” I had drawn a woman in a suit and scrawled under it “I am a CMO.” I have no idea how 10-year-old me knew what a CMO was but 10-year-old me definitely didn’t understand how young 30 is. Regardless my mom had kept that drawing and reminded me of it when I first told her I was contemplating business school because I was feeling stuck at my media job. I think often about how she moved to this country younger than I am now with a toddler in tow to give me the opportunities she could only dream of. I am so grateful for her keeping me on track with my own dreams.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

1) Become a consistent mentor. I am immensely grateful for all the mentorship and guidance I have received on my professional journey. Giving back and lifting up those after me is something I am looking forward to as I get more work and life experience.

2) Create an inclusive skincare/beauty brand from scratch. I’m still working on fleshing out this bucket list item. I didn’t think I had an entrepreneurial spirit before business school but the startup bug bites hard out here in the Bay.

What made Aditi such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Aditi has been fully engaged in supporting the community since joining the program. Despite the challenges of the COVID era she’s been a leader in student government working as VP of Communications to improve and maintain good communication between the school and the full-time MBA student population. Her energetic and positive attitude has helped carry others through a difficult time. In addition she’s served as a peer advisor with our Career Management Group helping to advise first-year students who are pursuing careers in marketing. She has also served on the Board of Directors of a local non-profit organization through the Berkeley Board Fellows Program supporting NIAD a local art center and gallery for adult artists with disabilities.

Her enthusiasm for life and work her positive attitude and her genuine passion for serving her community have made her an invaluable member of our program.

Almost all people hospitalized for Covid-19 are not vaccinated — 99.9% as of May to be exact according to a recent Associated Press report. Yet 13% of U.S. adults said they will ""definitely not"" get a COVID-19 vaccine as recently as late May according to Kaiser Family Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. Another 12% wanted to ""wait until it has been available for a while to see how it is working for other people."" Vaccinating the majority of the population is the best way to help avoid further surges from constantly evolving variants like the current delta variant which is quickly spreading in the U.S. and other countries. Still Moderna co-founder Noubar Afeyan understands the hesitation to get a new vaccine. ""The vaccines came out in such a [short] timeframe that people assumed automatically it can't possibly be safe"" Afeyan said during a talk at a Solve at Massachusetts Institute of Technology event in May. ""In fact many many people were on television espousing the view that — experts for that matter — that if it's done in less than five years it's got to be unsafe all of which is untrue. ""Nevertheless people get confused."" What people might not understand is that extensive research was being done on mRNA technology and other mRNA vaccines for years. That decade plus of experience and the innovation of mRNA technology itself is what allowed Moderna to produce its Covid mRNA vaccine so quickly as the pandemic struck. And it could also change the future of medicine. Here's what you need to know about how the Moderna Covid-19 mRNA vaccine was developed.

The timeline: A vaccine in under a year

It is true that Moderna's mRNA vaccine was ready remarkably fast as was Pfizer's. Chinese scientists put the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus online on Jan. 11. Over the next two days the NIH and Moderna used it to plot out a vaccine. Afeyan remembers getting a key call about the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. ""January 21st my daughter's birthday.... I got a call from Davos [during The World Economic Forum] from the CEO of Moderna"" he says. Bancel had been approached by a number of public health groups at the conference ""urging"" him to work on a vaccine. ""We literally decided overnight...to try and do this"" Afeyan said at MIT. Moderna delivered the first doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the NIH for testing on Feb. 24 2020 and ""the first Moderna shot went into a volunteer's arm in Seattle on March 16 2020"" according to Afeyan. After testing the Moderna vaccine on 30000 volunteers on Dec. 18 2020 the FDA authorized it for emergency public use and three days after that the first Moderna vaccines were administered to front-line health workers according to Afeyan.

Over a decade of research to innovate mRNA as a 'bioplatform'

One of the reasons Moderna's mRNA Covid vaccine development moved so quickly is because scientists had been working with mRNA for years. ""Messenger RNA technologies have been in development from a basic science perspective for over 15 years"" Kizzmekia Corbet the scientific lead for the Coronavirus Vaccines & Immunopathogenesis Team at NIH who helped make the vaccine possible told the NIH Record. And Moderna has been working with mRNA technology ""since its inception in 2010 for myriad therapeutic areas"" including cancer therapies Afeyan tells CNBC Make It (by way of a spokesperson) and with clinical development of mRNA-based antiviral vaccines since 2015. What Moderna did over many of those years was develop mRNA as what scientists call a bioplatform which allows for speedier vaccine development. Bioplatforms are systems that can easily be scaled and tailored for many different diseases. Traditionally developing any vaccine essentially has been a bespoke effort. ""The benefits of a bioplatform is the ability to quickly redeploy the platform once established and refined — in the case of Moderna's mRNA platform to create and test new vaccines based on new viral sequences"" Afeyan tells CNBC Make It (by way of a spokesperson). All of this makes mRNA vaccines virtually programable. Corbet and Bancel describe the process as ""plug and play."" ""MRNA is always made of four same letters Bancel said on the December Andreessen Horowitz podcast ""Bio Eats the World."" (MRNA is genetic material similar to DNA so its ""code"" is expressed with letters.) It's ""the four letters of life like zeros and one in software"" said Bancel. ""This is like software or LEGO."" ""The only difference between"" mRNA vaccines is ""the order of the letter; the zeroes and ones of life"" Bancel said. ""The manufacturing process is the same the equipment is the same with the same operators. It's the same thing. And so this is why we could go so fast.""

Faster vaccine development in the future",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXIuYWMudWsvZGlzY292ZXIvbmV3cy9jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lcy1jb21iaW5pbmctYXN0cmF6ZW5lY2EtYW5kLXBmaXplci1tYXktYm9vc3QtaW1tdW5pdHktLW5ldy1zdHVkeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID vaccines: combining AstraZeneca and Pfizer may boost immunity – new study,"Late last year I asked: is it safe to have more than one type of COVID-19 vaccine? A trial has now addressed that question as well as what effect combining different vaccine types has on immunity.

Most COVID-19 vaccines require two doses and the usual strategy is to give people the same vaccine type for both. But the Com-Cov study led by the University of Oxford recruited over 800 participants from across the UK to investigate the effects of giving people different vaccines for their first and second jabs. Two vaccines were studied: those made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

So is mix and match an option? The trial’s results are preliminary having yet to be reviewed by other scientists but the answer appears to be yes. Giving people different types of COVID-19 vaccine appears not only to be safe but also a potential way of boosting protection against the coronavirus.

However the exact benefits depend on which vaccine goes first and which second. Taking the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by the Pfizer one resulted in a striking increase in antibodies against the coronavirus’s spike protein (a key part of its outer structure) compared to using the AstraZeneca vaccine for both doses or Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.

Taking the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Pfizer resulted in a better T cell response than all other combinations of doses. T cells – also known as T lymphocytes – are immune cells that help kill invading germs (such as the coronavirus) and support antibody production.

The Com-Cov study will next look at whether mixing and matching doses like this provides as good results when a larger gap is left between doses. The time between doses in this initial trial was 28 days but a parallel study is stretching this to 84 days. The results are yet to be reported.

An expected outcome?

Other researchers have also been studying mixing vaccine types to fight COVID-19. A Spanish study recently reported that people who initially received the AstraZeneca vaccine experienced a massive increase to their antiviral immunity when given a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine – providing more evidence that Pfizer works well as a booster.

To understand why these beneficial effects might be happening it’s important to understand how the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines work. Both present a key element of the coronavirus – again the spike protein – to the immune system but do so using different methods.

The Pfizer approach packs the genetic code for the coronavirus’s spike protein into fatty nanoparticles. When these particles enter the body’s cells the code is read and copies of the spike protein are produced leading to an immune response. The AstraZeneca vaccine delivers the same genetic code but uses a weakened form of a common cold virus (an adenovirus) from chimpanzees to carry the code into cells.

When the first vaccine doses are given it is possible that an immune response is raised not just against the spike protein created but also against the carriers that are used to deliver the code for it. This is a known issue for treatments or vaccines that use viruses for delivery. If the second dose is then the same the immunity developed against the carrier will react against the second dose clearing some of it before robust protective and long-lasting immunity develops.

This is why Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine – which is based on the same delivery method as the AstraZeneca vaccine – uses two different adenoviruses as carriers for its first and second doses and has achieved impressive results.

Why mixing doses is so important

There are additional benefits to mixing vaccine doses on top of improving protection. Logistical problems can arise when a second vaccine dose has to be identical to the first. Producing double the quantity of one vaccine takes time. Boosting with a different vaccine could allow the world’s population to be vaccinated quicker.

Second if a person reacts badly to their first vaccination they are more likely to get a second dose if they know it is a different one – and it’s clear that two are needed for good protection. Governments may also decide a certain type of vaccine is less suitable for different groups of people as has been the case with the AstraZeneca vaccine in younger people in some countries. Having more potential vaccine combinations available may help overcome any public uncertainty in the wake of these sorts of decisions.

Supplying vaccines to some low- and middle-income countries can also be difficult particularly if they do not have the necessary cold storage requirements for large batches of a vaccine that need to be kept at low temperatures. Including vaccines into the distribution plan that do not need storage at very low temperatures may make widespread vaccine delivery easier.

So there are clearly huge benefits to vaccine mixing. However this study only looked at two vaccine types – in time every combination will need to be tested in every age group and in every ethnicity. Vaccines may also behave differently if mixed in different contexts for example against a backdrop of malnutrition or other infectious diseases. These factors will need to be included in future testing too. But for now this study suggests that a mix-and-match approach to COVID-19 vaccines is an acceptable useful option.

Associated Press

As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Chicken recall:Tyson recalls 8.5 million pounds of frozen poultry for possible listeria contamination

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3RhaXdhbi9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzA0LzIwMDM3NjAyNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer recalls anti-smoking medication after impurity report,"Pfizer recalls anti-smoking medication after impurity report

Staff writer with CNA





US biotechnology firm Pfizer is recalling four lots of Champix anti-smoking tablets in Taiwan after elevated levels of nitrosamine impurities were found in the prescription drug the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said yesterday.

Hung Kuo-teng (洪國登) head of the FDA’s Medicinal Products Division said that about 600000 Champix pills with the four lot numbers 00019669 00019012 00019601 and 00019602 are to be recalled by July 22.

The announcement came after Pfizer said that it found elevated levels of nitrosamines in Chantix the name under which Champix is sold in the US.

Hung said that Pfizer is investigating the situation.

The US Food and Drug Administration in a report in February identified seven nitrosamine impurities that could theoretically be present in medicines adding that five of them have been detected.

Bloomberg reported that they include N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) which is suspected to increase the risk of cancer and that US health authorities have asked drugmakers to test their products for the impurities.

Pfizer’s Taiwanese subsidiary yesterday said in a statement that impurities that had been found in Champix’s active component varenicline include nitrosamines but not NDMA or any other impurities mentioned in the US report.

International media reported that Pfizer has yet to determine the health risk posed by nitrosamines but it has halted the global distribution of the anti-smoking drugs and is recalling the affected lots.

In Taipei the FDA said that medical institutions and pharmacies should stop prescribing and dispensing Champix adding that they should return the product.

People concerned about their use of the medication should immediately consult their doctors the agency said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzE4ODc2MjEvd29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bangladesh starts Pfizer vaccination program for workers bound for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,"DHAKA: Bangladesh is to provide coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Pfizer vaccinations to migrant workers heading for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to help them meet the new travel requirements of Gulf countries.

The Bangladeshi overseas employment ministry made the announcement on Friday in the wake of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait’s updated travel restrictions requiring visitors to have had either Pfizer AstraZeneca Moderna or Johnson and Johnson jabs to gain entry leaving out the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine on which Bangladesh now relies.

Until April Bangladesh had been administering Covishield the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by India but its south Asian neighbor stopped delivering the shots.

Every week 12000 Bangladeshi workers travel to Saudi Arabia where they have had to undertake a costly 14-day quarantine period upon arrival but with the Pfizer vaccination it will no longer be necessary.

Departures to Kuwait are scheduled to begin next month with the state expected to start receiving travelers from Aug. 1.

Bangladeshi Minister of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment Imran Ahmad on Friday told Arab News: “Our migrant workers who will have the first dose of Pfizer vaccine in Bangladesh will be exempted from the mandatory quarantine after their landing in the Kingdom.”

As the government started registering workers for vaccination he added that workers would receive their second vaccine doses under the supervision of Saudi authorities.

Bangladesh has so far received 100000 Pfizer vaccine doses under the World Health Organization’s COVAX program for equitable distribution of COVID-19 shots among developing nations.

FAST FACT Dhaka has received 100000 Pfizer vaccine doses under WHO’s COVAX program. More than 2m Bangladeshis work in Saudi Arabia around 350000 in Kuwait.

“Currently we have around 100000 doses of Pfizer vaccines which arrived through COVAX the global vaccine initiative” Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research principal scientific officer Dr. A.S.M. Alamgir told Arab News.

He said that workers bound for Saudi Arabia or Kuwait would receive the Pfizer vaccine at seven government-run health facilities in the capital Dhaka.

“Later the migrants will be inoculated with Moderna vaccine which is approved by Saudi authorities as well” he added.

Bangladesh is expecting to receive 2.5 million doses of Moderna vaccine from the US.

More than 2 million Bangladeshis work in Saudi Arabia and around 350000 in Kuwait.

Tipu Sultan president of the Recruiting Agencies Unity Forum said: “Considering the current vaccine crisis around the world the government’s decision to ease the migrant workers’ trouble to such an extent is appreciated.”

Mohammad Saleh 27 said he had borrowed $2000 to pay for his flight and visa in order to work in Saudi Arabia and had been worried about finding another $1000 for mandatory quarantine.

“I was concerned about the hotel quarantine costs in the Kingdom but now I can take the flight without any worries” he added."

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

On Monday Teneisha Gomez 37 was charged with robbery and aggravated battery in connection with the incident. The charges were filed against her while she was in the Will County jail after her arrest regarding another incident.

On June 14 officers met with a disabled man who told them that he was approached by a woman while he was walking about 7:45 a.m. that day near Ottawa and Crowley streets.

Gomez was first arrested on June 15 after she was charged with burglarizing a vehicle in Joliet last year and stealing a wallet containing a debit card she used at a business police said.

Gomez was later indicted on charges that alleged she burglarized a Nissan Versa Jeep Grand Cherokee and Pontiac Torrent between August and September 2020 court records show.

Gomez was also charged with intent to defraud the Gulf gas station at 334 Collins St. and the Phillips 66 gas station at 379 S. Chicago St. by using three stolen debits cards.

Williams had been approached by various companies over the years about signing a gas drilling lease but she had questions about the noise pollution and other factors that typically accompany urban drilling.

What You Need To Know Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies didn’t drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals.



The Railroad Commission of Texas is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own.



The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”



There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies.

“I wanted answers to questions” she said. “I didn't say ‘I won't ever do this.’ I said ‘I want answers to these questions’ and I never got the answers.""

The 76-year-old Fort Worth resident refused to sign a lease with Chesapeake Energy Corporation many years ago and now Total Energy — the France-based company that purchased the rights to minerals in Williams’ area near Lake Worth — is continuing its aggressive expansion in North Texas by using a little-known rule to grab all of the underground resources in the vicinity of her house whether neighbors agree to it or not.

Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies don't drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals. A spokesperson for the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) the state agency tasked with regulating oil and gas companies (which was created by the oil and gas industry) said “Statewide Rule 37 requires minimum distances between wells at drilling sites in order to protect field pressure and correlative rights.”

Under the rule the RRC is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own — the usual justification is that without the unlicensed pool of minerals the company won’t be able to generate enough pressure to bring the gas to the surface. But observers said oil and gas companies have learned that the RRC will almost always grant these exceptions whether they are justified or not.

The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”

There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies. Though the RRC doesn’t keep aggregate data on the win-loss records on hearings for exceptions a spokesman for the organization pointed a reporter to three separate websites where the final orders on the hearings are stored. In a search of the first 50 cases on one of the pages the RRC arbiter sided with the oil and gas companies 100% of the time.

One industry insider said he’s never heard of a business losing a hearing and the only cases that residents ever win are on technicalities such as botched paperwork. The former oil and gas executive who asked not to be named for fear of hurting his current career guessed that the win-to-loss ratio was around 1000 to 1. The process is so tipped in the favor of these companies he said most people don’t bother to protest.

Elaine Williams is not most people. When the RRC told her that everyone in her neighborhood had been notified of the more than 200 Rule 37 exception cases that Total has filed in the area she went door-to-door to verify that people knew what was happening. Almost none of the people she spoke to knew anything about the Rule 37 applications.

“Whenever they sent [the notification letter] they gave me a long list — front and back — of people they said they had tried to contact or they said they had contacted” she said. “One of them was my neighbor caddy-corner to me. So I went over there and we talked in his driveway. Neither one of us has ever signed that we would take money or do anything with this. He signed a [protest] form right there in his driveway.”

After her initial protest was declared invalid because of a paperwork error she tried a second time to fight for her minerals. This time she successfully protested her case and helped neighbors file their protests. Total tried once again to buy her minerals but she said she’s past that point.

“In this process I have discovered that all of these things are hidden in plain sight” she said of the Rule 37 exception process. “I'm becoming aware of just how sneaky they are.”

Gas drilling in her area has already taken a toll on her health and quality of life she said.

“I literally cannot drink my own water in this house anymore” she said. “I tell my overnight visitors my family not to even brush their teeth with the water — to use my bottled water. Whenever I take a shower I'm very careful. I’ve been using paper plates and plastic [utensils] for years now.

“I literally was getting sick” she said. “I was getting so sick.”

Are the hearings a sham?

Williams and her neighbors who have chosen to protest Total’s application for a Rule 37 exemption are about to go through a process that critics allege is almost impossible to win.

Residents are required to travel to Austin on a weekday to attend their hearing — there is also an option to have the hearing over the phone but that has only existed since 2017 and it would make presenting evidence or fairly cross-examining witnesses nearly impossible. Residents can request an alternative hearing site but both parties would have to agree to the change.

Oil and gas companies employ a team of attorneys and expert witnesses to fight residents’ claims to their own minerals. While there is a discovery period most residents don’t have the legal savvy to ask for it and they are blindsided by testimony replete with myriad slides and dense scientific jargon. Anyone can hire an attorney to represent them but oil and gas attorneys are uniquely specialized and expensive. Spectrum News 1 reached out to one such attorney based in Fort Worth and his rates started at $300 an hour.

The judges in these cases are not required to be elected judges attorneys or even have a basic understanding of the law. They are political appointees who are handpicked by a government body known for protecting oil and gas interests.

Emeka Duruigbo Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Institute for International and Immigration Law Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University is one of the few academics who has done extensive scholarly research on the cross-section of property rights and oil and gas law. He said Rule 37 by itself is a good one — society he argues needs the underground gas to fuel our lives — but the hearing process for exceptions he said is inherently unfair.

“It’s a David versus Goliath fight and the little guy is outmatched” he said. “There’s a battery of lawyers with experience in these kinds of cases prepared to fight you. This is what they do. So the private citizen comes in with nothing. They don’t even have the scientific information to back up their claims.”

Ranjana Bhandari executive director of Livable Arlington — a grassroots environmental organization that frequently takes on oil and gas companies — went through the RRC’s Rule 37 exception hearing process. She just so happens to hold a Masters in economics and her husband a university professor holds a PhD in physics. Even with their unique expertise to argue their case the RRC’s arbiter still sided with the oil and gas company. The couple was given only a few minutes to examine the oil and gas company’s data.

“I can only speculate but it seemed that there was asymmetry in treatment of the two sides” she said. “Even though we were the victims we were the injured party. We were the ones being dragged out of our homes in Arlington on a working day at great inconvenience trying to learn all these arcane rules trying to understand the technology and trying to understand something that most mineral owners know very little about.

“I've never had heard of a case where a potential robber can go to the legal system and say ‘Can you please have Ranjana explain to you why you shouldn't rob her?”

Duruigbo emphasized that the hearings are well outside of any traditional legal standards.

“They are acting like a court” he said. “The Railroad Commission has the [judges] sit there. They're not required to be lawyers. They're not judges. They're usually political appointees or they are elected. So any politician who collects money from vested interests [through an election] sits there and makes decisions.”

In April 2013 Duruigbo conducted a focus group of residential property owners in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area who were targeted for gas drilling underneath their homes.

In the resulting article the professor concluded that unfair granting of the Rule 37 exception was an abuse of power and an affront to the rights of property owners.

“Participants numbering about 12 men and women decried energy developers’ interference with their property freedom and their ability to holdout when negotiations are orchestrated” the article says. “After examining applicable legal provisions and hearing the concerns of the focus group participants it is apparent that the … unfair granting of exceptions to spacing rules do interfere with the property freedom of small tract owners. They also encroach on their power to holdout for better deals or more desirable outcomes.”

Oil company landmen also know that the game is rigged and they frequently use that as a negotiation tactic when trying to buy a person’s gas rights.

“When landmen and Chesapeake's representatives contacted us a few times to see if they could change our mind their biggest selling point was ‘It's going to be expensive for you to defend yourself’ ” Bhandari said. “ ‘You are going to lose. So isn't it better for you to just sign the lease now? We are going to drill anyway. One way or the other we'll get permission to drill and the only difference will be that you won't be paid.’ I heard this over and over again from landman from Chesapeake employees who called us. And so because the system is so unfair to mineral owners they can very easily be coerced by the drillers.”

Even knowing all of this Williams said she is undeterred. Now that she’s had a chance to do more research on the environmental impact of urban gas drilling she’s determined to at least make herself a pest to Total Energy.

Since filing her appeal she said the company has once again contacted her about buying her minerals but this time at a reduced rate.

“I just laughed at him” she said of her recent encounter with a landman. “I said ‘If I didn't take over $5000 what makes you think I'm gonna take $1000?’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbW9udHJlYWxnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZG96ZW5zLWJyYXZlLWNvbGQtd2F0ZXJzLW5lYXItbW9udHJlYWxzLW9sZC1wb3J0LWluLWFubnVhbC1iaWctc3BsYXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dozens brave cold waters near Montreal's Old Port in annual Big Splash,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/dozens-brave-cold-waters-near-montreals-old-port-in-annual-big-splash on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbW9udHJlYWxnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZG96ZW5zLWJyYXZlLWNvbGQtd2F0ZXJzLW5lYXItbW9udHJlYWxzLW9sZC1wb3J0LWluLWFubnVhbC1iaWctc3BsYXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcHJhZ2F0aXZhZGkuY29tL2hlYXZ5LXNob3dlcnMtbGVhdmUtcGFydHMtb2Ytb2Rpc2hhLWNhcGl0YWwtZmxvb2RlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heavy Showers Leave Parts Of Odisha Capital Flooded,"Bhubaneswar: An hour-long heavy rain inundated several parts of Odisha capital causing untold hardships to the citizens on Sunday evening.

Several areas of the Smart City Bhubaneswar witnessed water-logging which exposed the worst monsoon preparedness of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Like every year the service road along NH-16 in front of Iskcon Temple once again bore the brunt of rains as the entire area was submerged in a flash flood.

The heavy shower which continued for an hour turned the main road in front of Iskcon temple in Nayapalli into a pool as the rainwater could not be discharged immediately.

Heavy rains paralysed the vehicular movements as roads were flooded at Nayapalli Behera Sahi and Bomikhal along the Rasulgarh-Kalpana Square road. People had a harrowing time wading through the knee-deep water and several four-wheelers were left submerged.

While flooding and the water-logging issue have become every year’s event in the city the civic body authorities are yet to resolve it.",,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

Musyoka’s sisters “wept uncontrollably” during the ceremony a local outlet reported. Some “fainted as they eulogised their brother.”

The 26-year-old Musyoka had come to the United States to study at Dartmouth College. After graduating at the very top of his class he married an American woman and settled with her in Connecticut. In late 2020 after a year of pandemic lockdowns they decided to move across the country to San Francisco. They had a 3-year-old son named Theo.

On the morning of Feb. 4 2021 Musyoka was jogging near San Francisco State University when a stolen 2003 Ford Explorer flew through a red light at Lake Merced Boulevard and Higuera Avenue crashing into seven other cars. The crash killed Musyoka and injured three other people.

The Explorer had been stolen in San Jose by a man named Jerry Lyons who had proceeded to drive north to San Francisco where he lived.

Lyons had only recently left prison only to fall back into the same patterns that had seen him cycle through the criminal justice system for years. In October 2020 he was arrested for allegedly stealing a car and possessing methamphetamine but San Francisco’s district attorney Chesa Boudin decided not to bring new charges against him even though Lyons was in violation of his supervised release from prison.

Lyons was arrested again in December for drunken driving again in a stolen car. He spent the better part of that month in jail but Boudin’s prosecutors — many of whom were like him former public defenders — did not move quickly to press new charges effectively letting the case languish. Lyons was thus set free. The next time he would come to Boudin’s attention it would be for killing Musyoka.

Boudin seemingly struggled to reconcile his own progressive convictions with San Francisco’s outrage at the killing of a young man of so much obvious promise. “We need to remember that all of us are more than our worst mistake” he told a CBS interviewer in an apparent reference to Lyons.

The killing of Musyoka came at a particularly difficult time for Boudin the son of two 1960s radicals. He had been elected a year before on a criminal justice platform. “We have to build an office like no other district attorney’s office in the country” he’d said vowing to end cash bail and solitary confinement practices that are increasingly seen as unfair and inhumane even by some conservatives.

Across the country more and more prosecutors had run or were running on near-identical platforms. They were anti-prosecutors in a way steeped in social justice interpretations of policies like Rockefeller drug laws and stop-and-frisk. They saw traditional prosecutors as enablers and abettors of aggressive policing which in turn they saw as enforcing systemic racism. The new prosecutors vowed to redress these injustices by serving in the very offices that had perpetuated some of them.

Those promises are increasingly imperiled by rising crime rates across the country including in every major city. Boudin is facing two separate recalls which on some days has him sounding like the very type of law-and-order prosecutor he promised he was never going to become.

“I never expected that I’d be able to solve the problems I inherited in my first term in office” he told me “much less my first year much less a year marred by COVID. So we have a long way to go.” The 40-year-old district attorney blamed his political troubles on the police union “the fearmongers and the Republicans in San Francisco.” Yet it seems unlikely that the 6.8 percent of San Franciscans registered as Republicans are alone in driving the increasingly intense opposition to his tenure.

Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner probably the nation’s most prominent progressive prosecutor spent the spring fighting off a primary challenger. His rival was supported by the city’s Democratic establishment which had refused to endorse Krasner the incumbent. Speaking a few days before that election Krasner told me the backlash was nothing more than “Trumpian bullshit.”

He went further saying that far from being embattled the progressive prosecutorial movement was just beginning supported by a society that has become increasingly aware of racial inequalities. “You can see it in the music. You can see it in the movies” Krasner said. “You can see it in the books. You can see it in popular culture. You can see it in the marches and the discussions that are going on. So there’s a tremendous cultural shift happening here which is essential for any successful grassroots movement.”

Days after we spoke Krasner easily defeated his primary opponent but the challenge to him may have been more revealing than its outcome. Similar efforts are taking place across the country including one to recall Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón (who used to hold Boudin’s position in San Francisco succeeding Kamala Harris). Investigations into ethical lapses have targeted progressive prosecutors in Baltimore and Chicago.

The backlash is not unexpected. “This movement is here to stay” said Miriam Krinsky the founder of Fair and Just Prosecution a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that has boosted many progressive district attorney candidates including Krasner and Boudin. She noted the recent victories of progressives like Eli Savit in Ann Arbor Mich. and Ramin Fatehi in Norfolk Va.

“Communities” she said “are smarter about what they want.”

What communities wanted used to be neatly captured by “Law and Order” the police procedural that started running on NBC in 1990. The top prosecutor on the popular series was based on Robert Morgenthau the real-life Manhattan district attorney for 35 years or “the greatest district attorney in the history of New York” as the show’s creator Dick Wolf once called him.

The patrician custodian of an earlier ideal of New York Morgenthau presided over some of the most famous criminal cases of the late 20th century. He was sometimes criticized for going too soft on white defendants such as the subway vigilante Bernhard Goetz and too hard on Black ones most infamously the five young men falsely accused of beating and raping a woman in Central Park.

On the whole New Yorkers liked Morgenthau enough to elect him nine times. Often he ran more or less unopposed. That changed in 2005 when he received a surprisingly spirited challenge from Leslie Crocker Snyder then a New York City judge. Snyder attacked Morgenthau from the left insisting he was “the opposite of a reformer.”

New York was no longer the dangerous and dreary Gotham of Morgenthau’s early years. Other cities had undergone similar changes throughout the 1990s; Washington D.C. once considered the nation’s murder capital was on its way to becoming “a cool city.” Vigorous policing combined with tough prosecution had paved the way for such transformations from East Los Angeles to South Brooklyn as coffee shops and glass-sheathed condominiums replaced empty lots and shuttered storefronts.

Astonishingly the New York Times — generally more conservative in its approach to local issues than national ones — endorsed Snyder in an editorial titled “When to End an Era.” The editors expressed a concern that “Morgenthau has been very resistant to the kinds of fresh approaches that have improved law enforcement services in other boroughs” and that his “office sometimes seems set in its ways.”

Morgenthau had enough goodwill in reserve to secure 59 percent of the vote but Snyder’s challenge was a sign that times had changed. Aware that long-reliable winds were no longer blowing in his direction Morgenthau chose not to seek a 10th term and retired in 2009.

He was succeeded by Cy Vance who has spent the last decade more or less as a placeholder unwilling to cast himself as either a lefty crusader or a zero-tolerance lawman. Earlier this year Vance announced that he wouldn’t run again.

The year Morgenthau retired so did Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham who’d served in that office for 20 years. Throughout her tenure Abraham was a zealous death penalty advocate obtaining 108 such sentences. A New York Times profile in 1995 described her as “The Deadliest D.A.”

At the time of Abraham’s retirement Krasner was a civil rights lawyer who represented victims of police violence. By the time he announced his own run for Philadelphia district attorney he had sued the department there 75 times. It was an unusual qualification for someone who if he were to be elected would be trying the cases those same cops brought him. “We already have one public defender’s office in Philadelphia” a Republican challenger quipped to the New York Times. “We don’t need the district attorney to be a second.”

Krasner won easily.

Krasner told me that the publication in 2011 of “The New Jim Crow” by Michelle Alexander was a signal moment; he says that until then he had never heard the phrase “mass incarceration” despite decades in civil rights law. Krinsky said the movement began in earnest in 2014 when Marilyn Mosby was elected as Baltimore state prosecutor. Two years later Kim Foxx was elected Cook County's state's attorney in Chicago.

If the media can sometimes overstate developments this was a genuine movement one that gained force with the rise of Black Lives Matter and its critique of American policing. That critique is also the central premise of progressive prosecution. In his recent book “For the People” Krasner denounces the “extraordinary evil and depravity” of some police officers noting that the serial killer Ted Bundy once sat on a law enforcement commission. As for traditional prosecutors they have at their worst “supported a fascist fantasy” Krasner writes.

Critics take issue with such language joining the fight with rhetoric of their own. Some note that campaigns like those of Krasner and Foxx were funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros. A bête noire of conservatives Soros has been the subject of both conspiracy theories and antisemitic attacks. In 2019 the National Police Association accused him of bankrolling an “anti-cop/pro-criminal onslaught.”

There is not a “more important civil rights movement in our time” than progressive prosecution Krasner told me describing himself and like-minded D.A.s as social justice “technicians” who need to take apart the criminal justice system then build an entirely new one.

“When I ran my long-shot campaign to be Philly’s chief elected prosecutor” Krasner writes in his new book “I promised to try to reverse the damage done by traditional prosecution.”

Back in 1995 Abraham his predecessor said this to the Times of the people she’d sentenced to death: “Prison is too good for them. They don’t deserve to live.” (Only three executions were ever carried out.)

Krasner’s discussion of crime victims in “For the People” is circumspect but revealing; he denounces prosecutors who think their job is to act as victims’ “saviors” and laments the “harmful fraud” of prosecution that too zealously seeks punishment and retribution.

That was exactly the kind of prosecutor Abraham had been: “I represent the victim and the family. I don't care about killers” she’d told the Times. She failed to see that moral certainty was bound to lead to mistakes as it so often does. Krasner has had 18 people exonerated in his first term.

Yet for all their legal disagreements Krasner operates with as much certitude as Abraham at the other end of the spectrum. Her certitude prevented Abraham from perceiving how the criminal justice system treated African American men but progressive prosecutors' just as strongly held convictions could also lead to a backlash.

Nobody really knows why crime started to rise and rise dramatically in 2020 or why it has continued to rise in 2021. Homicides were up in American cities by 33 percent according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association accompanied by a 15 percent jump in violent assaults. At the same time robberies fell 12 percent and rape by 19 percent.

The violent crime was concentrated not only in large cities but in specific neighborhoods in those cities. Killings like the one of Musyoka with his touching story made national news. But most of these murders did not because they were of and by young Black and Latino men whose dispossession in American society has been intractable and persistent.

Progressive prosecutors had promised to redress the ills that had contributed to that dispossession such as sentencing guidelines from the war on drugs and the lack of services for people leaving prison. The upheaval of the pandemic at first seemed to offer the impetus to accelerate some of those reforms. Boudin reduced San Francisco’s jail population by 40 percent citing the real risks of transmission of the virus. He earned praise and was interviewed by Terry Gross on the popular “Fresh Air” radio program.

That was in early April. Homicides had fallen across the nation in the first two months of 2020 but then rose spiking by the time Gross talked to Boudin in April before finally peaking in July. A graph of killings from 2017 until the end of 2020 looks like Mount Everest plunked down in the middle of Kansas. The criminologist Richard Rosenfeld called it a “historic increase.”

The rise in crime took place at around the time that racial justice protests erupted around the country. A Princeton study has found that 93 percent of Black Lives Matter-related protests were peaceful but conservative critics have pounced on the fact that the remaining 7 percent account for 570 instances of violence. Signs of looting were impossible to ignore in large cities like Washington D.C. and New York where plywood became the primary storefront decoration.

Seizing on an issue that would resonate in the culture wars conservative media outlets zeroed in on the violence. President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign described the protesters as rioters poised to “unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.”

As debate raged on social media and cable news about whether a storefront window in Portland had been broken by antifa or by the Proud Boys young Black and Latino men kept getting shot. In Chicago on June 8 of last year 18 people were killed in just 24 hours a grim record that had not been surpassed since the 1960s.

“This is a phenomenon of young people almost all men killing young people almost all men” Krasner says. He blames the violence on pandemic-related closures. “We have lost open public school high school classrooms” he told me. “We have lost organized sports both in and out of school. We have lost summer camps. We have lost recreation centers.”

The actions of progressive prosecutors “probably did not contribute much to the violence we saw last year” said Rosenfeld the noted criminologist. Most people do not get their news from criminologists but millions tune in nightly to Fox News where conspiracy theories about George Soros jostle with images of civic disorder.

It was not until the last day of 2020 that the opposition to Boudin in San Francisco coalesced into something of a movement.

As the city was preparing for what was to be a muted New Year’s Eve celebration given the pandemic a 45-year-old man named Troy McAlister ran a red light in downtown San Francisco killing two people.

McAlister had been out on parole and whether fairly or not Boudin was blamed for the killings. The San Francisco Police Department issued a withering statement whose target was obviously the young embattled prosecutor: “We take responsibility whenever we fall short of expectations” it said. “That’s an approach every element of our criminal justice system needs to embrace.”

In the days following the killings what had been a quixotic effort to expel Boudin from office entered the mainstream with help from a local technology executive David Sacks. “The decarceration disaster unleashed by Boudin in the past year has come about not because decarceration is never the right answer but because Boudin insists that it is always the right answer” Sacks wrote in a widely shared Substack article published on Jan. 5. “It also increasingly appears to be his only answer.”

Boudin had won only narrowly in 2019 ousting an incumbent favored by Mayor London Breed. San Francisco politics is contentious and Boudin had always had his detractors. He could have done more to assuage their concerns but it probably wouldn’t have made a difference.

A month after the McAlister killings Musyoka was killed at Lake Merced and the recall effort intensified. By spring there were two competing recall efforts.

Then came the attacks on Asian Americans after Trump’s allegations that China had unleashed the coronavirus on the world. In late January an 84-year-old Thai immigrant Vicha Ratanapakdee was slammed to the ground by an assailant who attacked him without any provocation. Ratanapakdee who had been out for a walk went into a coma and died.

Boudin described the suspect as having been in the midst of “some sort of a temper tantrum.” The comment infuriated some in the Asian American community although Boudin’s supporters insisted that his statement had been taken out of context.

As violence against Asian Americans persisted Boudin began to change his approach. After a man was arrested for allegedly stabbing two elderly Asian women Boudin vowed to appear in court himself for the suspect’s pretrial detention hearing.

I asked Boudin why a line prosecutor couldn’t handle those relatively simple proceedings especially since the attack had been captured on video. The district attorney’s presence could be seen as a political ploy a way for him to indicate that he was an ally of the Asian American community.

Boudin objected. “He lets everybody out” he said of the judge who was to hear the motion.

More recently Boudin and San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott made a video in which they stood stiffly next to each other and said in unison into the camera “Together we will make San Francisco safe.” A Chinese translation played at the bottom of the screen.

Officials in San Francisco city government were eager to talk to me about Boudin. One of them said the DA’s problems had less to do with the tenets of progressive prosecution than with his own shortcomings. Another showed me the results of a poll commissioned several months ago that shows Boudin with only a 26 percent approval rating. Even more troubling for Boudin is that a full three-quarters of respondents in San Francisco’s Chinese community favored a recall.

To be sure Boudin continues to have support from progressives both nationally and in San Francisco. City Supervisor Dean Preston one of his allies told me that Boudin is doing exactly what he was elected to do. He described the opposition as ideological and hyperbolic. Local media have mocked the recall efforts against him as reactionary echoing the district attorney’s own arguments. And he has supporters in national media outlets even if the favorable coverage he enjoyed at the onset of the pandemic has more or less vanished.

“Look the problems in the criminal justice system weren’t developed overnight” Boudin told me. “This is decades of underfunding education and housing and public health. It’s decades of a failed war on drugs. It’s decades of building more and more prisons and fewer and fewer universities.”

The San Francisco poll conducted a few months ago showed respondents to be extremely concerned about car and home break-ins. Of issues they considered important to them respondents ranked police misconduct — a focal point for Boudin — last.

Alongside Asian Americans another group that has emerged as a potential problem for Boudin are survivors of domestic abuse who can face physical danger if their assailants are not put behind bars. Progressive prosecutors have generally favored no pretrial detention and reduced sentences putting them at odds with advocates for victims of such abuse.

This spring a 7-month-old baby Synciere Williams was murdered by a man who had twice been arrested on domestic violence charges in recent months. Those charges were dropped by Boudin’s office. After several domestic abuse survivors spoke to a San Francisco Chronicle columnist Boudin is said to have called advocates to lobby for their support which only angered them further.

Those advocates were also infuriated by a press release Boudin’s office sent out after the unflattering Chronicle column. The release one of those advocates told me appeared to engage in victim blaming describing how “in many cases” a victim of domestic violence “refuses to communicate with the police and prosecutors.”

The release went on to say that some victims of domestic violence “love their assailant and do not want them incarcerated or punished.”

Boudin’s critics have struggled to understand how such assertions help his cause or the broader cause of progressive prosecution. The poll shown to me by a San Francisco government official offers the following assessment of the district attorney: “Boudin is weak.”

Across the country in New York voters recently appear to have picked former police officer Eric Adams as their Democratic nominee for mayor although the final result has not yet been declared. The disparity between Democrats and Republicans is not as steep in New York as it is in San Francisco but the difference is great enough to mean that winning a Democratic primary more or less guarantees victory in the general election.

Voters seemed to favor Adams despite his history of corruption his ties to the real estate industry and some strange proposals including 400-person Zoom classes for public schools. His campaign was singularly focused on crime. In a city that is now seeing gunfights break out in Times Square that was enough.

As New Yorkers were choosing a mayor Manhattanites were choosing a replacement for Cy Vance the outgoing district attorney.

The candidates skewed extremely progressive. During the first debate a former prosecutor Alvin Bragg boasted that he had only ever prosecuted a single misdemeanor. Eliza Orlins ran on a platform nearly identical to Boudin’s. She supported defunding the police as did several other candidates. Tahanie Aboushi wanted to go after the “root causes” of crime as Boudin said he would in his victory speech before more immediate realities set in.

In this field Tali Farhadian Weinstein stood out for the relative moderation of her views. A onetime clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court she was in some ways a throwback to Leslie Crocker Snyder who launched a center-left challenge to Morgenthau back in 2005. But the landscape has shifted since then and Farhadian Weinstein looked positively conservative in a field so thoroughly shifted to the left.

“I think that people do not want to have to choose between safety and fairness” Farhadian Weinstein told me. “They want both.”

As Election Day approached progressives sharpened their attacks on Farhadian Weinstein painting her as an Upper East Side elitist out of touch with the rest of the borough. The same charge could have been made against Morgenthau but never was even though he was a scion of wealth and power whose father had been a close adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Both of the city’s tabloids the New York Daily News and the New York Post endorsed Farhadian Weinstein and the Post warned that Bragg and the other progressives would usher in an era of “utter chaos and confusion.”

Farhadian Weinstein conceded to Bragg on Friday in the race meaning that it is possible that New York may end up with a mayor and D.A. with conflicting views on criminal justice. “We’re going to do things a little different in Manhattan” Bragg told his supporters as the returns showed him to be a likely victor. That is exactly what some hope and others fear.

Sword Art Online is one of the isekai franchises that put the genre on the map and it has more left to do. After its big third season ended fans were reassured Kirito and Asuna would return to the screen in a new movie. Now it seems new details about the Sword Art Online movie are on their way and it comes courtesy of a poster.

The update comes from Twitter as vetted fan-pages like SugoiLITE hit up netizens with a treat. It was there fans were gifted with a surfaced poster of Sword Art Online's next film. And if the piece is legit it looks gorgeous.

You can find the poster here if you'd like as we await official news from Aniplex. The company is set to hold an event tonight at part of Anime Expo 2021. The virtual panel will give fans an update on Aniplex's most important franchises and one of them is Sword Art Online. The event might officialize this rumored visual so keep an eye out for more details.

Of course the only big question remaining is when will Sword Art Online bring this new movie to theaters. The project was announced some time ago and Studio A-1 has been working on it since then if not beforehand. Fans do expect the movie to go live sometime this year and the Fall season tends to attract big-name films within the industry.

As for the franchise itself Sword Art Online Progressive: Aria of the Starless Night hopes to tell a new side of a story we all know. The original light novel gives Asuna's perspective on the first season of Sword Art Online so this film will tell the story through her eyes. This means we'll get new info on Kirito and the dungeon his party fought when trapped inside the digital world of Sword Art Online.

A “safe space” at the heart of Hamilton has been dedicated to commemorate the landmark Theatre Boycott of 1959.

The new Freedom Square was also unveiled yesterday in tribute to other key moments where Hamilton hosted the island’s push for social justice.

The square encompasses the block covering Hamilton City Hall and its grounds as well as the adjacent car park.

It includes the space where crowds gathered 62 years ago to challenge Bermuda’s entrenched racial segregation starting with cinemas organised in secret by the Progressive Group of activists.

July 2 marked the successful conclusion of the peaceful protests.

Charles Gosling the Mayor of Hamilton said renaming the historic area made good on a request from a year ago during one of the Black Lives Matter marches.

In a ceremony on the steps of City Hall Mr Gosling declared it “my absolute honour to be here today to formally announce the birth of Freedom Square”.

Many members of the Progressive Group attended – among them Reverend Erskine Simmons who told the crowd: “Sixty-two years seems like a long time.

“I am here today to speak for a group of people who came together with the idea of changing life in Bermuda changing life for the Black people who were denied privilege denied mortgages denied access to the hospital and to the full and free system of living in Bermuda.”

Mr Simmons noted that desegregating Bermuda’s movie theatres in just two weeks forced hotels to admit Black guests restaurants to withdraw segregation the civil service to open to all and the Government to pass its first anti-discrimination laws.

Mr Gosling added that activist Glenn Fubler had led calls a year ago to rename the block in recognition of the Progressive Group and subsequent campaigns for change.

The Mayor cited other activists such as Bermuda’s suffragettes Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ group OutBermuda.

He said Mr Fubler’s suggestion had been picked up by “an alliance of churches unions and other socially aware organisations”.

He added: “Freedom Square on which the City Hall building and grounds rest will henceforth be recognised as a safe space for people to express themselves regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or national origin.”

As part of a move to make Hamilton a ‘learning city’ Freedom Square has been given codes placed at historic sites where visitors can access informative videos with the swipe of a phone.

Mr Gosling said others would be installed and ultimately across Hamilton allowing visitors to take self-guided tours through the city’s past.

“Our long-term wish is to erect a fountain or sculpture along the grassy semicircle area in front of City Hall which further represents the concept of freedom” Mr Gosling said.

“This will be an outreach exercise that will have the input of the public and community groups to find the most appropriate symbol for this spot.”

Kadenacy who left AECOM in 2017 set up shop in the financial sector in 2018 and became an early pioneer for special purpose acquisition companies with local private equity firm Boxwood Capital.

Now at a time when SPACs have become a go-to option for companies looking to go public Kadenacy is helping to develop a fresh approach to these blank check offerings.

The 52-year-old Kadenacy has forged a new partnership called SilverBox Capital and has enlisted the help of a big money manager on L.A.’s Westside who managed the family wealth of Michael Milken along with an Orange County-based money manager who is committing a total of $500 million for five SPACs over the next few years.

Boxwood Capital is still a private equity firm but SilverBox marks a step up in its approach to SPACs.

The firm came about when Boxwood Capital decided earlier this year to partner with

Sawtelle-based hedge fund Silver Rock Financial. Carl Meyer the firm’s chief executive and chief investment officer had previously managed billions of dollars for Milken.

Kadenacy and Meyer combined the first syllables of Silver Rock and Boxwood to come up with the new firm’s name.

The partnership then added Newport Beach-based money manager Engaged Capital run by Glenn Welling who has agreed to commit $100 million on every SPAC deal that SilverBox Capital executes.

New approach

Unlike most SPACs — where private investors are invited to participate in a private investment in public equity or PIPE — SilverBox Capital takes a less conventional approach.

SilverBox Capital has designed SPACs using forward purchase commitments which are essentially contractual agreements to carry out a transaction in the future.

Forward purchase agreements give the buyer leverage in negotiations to buy a private company whereas PIPE investors can back out and potentially kill a deal.

SilverBox Capital and Engaged Capital already have come together on one SPAC. In February they raised $345 million in the initial public offering for SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp. I.

Using forward purchase agreements offers a cleaner way to do an acquisition because it bypasses the strings of warrants of conventional SPACs according to Kadenacy.

In April the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance that SPACs would need to classify their warrants as liabilities instead of equity instruments.

The SEC move nearly brought the market to a halt as SPACs digested the development and many SPACs were forced to restate their financial statements.

SilverBox has four more SPACs in the pipeline all structured with similar forward purchase agreements with Engaged Capital. The partnership is putting final touches on a second SPAC to go public before the end of the year Kadenacy said.

Meanwhile SilverBox’s first SPAC is in negotiations to buy a private company and take it public in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.

It’s believed to be one of the first forward purchase agreements used by a SPAC in Southern California according to industry experts.

Laying the foundation

Before the formation of Boxwood Capital in 2018 and his interest in SPACs Kadenacy ran local infrastructure consulting giant AECOM one of the largest companies in L.A. with a market capitalization of $9.3 billion.

He joined AECOM as senior vice president of finance in 2008 and became the company’s chief financial officer in 2011. In 2014 Kadenacy was promoted to president and CFO and in 2015 he was named president and chief operating officer positions he held until he left the company in June 2017.

Kadenacy’s departure was not related to any adverse change in the company’s business AECOM said at the time. Kadenacy said he simply wanted a different career trajectory.

AECOM has since seen a great deal of change including a restructuring that began last fall the sale of its government services business and construction units and the move of its headquarters from Century City to downtown. In addition AECOM Chief Financial Officer Troy Rudd succeeded Michael Burke as chief executive.

After leaving AECOM Kadenacy formed Boxwood Capital and based the business in Century City. The firm’s first SPAC went public in November 2018 raising $200 million through its Boxwood Merger Corp. which was based in Santa Monica according to SEC documents.

In August 2019 Boxwood Capital’s SPAC agreed to buy Austin Texas-based Atlas Technical Consultants Inc. with the hopes that the privately held professional testing inspection engineering and consulting services business could capture future federal dollars for infrastructure development.

Kadenacy’s only work on a SPAC transaction from beginning to end — or from an initial public offering to acquisition of Atlas — was with Boxwood Merger Corp. a business combination with an enterprise value of $720 million.



A move to Austin

With the SPAC deal under his belt Kadenacy began looking for change in his personal life.

Two years ago he uprooted his private equity firm and his family and moved to Austin — not as part of the growing corporate flight by companies such as Green Dot Corp. the Pasadena-based fintech that announced in May it will be leaving for Texas.

Kadenacy’s reasons for the move were more personal he said.

For one thing he was tiring of cross-country flights to New York to meet with his firm’s significant shareholder Macquarie Capital USA Inc.

His kids also were also getting ready to enter high school L.A.’s freeways were a headache and he wanted a better quality of life.

“I love L.A. I grew up there. I went to UCLA for undergrad and USC for business school” said Kadenacy who traded in his multimillion-dollar home in the Huntington area of Pacific Palisades for a place in Austin — a rising Silicon Valley-like region that boasts affordability and family friendliness.

Joe Reece who is executive chairman of SilverBox Capital and still has a home in L.A. moved his merchant banking company Helena Capital to Ketchum Idaho from Brentwood.

Reece wanted a deep bench of expertise so he enticed his friend Milken who helped create the market for high-yield bonds in the 1980s to invest in SilverBox Engaged Capital earlier this year.

“When we sit down with a SaaS (software-as-a-service) company or a fintech company we’ve got people who have actually run those businesses” Reece said of SilverBox’s five-member advisory board which is composed of former execs and advisers with downtown-based Oaktree Capital ConAgra Foods Synchrony Financial Diamond Resorts International Inc. T-Mobile USA Inc. and SunPower Corp.

While Boxwood Capital is one of the early adopters of the forward purchase agreement it’s by no means the first to use the approach.

Billionaire Bill Foley owner of the National Hockey League’s Las Vegas Golden Knights began to use forward purchase agreements several years ago. Foley did his first SPAC in 2016 with Chinh Chu a SPAC creator and former co-head of private equity at Blackstone Group Inc.

“We always believed that there would be a shakeout in the SPAC market and that’s why we put SilverBox Engaged together” said Welling founder and chief information officer of Engaged Capital. “We believe this is a durable platform and that the SPACs that would thrive after the shakeout were going to be those that had institutional backing. For us we think the shakeout is a good thing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV5LmNvbS9lbl9hdS9ib2FyZC1tYXR0ZXJzL2ZpdmUtdHJlbmRzLXRoYXQtd2lsbC10aGUtc2hhcGUtdGhlLWJvYXJkLW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five trends that will the shape the board of the future,"The governance trends of today aren’t going away

This may be the reality for future board members as five trends reshape governance models according to EY recent study of boards in Australia. These trends are already having a profound impact on boards’ performance and are expected to fundamentally redefine their roles and structure by 2030:

1. Elevated stakeholder voice from more diverse groups

The shift from shareholder primacy to stakeholder capitalism was underway before the COVID-19 pandemic but the crisis has accelerated the urgency to turn this ambition into action.

For boards this means exchanging the known rules metrics and priorities of shareholder primacy for the unknown landscape of creating long-term value for more – not just for some. Already we see leaders beginning to embed standard non-financial metrics such the WEF-IBC standards for measuring ESG into their organisations.

Meanwhile the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer1 revealed that 86% of respondents expect CEOs to publicly speak out on societal challenges and there’s evidence executives are responding by shifting from being internally-focused business leaders to assuming broader societal leadership roles. For example in EY 2021 CEO Imperative Study 66% of CEOs in Australia and New Zealand saw fostering stakeholder trust and confidence as an increasing part of their role.

Boards needs to be ready for and embrace this shift. As one of interviewee said “If we think about when shareholder primacy was dominant… we have moved away from that paradigm and boards need to adapt. Boards need to recognise stakeholder expectations and that companies operate as part of the community and broader society.”

2. More transparent decision-making

We know investors are expecting more from boards. According to Insightia Ltd2 between 2013 and 2021 85% of demands from activist investors in Australia related to factors within the remit of the board. But others are raising their voice too using their influence to have an impact on corporate behaviour and changing their own based on a company’s actions. More than 83% of respondents in a 2019 US study of Gen Z3 said they consider a company’s purpose when deciding where to work. And a 2020 Australian survey4 found that 72% of Gen Z and 69% of Millennials are more likely to buy from a company that contributes to social causes. As one of our interviewees explained “Our law still includes the shareholder primacy rule but the reality of where we stand today is that stakeholders feel we are accountable to them.”

3. Greater accountability – and consequences – for boards

The first two trends bring us neatly to the third: the onus on boards to be open accountable and publicly admit when they’ve made a mistake. Again Gen Z is particularly vocal on this issue: in the same 2019 US survey of Gen Z we quoted above 75% said they would research a company to see if it’s being honest when it takes a stand on issues.

The big challenge though is that news and public sentiment moves faster than boards can react and having to work out what happened after the story has broken puts them very much in the back seat. Directors that follow an agreed decision-making approach which includes consulting and sense-checking externally will be better able to defend their actions.

For example AI can guide better decisions where fast thinking is required offering simulations of stakeholder responses. When more considered responses are in order consultation critical challenge and review points can support decision-making. Boards need to govern for both speeds with suitable checks and balances in place for both.

4. Faster more unpredictable pace of change

Of the issues people raised in our interviewees VUCA was one of the most common.

A VUCA world presents big challenges to procedurally driven boards because correlations – the relationship between cause and effect – aren’t well understood and when changes and new rules emerge the usual procedures favoured by traditional board members just don’t apply. Instead boards need to test quickly assess and adjust.

But while many organisations talk about becoming agile and resilient we see few boards putting it into practice. Most hold meetings in quarterly cycles with pre-set information and they generally don’t look beyond the knowledge experience skills and network reach of incumbent directors for input.

Changing this reactive approach is critical but challenging. One interviewee summed up the dilemma like this: “We’re dealing with changes in regulatory environments markets technology generally cyber risk … How does a board stay on top of the changes? … Many boards so are incredibly time poor; they don't have enough unstructured time together; meetings are jammed with agenda items and overly structured; and boards generally don't get adequate time with management. How do you thread the needle as a director through all these issues?”

5. Complex business ecosystems that make governance more challenging

The forces of digitalisation globalisation and dispersion (of people organisations supply chains) have created a mind-boggling level of complexity for boards.

This takes two forms:

Capital arrangements and structures. Businesses may own small stakes in many different businesses – a joint venture here a minority stake there. This complexity makes it harder for the board to understand the level of control and exposure it has in its subsidiaries. Networked business ecosystems. Today’s organisations create (or potentially lose) value through a network of employees contractors and third parties dispersed around the globe. How can boards oversee performance or make sure everyone in that network is upholding the standards of business without this direct line of sight?

Together these factors create a board member’s worst nightmare: considerable exposure to risk with poor optics and little control.

A clear and present danger or someone else’s problem?

Each of these trends could be a powerful force for change and deserves time and consideration. Collectively though they will have significant implications for boards.

Directors may feel that making the systemic changes required to adapt to these trends can wait while they address the four issues our study identified as the key challenges for boards right now - regulatory and legal demands; outdated and manual modus operandi; technology and skills gaps; and competing stakeholder and ESG pressures. But we can spot clear links between today’s challenges and the trends creating tomorrow’s conditions for boards - those that act now to rethink their operating model can ease pressures now and get ahead of change. Key questions for directors can help kickstart the process:",,,,,,,,,

Restructuring of TelOne’s $347 billion (US$432 million) legacy debt to improve the firm’s performance is expected to be completed by year-end.

Minister of Information Communication Technology Postal and Courier Services Dr Jenfan Muswere told TelOne’s annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday he was confident the Government will soon resolve the issue.

He said the plan would involve warehousing the fixed telecommunication company’s foreign loans amounting to US$432 million in line with resolutions passed by the Cabinet in March 2019.

Minister Muswere said while the State-owned enterprise’s performance for 2020 was good it had however been weighed down by onerous legacy obligations.

TelOne’s net loss before tax narrowed to $103 billion in 2020 from $35 billion a year earlier.

“The impact of the PTC (Post and Telecommunications Company) legacy loans on the company’s performance has been noted and indeed the $347 billion legacy loan expenses have overshadowed the positive performance achieved at operating profit level.

“It is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has already expressed willingness by the shareholder to warehouse TelOne’s legacy debt” Minister Muswere said.

With a stronger balance sheet he added TelOne would be able to declare a dividend.

Warehousing the legacy loans is meant to allow restructuring of the company’s balance sheet and pave way for privatisation.

Last year the company realised an operating profit of $523 million up from $449 million in 2019.

Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 2 percent from $658 million to $671 million in 2020 driven by revenue growth and cost containment.

Staff cost-to-income ratio was within the prescribed threshold of 30 percent.

Inflation-adjusted revenue grew by 147 percent to $47 billion in 2020 on rising demand for broadband services.

Home broadband subscribers jumped 14 percent to 128 545 in the period.

Subscribers have since risen to 129 590.

“This development is key in that it resonates with the drive by the Government to increase access and utilisation of broadband especially as a key driver for economic development” Minister Muswere said.

Revenues from voice services declined 19 percent as subscribers dropped by 4 percent.

TelOne was also commended for generating its own foreign currency although the earnings were still inadequate to cover its foreign currency-denominated bills.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ATLANTA — An eighth arrest has been made in the murder case of Rossana Delgado a metro Atlanta mother of two and taxi driver who was found dead after going missing in April.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said on Saturday that Juan Ayala-Rodriguez had been arrested in Durango Mexico on June 26 and that he has since been transferred to the United States.

Ayala-Rodriguez is currently in detention in California.

Three more suspects in the case Mario Alberto Barbosa-Juarez Carolina Jazmin Rodriguez-Ramirez and Maria Chavez are still at large according to the GBI.

Chavez was most recently identified as a suspect last month. Rodriguez-Ramirez was announced as a suspect in May.

Also that month three suspects were arrested in Mexico.

""The GBI and the Gilmer County Sheriff’s Office continue to actively investigate this case and the individuals involved in the murder of Rossana Delgado"" the GBI said. Delgado was killed in Gilmer County authorities have said.

Delgado had been reported missing in Barrow County on April 16 and had last been seen in DeKalb County on that day.

Her close friends said Delgado spoke to her husband around 7 p.m. that Friday night right before picking up a person for her job. That was the last time he spoke with her. He reported her missing about eight hours later.

Surveillance video shows the last moments she was seen at a Ross store in the Chamblee mall called Plaza Fiesta next to another woman.

Friends and family don't know who she is but they said Delgado's husband was able to trace his wife's last moves through her phone. He was able to track the phone to a home in DeKalb County and said the signal was there for roughly one hour before heading to a public storage unit on Covington Highway. There Delgado's husband found a face mask with blood on it.

A day after those close to the mother of two spoke with 11Alive the GBI released details on her death and the people they believe may be tied to it. According to the agency Delgado's body was found by Gilmer County deputies while checking a home in Cherry Log on April 20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMzIxNjIxOC9yb3NzYW5hLWRlbGdhZG8tbHlmdC1kZWF0aC1maXZlLXBlb3BsZS1jdXN0b2R5LWdlb3JnaWEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy8zMjE2MjE4L3Jvc3NhbmEtZGVsZ2Fkby1seWZ0LWRlYXRoLWZpdmUtcGVvcGxlLWN1c3RvZHktZ2VvcmdpYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rossana Delgado death – five people in custody after ‘killing of Lyft driver mom’ as officers hunt three mo...,"COPS CLOSE IN Rossana Delgado death – five people in custody after ‘killing of Lyft driver mom’ as officers hunt three more suspects

FIVE people are now in custody after allegedly killing a Lyft driver mom as a hunt is underway for three more suspects according to authorities.

Georgia authorities announced on Saturday that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) and the Gilmer County Sheriff’s Office are actively investigating the case of Rossana Delgado and looking to find and arrest the other three murder suspects.

Rossana Delgado 37 was last seen alive at a mall in Atlanta Georgia on April 16 after telling her husband she was picking up a passenger and would then be heading home.

The Venezuelan-born taxi driver and mother of two was later found dead.

She never returned to her home in Barrow County that night and her body was found four days later at a home in Cherry Log a small rural community 87 miles away.

Investigators have not released any information about Delgado's killing however five suspects are now in custody after being linked to her murder.

A GBI news release published on July 3 states: ""A coordinated effort to locate and arrest the other three murder suspects Mario Alberto Barbosa-Juarez Carolina Jazmin Rodriguez-Ramirez and Maria Chavez is active and ongoing.""

Chavez Rodriguez-Ramirez and Barbosa-Juarez are believed to be in Mexico.

Meanwhile the five suspects in custody are Calvin Howard 28 Megan Colone 30 and Oscar Manual Garcia 26 Juan Antonio Vega 25 Juan Ayala-Rodriguez age 35.

Ayala-Rodriguez was arrested in Mexico and is in custody in California and Howard was allegedly found with Delgado’s red Ford Focus and the vehicles of the other suspects.

Colone Garcia and Vega were apprehended on May 15 in Mexico and later taken to the US.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation first issued arrest warrants for four of the five suspects back in April.

They were identified as Georgia residents Megan Alyssa Colone Juan Ayala-Rodriguez and Oscar Manuel Garcia as well as Mario Alberto Barbosa-Juarez.

Delgado was reported missing by her husband eight hours after he spoke to her over the phone on April 16 when she told him she was picking up her last passenger of the day.

The mother-of-two was last seen on surveillance footage at a Ross store in Chamblee mall called Plaza Fiesta next to another woman.

Concerned for his wife's safety Delgado's husband was able to trace her last movements through her phone.

He was able to track the device to a home in DeKalb County and said the signal was there for roughly one hour before heading to a public storage unit on Covington Highway.

There he discovered a face mask with blood on it according to 11 Alive.

Her body was found four days later on April 20 after authorities conducted a welfare check at a home in Cherry Log.

This new laptop chip will take advantage of Nuvia's core architecture which Qualcomm acquired a while back.

In an interview with Reuters Amon said Qualcomm can have the best chip on the market thanks to its new team who worked on Apple's M1 SoC. Instead of using ARM cores Qualcomm plans to design its own chips.

To design its custom chips Qualcomm will make use of its recent $1.4 billion acquisition Nuvia. Using its core architecture expertise the chip manufacturer hopes to release a new laptop CPU in 2022. If Arm designs a better CPU than them Amon claimed that “[they] always have the option to license from Arm”.

Amon also stated that there are no plans to develop data centre CPUs or other big markets but Nuvia's core license is available for anyone interested in it.

Before being acquired by Qualcomm Nuvia shared a bit about what its core architecture was capable of. Compared to AMD Zen2 and Intel Sunny Cove Nuvia cores could deliver 50% higher peak performance at a third of the power in Geekbench 5. Moreover it also claimed that they could also outperform Apple A13 Lightning cores.

KitGuru says: Even if the new laptop Snapdragon SoCs can compete with Apple's chips the systems using them will be running Windows or Chrome OS. Qualcomm may take some market share from Apple but in the end it will be more disruptive in the Windows and Chrome OS laptop market where AMD and Intel still reign supreme.

Now however one version of this phone (the one with a Snapdragon processor) has become even more worthwhile with a new and more up-to-date major software upgrade.

4 Reviews

Realme mounted its first real challenge to the popular Galaxy M series with the C15 its first phone to rock the 6000mah battery heretofore only seen in the Samsung devices at their general price-point. Their new rival also offered a 6.5-inch HD+ display dual SIM-card slots and even microSD card support. To date it has run on the same Android 10-based UI it had out of the box; however that has just changed.

The OEM has announced an upgrade to Realme UI 2.0 based on Android 11 now available to users in India. It offers new privacy and security tweaks more dark modes and the ability to adapt a wallpaper based on system-wide color accents. However there is a catch: it has only been released for the Snapdragon 460-powered version of the phone in question.

Therefore this might make the C15 Qualcomm Edition a particularly good deal at its starting price of INR 9999 (~US$134; for a 3GB RAM SKU)...even if this left its MediaTek Helio G35-based counterpart behind. On the other hand this phone starts even cheaper on Amazon right now at INR 9575 (~US$129) for those who don't mind the relative compromise on software.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3NuYXBkcmFnb24tODg4LXBsdXMtdnMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgtcGx1cy12cy1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon 888 Plus vs Snapdragon 888 – All Specs Feature Differences Compared,"As tradition holds Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 888 Plus a few days ago. As most of you know it is a slightly overclocked variant of the Snapdragon 888 which would eventually fuel Android flagships arriving in the remaining half of 2021. However has the company unveiled an SoC that holds a significant difference from its lower-clocked variant? Here are all the details you should know.

Snapdragon 888 Plus vs Snapdragon 888 - All the Similarities

First let us go over some similarities first. The Snapdragon 888 Plus and Snapdragon 888 are manufactured on Samsung’s 5nm LPE architecture and the CPU cluster remains the same divided in the 1 + 3 + 4 configuration. Strange enough where Qualcomm previously introduced a slight GPU clock speed boost to its chipsets featuring the ‘Plus’ moniker it has refrained from doing so on this occasion.

Just like the Snapdragon 888 the Snapdragon 888 Plus features the same Adreno 660 GPU operating at 840MHz. This means that between the two chipsets you are not expected to find any differences when firing up graphically demanding applications. Additionally Qualcomm has not used its latest and greatest Snapdragon X65 5G modem and integrated it into the Snapdragon 888 Plus. Instead it uses the older Snapdragon X60 which is on the Snapdragon 888.

Support for LPDDR5 at 3200MHz remains the same for both chipsets and so does the total memory bandwidth at 51.2GB/s. The triple 14-bit Spectra 580 image signal processor also remains consistent between the two silicon and there is no difference between the maximum supported cameras either.

Snapdragon 888 Plus vs Snapdragon 888 - All the Differences

Where we could find some differences between previous-generation chipset releases from Qualcomm here there are only two. The clock speed of the single Kryo 680 core based on the Cortex-X1 running in the Snapdragon 888 Plus operates at 2.995GHz while the same core in the Snapdragon 888 runs at 2.84GHz. That is a measly increase of 5.2 percent and the majority of the time you will hardly find any redeeming differences between the two.

The rest of the clock speeds remain the same and in case you want to know the complete details that info is given below.

Snapdragon 888 Plus - 1 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-X1) running at 2.995GHz 3 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A78) running at 2.42GHz and 4 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A55) running at 1.80GHz.

- 1 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-X1) running at 2.995GHz 3 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A78) running at 2.42GHz and 4 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A55) running at 1.80GHz. Snapdragon 888 - 1 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-X1) running at 2.84GHz 3 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A78) running at 2.42GHz and 4 x Kryo 680 (based on Cortex-A55) running at 1.80GHz.

The AI performance of the Snapdragon 888 Plus also sees an upgrade to 32TOPS which is a 20 percent increase compared to the Snapdragon 888’s AI performance of 26TOPS. Whether or not this increase will translate into a real-world use-case we will find out in the future. Given that the Snapdragon 888 Plus is not that different from the Snapdragon 888 it is hardly a surprise that Samsung may not use it in its upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 3.

According to a specifications leak the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is expected to feature a Snapdragon 888 not Qualcomm’s newly announced SoC. It is possible Samsung did not find a reason to pay a higher cost of the Snapdragon 888 Plus for diminishing returns. It is also likely that Qualcomm did not see any advantage in introducing more differences between its chipsets when it comes to CPU and GPU clock speeds as it would have resulted in unnecessary power consumption heat generation and by extension performance throttling.

Also since we are in the second half of 2021 Qualcomm likely wants to focus its resources on the upcoming Snapdragon 895 which is said to be the first chipset from the company to be made on Samsung’s 4nm node. The first flagship smartphone bearing new SoC will reportedly launch later this year and with the unveiling we could see noteworthy performance and power efficiency improvements.

Looking at the difference between the Snapdragon 888 Plus and Snapdragon 888 do you think it would be wise for Qualcomm’s partners to go with the faster silicon despite those negligible differences?

His father Dick started farming on the south side of the section and stayed home from school to help his dad making it through eighth grade. Dick eventually had land on both sides of it including this farm where they moved in 1963.

James graduated from high school in 1965 and went right into farming. He and Susan who was from Spicer Minn. married in 1971 and moved to the farm on the south side of the section. They moved to the north side in 1979 when Dick retired.

They built the new home in 2012. James and Susan had seen various flag displays and decided to add that to their landscape.

“Pride in America I guess” he said quietly when asked about the display. “I believe in our freedom.”

James was in the 825th Army Reserve Company of out of Willmar Minn. for six years active for five months taking basic training in Fort Leonard Wood Mo. He did on-the-job training in Fort Bliss Texas.

Today James still helps some on the farm which is just west of Prinsburg. Sons Tim and Terry raise corn beans sugarbeets and edible (black) beans. Tim also custom-feeds isowean piglets to market weight hogs in a 2400-head barn for a neighbor.

The Ahrenholz family produces beets for Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative at Renville. The guys in the green beet trucks can see the flags along Minnesota Highway 7. The beet crop this year looks good but needs rain. They were thankful for a good year in 2020 after excessively wet years in 2018 and 2019.

Ahrenholz said he gets positive comments and some questions about the Christian flag. Some wonder if it represents all Christians.

“Yes it does” he said.

The flag trio flies 24 hours a day seven days a week. They take a bit of care to maintain.

“With the wind we’ve got they tear. She sews them up or we get a new one. We have to do that” James said.

But if it’s real work it’s not on Sundays. The family is in the Christian Reformed Church which grew from Dutch and German immigrant families. They adhere to certain rules.

“We do not work on Sunday” Ahrenholz said adding “We’ve made a good living.

This past February Mahomes had the chance to enter himself into the GOAT debate by defeating Tom Brady. However in the Super Bowl Brady and the Buccaneers usurped defending champions Kansas City Chiefs in style. And now Mahomes has found himself at the receiving end of a reference from hip-hop icon Drake.

Drake dropped a new song this weekend titled ‘Lemon Pepper Freestyle’. In the track with Rick Ross Drake dropped lines “Patty Mahomes ‘bout to fall short a couple hunnid/Signed sealed delivered…/She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers”.

Patrick Mahomes playfully responded on Twitter to ‘Drizzy. He posted a GIF of none other than Drake from his ‘Popstar’ music video where Drake has an incredulous look on his face almost as if he is speechless. Perhaps Mahomes was lost for words on how to respond to the musical mega-star. Or it could be his way of firing some barbs back at the ‘Six God’.

Will Patrick Mahomes bounce back next season?

Mahomes signed a massive $503 million 10-year extension with the Kansas City Chiefs. It is the largest American sports contract in history to this day. However he will not be seeing all of that money in his pocket as a good chunk of the deal consists of performance and incentive-based bonuses.

Mahomes had a fantastic season with the Chiefs last year. Heading into the Super Bowl the Chiefs had only lost two regular-season games. However their defensive inefficiencies got exposed when Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ran roughshod on them in the Super Bowl. Mahomes had a rough night and wasn’t able to throw for a single touchdown in the game.

But I think the biggest interesting fact is here that MSI managed to get the word ""sex"" into the graphics card name ""SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA"" -- I mean LOL. Anyway the new MSI GeForce RTX 3070 SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA is part of the Lite Hash Rate (LHR) series which has its crypto mining powers gimped.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

The custom theme that MSI has used on the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA looks fantastic with the front cooler getting a red/black theme treatment -- but man-oh-man the backplate is something I need in my gaming PC as soon as humanly possible.

The backplate has a beautiful red color that is something that I'm sure looks even better in person with the brushed aluminum painted in amaranth color with GODZILLA roaring at the RTX 3070 GPU and 8GB of GDDR6X memory on the back.

MSI is a big fan of dragons obviously but now it has two dragons on its new GeForce RTX 3070 SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA graphics card. The new card is aimed at the Japanese gaming market but I will be reaching out and asking if they'll be kind enough to send me one over for review.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9tc2ktZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA3MC1zdXByaW0tc2UteC1nb2R6aWxsYS1waWN0dXJlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI GeForce RTX 3070 SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA pictured,"MSI Lucky Dragon turns into Godzilla

MSI partners up with Toho Co. Ltd to launch a Godzilla themed GeForce graphics card.

MSI Gaming brand has always been associated with dragons in fact even the Gaming logo itself features a dragon. The company’s mascot name is Dragon Lucky which has been used in various marketing campaigns but also for products including MSI clothing line brick toys or plush toys. With the current generation of graphics cards MSI released a new premium series called SUPRIM. The company already announced it will launch a 30th Anniversary model based on the series as well.

MSI GeForce RTX 3070 SUPRIM SE x GODZILLA is the latest addition to the manufacturer’s lineup. This model is based on the latest version of the RTX 3070 GPU with Lite Hash Rate enabled. It features a boost clock up to 1785 MHz in Extreme Performance mode which can be applied through Dragon Center software. By default the clock speed is 1770 MHz. It’s a full custom design with a dual 8-pin power connector and TDP of 240W. That said this model offers identical specifications to RTX 3070 LHR SUPRIM SE which has only been released last month.

The SUPRIM x GODZILLA model offers a new color scheme which is black and amaranth. The backplate made entirely by brushed aluminum has been painted in amaranth color with the addition of Godzilla himself. It goes without saying that SUPRIM x GODZILLA series is targeted at the Japanese market.

The League a 75-year-old national federation of more than 300 astronomy organizations was co-founded by famed professional astronomer Dr. Harlow Shapley of Harvard University.

The award plaque will be presented during the League’s 2021 virtual convention this August. The event is headlined by a cast of accomplished professional astronomers including pulsar discoverer Dr. Jocelyn Bell Burnell of Oxford University. Clairmont will present his paper at the convention.

Clairmont will receive a plaque a substantial telescope prize sponsored by Explore Scientific and an all-expenses paid trip to the League’s 2022 national convention in Albuquerque New Mexico.

The award was founded in 1993 and is now in its 29th year. Award prizes are sponsored by Scott Roberts and Explore Scientific.

Clairmont’s project involved his creation of the first three dimensional (3D) morpho-kinematic model of the Cat’s Eye Nebula a planetary nebula in the constellation of Draco. Using Hubble Space Telescope images existing motion-velocity diagrams and his own spectroscopic observations of the nebula he was able to create the first 3D hydrodynamic model of the nebula and offer a physically justifiable evolutionary explanation of the nebula’s strange bi-polar nature. He was able to determine that the rings and inner shell of the nebula are consistent with formation by two separate precessing wind events and with the existence of a close binary star at the center of the nebula.

He collected his own spectra of the nebula using an 8-inch Newtonian telescope with spectrograph and CCD camera. The astrophysical models that he generated explain the nebula’s three dimensional ringed structure and provide a plausible physical explanation of the nebula’s evolution giving further insight into the underlying formation of all planetary nebulae.

Earlier this year Clairmont’s project also won first place in Physics and Astronomy at the prestigious Regeneron International Science & Engineering Fair.

Thanks to donations the new bin painted and decorated to look like the front of one of the city’s fire trucks became available for use in the back parking lot of Fire Station 1 320 S. DePeyster St. on June 28 said Fire Chief John Tosko.

“It’s already a quarter full” he said on Thursday.

Area fire departments have for years collected cans for Aluminum Cans for Burned Children an organization affiliated with but independent of Akron Children’s Hospital. The collected cans go to an Akron recycler with the proceeds benefitting patients of the hospital’s burn unit.

Tosko said he discovered last year that the Hudson Fire Department has a bin similar to the one Kent now has and he reached out to Rhonda Kadish Hudson’s community relations manager. She gave him contact information to get a donated trash bin from Republic Services and put him into touch with Hudson resident Marci Matthews.

“She is a donor for Akron Children’s Hospital” said Tosko. “She does a lot of philanthropy work through Akron Children’s Hospital so she’s a really big supporter of that. When she heard what we were doing she was very enthusiastic about supporting us. So she really made a lot of this happen.”

Matthews donated $353 for paint and $1284 for graphics put on the bin. The painting was done by LaMancusa Auto Body on Enterprise Way which donated the labor and the graphics were provided by Advanced Display Systems on Mogadore Road both in Kent.

“I wanted to use a local body shop and a local graphics shop” said Tosko.

Station 1 is a new collection location. It was previously at Station 2 on North Mantua Street.

“[Station 1 is] a little bit easier for people to get to and more visible” said Tosko. “Plus there’s going to be construction beginning soon at Station 2 so they’ll need that space for construction equipment.”

Tosko said only aluminum cans are accepted and he is requesting that they be bagged because it can be difficult removing loose cans from the bottom of the bin.

“Garbage bags full of cans would be perfect” he said.

Go to https://www.akronchildrens.org/ACBC for more information about Aluminum Cans for Burned Children including a list of drop-off sites in Portage Summit and Stark counties.

Tosko said he is pleased with the new bin and grateful for the help in getting it.

“It was a great collaboration between everybody together to make this happen” he said. “So we’re appreciative of everything that everyone did to make this happen.”

By 2023 a constellation of two-dozen tiny satellites designed by the National Aeronautics Space Administration’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory or JPL based in Pasadena and constructed and managed by Planet Labs a private Earth-imaging firm in San Francisco will map “chemical weather” — otherwise undetectable plumes of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.

The automation of precise near real-time measurements from orbit will provide agencies like the California Environmental Protection Agency the California Air Resources Board and state air quality management districts powerful new tools in the battle against climate change and industrial activities that produce harmful greenhouse gases.

From 2016 to 2020 planes equipped with JPL-designed sensors flew over nearly 300000 potential sources of emissions in California including industrial equipment used by oil refineries landfills and industrial agriculture facilities. The sensors will eventually be installed on orbiting satellites no larger than a mini-fridge for fully remote around-the-clock imaging of air pollution sources.



The early studies revealed nearly 600 such “point sources” which researchers define as industrial elements less than 10 meters in diameter responsible for highly concentrated methane plumes. Those studies found 10% of the sources — dubbed “super emitters” by the research group — produced two-thirds of all emissions.



“The outcome of this study is that less than 0.2 percent of the infrastructure we surveyed is responsible for at least a third of the state’s entire methane inventory” said Riley Duren chief executive officer of Carbon Mapper the nonprofit organization that is leading the research consortium.



A series of state greenhouse gas reduction laws mandate a 40% reduction in methane from 2013 levels by 2030. Despite its designation as a “short-lived climate pollutant” methane a byproduct of organic waste has a warming effect on the atmosphere that exceeds that of carbon dioxide. The law sets specific targets for methane reductions in landfills and livestock agriculture operations.



According to Carbon Mapper California’s landfills comprise the largest category of all methane emitters 41% followed by livestock agriculture and petroleum facilities each responsible for about 26%.



As part of the project Carbon Mapper contacted companies to provide them with their own emissions data in hopes that they could identify the causes of gas leaks and fix them.



“Most of these are malfunctions” said Duren. “In fact when we share the data with operators in general … they’re reporting that about 50% of what we’re finding is fixable.”



In 2016 when methane sensor overflights began Sunshine Canyon Landfill — one of the nation’s largest municipal garbage dumps — stank like rotten eggs. Each day approximately 9000 tons of garbage flow into the 1000-acre site located in the northeast corner of the San Fernando Valley mostly from the city of Los Angeles.



The landfill’s owner Republic Services and local environmental regulators were unable to discover the source of gases that were causing odors so overwhelming that nearby residents filed a class-action lawsuit. The firm eventually began working with Duren’s team to resolve the leaks.



“We had more extensive data than any other landfill in the world in terms of surface emissions so I gave all that to NASA and they used it to calibrate their methane flux model” said Eugene Tseung an environmental engineer and attorney who has been advising Sunshine Canyon Landfill and its regulators. Tseung said that the collaboration has led him to develop new protocols for similar aerial surveillance and methane mitigation of landfills around the world.



“We are currently collaborating with JPL-CARB and consider our relationship to be synergistic with our commitment to innovation and sustainable solutions” Republic Services said in a written response to the Bay Area News Group.



Bill Gates is a major shareholder of Republic Services which reported 2020 revenues of $874 million. Gates is also a significant shareholder at Waste Management a major Northern California landfill owner which reported $15 billion in revenue last year.



SoCal Gas which serves 21 million customers across the state also used the project’s imagery to resolve a massive methane leak. The Aliso Canyon leak near Porter Ranch contributed more than 109000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere from October 2015 to February 2016. The source of the leak was detected by a spectrometer aboard the Earth Observing-1 satellite and by planes equipped with various sensors.



“They had a four-inch pipe that was running underneath this street in a subdivision with no obvious infrastructure around and we saw this big plume coming up through a manhole cover and SoCal Gas went out there and found that the pipe had actually cracked” said Charles Miller a scientist at JPL and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “Some refer to this new paradigm as getting at what we call ‘chemical weather.’” Related Articles Science | Letters: CalPERS’ responsibility | Anti-BDS law | Strengthen rules | Normal politics | Expand message

Jorn Herner who is leading the state Air Resources Board’s efforts to use new sensors for pollutant measurement said that once the full complement of satellites is launched into orbit in 2023 the environmental regulator will be able to inform other regulators and companies about emissions leaks within 48 hours of detection.

Once 15 satellites are deployed CARB will have “near-daily coverage” of most of California’s greenhouse gas emissions Herner said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYW55Ym9keXMtd2VsY29tZS1mbG9yaWRhLXBhc3Rvci1pbnZpdGVzLWFsbGlnYXRvci10by1jaHVyY2gtb2ZmZXJzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNhcmQv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVwdWJsaWN3b3JsZC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hbnlib2R5cy13ZWxjb21lLWZsb3JpZGEtcGFzdG9yLWludml0ZXMtYWxsaWdhdG9yLXRvLWNodXJjaC1vZmZlcnMtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2FyZC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Anybody’s welcome': Florida pastor invites alligator to church; offers business card,"Advertisement

“I need to invite this gator to church” the pastor can be heard saying labelling the reptile as “one of the daycare workers” that came for a visit although it “turns out to be a gator”. “Want to check us out?” he goes on to add as he walks up close to the creature.

Gregory also uploaded the photographs of the gator on his Facebook handle with the caption “When a Gator shows up to your church but isn’t ready to accept the Lord.” Several onlookers can be seen standing clueless about the gator’s next move as the pastor gets ""personal with the big guy"". “He’s coming to church get ready” said Gregory in a video that emerged online.

The predator however seemed to have denied to avail the church service or the pastor’s offer to baptize him as he scurried back into the storm drain.

'Definitely not advisable' warns Florida's conservation commission

Adam Brown of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told Fox10 that while the footage is pleasing in its viewing aspects it is definitely not advisable to approach close to a wandering alligator as he also warned that the residents must “not to take that chance”. The pastor though admitted in televised remarks that it may not have been “the best idea” to get near the wild animal in that fashion. FWC Nuisance Alligator Hotline at 866-FWC-GATOR rolled out the digits cautioning people if there’s an alligator in the vicinity it is advisable that one should like to have it removed instantly by the wildlife experts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcnR1Z2FscmVzaWRlbnQuY29tL2FudG9uaW8tZG9zLXNhbnRvcy1yYW1hbGhvLWVhbmVzLTE2dGgtcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLXRoZS1yZXB1YmxpYy1wYXJ0LTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,António dos Santos Ramalho Eanes – 16th President of the Republic - Part 1,"If there were any doubts that the Carnation Revolution which ushered in the Third Portuguese Republic was a military movement it is perhaps enough to consider the first three Presidents of the Republic after April 25 1974. The first was General António de Spínola; the second General Francisco da Costa Gomes; and the third General António Ramalho Eanes. They were all Generals.

Eanes is unique in one respect. When he left office at age 51 after two terms as President of the Republic he was still younger than any other democratically elected President taking office for the first time. Yet at the time of the Carnation Revolution he was a serving officer in Angola unknown to anyone except his professional colleagues in the army.

From June 1974 to June 1976 he progressed in rank from Major to General and also became President of the Republic at the age of 41. How had this rapid promotion happened? How had this unknown young man captured the votes of the majority of Portuguese who were voting in a Presidential election for the first time in the new Republic?

The young Eanes

António was born in Castelo Branco in 1935 into the family of a civil construction contractor Manuel dos Santos Eanes. He had two older sisters and one younger brother each of whom was educated in a profession. The sisters qualified in teaching or commerce and young João in civil engineering. Their parents merit respect for the education they made available to their children and they also inculcated values of honesty and honour.

When he failed a year at the Liceu of Castelo Branco in 1947 12-year-old António had a memorable lesson from his father. He was told that many other boys of his age would be working from dawn till dusk earning for the family but he on the other hand had the privilege of an education and his father would not support a slacker. The boy took heed and when he left school his marks averaged 80%.

With his quiet introspective and disciplined personality he had dreamt of becoming a priest or a doctor but António eventually chose a career in the army because it seemed the quickest way to become financially independent. He said: “I wanted to escape small-town life. For a 17-year-old the military life holds attraction. My education was also nationalist which contributed to my choice. But I never joined the Mocidade Portuguesa.”

Service in the army

António Eanes joined the army in 1952 finishing his cadet course in 1957 as Second Lieutenant. Posted to Mafra he qualified as a physical training instructor. On his first overseas posting to Goa in 1958 he was captivated by the different lifestyle.

Spending two years there as the sole Portuguese in a unit of Goans he discovered another culture and echoed the words of the great Afonso de Albuquerque that no power can continue unless it is rooted in men’s hearts. When the Indian invasion happened in December 1961 he volunteered to return to Goa but his offer was not taken up.

Now Captain Eanes in 1962 he was posted to Macau where Portuguese and Chinese lived parallel lives so different from Goa. He made a friend of Lieutenant Arnaldo Matos whom he admired for his disciplined and demanding way with his men. His next overseas posting was to Mozambique where he spent nearly three years.

He later admitted that commanding men in action was difficult and the experience had a lasting effect on him.

Eanes was very interested in human nature and studied the first three years of a Psychology course at the ISPA (Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada) in Lisbon. When he was in Guiné in 1970 serving under General Spínola this psychological knowledge together with his personal qualities of good sense and equilibrium made him the ideal candidate to run the Broadcasting and Press Service and Spínola later decorated him for his efforts.

Much later in 1978 it was Eanes as President of the Republic who oversaw the re-integration of the disgraced General Spínola into the Portuguese armed forces.

Marriage

Also in 1970 on October 28 at Palácio de Queluz he made what he calls the best decision of his personal life when he married Maria Manuela Duarte Neto de Portugal. They have two sons Manuel António born in 1972 and Miguel born in 1974.

With her tranquility and spiritual peace Maria Manuela accompanied Eanes on all of his engagements as President. In their photographs she always looks radiantly happy and has undoubtedly been an immense support to her husband.

It is a matter of great regret to Eanes that his father had died in 1970 and never knew these grandchildren. “My father never knew his grandsons. His death is one of the great sadnesses in my life. One’s parents are so important in one’s life but strangely after a certain age this importance grows and when they are alive we scarcely realise how decisive they are.”

In March 1973 he was promoted to the rank of Major and he was one of the 400 regular army officer co-signatories who protested about the promotion of militia officers. He took part in the preparatory meetings of the Captains of April before he was posted to Angola in February 1974. The reports of his commanding officers were uniform in their enthusiastic commendations. The army hierarchy had high hopes for this officer who would soon exceed even their greatest expectations.

After the Revolution

In June 1974 two months after the Carnation Revolution Eanes was summoned from Angola to Lisbon where the then President General Spínola appointed him as Director of Programmes and soon afterwards President of the Administrative Council of RTP (Rádio e Televisão de Portugal). He admits that he had little training for this work but was supported by his professional colleagues at the station. He must have done something right because in November of 1974 he was promoted to Lt Colonel.

The attempted coup of March 11 1975 (by his former commander General Spínola) brought a crisis. Eanes decided to carry the normal daytime schedule on the television network in order not to provoke further reactions in Lisbon. It was suspected that he was acting out of loyalty to his former commander especially since his brother-in-law was also a supporter of the attempted coup. Eanes immediately resigned his position at RTP demanding an enquiry and refusing any further assignment until his name was cleared.

The Junta de Salvação Nacional was abolished after this attempted coup and replaced by the powerful Conselho da Revolução which was a combination of the extinct Junta da Salvação Nacional and the Conselho do Estado. The Conselho da Revolução comprised the President Chief of the Armed Forces and his deputy chiefs of the army navy and air force and 14 other military officers. This Conselho was abolished in 1982 and its wide powers devolved onto the Conselho do Estado Tribunal Constitutional and the Assembleia da República.

In the summer of 1975 Eanes answered the call of President Costa Gomes to take command of and disband the army’s Fifth Division a hotbed of leftist revolutionary propaganda and he was a signatory of the Documento dos Nove in which senior officers proposed a political route different from the pro-soviet model.

November 25 1975

There was another attempted coup d’état on November 25 this time by leftist army units including the élite parachutists. Eanes later said of the attempted coup that “November 25 was the most important moment in my professional life” and under the guidance of President Costa Gomes Eanes directed the forces of order to suppress the rising. It was easy for him to identify his friends among the rebels but personally very difficult to imprison them.

This event proved to be the first time that Eanes appeared on the public stage the hardened soldier in combat fatigues and darkened glasses and he earned public support by his actions at this time. Two days later he was promoted to General and made Chief of the Army and was now a member of the Conselho da Revolução.

The news emerged during a press conference as Miami Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava announced that search and rescue teams had recovered another two bodies bringing the total to 24. Officials had yet to account for 124 people believed to have been in the 12-story tower when it collapsed on June 24.

Cava earlier in the week had warned that it might take weeks to carefully deconstruct the section but fearful of Elsa’s approach engineers with the state Department of Transportation recommended quicker action.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said the process could take as little as 36 hours.

“Taking the building down given the fact that the storm is coming and given the fact that you were going to have to do this anyways is the prudent thing to do. And I think it will lead to the course of action that most minimally disrupts the rescue efforts” he said.

The state will pick up the costs DeSantis said.

“At the end of the day that building is too unsafe to let people go back in. I know there are a lot of people who were able to get out fortunately who have things there. We’re very sensitive to that. But I don’t think there’s any way you could let somebody go up in that building given the shape that it’s in now” he said.

“The fear was that the hurricane may take the building down for us and take it down in the wrong direction — on top of the pile where we have victims” Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said.

Cava who made the decision to bring the structure down said the county already has a signed contract to make it happen.

She met with family members Saturday morning and informed them of the decision. Some have expressed concern about pets left being in the building but three searches have failed to find any Cava said.

Engineers were still planning the process and haven’t settled on an exact time yet she said.

“The proposal that is here now this proposed demolition is a very narrow footprint so we’re not looking at major impacts to the area or additional evacuations. Again we are still in the due-diligence process and we will get back to you as soon as we have the exact details.”

With the Surfside structure down search and rescue workers could remain on the site even if the wind picks up DeSantis said.

“If they are out there though and you start to get some of these gusts with that structure there that would be a real real hazard and I would imagine it would likely cause them to do a work stoppage” he continued.

“We have a building here in Surfside that is tottering it is structurally unsound and although the eye of the storm is not likely to pass over this direction you could feel gusts in this area. We don’t know. It’s definitely a possibility” DeSantis said.

Following the collapse Cava ordered audits of buildings nearing their mandatory 40-year inspections. On Friday inspectors declared that a condo complex in North Miami Beach was at danger of collapse and ordered it evacuated according to news reports.

Officials in Key Biscayne played down the danger at another structure after a TikTok video appeared to show cracked concrete in the garage again according to news reports. Officials concluded the apparent problem represented cosmetic damage to an expansion joint.

In other updates from the Florida Division of Emergency Management:

“Task Forces from Virginia Indiana Ohio Pennsylvania and New Jersey have been deployed to Surfside to ensure additional first responders are available in the event of severe weather in Florida.”

“In collaboration with FDEM Royal Caribbean Group docked Royal Caribbean International’s Explorer of the Seas at PortMiami to provide free housing and support for the tireless efforts of search and rescue teams working at the Surfside Building Collapse.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQmxvZ3MvRGlzcGF0Y2gvUGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1tdXN0LWFkYXB0LXRvLXJ1bGVzLWZvci1wb3J0LWNhbGxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. cruising: Passengers must adapt to ever-changing rules for port calls,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Blogs/Dispatch/Passengers-must-adapt-to-rules-for-port-calls on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQmxvZ3MvRGlzcGF0Y2gvUGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1tdXN0LWFkYXB0LXRvLXJ1bGVzLWZvci1wb3J0LWNhbGxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLnN4L2lzbGFuZHMvcG9ydC1zdC1tYWFydGVuLXRvLXJlY2VpdmUtZmlyc3QtdHJhbnNpdC1jYWxsLW9uLWp1bHktN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port St. Maarten to receive first transit call on July 7,"Port St. Maarten to receive first transit call on July 7

PHILIPSBURG--The cruise industry is back in gear prompting a staggered approach to the resumption of cruising Port St. Maarten management said over the weekend. “Destination St. Maarten forms a pivotal part of this approach and will be welcoming more than 1000 passengers to its shores”.

In a sector update port management said that they have had a lot of communication with key local stakeholders and the cruise industry in regard to protocols and the safest and most feasible way to resume business. “The team at Port St. Maarten and port users are ready to welcome host and entertain the passengers as they return some 15 months later.”

In addition port management said that coincidentally Celebrity Edge was the last commercial transit vessel that visited the country back in March 2020 and this week it will come back full circle. The port is looking forward to frequent/daily transit calls to the destination in the coming weeks and months.

Minister of Public Health Social Development and Labor (VSA) Omar Ottley stated: “I am extremely happy to be a part of ‘safe tourism.’ At times it is not easy but when a balance is found between economic activity and safety it becomes a special moment and Wednesday July 7 2021 will be a special moment.”

Cruise sector forecasting is currently indicating a strong rebound and the port is looking to local stakeholders such as taxis retailers and tour operators to continue to maintain high service level standards along with local coronavirus COVID-19 public health and safety protocols.

The Celebrity Edge cruise ship described as the new home of modern luxury cruising will be making a transit commercial cruise call to Port St. Maarten on Wednesday July 7. The Royal Caribbean Group brand vessel was the first ocean-going cruise ship to set sail on June 26 from United States Port Everglades after 15 months of no-sail.

The destination remains a favourable port of call for the cruise industry in connection with regular scheduled destination port of calls throughout the week. Scheduled port calls are important to the destination as it will allow passengers to explore the island in a safe manner for a couple of hours as was done pre-COVID-19 pandemic.",,,

Craig Zahler’s Gangster Thriller in Cannes (EXCLUSIVE),"Writer-director S. Craig Zahler (“Bone Tomahawk”) is set to reunite with his “Dragged Across Concrete” and “Brawl in Cell Block 99” star Vince Vaughn and Oscar winner Adrien Brody (“The Pianist”) for upcoming crime thriller “The Bookie & the Bruiser.”

Anton will introduce the film to international distributors at the upcoming Marche du Film in Cannes. UTA Independent Film Group and Range Media Partners arranged the financing and will be representing the North American distribution rights.

Set in 1959 New York “The Bookie & the Bruiser” follows a pensive Jewish fellow named Rivner and an oversized Italian-American tough named Boscolo from the Lower East Side both of whom served overseas during WWII and returned changed men who no longer fit inside the lives they’d left behind. Uninterested in taking orders from bosses or playing by the rules of polite society the two friends partner up as a bookmaker and an enforcer and create an illicit gambling operation that proves to be very profitable though risky and their situation gets rather sticky when they find themselves stuck between a powerful Irish gang and the Mafia. The film is currently in pre-production and is planned for a fall 2024 shoot.

Anthony Katagas — an Oscar winner for “12 Years a Slave” and one of the most prolific producers in U.S. indie film having worked across titles including “Lost City of Z” “Ad Astra” “Uncut Gems” and “Armageddon Time” — will produce via his Keep Your Head Productions alongside Dave Caplan. C2 Motion Picture Group is fully financing the project.

“We are thrilled to be working with the visionary S. Craig Zahler on this action-packed tale of a searing conflict between the Irish-American and Italian Mafias in New York and see Vince and Adrien team up in this very unique power charged film” said Anton CEO Sébastien Raybaud.

“I’m honored and humbled to be working with one of my favorite filmmakers” added Caplan. “A S. Craig Zahler gangster movie is something I’m dying to watch.”

(NYSE:CRM)?,"If you want to know who really controls salesforce.com inc. (NYSE:CRM) then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions often own shares in more established companies while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

With a market capitalization of US$230b salesforce.com is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about salesforce.com.

See our latest analysis for salesforce.com

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About salesforce.com?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

salesforce.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at salesforce.com's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. salesforce.com is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.7% of shares outstanding. For context the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 7.0% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 3.1% of the company's shares.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of salesforce.com

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

I can report that insiders do own shares in salesforce.com inc.. It is a very large company and board members collectively own US$8.1b worth of shares (at current prices). I sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public holds a 18% stake in salesforce.com. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks for instance. Every company has them and we've spotted 3 warning signs for salesforce.com you should know about.

Coop Sweden a national supermarket chain is shut down due to the attack. A public forensic analysis of the ransomware payload indicates the attack came from the REvil ransomware criminal gang.

What is Kaseya VSA?

MSPs or companies who are hired to manage a larger company’s computer network use Kaseya VSA to perform “endpoint management and networking monitoring.” This means Kaseya VSA is installed with full administrative privileges on every computer managed by an MSP which makes it an ideal target for ransomware threat actors.

Compromising an MSP is an effective way for ransomware to be infiltrated into every customer managed by the MSP. And an MSP attack has already happened in 2019 to 22 cities in Texas whose computers were managed by a single MSP.

But this attack is much worse. Like how the SolarWinds and Codecov supply chain attacks amplified the threat actor’s power this Kaseya VSA attack uses two stages of distribution to exponentially amplify ransomware distribution. After compromising the online servers as Kaseya the ransomware began an automatic distribution cycle that delivered the ransomware to Kaseya’s MSP customers. This in turn infected the MSPs customers.

Kaseya says they shut down the compromised server but the ransomware did ultimately get installed into over 200 corporate sites causing business operations to be disrupted.

Deliberate Timing

According to security blog Beeping Computer a REvil ransomware attack timed for a Friday before a holiday weekend is a ransomware criminal tactic.

Most large-scale ransomware attacks are conducted late at night over the weekend when there is less staff to monitor the network. As this attack happened midday on a Friday the threat actors likely planned the time to coincide with the July 4th weekend in the USA where it is common for staff to have a shorter workday before the holidays. Source: Bleeping Computer

The same Bleeping Computer article has a forensic analysis of the methods used to distribute the ransomware. That analysis plus the text of the digital extortion demand leads the publication to conclude the REvil ransomware gang also known as Sodinokibi is behind the attack.

Managing Software Supply Chain Risk

For Salesforce architects and devops practitioners this news reinforces the need to harden how software solutions are crafted. Here are some points to consider when adding open source or external packages to a stack of solutions.

Consider if you have an MSP who may need to improve security or if you have any other kind of management agents on developer workstations.

Secure remote workers with hardware-based VPN routers.

Remember that open source software is everywhere and until now there has been no widespread concern about its security.

Be careful when building your own Salesforce or cloud native solutions. Look for any products that have an open source component to come with a software bill of materials to itemize and validate all 3rd party libraries.

When using any JavaScript or other public library ecosystem be sure to engage in your own software composition analysis (SCA) to check for malicious code. One company I track DigitSec performs this type of scan as part of its security solution.

Time for Action

As if the IT industry needs reminding the United States and its allies are under constantly attack by criminal gangs like REVil emanating from the Russian Federation. All workers in the industry must adopt a cyberwarrior posture and be on guard. Such admonitions are still in effect and if anything the industry must assume that things will get worse before they get better.

At last month’s summit between the United States and the Russian Federation President Joseph R. Biden stated that if any further ransomware attacks reach into 12 critical infrastructure sectors there would be tangible consequences to that action. One of the 12 sectors is the “Information Technology Sector” and Kaseya is most certainly in the IT sector.

The United States and its allies must act against the source of these attacks. Those of us in the IT industry will be overwhelmed if threat actors get infinite do-overs. It is time to address the problem at its source.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvdGNwbC10by13b3JrLWNsb3NlbHktd2l0aC1iaWdiYXNrZXQtdG8tZHJpdmUtd2luLXdpbi1zeW5lcmdpZXMtY2VvLTEyMTA3MDQwMDE3Nl8xLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy90Y3BsLXRvLXdvcmstY2xvc2VseS13aXRoLWJpZ2Jhc2tldC10by1kcml2ZS13aW4td2luLXN5bmVyZ2llcy1jZW8tMTIxMDcwNDAwMTc2XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TCPL to work closely with BigBasket to drive 'win-win' synergies: CEO,"FMCG firm Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) will work ""very closely"" with BigBasket an e-Commerce platform that was recently acquired by the Tata Group to drive win-win synergies in terms of costs and topline according to the company's managing director and CEO Sunil D'Souza.

The company which has more than doubled the sales contribution from e-commerce channel to around 6 per cent for domestic market last fiscal is also focussing on enhancing its direct-to-consumer channel (D2C) approach of selected coffee brands and their specific websites.

As part of the strategy it is bringing 'Eight O'Clock' an America's Original Gourmet Coffee under D2C besides Tata Coffee 1868 and Sonnets.

""We will be working very closely with BigBasket to leverage whatever synergies we get both in terms of topline and costs"" D'Souza told PTI.

When asked about the advantages of working with BigBasket he said ""So we have aligned partners. It is very easy to partner with a group company especially when you have a common vision of where you want to be whether it's on the e-commerce side or the FMCG space.""



""A very close partnership and driving win-win synergies I think that is going to be the key"" he added.

As part of its aggressive expansion into the e-commerce space the Tata Group had last month acquired a majority stake in online grocery seller BigBasket for an undisclosed sum.

In tune with the changing business landscape and consumer behaviour in the wake of the pandemic D'Souza said TCPL has also hired people from outside who had worked with e-commerce portals to get the right talent.

""Because that's (e-commerce) a separate ball game which you need to understand and very difficult to build talent from within"" he added.

He further said ""So far it seems to have worked. For example over the last one year we have doubled the percentage contribution from e-commerce from about 2.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent. We exited March at 6 per cent and it is continuing to grow month on month.""



Stating that TCPL will also enhance its D2C brands such as Tata Coffee 1868 and Sonnets and Eight O'clock he said ""All of these are targeted towards very specific consumers. Going online allows us to target those specific consumers in a very cost-efficient manner.""



TCPL had entered into the D2C space last month by launching its premium roasted and ground coffee under the Sonnets brand targeting mainly urban consumers seeking a special coffee experience.

When asked as if TCPL would add more brands in the D2C space D'Souza said it would like to stabilise these three coffee brands however said I would not rule out launching more brands going forward.""



TCPL which has lesser rural exposure in comparison to other rivals is also expanding its coverage area with expansion in the network in those far-flung areas.

""Compared to the rest of the FMCG world we are probably underweight on rural compared to urban. That said it is not by design but it is by default because right now we rebuilt our entire distribution system first. Focus was getting the urban semi-urban areas in shape and that is where we focused on the integration and now we are moving towards rural"" said D'Souza.

It has now trebled the number of salesforce on the ground and added about 2000 distributors.

""The target is close to 8000 to 9000 distributors and that is what will give me my rural expansion. Right now I would say we are still slightly one step behind the rest of the good FMCG companies in rural (market)"" he said.

On Starbucks D'Souza said it has a significant opportunity to expand as the business model works as same-store profitability is in a ""good place"" and the brand is extremely strong.

""It is probably the strongest brand in the QSR space in India today and if you look at footprint we are still only 221 stores. So I think we have a significant opportunity to expand and what the pandemic has done it it has separated men from boys"" he said.

Stating that weaker players which do not have strong business models have shaken up and given a pause over their expansion plans he said ""Whereas for us we see this an opportunity and that's why store expansion will continue to happen.""



The expansion would be ""deep and wide"" by entering new cities and opening more stores in cities where it has existing outlets.

""It would also be in more formats. We have started a drive-through in Zirakpur (at Ambala Chandigarh Expressway) and now we are figuring out where else to take it. We have also started small engine stores with a smaller footprint (size) as we enter into tier II and III cities we are making sure its right business model for the geography"" he added.

The 55 Pitt Street Sydney development was the last significant site within the so-called APDG (Alfred Pitt Dalley and George streets) block and was “critical in the successful realisation of the precinct” according to the plans that went on exhibition this month.

There are four other major developments in the block owned by Mirvac Lendlease Poly Australia and Yuhu Group.

The latest detailed design by Mirvac details a 53-storey tower up to the maximum 240.8m height limit. The building would add $1 billion in gross value to the CBD.

The plans by Woods Bagot and SHoP also included 70000sq m of commercial and retail floorspace across an eight-storey podium 45 storeys of office space and a large lobby with a waterfall.

The Plan

The office tower itself will sit on part of the surface parking lot at the corner of Superior Avenue and West 3rd Street. Plans suggest it will be around 36 stories tall potentially making it shorter than both Key Tower and 200 Public Square.

Sherwin-Williams The new HQ building would be fewer stories than Key Tower and 200 Public Square. It's not clear exactly how tall it might end up being.

A two-story pavilion is proposed for the surface lot directly to the west of Public Square. A parking garage with retail on the ground floor is planned for the surface lot to the north of the proposed HQ building.

Pedestrian bridges are in the plans above street level to connect the HQ to the pavilion and the parking garage. Sherwin-Williams ia also asking for the city to vacate Frankfort Street between the two parking lots with plans block off that street from West 3rd Street and use it as a loading entrance.

Sherwin-Williams Phase 1 would still keep large surface lots to the west of the new development.

Plans also show the western parts of the lots remaining undeveloped for now leaving the southern lot for a future Sherwin-Williams expansion and the northern lot for other commercial retail office and living space on the corner of West 6th Street and St. Clair Avenue where the Warehouse District picks up.

See a detailed breakdown of the plan here.

Sherwin-Williams Later development could create new places to live work and shop connecting the Warehouse District to Public Square.

The Impact

55 Public Square

The plans confirm what 55 Public Square owners were banking on when they purchased the building in February of 2021 after trying for years to buy it from Optima Management. The plan is to renovate the building’s parking garage create new office space and 156 new apartment units.

The new headquarters will bring at least 3000 Sherwin-Williams employees just across the street from the new office and residential space while the two-story pavilion won’t block the view from 55 Public Square’s new restaurant space in the former John Q’s Steakhouse location.

News 5 The open parking lots stand to be redeveloped into a Sherwin-Williams' Headquarters parking structure and pavilion along Public Square.

“This building in front of us will only be two stories” said K&D Group CEO Doug Price pointing out of the windows in 55 Public Square’s lobby. “According to what I’ve seen so 55 keeps its real high profile in the square.”

Price said he hopes the restaurant and a renovated 55 Public Square will help bridge the gap between the Euclid Avenue corridor and East 4th Street and the Warehouse District.

Right now there are limited options for food and entertainment between the southeastern tip of Public Square and West 6th Street with the two massive surface parking lots in between. The hope is that a restaurant at 55 Public Square and a new high-rise with it’s own retail nearby will make that distance feel shorter while offering additional attractions to see.

75 Public Square

The new HQ will have a similar impact on 75 Public Square next door. That 15-story building is being renovated into 114 units with two retail locations on the ground floor and a slew of amenities including a rooftop deck.

Kevin Barry The parcels where Sherwin-Williams' pavilion and headquarters could one day go are now used as large surface parking lots.

Construction is expected to be finished by the end of 2021 with the first residents moving in soon after.

Filter

Just around the corner at the Perry-Payne building Kyler Smith is building out Filter adapting the idea from destinations he’s seen in Miami and Los Angeles with curated locations inside the venue to encourage people to post their experience to social media essentially working as free marketing for the restaurant.

Filter Filter plans to move into the ground level of the Perry-Payne building blocks away from Sherwin-Williams' new HQ.

“Just around the city it’s going to be that place that you want to go because it’s going to be popular” Smith said.

Smith said he started that project during the pandemic on the faith that after COVID-19 subsided people would be eager to go out again once it was safe.

The Reactions

Early push-back has been targeted mostly at the second floor pedestrian bridges comparing them to the proposed pedestrian bridge on the other side of Public Square that could connect the JACK Casino to a parking structure. Community members pushed back against that bridge when it was first introduced.

Among other things the project held the promise of filling the parking lot wasteland that has blighted the city for decades since half of the historic Warehouse District was bulldozed in the 1970s and ’80s to make downtown friendlier for suburban car commuters.

It’s even better that a venerable Cleveland-based company wants to remain in its hometown where its investment could help trigger additional local development rather than leave for the Sunbelt or the coasts. Kudos to Sherwin-Williams for that.

But any hope that the company’s $300 million project would be a complete boon for downtown would have to be at least somewhat tempered by the early-stage designs released Thursday to City Hall and the media.

An image from the Walter Leedy postcard collection at the Michael Schwartz Library at Cleveland State University shows the Cleveland Warehouse District after completion of the 1958 Illuminating Building at right. Buildings in the center foreground area were demolished from the 1960s to the 1990s to create surface parking lots to serve the Cuyahoga County Justice Center.Walter Leedy postcard collection Michael Schwartz Library Cleveland State UniversityMichael Schwartz Library Cleveland State University

The new plans which are only partially complete don’t yet show anything yet about the architecture of the headquarters which will occupy three blocks totaling 7 acres west of Public Square.

The plans focus on building footprints and overall bulk or massing. Buildings are indicated by colored boxes; there’s no description of how they might be sculpted and surfaced or what materials they might be made of. Nor do the plans show whether the buildings will create walkable inviting streetscapes around them or dead zones edged with facades of reflective glass. There will be exciting opportunities for public art around the project but there’s no hint of any direction the company might take.

Black-box process

For now there are things to like in the emerging plans and some very important things not to like. Before diving in let’s look at the design process which allows for public input in a nominally open but fundamentally secretive way.

Thursday’s unveiling marked the beginning of a review and approval process including meetings with the City Planning Commission scheduled for July 20 September 14 and November 30 when final designs could be approved.

In a joint news release the city and Sherwin-Williams said: “The agenda for each meeting and a meeting link will be posted on the Cleveland Planning Commission website 10 days prior to each meeting. Members of the public will be able to provide written comment and ask questions in a written format via the Commission website. Sherwin-Williams will provide responses to questions subsequent to each meeting presentation.”

In addition to the knothole described above the company plans to consult a community advisory committee whose members will sign a nondisclosure agreement. It will also consult privately with city planning officials community organizations residents downtown businesses and building managers.

This is a black-box process in which information will be received without allowing the community to hear questions and answers in real-time. That’s not exactly a public-spirited way to do business especially for a company expected to receive more than $100 million in public incentives for a project that will impact traffic patterns and the walkability of city streets not to mention the overall look of the city.

Adding to skyline

As for the design itself the early plans call for a 36-story tower a block west of Public Square at West Third Street and Superior Avenue with room for a potential second and most likely lower tower just to the west. The initial tower with a million square feet of space will rise roughly 600 feet and will add to the current three-tower ensemble around the square including Key Tower 200 Public Square and the Terminal Tower.

That’s all good. Adding to the skyline will make Cleveland look like a busier and more consequential place. If it fits well among its neighbors and embodies beautiful new ideas about how to shape the base shaft and pinnacle of an office tower the new building could be a joy to see from miles around.

Not so good is that the smallish block sandwiched between the tower site and Public Square will feature a two-story corporate welcome and learning center that will be attached to the big tower with an elevated walkway over West Third Street.

The low-rise structure might look insubstantial next to the bulkier mid-rise buildings that now edge the square between the big three skyscrapers. A great deal depends on how the pavilion and the landscaping around it are designed.

Members of the design team headed by Bill Chilton a principal of the New Haven-based architecture firm of Pickard Chilton (working along with Cleveland-based Vocon) said the decision to push the tower to the block west of West Third Street was guided in part by the need to gross 28000 square feet per floor netting 20000 square feet after accounting for elevators stairwells and other necessities.

The smaller block immediately west of Public Square wouldn’t have allowed “floor plates” of that size. Then too if the tower were located immediately west of Public Square it would have stood awkwardly close to the glassy 22-story mid-century office tower at 55 Public Square located just to the north of narrow Frankfort Avenue.

Pulling the Sherwin-Williams tower one block to the west looks like a polite gesture to 55 Public Square enabling its tenants to keep their views of the Terminal Tower and the square. It will also put the new Sherwin-Williams tower immediately south of the 920-space parking garage that it wants to build north of Frankfort and west of West Third Street.

Closing a street adding skywalks

But the company also wants to close Frankfort to public traffic from West Third to West Sixth streets turning it into a private driveway to its garage and the main loading dock in the office tower. Employees and deliveries will enter from West Sixth Street. A barrier of some kind will be erected at Frankfort although it will remain open to pedestrians.

Closing and privatizing a downtown street is not a good idea because it will create a superblock — a large piece of urban turf that traffic and pedestrians have to circulate around. Downtown already has many blocks that are too big especially on the sides running east-west.

It’s also not good to allow skywalks to proliferate because they kill street life and encourage social stratification with elites above and the hoi polloi down below. The Sherwin-Williams project is setting a bad precedent in that regard.

A rendering Sherwin-Williams provided of plans it has for possible additional construction after its campus is built.

As for the garage it’s good that the company plans eventually to wrap the four-story structure on its east north and south sides with retail residential and office buildings. But those “liner” buildings will not happen immediately on the north side along St. Clair Avenue and on the West Side along West Sixth Street. Surface parking lots with 280 spaces will remain until the company decides to build on those sites and to build an office expansion west of its initial tower. That could take years to happen.

The big new garage will have nearly four times the number of spaces as the company now has at the Landmark Office Towers in the Tower City complex. Adding more parking is not good for downtown which is awash in it although the company argues that it’s providing spaces for only slightly more than a third of its employees meaning that it expects many to walk to work or use transit or to use existing parking.

Devon Energy World Headquarters Oklahoma City. Architects: Pickard Chilton Architects Gensler Alan Karchmer

Lastly it should be said that it’s encouraging that Sherwin-Williams is working with Pickard Chilton a firm with a solid reputation for thoughtful modernist design. Pickard Chilton designed the Eaton headquarters in Beachwood a suburban site that isn’t comparable to downtown but the firm has also designed handsome office towers in Chicago Milwaukee Oklahoma City and other cities.

Members of the firm have roots in the distinguished practice founded in New Haven by the late Cesar Pelli architect of Cleveland’s Key Tower and four fine buildings at the Cleveland Clinic.

A firm linked to that legacy wouldn’t want to design something awful next to Key Tower. And maybe if Pickard Chilton and Sherwin-Williams hear enough from the public through any available channel including social media the design for the company’s headquarters could evolve in a more completely positive direction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndreWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ha3Jvbi9maXJlLWRvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWFrcm9uLzk1LWZmM2JiMTc4LWY2ZGUtNDQ0MC05ZmM0LTI4ZjUyNDZiMTQ5Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General store catches fire in Akron,"Officials believe this was an 'accident' and no injuries have been reported at this time.

Bixby II passed away on Wednesday June 30 2021 peacefully with his family by his side at home as he wished. Chet Bixby was born at Lewiston’s Central Maine Medical Center on March 5 1952 to Hildred and Chester Bixby; he was the youngest of four children. Chet was educated in Auburn schools first at Washburn Elementary next at Webster Junior High and finally graduating at Edward Little High (ELHS) in 1970. At the latter he was the manager of the baseball team for one year. The remainder of his time at ELHS he served as a tour guide at the Shaker Village in New Gloucester part-time during the school months and full-time in the summers. After graduation he attended Lewiston’s Bliss College at which he earned an associate degree in Business Administration in 1972. He used that experience as a springboard to garner a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Business Management at Thomas College in Waterville in 1974. He was hired by the Sherwin-Williams Company to work as a sales representative and manager trainee in its Lewiston store. Two years later he was promoted to assistant manager of the company’s Old Town/Orono location staying there and living in Bangor for four years coming back to Auburn on weekends to date Sandra Gordon whom he had met at Bliss College. In 1978 he began working in his family’s business C B Distributors – and proposed to Sandy. They were married on Oct. 5 1979. In 1980 he took the reins of the C B Distributors running it for almost a decade. During those years Sandy and he became parents of Rebecca “Becky” in 1981 and Karen 1986. Eventually they became grandparents of two granddaughters Casey Lacasse Riley Lacasse and one grandson Zackary Giguere.In 1987 Chet began working part-time second shift in L.L.Bean’s Lewiston warehouse. In 1991 he transferred to the Westbrook warehouse at which he soon became part of the first shift crew. In 1993 he moved to the Freeport warehouse as a material handler and the plant’s safety advisor remaining there until he retired in the spring of 2018. He thought that retirement would afford him to do more of the things he considered to be hobbies – outdoor work particularly on his John Deer tractor housework hiking and shopping and spending annual family vacations in Ocean Park. However the newfound leisure time didn’t agree with Chet very well and he took the job of Court Street Baptist Church custodian the following year. How many people do you know who were ‘born into a congregation’ were involved in virtually every facet of the church along the way and wound up being ‘the keeper of the keys? Of course his routine expanded soon thereafter when new cleaning protocols were necessitated by the corona virus pandemic. So he was providing cleansing and upkeep for the building in which he attended Sunday school Junior Christian Knights and Baptist Youth Fellowship and was baptized – and has served on the Diaconate Board of Trustees Nominating Committee and Pastoral Relations Committee and as an usher. In a very special way church is ‘home’ for Chet. “I’m happy to be a member of Court Street Baptist Church” he states. “I feel comfortable here and am thankful for the love care and prayers I’ve received; I’ve had many blessings here.” He enjoyed the custodial job knowing it was for the benefit of not only the members but he was serving God’s purpose. Chet was right at home working in the Lord’s house – to which he has had close ties virtually since the day he was born 69 years ago. Survivors include his wife of 42 years Sandra Bixby; his daughters Rebecca Bixby (Christopher Hatfield) of Auburn Karen Giguere (Rick Giguere) of Sabattus; grandchildren Casey Lacasse (Jake Smith) of Lewiston Riley Lacasse of Auburn Zackary Giguere of Sabattus and additionally they became adoptive grandparents to Brad and Alex Hatfield of Minot; sister Lorna Hansen (Robert)of Auburn Carole Daniels of Largo Fla. sister-in-law Ann Bixby of Albion; numerous nieces and nephews; his dog Lucky. Predeceased by his parents Chester and Hildred Bixby of Auburn; his in-laws Robert and Lillian Gordon of Lewiston; a brother James Bixby of Albion and brother-in-law Robert Daniels of Largo Fla. A special thank you to the doctors at Family Health Associates Maine Health Cancer Care staff including Dr. Voisine Mikee Spaulding Crystal and Abby; the Androscoggin Home Health and Hospice staff and the many people that sent cards and reached out during his illness.

""She's also worried that Brooklyn is throwing everything into this relationship and could struggle to cope if things went wrong so he needs a back-up plan.""

There are words like “ring tailed tooter” and “wooly booger” that I was sure must’ve only ever been said by my grandfather. And in the history of Appalachian language you’ll find the history of Appalachia. The confluence of Scotch-Irish Native and African dialects blending to create a new sound.

This week on the Reckon Interview we speak with Jennifer Heinmiller co-author of the Dictionary of Southern Appalachian English.

We discuss the early 20th century origin of this project the process of gathering and investigating words to include in a collection such as this the way Southern Appalachian English has changed with new technologies and some of her favorite terms and phrases that are included in this edition.

I promise this will be the most fun you’ve ever had with a dictionary.

Below is a transcript of the episode.

John Hammontree: You are the co-author of the dictionary of Southern Appalachian English. It covers I believe eight states that make up the Appalachian south and something like 10000 entries. Exactly how many words could we expect to find in this dictionary? And you know it’s structured in kind of an interesting way. So how is it set up?

Jennifer Heinmiller: Yeah it’s that ballpark. Around 10000. The text itself is more than 1.3 million words in length. So it’s a pretty hefty volume. And it is kind of different from your typical dictionary in that it’s a historical dictionary which means that each entry consists of the head word and then usually a pretty short definition and then a paragraph of historical citations. And by citations I mean examples taken from historical documents or recorded interviews or newspaper clippings that really show the word in context. And it provides a really great illustration of how that word was or is used.

Hammontree: And this is actually an update of an older project that was originally the Dictionary of Smoky Mountain English. And that was published I guess about 15-16 years ago. Why was this originally undertaken to try to document this region of the country’s English? How does it differ from the rest of American English? And how did you determine what regions to cover in your updated version?

Heinmiller: So the impetus of this project was originally a research project undertaken by Joseph Hall who was originally hired by the US National Park Service to document the speech and culture of the people in the Great Smoky Mountains. And that was back in 1937 that was just after the park service had established Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934. And they decided they wanted to create a record of the people who had lived in the area prior to the park being founded at the time the park service was actually in the process of removing all of these residents from their homes and finalizing land purchases in the area and determining the boundaries of the park.

As you can imagine there was a lot of conflict regarding what the park would look like both in the boundaries and just you know what form it would take. And you had some people asserting that it should be a completely natural area free of human inhabitants like the other national parks especially those out west. But other people wanted a more like resort style experience with highways and hotels and all sorts of amenities sprinkled throughout the park.

But at any rate the Park Service decided it was important to at least document the speech and culture of these people who lived there before their ways of life were destroyed by the Park Service itself I might say. You know I love the park nothing against that. But at any rate even without the establishment of the park it was already on the radar of anthropologists and linguists that certain varieties of English and certain cultures were diminishing or you know changing with the arrival of modern culture even back then.

So at that time a guy named Roy Appleman excuse me who was a historian with the Park Service was put in charge of the project. And he was already friends with Joseph Hall so Hall was this guy who was originally from Montana spent a lot of his life in California and he had actually just spent a year studying at the Sorbonne in Paris like no connection to Appalachia at all. And he had just started graduate school at Columbia University in New York. And he was like “yeah sure I’ll do it. I want to make some money for grad school.”

So yeah he took the job and he was I will say he was kind of an outdoorsman. He was an early member of the Sierra Club and really liked hiking and outdoor activities. He came early in the summer of 1937. And like so many of us he just immediately fell in love with the area the beauty of the area the people here. And throughout the course of that summer he ended up completely filling four notebooks you know all handwritten notes of course at that time and realized there was so much more work to be done. And decided you know almost immediately to start planning subsequent trips. He did that very soon afterwards. I think his second trip was just a couple years later in 1939.

And you know going into it he was already a trained linguist and researcher and he was able to put those skills to very good use and he amassed one of the largest collections of Appalachian culture in existence. Even today. With dozens of interviews on the you know this huge old recording equipment he was dragging those around the mountains in the back country. And he published three books on the subject including a really great work on the phonetics of Smoky Mountain speech as he called it and a large glossary. He started doing this like over the course of decades.

Then Michael Montgomery my co-author who unfortunately passed away a couple of years back he started corresponding with Hall I believe in the early 1980s. So Michael was just finishing up his Ph. D work I believe. And Hall had just retired from teaching in California like even though he fell in love with this area he ended up you know going back to California. So the two of them became friends and Hall passed in 1992. And at that point Michael inherited his entire collection of Appalachian Smoky Mountain English materials.

And I guess as Michael told me he had been looking for a project to really sink his teeth into and he just wanted to do something huge so he decided to take the glossary that Hall created as well as the interviews and just use that material and create a dictionary. From the very beginning he wanted to base it on the principles of the Oxford English Dictionary which became this kind of you know historical reference work rather than just glossary style with word definitions. So he worked on that and it published as you said in 2004 by University of Tennessee Press. It is a great text. A lot of people have a copy of it.

But almost as soon as it hit the printers Michael was ready to do an expanded version. He saw the limitations of it he wanted to broaden the scope. And so he was already collecting materials for that from a more diverse range of sources in the mid 2000s. So just prior to when I met him. And he brought me on originally as a graduate assistant at the University of South Carolina. So that was in 2008. He was already retired from teaching but he was still working like more than full time on all these research projects.

And he brought me on for another project. But we got to talking and I don’t know I guess he saw a lexicographer in me and asked if I would be interested in learning about lexicography and joining the dictionary project. And of course I said “Yeah let’s let’s do it.”

Hammontree: For our audience who doesn’t know can you just give us a working definition of lexicography and what that is?

Heinmiller: Sure. Lexicography is basically just the art and crafting of dictionaries.

Yeah I learned what lexicography was at that point. And yeah he started training me. And then a few years later we started going to conferences together and going around you know North Carolina Tennessee South Carolina doing research together. And he named me co-author of the project.

It was interesting because at the time I was more focused on an endangered language indigenous to one of the outlying islands of the Okinawan archipelago in Japan like you know about as far from Appalachia as you can get. But I I’m interested in minority languages and varieties of all types and I have some history family roots in East Tennessee. And yeah so of course I was very interested.

And I just dove right in and I’ve been on the project now. It’s been almost 13 years at this point.

Hammontree: Wow. And as you mentioned he unfortunately passed away a few years ago. So all that stuff that he inherited you know is that now in your possession? Does that belong to the university or museum? How does that work?

Heinmiller: A little bit of both. I mean I do have like a bunch of his materials sitting here in my office right now. Some of the rarer books that he had acquired we donated to some rare book collections. I think the university library system at University of South Carolina and some other institutions around the country that expressed interest as well as some of his friends and acquaintances who you know maybe they had their eye on certain things or he knew that you know they would be interested in these different particular works. So yeah it’s not one single collection at this point anymore.

Hammontree: Well tell us a little bit about what distinguishes the type of Appalachian English Southern Appalachian English that y’all have collected in this dictionary versus–not that there’s any sort of standard American English–but compared to other parts of the country what are some of the hallmarks of Appalachian speaking and writing?

Heinmiller: Sure. I mean on the surface you know Appalachian English as you said it’s immediately recognizable as being different from more mainstream or standardized or you know any of these problematic words we want to use. So those varieties of American English and listeners pick up on that immediately. And there are a lot of differences in the vowels and even in the cadence of phrases and sentences. And sometimes the syllables and words will have different emphasis from the more mainstream varieties.

One example that I can think of is the word Tennessee you know in mainstream English is Tennessee. But in southern Appalachian varieties you have a couple of shifts there the vowels are slightly different. And then you have the emphasis shifted a bit so you get something more like Tennessee. And this can vary from place to place and even person to person. But we do see some general patterns.

And we put together a pretty comprehensive overview of some of these features in the introductory frontmatter section of the dictionary. And I would definitely encourage people to check that out. Yeah reading through it you can really see how these things are not just random. They’re very rule governed and very systematic just like any language. It’s really pretty cool.

Hammontree: I’m curious about how you decide what merits inclusion in a dictionary like this. You know how are you tracking down old words and their origins? You know in some ways it feels like an investigation but also a lot of transcription and even a little bit of a treasure hunt. You know were there moments of discovery that were exciting for you looking through some of these old documents or recording some of these oral histories and things like that?

Heinmiller: Yeah the question brings so many memories of this treasure hunting just as you said. And I think this is such an appropriate description of the process we undertook to compile this dictionary; we really took no shortcuts in our search for terms and sifting through what to keep and what to discard was really an ongoing process and sometimes resulted in battles between Michael and myself.

We were able to use some really great resources. Some of the memorable ones were the Appalachian Oral History Project which was undertaken in 1970 as kind of this joint project between some junior colleges in Tennessee. And then a lot of obscure books and documents going back to the 1700s. We visited some historical societies like the East Tennessee Historical Society to consult with librarians and other experts and frequently spoke with locals who very kindly shared their world with us. And so Michael had limited mobility I was very much the “boots on the ground” half of the outfit. And I spent what must have been hundreds of hours in archives going through microfiche and microfilm.

The Dictionary of Southern Appalachian English is published by the University of North Carolina

And I think my favorite part was probably reading letters written by privates in the Civil War at the University of South Carolina South Caroliniana Library. So yeah I spent a couple of hours there for a few weeks like every day going in. And the librarian would bring out the actual physical letters that these soldiers had written. And these weren’t just soldiers from South Carolina just in the region. And I actually got to feel these letters and read the words and see the indentations of the letters on the paper. And it was just an incredible experience to truly touch a piece of history like that. And it was honestly a bit emotional to read the fear and the uncertainty in these men’s words. You know so many of them were just children really and they were doing something they believed in.

And I found myself wanting to capture as much of their world as I could and preserve it for future generations. And through that part of our research I’d like to think that I brought a very human element to what might otherwise be viewed as you know perhaps like a dry academic work. And it’s really my hope that we were able to achieve that. So many of the men wrote in those letters about their fears of being killed without seeing their families again or being forgotten or just being incredibly lonely and isolated.

And I realized that I wanted to make the book not just about the language from an academic perspective but about that human experience and how we’re all connected. They weren’t just faceless soldiers; they were human beings just like us. And I wanted to make it so that people generations from now could still make those connections.

Hammontree: A few weeks ago on the show we spoke with a woman named Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson who is the co-director of the Highlander Folk Center there in the Appalachian region. And we got to talking kind of about you know a lot of the assumptions that people have of Appalachia as you know formed by books like Hillbilly Elegy and things like that being almost exclusively Scotch-Irish. And I’m curious you know what the roots and influences of Scottish and Irish language are in Appalachian English? But also you know I know for example in in the dictionary you include the term Affrilachian which which we talked about with Ash-lee. What are some of the influences from people of the African diaspora or Native-descent that also shaped and affected the language and culture of Appalachia? Or other groups of people that maybe we don’t typically think about?

Heinmiller: Yeah you’re correct. A lot of people in Appalachia are indeed of Scotch-Irish heritage. Historically the majority of the communities in the region have been made up of white people of European descent. But yeah it is very diverse these days you know especially as time has gone by. And I guess just to provide a definition for people who aren’t familiar Scotch-Irish refers to the people in the Ulster area of Northern Ireland.

And so the people in Appalachia who trace their roots there typically have ancestors who arrived from there in the 18th and 19th centuries. We can see a lot of effects from that particular culture. And one thing that springs to mind immediately is bluegrass music. So you know yeah not just in the terminology but it really is pervasive in so many aspects of the culture.

Some of the terms that stuck around really we don’t find in other parts of the country. One example of that would be cohee or coohee which refers to a person of or from just west of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia mostly. And this term comes from the phrase quothe he or quothe she which you know was used to report speech. Yeah so it just you know kind of ran together and became cohee I thought it was really cool. And that one’s not used anymore today at least to my knowledge but we have records of it dating back to the late 1700s. It’s just fascinating.

But looking at other cultures one of the coolest things I thought was how we can see a lot of plant names and medicinal uses that come from Cherokee lore and a lot of food items as well. So things like bean bread which was a bread made from crushed dried beans usually like pinto beans and cornmeal mixed together. And that came directly from the Cherokee who shared the recipe and the cooking method with the white settlers. And then we have alternate terms for certain things. Like for example there’s this wooden toy that was known mostly as a whimmydiddle or a geehaw whimmydiddle by the white settlers and the Cherokee would refer to this as a hoodoo stick.

And some of the people of African descent would refer to it as a voodoo stick or other things. And then another one that comes to mind that I think people might still know you’ll have to give me your thoughts on this. But we have the term goober pea which comes directly from African origins. It means a peanut. Yeah the word goober it actually comes from a word that appears in both the Kikongo and Kimbundu languages of Africa which means the same thing and it’s a great example of both a piece of culture in the form of food and a term that was brought to the region.

Hammontree: Coming up after the break more from Jennifer Heinmiller about Appalachian English.

At the beginning of the dictionary you include an author’s note about the decision to remove some language that you say may perpetuate racist ideology. Can you talk about what drove that decision and then also how you balance you know keeping that historical record without sanitizing it but also not advancing outdated norms and ideas?

Heinmiller: Sure. Yes that’s true. I did remove some material that was dare I say blatantly offensive. And I do explain that in the author’s note as you mentioned. Of course this is a region that has struggled with a lot of racial issues as has the rest of the country. But in writing this dictionary I realized it would have been very difficult to provide an appropriate historical context for racist language.

You know we hope that people will thumb through it and they’ll want to browse it. So it’s not necessarily something you read from start to finish the way you would an article or an academic paper. So there isn’t really that latitude to give a whole background and show the development of that language and the context and how these things arose or you know were used and why it’s no longer appropriate. It just would have been very difficult.

So in the end my editorial team and I felt that such language which truly was an extremely small percentage of the material anyway would have detracted from the work as a whole. And that was the last thing we wanted to do. We felt it would be more of a distraction than something that would have added merit to the text. So yeah that’s why that decision was made.

And it is certainly a historical record. But it’s not a complete record of every word ever used in the region. I want to specify that because such a thing would be an impossible undertaking. You know we did formulate the entries and conduct our research based on the principles of the Oxford English Dictionary which does strive to be a complete historical record of the English language. And we aimed for something close to that.

But there will inevitably be some questions that came up when readers search for a term that you know maybe their grandparents used and it’s not in the text. And on that note there is talk of creating a web-based version in the future. And if readers have suggestions for filling in some of those gaps I’m certainly open to adding more terms. And I invite people to reach out to me.

Hammontree: You were talking about how the language has changed over time. And that decision to remove some of that. Are you able to see how power dynamics and cultural norms change in the evolution of Southern language? Is that something that showed up kind of in the documents and texts that y’all were sorting through?

Heinmiller: I think no matter which source we were looking at or what term you’re looking at in the dictionary it’s really necessary to view the region within a wider geopolitical context. Like we have this perception that there were these small isolated mountain communities with little contact with the outside world. But that simply wasn’t true. Or if it was true it didn’t last for very long. It was only a very brief flash of time before the outside forces came and shaped these communities with such a heavy hand.

So you know like in the northern part of Appalachia there’s been an immense influence from the coal industry. And then the Smoky Mountains region it’s more so logging. And so you see these these varieties changing due to these industries like as a direct result of these external forces and these power balances that would come in and change everything. Literally changing the landscape. And it really added a lot to the different regional and sub regional lexicons but it is a reflection of those power dynamics that you mentioned.

And historically you know we also think about there’s also the perception that this variety of English as well as other varieties of Southern English are somehow inferior to other varieties and mark the speakers as lesser educated or backwards or rustic. And this is incredibly unfortunate. And it’s a perception that has perpetuated some of these very imbalances in power on a broader scale at a more national level I would say. It’s not unique to Appalachia or the South. I mean we can see this in other varieties of English and even other languages with varieties being perceived in various ways. Some being held in higher esteem than others.

And then you know on smaller scales you can see like you know kids who move to other regions getting bullied for the way they speak. And that’s something I can personally attest to. And it can really create feelings of shame and change those dynamics you know right from the get go. So you will see cases where people consciously change the way they speak.

And then you have the opposite reaction if they return home you might have some opposition from the family and community where they might feel alienated by this person who chooses to speak in a more standardized way. And we have phrases like uppity or being like quote unquote “above one’s raising” which is actually a phrase in this dictionary referring to try to elevate oneself you know above one’s place of origin or culture. So yeah it is interesting to look at that. And quite honestly this is it’s such a broad topic we could do a whole mini series on this topic alone. And I’d love to dive deeper into it at some point.

Hammontree: You know kind of continuing down this vein of thought about how the rise of radio I mean you talked about bluegrass and certainly you know the Carter family and then later Dolly Parton came to symbolize the region for a lot of people through music. Television Beverly Hillbillies for instance. And now the internet. You know how have media changed Southern Appalachian language and how people are using these new tools as a form of storytelling?

Heinmiller: I think that’s a great point. And I think it has kind of come in waves and shifted over the past few decades. You mentioned Dolly Parton and the Carter family and The Waltons which I think you know we’re great to bring exposure. And you know Dolly Parton. I mean who doesn’t love her? She’s really done a lot for the region. But some of the other pop culture references you know they’ve kind of verged on creating stereotypes or reinforcing some stereotypes.

And I think with the advent of the Internet and social media networks and podcasts radio some of these other venues we have other opportunities. And you know looking at the way that language has changed I guess it reminds me of one of the first principles that I learned as a graduate student is that language change happens. And it’s a normal course of events. And some cases this happens due to huge shifts in the political or cultural landscape. And I think that you know the many many technological developments of the last century really attest to that in this case.

Prior to that prior to broadcast television there’s evidence that there were many more regional varieties and you know sub regional varieties almost micro varieties if you will which have already assimilated into more mainstream ways of speaking. And this of course it’s something that happens in every language and we’re seeing it just on a faster and broader scale. And so like I was talking about before with some of these negative perceptions of both from inside and outside the communities I think in recent decades people have found their speech put on a national or international stage whether it’s through you know fiction or politics or whichever. This can really affect the ways that people choose to speak. And we can see some differences in the ways that various genders and socio-economic classes choose to speak or not speak. And that’s a whole other podcast with a lot of research to be done there.

But you know I’m always looking at these things through a historical lens. And I think this kind of follows the pattern set by spelling standardization which it didn’t happen until quite recently in the broad scope of human history. You know you have the establishment of spelling and grammatical rules. And a lot of those grammatical rules are arbitrary. And people might pick and choose which to follow and which to reject. As a linguist I think it’s interesting to look at those examples you know such as how people largely avoid double negatives and sentence construction these days even though this was perfectly acceptable as recently as a couple hundred years ago in English.

But then on the flip side you have people reclaiming certain terms and structures. And I think we can really see this in the media like the reclamation of the term “y’all” and people embracing you know the Appalachian accent and pronunciation. Again I really see it as such a great opportunity for people to get out there tell their stories embrace their variety of the language to whatever extent they would like to and there are so many platforms out there. And I just I think that if you have a story to tell you should tell it people want to hear it.

I know even with my little one-woman podcast you know I reach more than 20 countries. And it’s incredible. People around the world who are interested in Southern English there’s definitely an audience for it. So it’s a prime opportunity. Whether you want to do a podcast or blog or anything I encourage people to put their material out there.

Hammontree: And that podcast is called Appalachian Words. And if y’all want to hear Jennifer walk us through some of the terms that she has included in the dictionary that’s a great one to go subscribe to. What are some of those terms that you were able to add to this edition of the dictionary that either surprised you or may surprise our listeners?

Heinmiller: Well I guess to preface that one of the aspects that I loved most about this project was learning about the creativity and the ingenuity of the people of this region and how they connected with the indigenous communities early on not to make a profit but to live peacefully and to make a life and community.

Yeah you see these influences but then you see so much humor as hard as life was there was so much humor and one of my favorite terms in the dictionary was circumvengemous which means “in a roundabout way” and it’s meant to be humorous. So you know they obviously elongated this word and they made it sound silly in this very fake academic way. And they did it completely on purpose very tongue in cheek which I appreciate so much.

And some of the surprising things to me were the very intricate terms used for processes such as the production of maple syrup and maple sugar which we don’t automatically associate with the South. Or at least I didn’t. But it was certainly something that was and still is in some areas practiced.

And along those lines you have the terms that are very specific to the geography and topography of various areas such as the different types of balds. And balds for those who aren’t familiar are areas on top of mountains that are open and they have very few or no trees on top there. They’re pretty unique. And so we have different types of balds there’s wooly balds and shrub balds and other types of balds. You can go through and find these throughout the dictionary. But it just completely depends on the flora that you find on top of these. And personally I’m a trail runner and I’m a hiker. And so learning about these terms and gaining the language lens to view these landscapes through it really added this whole new dimension to my own personal exploration of this region.

Hammontree: How else did working on this project affect your understanding of the South as a whole?

Heinmiller: I think I was really able to learn just how multifaceted it is. Even with my own personal background we all come in with you know preconceived notions and the connections that I made with people beyond just doing the kind of library research it really allowed me to make connections with people who I might not otherwise have spoken with. And just seeing the diversity among them you know even the ones who have lived in small communities of Appalachia all their life it was really wonderful. And it surprised and delighted me to find so many different perspectives and to see just how willing people were to share their stories. And yeah I really think that the diversity in the region is increasing.

And you know even in my own case I do the podcast and I’ve been working on the dictionary for well over a decade at this point. But that being said it’s not my full-time gig I actually work in tech. And I’m bilingual in Japanese. And I say that just you know as evidence of how diverse we are. And I love it. And I encourage people to get out there and explore Appalachia and the South as a whole. Because there’s so much to discover here and so many great fascinating people.

Hammontree: And maybe I should have asked you this at the beginning. Just to clear things up. You know there are people who say Appalachia and then there are people who say Appalachia and I believe that most of the people at least in the Southern Appalachians say Appalachia. Do we know where that divide is? And what caused that divide?

Heinmiller: You know I don’t know about a divide. But I do know that when I first met Michael I think I said Appalachian once. He broke me of that very quickly.

Hammontree: While after the last edition was published you said that Michael immediately started working on the next edition can we expect that there will be yet another edition of this dictionary somewhere down the line?

Heinmiller: Oh goodness what a question. Well as I kind of touched on before an electronic version is in the works. An interactive web-based version. And I have a lot of ideas for that. And I would love to include clips from some of these oral interviews you know that Joseph Hall did back in the day because we do have a lot of those tapes still. So I would love to make a kind of multimedia experience very interactive and you know very accessible to everybody because this this is a gorgeous book but it’s unfortunately not going to be at every bookstore every library and I think bringing it to the internet would really make it more accessible.

So as far as a third edition like hardcopy book I’m not so sure about that. Although you know there’s plenty of time to explore that option. But prior to that I would really like to do a digital version.

In addition to the career opportunities school culture Consortium group and location I chose Goizueta because I knew it was an environment in which I could thrive. One of my goals was to become a better leader and Goizueta provided me with the opportunities to do that and much more. If you have a desire to build something here the school will do everything it can to support you and your vision.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Professor Lynne Segall definitely stands out for me. She is behind IMPACT360 an experiential course here in which MBA students work on semester-long consulting projects with real businesses which was a highlight of my first year. She also has a passion for helping her students and was very instrumental in helping us create the John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? My favorite MBA event was the Global Experiential Module. My group went to several cities in Brazil and did a mix of company visits and cultural/tourist activities. It was great to see how business is done in South America and get to know more of my classmates outside of school.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I can confidently say I wouldn’t do anything differently. I was very diligent in making sure I got everything I wanted out of my MBA experience.

What is the biggest myth about your school? I think the biggest myth about Goizueta is that it’s a regional school. Many of my classmates do remain in Atlanta post-MBA but that is because it’s a great place to live and people choose to stay not because we have to due to job availability!

What surprised you the most about business school? As a liberal arts major I was surprised by the level of difficulty in some of my quant courses but I’m so glad I took them.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I did extensive research on Goizueta and was able to speak to how I would leverage its resources for my career and how I would contribute to the community. I also spoke with many people at the school — students admissions and The Roberto C. Goizueta Business & Society Institute.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I admire many of my classmates but Willie Sullivan comes to mind because of the impact he has had not only at Goizueta but on the business world at large through the John R. Lewis Racial Justice Case Competition. I worked alongside Willie on the creation of the competition and it was amazing to see him take his idea and turn it into a nationwide event. In a few months we were able to get support from six Fortune 500s (HP Johnson & Johnson Salesforce Southern Company Truist and Walmart) and inspire more than 500 students from 52 universities to apply to compete.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? The shift to online was hard because it happened in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester. The biggest adjustment was not seeing my classmates and missing out on in-person events which is what really made the business school experience fun. However I think Goizueta did a good job in the transition and I feel like I still got a lot of my experience academically.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My mother – who is a scientist and has never worked in the private sector – had always encouraged me to get an MBA. Once I decided to take her advice she was my strongest advocate. I would not be here without her support!

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Pivot into corporate venture capital at a large tech or healthcare company or lead a social impact venture fund Work abroad for a short period preferably in West Africa

What made Kristen such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021

“Each year some students go above and beyond their call of duty which results in amelioration for the community. In a most trying year for many around the globe I found that a person’s zeal can benefit the masses and our close-knit Goizueta community has benefitted from the work of Kristen Little.

Kristen’s business acumen and problem-solving ability are truly inspirational. Last summer Kristen proposed an initiative and worked with the Dean’s office as an advisor to challenge the business school to better support black entrepreneurs both on campus and in the greater Atlanta community. Kristen continues to lead the project which resulted in thirteen actionable recommendations. Kristen’s focus is to build strategies that create access to capital through an alumnus-supported investment fund for black-led ventures.

In addition to a rigorous MBA course load Kristen concurrently serves as President of the Goizueta Black MBA Association and a co-founder of a nation-wide collective of Black MBA associations connecting business schools across the country. Kristen also plays a role as the co-captain for the MBA Impact Investing Network & Training (MIINT) national competition. Her Goizueta Team is competing for a $50K investment in the venture of their choice based in the southeastern US. They say that pressure bursts pipes but also makes diamonds – and Kristen Little shines bright at Goizueta.”

DON’T MISS: THE FULL LIST OF MBAS TO WATCH IN 2021",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS90eC9kYWxsYXMtZm9ydC13b3J0aC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvMDIvcnVsZS0zNy1hbGxvd3MtdGV4YXMtb2lsLWFuZC1nYXMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLXRha2UtbWluZXJhbHMtd2l0aG91dC1wYXltZW50LdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rule 37 allows Texas oil and gas companies to steal minerals,"FORT WORTH Texas — Elaine Williams received a letter from the Texas Railroad Commission informing her that the state was allowing an oil and gas company to take her minerals without compensating her. Williams had been approached by various companies over the years about signing a gas drilling lease but she had questions about the noise pollution and other factors that typically accompany urban drilling.

What You Need To Know Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies didn’t drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals.



The Railroad Commission of Texas is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own.



The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”



There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies.

“I wanted answers to questions” she said. “I didn't say ‘I won't ever do this.’ I said ‘I want answers to these questions’ and I never got the answers.""

The 76-year-old Fort Worth resident refused to sign a lease with Chesapeake Energy Corporation many years ago and now Total Energy — the France-based company that purchased the rights to minerals in Williams’ area near Lake Worth — is continuing its aggressive expansion in North Texas by using a little-known rule to grab all of the underground resources in the vicinity of her house whether neighbors agree to it or not.

Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies don't drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals. A spokesperson for the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) the state agency tasked with regulating oil and gas companies (which was created by the oil and gas industry) said “Statewide Rule 37 requires minimum distances between wells at drilling sites in order to protect field pressure and correlative rights.”

Under the rule the RRC is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own — the usual justification is that without the unlicensed pool of minerals the company won’t be able to generate enough pressure to bring the gas to the surface. But observers said oil and gas companies have learned that the RRC will almost always grant these exceptions whether they are justified or not.

The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”

There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies. Though the RRC doesn’t keep aggregate data on the win-loss records on hearings for exceptions a spokesman for the organization pointed a reporter to three separate websites where the final orders on the hearings are stored. In a search of the first 50 cases on one of the pages the RRC arbiter sided with the oil and gas companies 100% of the time.

One industry insider said he’s never heard of a business losing a hearing and the only cases that residents ever win are on technicalities such as botched paperwork. The former oil and gas executive who asked not to be named for fear of hurting his current career guessed that the win-to-loss ratio was around 1000 to 1. The process is so tipped in the favor of these companies he said most people don’t bother to protest.

Elaine Williams is not most people. When the RRC told her that everyone in her neighborhood had been notified of the more than 200 Rule 37 exception cases that Total has filed in the area she went door-to-door to verify that people knew what was happening. Almost none of the people she spoke to knew anything about the Rule 37 applications.

“Whenever they sent [the notification letter] they gave me a long list — front and back — of people they said they had tried to contact or they said they had contacted” she said. “One of them was my neighbor caddy-corner to me. So I went over there and we talked in his driveway. Neither one of us has ever signed that we would take money or do anything with this. He signed a [protest] form right there in his driveway.”

After her initial protest was declared invalid because of a paperwork error she tried a second time to fight for her minerals. This time she successfully protested her case and helped neighbors file their protests. Total tried once again to buy her minerals but she said she’s past that point.

“In this process I have discovered that all of these things are hidden in plain sight” she said of the Rule 37 exception process. “I'm becoming aware of just how sneaky they are.”

Gas drilling in her area has already taken a toll on her health and quality of life she said.

“I literally cannot drink my own water in this house anymore” she said. “I tell my overnight visitors my family not to even brush their teeth with the water — to use my bottled water. Whenever I take a shower I'm very careful. I’ve been using paper plates and plastic [utensils] for years now.

“I literally was getting sick” she said. “I was getting so sick.”

Are the hearings a sham?

Williams and her neighbors who have chosen to protest Total’s application for a Rule 37 exemption are about to go through a process that critics allege is almost impossible to win.

Residents are required to travel to Austin on a weekday to attend their hearing — there is also an option to have the hearing over the phone but that has only existed since 2017 and it would make presenting evidence or fairly cross-examining witnesses nearly impossible. Residents can request an alternative hearing site but both parties would have to agree to the change.

Oil and gas companies employ a team of attorneys and expert witnesses to fight residents’ claims to their own minerals. While there is a discovery period most residents don’t have the legal savvy to ask for it and they are blindsided by testimony replete with myriad slides and dense scientific jargon. Anyone can hire an attorney to represent them but oil and gas attorneys are uniquely specialized and expensive. Spectrum News 1 reached out to one such attorney based in Fort Worth and his rates started at $300 an hour.

The judges in these cases are not required to be elected judges attorneys or even have a basic understanding of the law. They are political appointees who are handpicked by a government body known for protecting oil and gas interests.

Emeka Duruigbo Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Institute for International and Immigration Law Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University is one of the few academics who has done extensive scholarly research on the cross-section of property rights and oil and gas law. He said Rule 37 by itself is a good one — society he argues needs the underground gas to fuel our lives — but the hearing process for exceptions he said is inherently unfair.

“It’s a David versus Goliath fight and the little guy is outmatched” he said. “There’s a battery of lawyers with experience in these kinds of cases prepared to fight you. This is what they do. So the private citizen comes in with nothing. They don’t even have the scientific information to back up their claims.”

Ranjana Bhandari executive director of Livable Arlington — a grassroots environmental organization that frequently takes on oil and gas companies — went through the RRC’s Rule 37 exception hearing process. She just so happens to hold a Masters in economics and her husband a university professor holds a PhD in physics. Even with their unique expertise to argue their case the RRC’s arbiter still sided with the oil and gas company. The couple was given only a few minutes to examine the oil and gas company’s data.

“I can only speculate but it seemed that there was asymmetry in treatment of the two sides” she said. “Even though we were the victims we were the injured party. We were the ones being dragged out of our homes in Arlington on a working day at great inconvenience trying to learn all these arcane rules trying to understand the technology and trying to understand something that most mineral owners know very little about.

“I've never had heard of a case where a potential robber can go to the legal system and say ‘Can you please have Ranjana explain to you why you shouldn't rob her?”

Duruigbo emphasized that the hearings are well outside of any traditional legal standards.

“They are acting like a court” he said. “The Railroad Commission has the [judges] sit there. They're not required to be lawyers. They're not judges. They're usually political appointees or they are elected. So any politician who collects money from vested interests [through an election] sits there and makes decisions.”

In April 2013 Duruigbo conducted a focus group of residential property owners in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area who were targeted for gas drilling underneath their homes.

In the resulting article the professor concluded that unfair granting of the Rule 37 exception was an abuse of power and an affront to the rights of property owners.

“Participants numbering about 12 men and women decried energy developers’ interference with their property freedom and their ability to holdout when negotiations are orchestrated” the article says. “After examining applicable legal provisions and hearing the concerns of the focus group participants it is apparent that the … unfair granting of exceptions to spacing rules do interfere with the property freedom of small tract owners. They also encroach on their power to holdout for better deals or more desirable outcomes.”

Oil company landmen also know that the game is rigged and they frequently use that as a negotiation tactic when trying to buy a person’s gas rights.

“When landmen and Chesapeake's representatives contacted us a few times to see if they could change our mind their biggest selling point was ‘It's going to be expensive for you to defend yourself’ ” Bhandari said. “ ‘You are going to lose. So isn't it better for you to just sign the lease now? We are going to drill anyway. One way or the other we'll get permission to drill and the only difference will be that you won't be paid.’ I heard this over and over again from landman from Chesapeake employees who called us. And so because the system is so unfair to mineral owners they can very easily be coerced by the drillers.”

Even knowing all of this Williams said she is undeterred. Now that she’s had a chance to do more research on the environmental impact of urban gas drilling she’s determined to at least make herself a pest to Total Energy.

Since filing her appeal she said the company has once again contacted her about buying her minerals but this time at a reduced rate.

“I just laughed at him” she said of her recent encounter with a landman. “I said ‘If I didn't take over $5000 what makes you think I'm gonna take $1000?’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvZXllLWZpcmUtZ3VsZi1tZXhpY28uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaky Gas Pipeline Sparks an Inferno in the Gulf of Mexico,"A leak in an underwater gas pipe sparked a swirling fire that raged for hours in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday creating a biblical scene that drew comparisons to Mordor the volcanic hellscape from “The Lord of the Rings.”

Special to MyTownNEO.com USA TODAY NETWORK

MACEDONIA – The city’s planning commission has given preliminary site plan approval for upgrades at Dominion Energy’s transmission station at 9796 Shepard Road just north of I-480 on the Twinsburg border.

The project on 15 acres on the southern side of the property includes removal of some existing buildings construction of two new buildings (384 and 2112 square feet) relocation of multiple gas-related facilities graveling about 3.41 acres and replacing lighting.

The company also plans to erect a 16000-square-foot one-story building for truck parking on 6.9 acres on the northern side of the property. It would include locker rooms showers a staff work room and restrooms.

A new entrance/exit point off Shepard Road and landscaping along the northern and eastern edges of the property are other components of the project.

Dominion Engineer Ryan Smith said the upgrades are exempt from National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements and the total site disturbance for the southern portion would cover 4.96 acres. The project would take about one year to complete.

At its May 19 meeting the board of zoning appeals granted setback variances for the truck storage building and some smaller sand/gravel storage structures. They will be 50 feet from the side and rear property lines instead of the 130 feet required by the zoning code.

Use and gravel area size variances must be granted and Smith said those requests likely will be dealt with at the BZA’s July meeting. The planning panel still must grant final site plan approval.

OTHER BUSINESS

IHOP and Panda Express originally were scheduled to present plans for local restaurants June 21 but those discussions were pulled from the agenda and are expected to occur at a later date.

IHOP is proposing to occupy the former Pizza Hut at 613 E. Aurora Road while Panda Express would build at 8261 Golden Link Blvd. on a portion of the former Golden Corral property.

The panel approved signage for three businesses and tabled action on signage for another one.

Silgan Dispensing will return July 19 to further discuss its proposed wall and monument signs at Cobra Plastics’ former 1224 E. Highland Road site. The firm produces triggers pumps sprayers and closures.

The proposed blue logo with blue channel lettering on a white polycarbonate metal panel for both signs was not well-received by planners. They preferred that individual letters and the logos be attached to the building’s brick wall and front yard monument sign.

FastSigns spokesman Gil Macias said the panel’s preference would cost three times as much as his proposal and he will have to consult with Silgan Dispensing officials before changing the design.

Planning chairman Kevin Westbrooks said another option is to request a variance from the BZA.

Meanwhile new or revised signage was approved for Premier Martial Arts at Macedonia Commons (former Hallmark store) T-Mobile at 663 E. Aurora Road and Target at the Crossings at Golden Link.

Premier Martial Arts plans to install a 37.9-square-foot sign above the entrance along with a 0.5-square-foot two-sided blade sign and 8.1 square feet of lettering on the glass windows and doors. The color scheme would be mainly green yellow and black.

T-Mobile would install a 27.7-square-foot sign with white lettering above the entrance while Target’s portion of the monument sign along East Aurora Road would measure 106 by 104 inches with white lettering and logo on a red background.

Instead of offering Southwest fare information for hidden-city flights Skiplagged may find that those Southwest fares have gone missing.

Skiplagged which helps travelers find “hidden city” flight itineraries and has generated airline wrath over the years filed a complaint seeking to have a court declare it is not subject to Southwest Airlines’ terms and conditions.

Using hidden city tickets flyers can book a flight from New York to Los Angeles via Chicago deplane in Chicago and save money because one-stop flights can often be cheaper than direct flights. Although doing so is legal the airlines hate these schemes because they lose revenue and fly with empty seats.

In the complaint for a declaratory judgment [embedded below] filed Friday in the Southern District of New York Skiplagged said Southwest sent it “threatening communications” in June claiming “Skiplagged has violated federal law.”

Specifically according to Skiplagged the eight-year-old New York-based business Southwest argued that Skiplagged must adhere to Southwest.com’s terms and conditions and is violating them by web-scraping Southwest.com and publishing the airline’s flight schedules and fare information and by using Southwest’s heart logo.

In the court filing Skiplagged said it doesn’t obtain Southwest’s flight information from Southwest.com and therefore is not subject to the airline’s terms and conditions. Skiplagged did not specify its source for Southwest fare information.

“On June 21 2021 Skiplagged advised Southwest in writing that Skiplagged did not ‘scrape’ any data from Southwest.com or obtain data from Southwest’s application programming interface had ceased displaying any ‘heart logo’ for Southwest flights and did not sell ‘hidden-city’ flights on Southwest airlines” the court filing stated.

In fact Skiplagged displays hidden city itineraries that include Southwest flights and directs users to Kiwi.com to book them.

Southwest is engaged in ongoing litigation against Kiwi.com and has been trying to get Kiwi from displaying and booking Southwest fares since 2018. Among its allegations Southwest claims that Kiwi charges its customers fees for things that are free on Southwest’s channels.

Kiwi denies Southwest’s claims and argues that it has not breached any enforceable contract with the airline.

The Skiplagged complaint asks the court to declare that “Skiplagged is not bound by the Southwest terms and conditions” has not interfered in the airline’s contractual relations and has not encouraged others to do so.

Founded by Aktarer Zaman in 2013 as a side gig Skiplagged cautions travelers to avoid checking bags because they will likely get off the plane during the layover and not to use their frequent flyer numbers or use hidden city tickets too often because airlines could cancel their tickets or boot them from loyalty programs.

Several years ago both United Airlines and Orbitz sued Skiplagged which settled with Orbitz and emerged unscathed.

Representatives from Skiplagged Southwest and Kiwi.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Southwest Airlines has at least a two decade track record of successfully suing online travel websites and forcing them to cease displaying Southwest fare information or using its intellectual property.

The airline offers its fare information to global distribution systems for travel agency use and has deals with corporate booking tools and travel management companies but shuns displaying its flight information to vacationers anywhere but on Southwest.com.

Here is the Skiplagged complaint:

Last month workers for the contractor consortium building the people mover completed construction of trusses for the first of six bridges that will connect the terminals with the people mover tracks.



The consortium LINXS Constructors completed work on June 14 for four trusses to support a bridge connecting the Terminal 4.5 extension between Terminals 4 and 5 with a people mover station that’s also under construction.



This follows the completion in late May of Terminal 1.5 — the extension of Terminal 1 used by Southwest Airlines that will enable another direct connection to the people mover.



And it preceded by a week the groundbreaking for the Metro Airport Connector station that will connect the people mover with Metro’s Crenshaw-LAX line providing a direct rail link to the airport for the first time.



The $2 billion automated people mover project is the centerpiece of the landside improvements around LAX to ease access to the airport. It consists of a 2.25-mile electric train system on an elevated guideway that will transport travelers in and out of the central terminal area connecting them to new off-site parking facilities the aforementioned regional light rail transportation network and a consolidated car rental facility.



The aim of the people mover project is to relieve congestion within the central terminal area and in turn the surrounding thoroughfares. The project is set for completion in 2023.



In 2018 LINXS a consortium of seven prime contractor companies won the $5 billion contract to build and operate the people mover project; the construction portion of the contract is expected to be around $2 billion.



The seven prime contractors that comprise LINXS are Fluor Corp. (Irving Texas); Balfour Beatty (London); ACS Infrastructure Development Inc. (Coral Gables Fla.); Dragados USA (New York); Hochtief PPP Solutions (Essen Germany); Flatiron Construction Corp. (Broomfield Colo.); and Bombardier Transportation (Montreal).

Three of the companies — ACS Infrastructure Dragados USA and Hochtief — are subsidiaries of Madrid-based Grupo ACS one of the largest infrastructure companies in the world with roughly $40 billion in 2020 revenue.



Workers for these companies and dozens of subcontractor companies completed the four bridge trusses. According to the release from Los Angeles World Airports specific engineering requirements and a mandate to adhere as much as possible to the mid-

century modern design motif meant that an unusual technique for constructing trusses known as the Vierendeel truss was used.



This type of truss uses only horizontal and vertical support elements eliminating the need for diagonal support beams.



Over the course of four evenings partially prefabricated steel trusses ranging in weight from 60000 to 100000 pounds were transported to the LAX terminal area and then assembled and lifted into place with a 350-ton crane.



Once all of the structural steel is in place a suspended scaffolding system will be installed to facilitate construction of the bridge’s concrete floor and the installation of metal panels and glazing.



Composed of multiple sections which can be raised and lowered as needed the suspended scaffolding system eliminates the need for traditional scaffolding that would need to be staged in the roadway. This in turn will result in fewer lane closures on the terminal circulator road below.



“The start of construction of this pedestrian walkway follows a tremendous amount of enabling work planning and coordination” Sharon Gookin project director at LINXS Constructors said in the announcement. “Having these steel trusses in place serves as a meaningful milestone for the APM project and a testament to the continued efforts of the APM team to bring the vision of a transformed LAX to fruition.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3NwaXJpdC1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbnMtbWlhbWkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spirit Moves Closer to Miami Launch Milwaukee Expansion,"Spirit Airlines continues to expand to new cities like Milwaukee while its all-new Miami flights are ready for booking.

Spirit Flights From Miami Ready For Booking

Spirit Airlines made waves on the South Florida coast by announcing its intention to serve Miami International Airport. The airport recently reduced costs for gates and access which encouraged Spirit’s Miami expansion as well as Southwest Airlines who is flying to the city for the first time shortly as well.

Both Spirit and Southwest had made Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport a low-fare kingpin just 20 miles north of the Capital of the Americas Miami. Southwest didn’t expand in Miami with the same vigor as Spirit adding flights from just four cities all of which Southwest currently serves.

Spirit Expands in Milwaukee

In what’s becoming a habit Spirit announced a few routes from a new city that went on sale months ahead of the first departure. Based on strong sales and frankly insatiable demand Milwaukee travelers will have even more options on launch day.

John Kirby Vice President of Network Planning made the following remarks about Spirit tripling departures out of Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.

“We see a vibrant future full of new opportunities for travel here in the Badger State” said John Kirby Vice President of Network Planning for Spirit Airlines. “We’re excited to nearly triple our convenient nonstop flights to exciting destinations. We can’t wait to take more Milwaukee Guests to ‘sun and sand’ destinations and bring travelers from all over to enjoy Wisconsin’s great festivals sports scene and fun outdoor activities.”

Here are the new Spirit Milwaukee destinations frequencies and launch dates:

Destination Frequency Start Date Las Vegas (LAS) Daily June 24 Los Angeles (LAX) Daily June 24 Orlando (MCO) Daily June 24 Fort Lauderdale (FLL) Daily June 24 Fort Myers (RSW) Daily Nov. 17 Phoenix (PHX) Daily Nov. 17 Tampa (TPA) Daily Nov. 17 Cancun (CUN) 3x Weekly Dec. 23

Incredible Growth

Coming out of COVID-19 shutdowns Spirit has re-emerged as the pre-eminent player in the leisure market. Spirit Airlines’ destination list has added a dozen new gateways and expanded flights in nearly every market.

Many domestic carriers have grown in a temporary way like United adding Florida nonstops from outstation markets but those were seasonal (some have already been discontinued.) Further when flag carriers need to pull back capacity from popular destinations to better utilize wide-body long-haul aircraft on international routes even fewer will remain. This is a golden opportunity for low-cost carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit to retail meaningful growth and greater market share when airlines refocus their efforts elsewhere.

Spirit has taken 16 new A320 family aircraft so far this year and adds another 21 next year all of which appear to be dedicated to growth. That’s good news for Spirit Airlines stock price which has performed well. I don’t currently hold Spirit stock but I wish I had held onto it as the airline just keeps winning.

Conclusion

As Spirit’s Miami launch nears I remain more impressed than when it was first announced. It’s a massive expansion on its own but coupled with all of the increased frequencies new stations and route increases the carrier is certainly growing rapidly. This is also a great sign for Milwaukee specifically (tickets are selling which also means growth for the city jobs and travelers) but also for new stations like it.

What do you think? Is there a route from either city that has your attention?"

I was recently on the East coast in an unfamiliar town and didn't know where to get a coffee.

Because my brain is indolent first thing in the morning I picked up my phone and Googled ""nearest Starbucks to me."" (Please berate me.)

It was a few minutes away but easy to find.

Stepping out of the car I thought I'd stumbled upon America's most popular Starbucks. The relatively small space was teeming with humans.

There was agitation in the air. Moreover the line for ordering was entirely empty. All these people were crowded around the baristas who were making the coffee. Had they all stood in line together and ordered at an unseemly pace?

I went to order a coffee at the counter and wondered what the commotion was about.

""Oh they all ordered on the app and came in at the same time"" she said. ""It happens a lot. And some of the orders are ridiculous.""

The baristas making the coffee were apologetic but I had to wait fully fifteen minutes before getting mine.

Perhaps I thought this was an isolated technological snafu. But then I learned it may not be. Business Insider reported that baristas in some parts of the country are having similar issues some of which were exacerbated by COVID-19.

Some current and former baristas believe the Starbucks app -- developed before some rival fast-food chains even knew what an app was -- is now so popular that some Starbucks stores are overrun with app orders.

Customers expect their order to be ready whenever they demand it without regard to how busy the particular store might be.

An app can do that to you. It can turn you into an even more demanding nuisance than you already are. Apps create monsters never forget that.

And then say baristas there are the TikTok drinks -- those that will impress your three friends on social media. You might believe that Starbucks's marketers want the company's drinks featured on social media. You might also believe that giving customers a plethora of options on the app only tempts them to be ludicrous in search of momentary fame.

For its part the company insists such barista complaints aren't representative of Starbucks as a whole. So I thought I'd contact some departed baristas for their views.

Sadly I heard similar stories not only of app customers who are unreasonably demanding but also unreasonably rude.

""They walk in. They don't even bother to say hi. They just want to grab their drinks and go"" said one former barista.

ZDNET Recommends

This may make one wonder how much technology is turning fast-food restaurants into vast glorified vending machines.

I had a similar thought after watching McDonald's experimentation with robot ordering at the drive-thru. There's no real human interaction. There's more the acceptance of demand and an expectation it be fulfilled with instant haste.

Perhaps some technologies inevitably change the customer relationship in that direction. When your benefits are speed and convenience the human factor becomes optional.

But does the brand relationship become optional too? And indeed is it any sort of coincidence that Starbucks last week launched a blistering new campaign -- featuring Chance the Rapper -- selling its Ready To Drink products?

I spent many years going to Starbucks every day and it was the presence and humor of baristas that made me loyal rather than say the coffee.

When COVID-19 hit and they left so did I.

And if more and more Starbucks become mere app pick-up joints why would I ever want to go back?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc29yYW5ld3MyNC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8wNC93ZS10cnktb2l0YS1wcmVmZWN0dXJlcy1jaXRydXMteS1jcmVhdGlvbi1pbi1zdGFyYnVja3MtamFwYW5zLTQ3LWppbW90by1mcmFwcHVjY2lub3Mv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3JhbmV3czI0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L3dlLXRyeS1vaXRhLXByZWZlY3R1cmVzLWNpdHJ1cy15LWNyZWF0aW9uLWluLXN0YXJidWNrcy1qYXBhbnMtNDctamltb3RvLWZyYXBwdWNjaW5vcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We try Oita Prefecture’s citrus-y creation in Starbucks Japan’s 47 Jimoto Frappuccinos,"Next stop on our Frappuccino tour is down south on the island of Kyushu.

Oita prefecture may not be particularly well known outside of Japan but within Japan we hold the nationwide title when it comes to four things in particular: we are the most popular hot spring prefecture we eat the most fried chicken in the whole country we produce the most kabosu fruit and my favourite Oita fact of all we are home to the most tunnels.

So when I heard about Starbucks Japan’s 47 Jimoto campaign where the coffeehouse chain is releasing limited edition Frappuccinos with flavours unique to each prefecture I couldn’t help but wonder what flavour would be in the Oita version. Would they use hot spring water in their Frappuccino? Would it come with a fried chicken topping?

Of course not. They went with the kabosu fruit angle instead — the Oita-exclusive drink is the Wakuwaku (Exciting) Kabosu Citrus Tea Frappuccino Blended Juice Drink.

The kabosu fruit is a citrus fruit widely produced throughout Oita prefecture similar to yuzu with a sour taste. Said to have come to Japan from China during the Edo period (1603-1867) over 90 percent of kabosu sold in Japan are grown here in Oita.

The fruit is usually paired with Japanese cuisine such as soba fish and miso soup and sometimes used instead of vinegar due to its mildly sour taste. Kabosu is so synonymous with Oita that there is even a prefectural mascot character called “Kabotan”.

When I heard the Frappuccino would be kabosu based I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. As someone who has lived in Oita for well over a decade I’ve had my fair share of kabosu drinks and I couldn’t think how Starbucks would be able to make anything new and exciting with their Frappuccino.

It felt a little bit like a cop-out like Starbucks couldn’t be bothered to come up with something more interesting.

▼ The Frap map of Japan with each prefecture’s offering in the proper geographical location. Oita is down the bottom

But as I entered Starbucks I started feel optimistic. There were signs and drawings everywhere of the drink as well as a signboard sharing some history and facts about kabosu.

There were also mini paper kabosu for customers to write how they liked to use the fruit in their cooking which they could stick to the board for everyone to read. People here in Oita really love kabosu!

▼ But what about the actual drink itself?

The Oita Frappuccino has a kabosu juice base blended with ice and citrus pulp topped off with whipped cream and honey drizzled on the top. While the inclusion of kabosu is an obvious homage to Oita’s favourite fruit the layer of citrus pulp on the bottom is a nod to Oita’s popular hot springs with the whipped cream layer representing the hot spring steam.

All in all visually it’s a perfect representation of Oita prefecture… minus the chicken and tunnels of course.

▼ You can see the citrus pulp along the side and settled at the bottom.

As I stuck my straw in I immediately hit a crossroads in what to do next. Should I mix it up to get an even blend of juice and pulp? But by doing that I’d be destroying the hot spring layer so I decided to take a sip of the drink in its purest form.

Which was a mistake.

I was immediately met with chunks of solid citrus pulp which were incredibly sour. Kabosu is known for its mildly sour taste but this was just too sour for me.

So I gave the drink a solid stir and took another sip. This time the blend of the mildly sour kabosu juice with the citrus pulp and drizzled honey was like a taste explosion in my mouth.

The sweetness of the honey perfectly balanced out the sourness of the kabosu and what was left was a refreshing sweet Frappuccino perfect for the summer.

Summer hasn’t quite reached the Oita shores just yet but I still felt the need to take it outside in the muggy heat to feel the full force of how refreshing it tasted. Here it is in front of Mt. Takasaki famous for the wild monkeys that live there.

The Oita Wakuwaku Kabosu Tea Frappuccino Blended Juice Drink far exceeded my expectations and made me feel proud to call Oita my home. We may be a relatively unknown place compared to places like Tokyo and Osaka but we can make some delicious drinks.

And after all it’s not like kabosu is the only exciting thing going on down here in Oita — check out our politicians!

One of the simple pleasures that come from living in the era of globalization is the joy of travelling overseas and sampling local menus from your favorite chain restaurants and cafes. For this writer at least every journey to a new country has to begin with a trip to Starbucks. Aside from providing a caffeinated cure for jet lag local Starbucks menus offer a glimpse of your host country’s culture.

Take Japan for example the Matcha Frappuccino and assorted matcha confectionery reveal the national love of green tea. Or in Canada the maple-flavored latte is literally comprised of the nation’s most prolific sweetener.

On the other hand Starbucks is also a reliable place to enjoy familiar fare. Regardless of location all Starbucks offer lattes or cookies and more than likely a slice or two of chocolate cake. Starbucks then offers a taste of home too.

So it was a great surprise to me when I first came to Japan and peered through the glass counter that displays the food that carrot cake was nowhere to be seen. Until now every Starbucks in every country I had ever visited had carrot cake in some form or another. Europe America the UK -- carrot cake aplenty. Japan’s Starbucks and I imagine those in other parts of Asia too however seems not to have taken to root vegetable cakes.

Customers are able to buy a whole carrot cake from Starbucks Japan’s online store. The cake is traybake style and packed full of carrots raisins nuts and spices as well as a generous topping of tangy cream cheese frosting. The website promises a rich spicy cake that exudes fruit and flavors of carrots; the perfect accompaniment to a steaming cup of coffee.

There’s no doubt it looks and sounds like the real thing. Carrot cake fans have reason to be excited ecstatic even. But the really interesting thing about this cake is its sustainable production process.

Starbucks Japan make their carrot cake with carrots grown in compost that uses recycled espresso shot cakes straight from the Starbucks store. Japan’s stores alone produce around 16.5 KG of espresso-bean cake every day accounting for about 70% of each store’s waste. By turning the bean cake refuse into compost Starbucks are able to grow ingredients like carrots which they then use in their food products. This to use the Starbucks lingo creates a sustainability “loop” that begins and ends with every store.

This writer is personally delighted that Starbucks’ commitment to sustainable business and environmental conservation has resulted in the long-overdue release of carrot cake in Japan. Most importantly Starbucks’ sustainability loop initiatives are part of the organization’s broader goal of achieving 50% total waste reduction across their business by 2030. So even if carrot cake is a take-it-or-leave-it menu item for you it may be worth purchasing to support the world’s biggest coffee chain to be more sustainable.

Starbucks’ sustainability initiatives

Starbucks is launching two new “loop initiatives” which are designed to promote sustainable production of new products for stores by recycling old products and waste from stores. The first of these is the turning used coffee bean cakes which are created every time Starbucks pulls an espresso into compost. The compost is used to grow ingredients such as carrots or even matcha to make matcha cake bars. The initiative began in Japan in 2014 and currently a total of 320 stores nationwide recycle their coffee bean cakes. Additionally the cakes are used to create feed for cows which eventually helps the cows to make the milk used by Starbucks in many of its drinks.

The second sustainability initiative is a plastic tumbler recycling program. Until August 3 2021 500 Starbucks across Japan will be accepting old plastic Starbucks brand tumblers from customers who in return can receive a 5% coupon for in-store use. The collected tumblers will be recycled by Starbucks and used to make new goods in the future. You can learn more about this initiative on Starbucks Japan's website .

Only plastic Starbucks brand tumblers can be recycled at Starbucks.

Non-Starbucks tumblers and tumblers made from materials other than plastic cannot be recycled.

One failed the state's vulnerable lowest-income preschoolers.

The Legislature provided about $500 million in one-time federal COVID-19 aid to child-care providers and an additional $1.2 billion for K-12 public schools on top of earlier federal relief.

There was also was about $1 billion in tax cuts and about $1 billion in federal money being carried over to future years.

Yet the Legislature unwisely declined to appropriate more money to ensure that the 35000-plus lowest-income kids get at least two years of scholarships to use at accredited day care/early-learning providers to help prepare them for kindergarten.

The state provides about $70 million annually for such ""Parent Aware"" scholarships to cover qualifying families. And economic research has found that quality preschool education can help close Minnesota's yawning racial gaps in education and income.

About 20 years ago economists determined that $1 invested in quality preschool for disadvantaged kids returns up to $16 to taxpayers. Kids who aren't ready for kindergarten cost the public disproportionately because they tend to drop out of school get in trouble and fall short of their economic potential. They are disproportionately students of color.

""Despite historic levels of new resources available and more than $1 billion in flexible federal funds still left unspent Minnesota's most vulnerable young children weren't a top priority for legislators"" said Ericca Maas executive director of Close Gaps by 5 which advocates for early-learning providers.

She noted that since about one-third of children under age 18 are under age 5 about $330 million should have been targeted for early learning. ""Unfortunately Minnesota's poorest and least served kids aren't as powerful … as the lobbyists who dominate public education policymaking"" Maas said.

Hundreds of millions flow from the state annually to day care and early-learning providers. The main subsidy Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program can benefit families that make up to $75000. But it misses some of the poorest kids including the homeless those in foster care and child protection.

The session started out with promising bipartisan bills that would have significantly increased Parent Aware funding from about $140 million over the two-year biennium. The time-tested Parent Aware-certified system awards scholarships for private centers as well as school-based centers.

Sen. Carla Nelson a Republican from Rochester and Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn DFL-Eden Prairie introduced respective bills that would have covered the tab over the next two fiscal years for all toddlers at or below 185% of the federal income guidelines. That didn't make it to the Senate floor. Nelson chair of the Senate Tax Committee tried during 11th hour negotiations to double scholarship dollars to $280 million.

Walz took the position of the education lobby which wants to control early learning. There also was a dispute over whether federal funds could be used. What should be a best-practice approach for the most vulnerable kids died on the altar of power politics.

On a more productive note home health agencies and workers got a needed boost. The agencies that employ personal care attendants who assist Medicaid-insured disabled and elderly low-income Minnesotans in their homes got help from the state following a decent pay hike for the attendants.

""This is a great result for clients caregivers agencies and the public"" said Andre Best owner of Best Care and a board member of First Provider Alliance. ""It will save lives stop some companies from going out of business raise worker wages allow some overtime"" and gives the industry financial stability over the next two years.

Earlier this year the state agreed in a contract with the Service Employees International Union to raise the minimum wage from $13.25 to $15.25 by July 2022 for caregivers of 44000 Minnesotans on Medicaid.

The just-passed legislation provides for a rate increase of 10% to the agencies in October that amounts to $236 million in incremental spending over four years. That will raise the reimbursement rate to employers to $19.60 an hour. The bill also renews the temporary ""waiver"" that allows parents and legal guardians and spouses to be paid for PCA services.

Last year Minnesota and the feds through Medicaid spent about $775 million to cover 40000-plus indigent Minnesota elderly and disabled in their homes. That's cheaper at an average per patient of less than $20000 annually than nursing home care.

And a growing number of aides in a business that has a worker-retention issue are friends or relatives who can raise income caring for a loved one; relieving financial hardship for many caregivers.

This bipartisan work was carried in the House by Rep. Todd Lippert DFL-Northfield.

Lippert collaborated for several years with Democratic Rep. Jennifer Schultz a University of Minnesota-Duluth economist and the late Republican Sen. Jerry Relph a lawyer from St. Cloud on the issue. This year's accomplishment was a bipartisan tribute to Relph who died last year of COVID-19.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXJwcmVzcy5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tc3AwNDQxNTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark A.

Many symbols of the Confederacy — including statues names and flags — have been removed from public places nationwide. Still many state flags to this day contain such divisive symbols often considered racist. Most recently Mississippi voted to replace its 126-year-old state flag which featured the Confederate battle symbol. Instead the new flag will include a white magnolia blossom.

24/7 Tempo reviewed the meaning of each state’s official flag using information from several encyclopedias state government websites and online state libraries. We included the date on which the current flag was officially adopted. Dates of subsequent modifications of the design or previous version of the flag were excluded.

The American flag is ubiquitous. People recognize it and know what every star and stripe represent. State flags don’t really enjoy the same fame.

A state’s flag is its emblem. Therefore most flag designs include geographical features historical dates or symbols of industries that best represent the state.

Though state flags have their own combination of colors shapes and symbols all U.S. state flags are rectangular with one exception the pennant-shaped state flag of Ohio.

A big influence from the earliest time in American history is Native American culture apparent in several flags — as well as state names. This is how each state got its name.

> Flag design: A crimson cross of St. Andrew on a field of white

> Officially adopted on: 1895 Alabama’s flag design is very similar to the Spanish Cross of Burgundy used in southern Alabama until the 1800s. The original square shape symbolized the battle flag of the Confederate States of America which featured a blue diagonal cross trimmed with white — with 13 white stars for the 11 states of the Confederacy plus Missouri and Kentucky — on a red field.

> Flag design: 8 gold stars forming the Big Dipper and Polaris on a dark blue field

> Officially adopted on: 1921 Alaska’s state flag designed by a 13-year-old orphan Benny Benson features the Big Dipper also known as the Great Bear constellation. The Big Dipper is a symbol of strength. The Polaris or North Star on the flag is a symbol of Alaska’s northern location. The blue background represents the sky.

> Flag design: 13 rays of red and weld-yellow on the top half

> Officially adopted on: 1917 The copper star on Arizona’s flag signifies the state’s copper production. Arizona produces more copper than any other state in the country. The 13 gold and red rays on the flag are a symbol of the sun setting over the western desert and the original 13 colonies.

> Flag design: A red field with a large blue-bordered white diamond and 29 stars

> Officially adopted on: 1913 The large diamond in the middle of Arkansas’ flag represents the state as the first in the country to produce diamonds. The 25 white stars signify that Arkansas was the 25th state to join the Union. The three blue stars below the state’s name on the flag represent the three nations that Arkansas was part of before it officially became a state — Spain France and the U.S. The lone star above the word “ARKANSAS” represents the state’s membership in the Confederacy.

> Flag design: A red star a red stripe along the bottom and a California grizzly bear

> Officially adopted on: 1911 California’s flag showcases the state’s official animal the grizzly bear which portrays strength. The star represents sovereignty as do the words “California Republic.” The flag was first raised at Sonoma California in 1846 by American settlers in revolt proclaiming California to be an independent republic.

> Flag design: 3 horizontal stripes of blue and white with “C” in the center filled with a golden disk

> Officially adopted on: 1964 The “C” at the center of Colorado’s flag stands for the state’s name but also signifies columbine the state flower and centennial as the state was admitted to the Union on the 100th anniversary of the American revolution. The colors represent the environmental features of the state. White symbolizes the snowy mountain peaks and gold acknowledges the abundant Colorado sunshine as well as gold production in the state. Blue is a symbol of the state’s skies.

> Flag design: White shield with three grapevines on a field of azure blue

> Officially adopted on: 1897 The three grapevines on the state’s coat of arms are believed to symbolize either three colonies in the Connecticut region or the first three towns established in the region by Europeans — Hartford Wethersfield and Windsor. The flag includes a ribbon with the state motto “Qui transtulit sustinet” meaning “he who is transplanted still sustains.”

> Flag design: A buff-colored diamond on colonial blue with the state’s coat of arms

> Officially adopted on: 1913 The colonial blue and buff used on Delaware’s flag represent the colors of George Washington’s uniform. “December 7 1787” is the date on which Delaware ratified the U.S. Constitution becoming the first state of the Union. The coat of arms has several state symbols. The ship stands for the shipbuilding industry and coastal trade. The militiaman recognizes the importance of the citizen-soldier in maintaining American liberties. The water represents the Delaware River.

> Flag design: Two red bars on a white field with the state seal in the center

> Officially adopted on: 1900 Florida’s state flag is very similar to Alabama’s state flag. The seal in the middle of the flag represents the state’s environmental features including images of sun rays palmetto trees lakes and rivers. Florida’s state flag is the only one to show a Native American woman. There is some controversy over whether the addition of St. Andrew’s cross to Florida’s state flag was based primarily on the saltire in the Confederate battle flag or merely an effort to reduce the older flag’s resemblance to a flag of surrender.

> Flag design: 3 red-white-red stripes a blue canton with a ring of 13 white stars around the state’s coat of arms in gold

> Officially adopted on: 2003 The 13 white stars circling Georgia’s coat of arms symbolize the state and the other 12 original colonies that formed the United States of America. The flag is reminiscent of the Confederate Stars and Bars with three broad red-white-red stripes and a blue canton a rectangular area usually at the top corner that is nearest to the staff.

Source: Saturated / iStock via Getty Images Hawaii

> Flag design: 8 alternating stripes of white red and blue with the U.K.’s Union Flag in the canton

> Officially adopted on: 1845 Hawaii’s flag is the only state flag to include a foreign country’s national flag. The flag resembles the Union Jack of Great Britain because the islands were once under Britain’s control. The eight horizontal stripes represent the eight major islands that make up the state.

> Flag design: State seal of Idaho on a field of blue

> Officially adopted on: 1907 The state seal in the center of the flag represents Idaho’s main industries — mining agriculture and forestry. The seal — the only one of all U.S. state seals that was designed by a woman — is also meant to emphasize the state’s geographic features including mountains and lakes.

Source: 400tmax / iStock via Getty Images Illinois

> Flag design: State seal on a white background with the word “Illinois” underneath the seal

> Officially adopted on: 1913 The flag’s design includes elements from the Illinois seal such as a rock on a stretch of land with water and a rising sun behind it. The seal also includes a shield bearing the national stars and stripes in the claws of a bald eagle. The ribbon reads the motto of Illinois: “State sovereignty — national union.” The 1818 and 1868 years stand for the years Illinois became a state and for the first use of the state seal respectfully. The name of the state was added in 1969 to make the flag more recognizable.

> Flag design: A gold torch surrounded by 13 stars an inner semi-circle of 5 stars and a large star at the top crowned by the word ‘Indiana’

> Officially adopted on: 1917 The torch in Indiana’s state flag is a symbol of liberty and enlightenment. The 13 stars in the outer circle symbolize the original 13 colonies. The five stars that make up the inner semi-circle represent the next five states to join the Union. The large star above the torch — and the 19th on the flag — is a symbol of Indiana becoming the 19th state.

The blue stripe stands for loyalty justice and truth the white stands for purity and the red for courage. The eagle carries streamers in its beak inscribed with the state’s motto: “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.”

Gli spazi condivisi riflettono l’armonia di una passeggiata in una strada o in una piazza di Firenze a cominciare dalla scelta dei colori delle geometrie e delle forme del design degli interni. Simbolico ad esempio è l'atrio della nave “Piazza della Signoria” che si ispira all’omonima piazza fiorentina. Con 13 diversi ristoranti e 8 bar l’offerta enogastronomica è la più ampia della flotta. Ogni sera viene proposto nel menù un “destination dish” ovvero un piatto legato alle destinazioni visitate dalla nave ideato in esclusiva per Costa da Bruno Barbieri.

These companies have several positive catalysts in the months aheads and analysts say investors shouldn't underestimate them. CNBC Pro combed through the top Wall Street research this week to find some of the more underappreciated stocks for the remainder of 2021. They include: Caterpillar Apple  Performance Food Sysco  US Foods and Stryker. Stryker Stryker is poised for a second half surge JPMorgan said in a note this week. ""We continue to view Stryker as a standout within our large-cap coverage heading into 2H21 as it represents one of the few companies that has managed to pair a premium growth profile with consistent top-tier execution spanning the last few years"" analyst Robbie Marcus and his team said. The medical technology company is home to a diverse array of businesses including neurotechnology and orthopedic products but there's one area that investors may be overlooking Marcus wrote. The firm said Stryker's Medical unit known as MedSurg had ""value-creating tuck-in M & A sales specialization and market leadership in narrow high-growth markets."" Marcus wrote that a recent meeting with the company's management left him feeling more bullish about the unit which he called the ""underappreciated backbone of Stryker's premium growth profile."" The company continues to innovate as well and Stryker seems to be one step ahead of the competition Marcus added. ""With a better understanding of these key underlying markets and Stryker's positioning in them we are even more bullish on the company's ability to sustain growth at a premium"" he went on to say. Shares are up 8.3% this year. Performance Food Sysco and US Foods It's been a rough year for the big three food suppliers as the pandemic wreaked havoc across the companies' businesses. But now things may be looking up for Sysco US Foods and Performance Food according to Wells Fargo. ""We remain very optimistic on the post-COVID earnings power of the food service space overall and continue to see upside in all three stocks"" analyst Edward Kelly wrote. The firm said if recent management commentary is to believed investors could be in for a big rest of the year. ""PFGC recently indicated that total company sales in the most recent week were $100 million above 2019 levels USFD stated that both chain & independent volumes were above 2019 levels in April & SYY is serving 10% more independent doors than pre- COVID"" he said. Kelly also noted there were some silver linings as a result of the pandemic including cost inflation cost cutting and further share gains.

Shares of Performance Food are up 0.8% this year while US Foods is up 13% in the same time period. Sysco shares are up 3% this year. Caterpillar The time is right to buy shares of Caterpillar Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook said in a note this week.

""We believe CAT's 2020 earnings are at a cyclical trough and see potential for most markets improving in FY2021"" he wrote. Cook noted that Caterpillar is a key beneficiary of what he called the ""cyclical bounce"" in oil and gas as well as increased construction activity. ""CAT should benefit from the North America Construction and Resource equipment replacement cycle which are recovering in tandem and both positive to mix"" he said. However don't overlook the power of a stronger commodities outlook according to Cook. ""Commodity prices including copper iron ore and nickel have been strengthening and the depressed mining business should begin to recover"" Cook said. Caterpillar has many other ""underappreciated"" attributes like strong cash flow generation and earnings power which should excite investors he added. Caterpillar shares are up 19.6% this year.

Post teammates in an auditorium for a team meeting. The school had just promoted defensive coordinator Bryan Collins to head coach and it was Collins' first day on the job.

In walked Collins wheeling in about 100 red bricks with him. He handed one to each of his players who looked at him as if he were crazy.

""'Tonight is Day 1'"" Isopo an offensive lineman recalled Collins saying ""'and with these bricks we’re going to build the foundation of our program.'""

Ask anyone who played for Collins during his tenure. He didn’t just help build a successful football program — he helped mold lives.

""He was like a father"" said Ian Smart who graduated in 2002 as the NCAA’s all-time leader in touchdowns (95) points scored (570) and yards per carry (7.58). ""He was a mentor. He gave us guidance. We were young boys when we got there and we all left as men.""

Collins resigned last Monday after 23 years leading the program which now competes in Division I FCS as the LIU Sharks.

""It’s important as a coach to know when it’s time"" he said in an interview with Newsday.

Collins 56 leaves as LIU’s all-time winningest coach with a record of 162-84. He guided the program to six NCAA Tournament appearances and eight Northeast-10 championships including three undefeated seasons in the conference — 2002 2016 and 2018. He was named Coach of the Year seven times and coached 12 All-Americans and 25 All-Region players.

""It really is a brotherhood"" Collins said ""and we as coaches are part of that family as far as circling it around and creating the culture for it to thrive and creating moments that players become even tighter. That was very important that we created that tightness within the team and that we grew it.""

Collins said one of his most special moments came on Nov. 5 2016 when his son Tyler — who quite literally grew up on the Post campus attending preschool there and spending time around his dad’s program — caught his first career collegiate touchdown in a win over Merrimack.

Collins also was the school’s athletic director from 2006 to 2016 a challenge in which he was able to draw from his coaching experience.

""We created the environment within the department that no one team is more important than us as a whole"" he said. ""And that was the same thing we did with the football team — there’s no one player that’s more important than the whole team.""

Smart who now lives in Florida and works as a deputy sheriff while running his new health nutrition shop saw that approach first-hand during his record-breaking season.

""To me it was never about [the records]"" Smart 41 told Newsday. ""To me it was about the brotherhood the family us being one that rubbed off on me.""

Smart went on to play in four NFL regular-season games with the Buccaneers in 2004. He also was a two-time CFL Western All-Star for the BC Lions and was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Special Teams Player of the Year in 2007 after setting the league record for kick-returns and kick return yards.

Isopo was Collins’ first recruit and home visit as head coach. He said Collins’ best trait was his ability to build a team-first brotherly culture.

""It doesn’t matter how talented you are"" said Isopo 40 who works as a spinal implant distributor for Stryker Corporation. ""If you don’t create a culture and a family-type environment your success is going to be minimal. He’s had tremendous success over his career and it’s because he built that culture.""

Jake Carlock who was Northeast-10 Defensive Player of the Year in 2018 and spent training camp with the Giants the following summer said one of the main reasons he transferred to LIU Post from Stony Brook was how quickly he and Collins connected — a bond that remains to this day.

""I just call him for advice"" said Carlock 24 who founded ONE4 Fitness earlier this year after hanging up his cleats. ""I call him when I need to know something and I know he’ll answer it and give me honest feedback.""

Honesty was a staple of Collins’ coaching style. He always was direct with his players who appreciated the way he knew what buttons to push to get the most out of them.

""He was the ultimate players’ coach and I say players’ coach in not as someone who just let us run wild"" said Rob Blount a four-year starting quarterback under Collins from 2002 to 2005. ""He coached with tough love he held us accountable at all times regardless of whether it was on the field in our social lives academics-wise. He was always there.""

Blount the head football coach at Oceanside High School is part of Collins’ coaching tree which spans from FBS to junior college to Long Island high schools. Collins’ influence on his descendants is quickly noticeable.

""I find myself saying a lot of the same things he did"" Blount said. ""When I started as a young head coach at 24 I was still fresh out of college and a lot of the building blocks that I learned in that program underneath him are the same building blocks that we still have today when I’m teaching and coaching.""

Most of those building blocks weren’t even related to Xs and Os.

""The majority of stuff that he was talking about had nothing to do with football"" Blount said. ""It was all about how we should handle situations later on as young men as future fathers as husbands how we should handle things in the workplace. And the lessons that he gave us and the words that he spoke really transcended into how we are today.""

Jonathan Gill Collins’ passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach was named LIU’s interim head coach. A spokesperson said the school plans to have a permanent replacement by NEC Media Day at the end of July.

Collins who lives in Sayville said he plans to get back into coaching or potentially back into the administrative side.

Wherever he lands there’s little doubt that bricks will continue to be laid.

""He’s like the Bill Belichick of Division II"" Smart said. ""He took a bunch of guys that were overlooked by other programs and he gave us an opportunity. He gave us a chance. We believed in him we bought into what he was trying to do and it paid off.""

And the last thing Collins took with him when he cleared out his office? His brick.",,,,,,,,,

Kadenacy who left AECOM in 2017 set up shop in the financial sector in 2018 and became an early pioneer for special purpose acquisition companies with local private equity firm Boxwood Capital.

Now at a time when SPACs have become a go-to option for companies looking to go public Kadenacy is helping to develop a fresh approach to these blank check offerings.

The 52-year-old Kadenacy has forged a new partnership called SilverBox Capital and has enlisted the help of a big money manager on L.A.’s Westside who managed the family wealth of Michael Milken along with an Orange County-based money manager who is committing a total of $500 million for five SPACs over the next few years.

Boxwood Capital is still a private equity firm but SilverBox marks a step up in its approach to SPACs.

The firm came about when Boxwood Capital decided earlier this year to partner with

Sawtelle-based hedge fund Silver Rock Financial. Carl Meyer the firm’s chief executive and chief investment officer had previously managed billions of dollars for Milken.

Kadenacy and Meyer combined the first syllables of Silver Rock and Boxwood to come up with the new firm’s name.

The partnership then added Newport Beach-based money manager Engaged Capital run by Glenn Welling who has agreed to commit $100 million on every SPAC deal that SilverBox Capital executes.

New approach

Unlike most SPACs — where private investors are invited to participate in a private investment in public equity or PIPE — SilverBox Capital takes a less conventional approach.

SilverBox Capital has designed SPACs using forward purchase commitments which are essentially contractual agreements to carry out a transaction in the future.

Forward purchase agreements give the buyer leverage in negotiations to buy a private company whereas PIPE investors can back out and potentially kill a deal.

SilverBox Capital and Engaged Capital already have come together on one SPAC. In February they raised $345 million in the initial public offering for SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp. I.

Using forward purchase agreements offers a cleaner way to do an acquisition because it bypasses the strings of warrants of conventional SPACs according to Kadenacy.

In April the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance that SPACs would need to classify their warrants as liabilities instead of equity instruments.

The SEC move nearly brought the market to a halt as SPACs digested the development and many SPACs were forced to restate their financial statements.

SilverBox has four more SPACs in the pipeline all structured with similar forward purchase agreements with Engaged Capital. The partnership is putting final touches on a second SPAC to go public before the end of the year Kadenacy said.

Meanwhile SilverBox’s first SPAC is in negotiations to buy a private company and take it public in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.

It’s believed to be one of the first forward purchase agreements used by a SPAC in Southern California according to industry experts.

Laying the foundation

Before the formation of Boxwood Capital in 2018 and his interest in SPACs Kadenacy ran local infrastructure consulting giant AECOM one of the largest companies in L.A. with a market capitalization of $9.3 billion.

He joined AECOM as senior vice president of finance in 2008 and became the company’s chief financial officer in 2011. In 2014 Kadenacy was promoted to president and CFO and in 2015 he was named president and chief operating officer positions he held until he left the company in June 2017.

Kadenacy’s departure was not related to any adverse change in the company’s business AECOM said at the time. Kadenacy said he simply wanted a different career trajectory.

AECOM has since seen a great deal of change including a restructuring that began last fall the sale of its government services business and construction units and the move of its headquarters from Century City to downtown. In addition AECOM Chief Financial Officer Troy Rudd succeeded Michael Burke as chief executive.

After leaving AECOM Kadenacy formed Boxwood Capital and based the business in Century City. The firm’s first SPAC went public in November 2018 raising $200 million through its Boxwood Merger Corp. which was based in Santa Monica according to SEC documents.

In August 2019 Boxwood Capital’s SPAC agreed to buy Austin Texas-based Atlas Technical Consultants Inc. with the hopes that the privately held professional testing inspection engineering and consulting services business could capture future federal dollars for infrastructure development.

Kadenacy’s only work on a SPAC transaction from beginning to end — or from an initial public offering to acquisition of Atlas — was with Boxwood Merger Corp. a business combination with an enterprise value of $720 million.



A move to Austin

With the SPAC deal under his belt Kadenacy began looking for change in his personal life.

Two years ago he uprooted his private equity firm and his family and moved to Austin — not as part of the growing corporate flight by companies such as Green Dot Corp. the Pasadena-based fintech that announced in May it will be leaving for Texas.

Kadenacy’s reasons for the move were more personal he said.

For one thing he was tiring of cross-country flights to New York to meet with his firm’s significant shareholder Macquarie Capital USA Inc.

His kids also were also getting ready to enter high school L.A.’s freeways were a headache and he wanted a better quality of life.

“I love L.A. I grew up there. I went to UCLA for undergrad and USC for business school” said Kadenacy who traded in his multimillion-dollar home in the Huntington area of Pacific Palisades for a place in Austin — a rising Silicon Valley-like region that boasts affordability and family friendliness.

Joe Reece who is executive chairman of SilverBox Capital and still has a home in L.A. moved his merchant banking company Helena Capital to Ketchum Idaho from Brentwood.

Reece wanted a deep bench of expertise so he enticed his friend Milken who helped create the market for high-yield bonds in the 1980s to invest in SilverBox Engaged Capital earlier this year.

“When we sit down with a SaaS (software-as-a-service) company or a fintech company we’ve got people who have actually run those businesses” Reece said of SilverBox’s five-member advisory board which is composed of former execs and advisers with downtown-based Oaktree Capital ConAgra Foods Synchrony Financial Diamond Resorts International Inc. T-Mobile USA Inc. and SunPower Corp.

While Boxwood Capital is one of the early adopters of the forward purchase agreement it’s by no means the first to use the approach.

Billionaire Bill Foley owner of the National Hockey League’s Las Vegas Golden Knights began to use forward purchase agreements several years ago. Foley did his first SPAC in 2016 with Chinh Chu a SPAC creator and former co-head of private equity at Blackstone Group Inc.

“We always believed that there would be a shakeout in the SPAC market and that’s why we put SilverBox Engaged together” said Welling founder and chief information officer of Engaged Capital. “We believe this is a durable platform and that the SPACs that would thrive after the shakeout were going to be those that had institutional backing. For us we think the shakeout is a good thing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like its predecessor the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price but this time you get more storage and 5G too.

It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy and kind of retro cool.

Good looks aside I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good).

It also lacks compatibility with AT&T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much.

There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device but it still comes up short.

Rather than offering a faster refresh rate TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.

TCL 20 Pro 5G screen performance and battery

A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool particularly after leaving the camera app but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.

TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles with “vivid” as the default or turn it off entirely.

We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be.

TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates

The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real but the effect is hard to mimic.

TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here and there are a ton of functions you can map it to from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode like night or portrait.

It’s really useful but unfortunately it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll which nobody needs.

There’s another premium feature on board here too: wireless charging at up to 15W

Moving along to the top edge of the device there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.

The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging.

On the software side the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid none) is common in this class so that’s great to see. However it will get just two years of security updates which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone.

Otherwise TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.

There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.

TCL 20 Pro 5G camera

The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide 2-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front.

The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on but it’s not too distracting. However there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos.

Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.

All in all the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.

While it offers some premium features for its price the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.

There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.

There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally the camera is basic and Nxtvision is underwhelming.

some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device

And then there’s network compatibility — in the US it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces Verizon and AT&T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.

If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G offers a fast refresh rate screen better network compatibility and a solid four-year security support policy. The Google Pixel 4A 5G is a good option too with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives but depending on your priorities they may serve you better in the long run.

The T-Mobile Arena opened in 2016 and the UFC became its anchor tenant a year later signing a multi-year deal involving at least four events annually.

Quite a major part of the UFC's history has been scripted at this venue in the five years since its inception. On that note let's take a look at five of the greatest UFC bouts that have been hosted at the T-Mobile Arena.

#5 Amanda Nunes vs Ronda Rousey - UFC 207

Amanda Nunes staggers Ronda Rousey.

Amanda Nunes defeated Miesha Tate at the T-Mobile Arena at UFC 200 to become the new women's bantamweight champion. However Nunes became part of an even bigger fight when she faced arguably the greatest female MMA fighter of all time. Nunes faced Ronday Rousey in her first title defense at UFC 207 another event hosted in Las Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena.

Ronda Rousey was coming off the first and biggest loss of her MMA career. A year earlier 'Rowdy' was knocked out by Holly Holm in one of the biggest upsets in UFC history. A year after losing her UFC championship Rousey returned to the octagon to face the new women's bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes.

During the fight Nunes stopped Rousey within 48 seconds of round one via TKO successfully defending her UFC title in the process. It was Ronda Rousey's last MMA fight ever as the pioneering female MMA fighter retired soon thereafter.

The fight between Amanda Nunes and Ronda Rousey was the headline event at the T-Mobile Arena in 2016. It was reported that a total attendance of 18000+ had broken the previous record held for UFC events in the state of Nevada.

Rousey reportedly received $3 million for the fight picking up the biggest paycheque by a UFC fighter at the time.

#4 Kamaru Usman vs Colby Covington - UFC 245

Kamaru Usman defended his UFC welterweight title for the first time against a heated rival Colby Covington. The event UFC 245 took place in Las Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena. Compared to UFC 235 where Usman defeated Tyron Woodley to become the UFC champion UFC 245 saw a much larger attendance.

It was one of the most electrifying UFC fights to take place at the T-Mobile Arena with Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington putting up a five-round battle. 'The Nigerian Nightmare' punished Covington for most of the fight but it wouldn't be right to say that 'Chaos' didn't fight back.

The fight eventually saw Kamaru Usman knock out Colby Covington in the last minute of the fifth round. However what made this fight one of the most exciting events at the T-Mobile Arena was Usman breaking Covington's jaw in the third round.

There were nearly 17000 people in attendance at the venue with Usman and Covington both receiving $500K apiece for their outing.

#3 Stipe Miocic vs Daniel Cormier - UFC 226

UFC 226 saw light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier take on heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic.

It was the third time in UFC history that champions of different weight classes were in a title bout after UFC 94 and UFC 205. After a KO win in the dying seconds of the first round Cormier went on to become only the second fighter in the history of the UFC to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously.

Dubbed 'The Superfight' Stipe Miocic vs Daniel Cormier headlined the UFC 226 event at the T-Mobile Arena in 2018.

It was the first installment of one of the greatest trilogies in the history of the UFC. It was also one of the most exciting fights to be hosted in Las Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena recording an attendance of 17464 including Brock Lesnar.

The event took place during the UFC's annual International Fight Week which made it more significant in T-Mobile Arena history. For this fight Cormier and Miocic also served as the head coaches of The Ultimate Fighter: Undefeated.

Nate Diaz defeated Conor McGregor in one of the biggest upsets at UFC 196 via submission.

Their rematch was held in Nevada at the T-Mobile Arena in 2016 at UFC 202. The event headlined by McGregor and Diaz became the most-bought UFC pay-per-view of all time with a buy-rate of 1.65 million.

While the first encounter between McGregor and Diaz ended inside two rounds their rematch at UFC 202 at the T-Mobile Arena went the distance. While the 'Notorious' dominated Nate Diaz in the initial rounds the plot switched with the Stockton native stepping his foot on the gas in the later rounds.

Conor McGregor eventually won the fight but only by a fine margin. The result a majority decision had a lot of MMA fans and analysts surprised as the scorecards read 48-47 47-47 and 48-47 for the Irishman.

The T-Mobile Arena housed a total of 15539 people for the event. It was also Nate Diaz's first well-paid fight as the 'Stockton Slugger' took home $2 million.

Conor McGregor took on one of his most hated rivals Khabib Nurmagomedov in one of the most hyped-up fights in UFC history in 2018 at the T-Mobile Arena. Khabib Nurmagomedov the reigning UFC lightweight champion at the time defeated the 'Notorious' in perhaps the most dominant fashion ever.

The record for the highest pay-per-view buy-rate previously recorded at UFC 202 was surpassed at UFC 229 with 2.4 million pay-per-view purchases. The fight between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov can be easily said to be the most exciting event ever hosted at the T-Mobile Arena to date.

The company lives up to its reputation for offering its flagship phones in a new color months after launching it. The South Korean handset maker has introduced the Navy version of its well-received Galaxy S21 Ultra.

It is worth mentioning here that the aforesaid model is exclusively available via Best Buy in the US. It is not the same Phantom Navy custom color that Samsung offered during the Galaxy S21 pre-orders. This navy blue shade has eliminated the textured camera module that was a notable element of those custom models.

Details about the date when Samsung unveiled this Navy version of the Galaxy S21 Ultra are still scarce. However it was probably launched introduced recently. Considering that it has already been 6 months since the phone hit the store shelves Samsung may be looking to stir up some interest in the phone by offering consumers a new color option to choose from.

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G Navy Blue Version Availability

Samsung introduced the eye-catching new Navy Blue color drawing inspiration from iPhone 12 Pro’s stunning Pacific Blue color option according to ScreenRant. It is also worth noting that only the Galaxy S21 Ultra has received a new color and specifically with the 128GB ROM model.

It is slightly annoying that the model is currently not available on other online stores such as Amazon B&H or even the company’s own website. However Best Buy is offering almost every model of the Galaxy S21 Ultra including Verizon Sprint/T-Mobile and AT&T. Alternatively you can go for the unlocked version that can be used on any carrier.

Revenue from ticket sales have of course been crushed by the coronavirus pandemic but with the chance of spectators on the horizon there could be the chance to break records with Anthony Joshua vs. Tyson Fury the return of Manny Pacquiao or another showbiz tie-in to spike interest from a wider audience.

Over the years there have been some huge events for promoters venues fighters and broadcasters. We take a look at the six financially biggest fights in history.

Note: Figures are based on widely-reported fees across multiple sources. Non-professional contests will not be considered.

1. Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao - May 2015

The ‘Fight of the Century’ is the most money-spinning fight to ever take place at least for now.

The 2015 fight profited off the hopes and expectations of fight fans who had long wanted a match-up between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

While the excitement for the bout was off the charts the fight itself was something of an anticlimax with Mayweather winning on points without too much drama including the announcement of the result.

However such was the anticipation the pair were able to sell 4.6m pay-per-view subscriptions and tickets for the public started at $1500 for the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

PPV: £333million

Gate: £58.7m

Mayweather’s purse: £223.5m

Pacquiao’s purse: £122m

Total: £678m

2. Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor - August 2017

Called ‘The Money Fight’ once it was announced it is no surprise to see that Mayweather appears again in this list for his fight with Conor McGregor at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise Nevada.

The Irishman moved across from UFC for the occasion and allowed Mayweather to conclude his professional career with a 50th win coming at something of a canter.

Mayweather continues to tease a return to the ring at least for an exhibition and given the sums he made it is no surprise.

PPV: £325m

Gate: £44m

Mayweather’s purse: £223.5m

McGregor’s purse: £70m

Total: £662.5m

3. Floyd Mayweather vs. Canelo Alvarez - September 2013

Mayweather again this time against one of the current biggest fighters in the world.

In 2013 Canelo was not quite the superstar nor quite as accomplished as he is today. Mayweather again came away with the points victory in an event that attracted more than 16000 fans to the MGM Grand.

PPV: £120m

Gate: £20m

Mayweather’s purse: £65m

Canelo’s purse: £9.7m

Total: £214.7m

4. Floyd Mayweather vs. Oscar De La Hoya - May 2007

It will perhaps not shock you to see Mayweather’s name again given his domination of the sport of boxing and his popularity amongst fans who were willing to pay up to watch him in action.

However in 2007 it was Oscar De La Hoya who was arguably the bigger name and that was reflected in the Golden Boy’s purse coming up to more than twice as much as Mayweather’s.

While De La Hoya might have take much of the cash it was Mayweather who claimed the win and emerged as the pre-eminent star of the lighter weights.

PPV: £110m

Gate: £15m

De la Hoya’s purse: £42m

Mayweather’s purse: £20m

Total: £187m

5. Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II - 1997

A rarity: an event on this list without Mayweather. Incredibly boxing existed before he came on the scene and we can go all the way back to 1997 in order to find the fifth highest grossing fight of all time held again at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

The fight in question is the Evander Holyfied vs. Mike Tyson rematch and fans might consider they were given an occasion to remember if not for the right reason.

Tyson was stopped by Holyfied in 1996 to set up a rematch but it ended in controversy and - more or less - finished Tyson as a serious figure in the sport. The former world heavyweight champion bit on Holyfield’s ear not once but twice and was disqualified as a result.

On the PPV front it was much more successful selling almost two million subscriptions.

PPV: £81.4m

Gate: £11.6m

Holyfield purse: £28.4m

Tyson purse: £24.3m

Total: £145.7m

6. Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson - 2002

Tyson hung on to fight Britain’s Lennox Lewis in 2002 with Lewis the undisputed heavyweight champion.

His class told as he won in round eight.

The victory might have been routine for Lewis in the end but the earnings were exceptional. 15000 seats were sold at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis Tennessee though it couldn’t match Tyson’s rematch against Holyfield."

With a fourth game almost certainly in development where does the franchise goes from here? Here are three possible answers to that burning question.

Last year was more challenging than any in living memory. Quarantined restricted from seeing loved ones and hunting through empty supermarkets fighting over toilet paper – it wasn’t good. One of the few lights in the darkness was and continues to be video games. One such “bright light” was the remastering of Mafia II and Mafia III as well as the full remake of the original Mafia: Definitive Edition. The trilogy provided a much-needed respite from world events and reignited my hope to see the franchise continue.

With that said here are three avenues that the franchise could take in a future sequel that Hanger 13 is hopefully working on.

The Groovy Seventies

The franchise has followed a chronological order from prohibition to the social turmoil of the sixties. Reason would suggest that the next stop would be sometime in the seventies. The decade was a successful one for the Mob as the families made their way into more legitimate rackets like construction. It was also a transition period where younger hoods started their climb to the top. These were second-generation Italian-Americans who showed but a passing respect to the oaths their mentors took. The powers of law enforcement were also sharpened allowing them to bug known Mob hangouts and even the houses of godfathers – this would eventually be the downfall of the Mafia.

As for a future sequel one possibility comes to mind straight away – a narrative with two converging threads one of a lawman and a gangster. Taking this path could also suggest a return to an established setting most likely Empire Bay. The last time we saw the franchise’s vision of New York City was over a decade ago; considering the significant improvement in graphics between then and now the developer could bring the Big Apple to life unlike any game before it. A return to Empire Bay could also mean a return and a fitting ending for Vito Scaletta who deserves to have his story come to a satisfying conclusion something Mafia III failed to do.

Las Vegas Or San Francisco

It’s no secret that the city of sin was built funded and controlled by the Mafia specifically the Chicago Outfit. From the late 40s to the mid-eighties Las Vegas was the Mob’s bankroll. Although predictable it’s a city tailor-made for organised crime and would make a perfect setting for a sequel. Considered a “free city” by the nation’s underworld several families used Vegas as an income source known as ‘the skim’. The Mob would skim money off the casino’s gross earnings in layman’s terms before it could be counted and forwarded to the IRS for tax. Anyone familiar with Martin Scorsese’s Casino knows there’s plenty of mob tales to be mined from the city’s seedy history.

Conversely San Francisco would make a fitting base for a crime tale but not quite for the same reason as Vegas. The Italian crime families never held a significant presence on the West Coast and were considered by the guy’s back east as the “Micky Mouse Mafia”. Its vibrant Asian community far more influenced the Bay City and while this diaspora was mostly law-abiding the criminal Triad element made deep roots in the city. Both of these locations have so much to offer but are under-utilised in my opinion. Exploring either city before the family-sanitisation of Vegas or pre-silicon valley Frisco would be excellent.

The Narco Connection

The interest in South and Central American organised crime has increased exponentially with the help of shows like Netflix’s brilliant Narcos series. The show follows the rise of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar his downfall and the Mexican cartels’ eventual supremacy.I’ve always been disappointed by how south and Central American locations are depicted in video game often as dilapidated and war-torn failed states.

Too often is the culture and fascinating history of these lands ignored set aside for the typical sunshine and dictators motif. Hanger 13 nailed the world-building in Mafia: Definitive Edition. I see no reason why the studio couldn’t do justice to say Bogotá or Guadalajara naturally giving them alternative names as is the the studio’s tendency.

Sadly this is the least likely of all my ideas. We know nothing concrete about Grand Theft Auto 6 but a popular rumour is that the game will take inspiration from Narcos. If we assume a 2025 release for GTA 6 it’s not out of the realm of possibility that we could also get a Mafia game within the same timeframe. A sequel if in development would likely have been so for roughly four years. The fandom surrounding Rockstar’s seminal franchise is magnitudes larger than Mafia. With both studios under the banner of Take-Two Interactive it’s unlikely that two games would be so similar in setting.

Conclusion

Ultimately we don’t know if or when we’ll see the studio’s next project or whether it’ll be a Mafia game at all. But if Hanger 13 are busy developing the fourth in the series these three ideas should be at the top of its list. Where would you like to see Mafia 4 set? Let us know in the comments below.

“Optimist and sunshine-seeker passionate about inclusion brands and people-focused marketing.”

Hometown: Sugar Land TX

Fun fact about yourself: I got my literal 15 seconds of fame on a Turkish reality TV show. My friends and I were approached by a TV crew in a Macao club and were asked to pretend to be the main character’s friends for a few scenes. We got a free table out of it!

Undergraduate School and Degree: The University of Texas at Austin; Bachelor of Business Administration in marketing minor in anthropology

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? I was a digital operations manager at the Target Corporation (digital media specifically AdTech)

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? PepsiCo Frito-Lay

Where will you be working after graduation? PepsiCo Frito-Lay

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School: Haas MBA Association (Full-time MBA student government association) VP of Communications; Haas Marketing Club VP of Careers; Berkeley Board Fellow (served on local non-profit board); Haas Career Management Group Peer Advisor; Oski (Berkeley Haas student cohort) Communications Representative

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? The extracurricular achievement I am most proud of is serving as a peer advisor for Haas’ Career Management Group (CMG). It’s been amazing to coach the Class of 2022 in their internship search which is actually more soul searching than anything! I’ve enjoyed sharing my passion for brand management and marketing especially in the CPG/retail industries with interested and brilliant peers. We’ve had a record number of people pursue recruitment for brand management this year which is especially exciting given the disruption in DTC and e-commerce and the growing importance of purpose-driven strong brands in this pandemic era and beyond.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? The achievement I’m most proud of is being an advocate for inclusion at Target. I’ve worked with courageous and brilliant colleagues in official employee resource groups and organizations and unofficially within my team and department to create and maintain a work culture that celebrates authenticity. The work culture not only shapes the employee experience but also the output and product that consumers see from the brand.

Why did you choose this business school? Sometimes you get to choose who your family is and I’ve found that to be true at Haas. I chose Haas for the amazing culture hands down. Haasies are the most consistently loving welcoming genuine group I have come across. I was worried b-school would be like college with distinct groups and internationals living lives separate from the American students but Haas truly does feel like one big family. For a business school experience that was disrupted immensely with some real lemons I feel lucky to be able to make lemonade every day with my Haas family.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Veselina Dinova. Veselina is a trusted friend and an expert in her field. Even in Zoom class Veselina creates a classroom atmosphere that promotes asking questions without fear. She explains complicated concepts simply and makes an effort to ensure that everyone is understanding and feeling above water. Furthermore Veselina makes an effort to personally get to know every student in her classes by reaching out to individual students for virtual coffees or connecting with project teams. She teaches accounting-focused classes. To say that those have been some of my favorite classes as a poet (and very much not a quant) has to say something about her as a professor.

What is the biggest myth about your school? The biggest myths about Haas are that the class size is too small and the alumni network is not as robust. It’s my last semester and I am still finding new people to get to know! The benefit of the small class size is that we know everyone’s names and we truly get to know our classmates on a deeper level. Also Haasies are everywhere! While there are definite regional and industry trends when it comes to Haas graduates I have found and connected with Haasies in unexpected places such as skincare/beauty CPG VC (where I hope to end up) and in the Texas suburbs.

What surprised you the most about business school? The academic rigor. I’ve been enjoying the personal professional and academic challenges as well as learning from my classmates. I am blown away by how brilliant and humble my classmates are—we’ve got a goldmine!

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I didn’t decide to apply to business school until the fall application cycle so I had to move quickly to make round two deadlines. I turned a wall in my studio apartment into a Memento-esque board full of post-its and taped pieces of paper that included personal reflections deadlines and proposed timelines and notes from calls with current students at my target schools. I think the rapid pace of my application process made me focus on tightening my personal statements and essays. I didn’t waste time writing additional essays for schools I wasn’t in love with. This approach allowed me to focus on Haas the culture clubs and courses via in-depth conversations with current students. By the end I was even more certain in my decision to apply.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I most admire my classmate Akonkwa “Akon” Mubagwa. He is the most generous kind-hearted and gregarious person I know. Akon has been crucial in creating a sense of community not only within our class but also facilitating bonds between second-year and first-year students (which is much harder given that our campus and beloved courtyard has been shuttered due to the pandemic). I admire his open-heartedness and open-mindedness; he is a deep listener and non-judgmental. On top of all that his work ethic is impeccable. He is getting his social impact-focused startup off the ground in addition to everything else in the b-school flurry.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? VERY disruptive. Haas is not a commuter school and a large reason the culture is so distinct is because most Haasies live within a mile or two of the school. We all hang out on and around campus. Quarantine and the sudden shift to remote instruction dramatically impacted our experience and essentially halted everything except classes for a while. As a student leader I learned a lot about how the school operates within the public university system the city the county the state and the federal government when it comes to navigating something as unprecedented as this pandemic and how to mitigate it. Despite all the hardship we’ve been counting our blessings coming together as a community and making the most of what we can for our experience.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My mom influenced my decision to pursue business in college. I tell her my goals and dreams and she reminds me of them when I am feeling stuck. I couldn’t have asked for a more invested cheerleader coach and best friend in my personal and professional life. When my parents were moving out of my childhood home in 2018 I found a drawing I had made in 4th grade. The prompt on top of the page said “Draw yourself at age 30.” I had drawn a woman in a suit and scrawled under it “I am a CMO.” I have no idea how 10-year-old me knew what a CMO was but 10-year-old me definitely didn’t understand how young 30 is. Regardless my mom had kept that drawing and reminded me of it when I first told her I was contemplating business school because I was feeling stuck at my media job. I think often about how she moved to this country younger than I am now with a toddler in tow to give me the opportunities she could only dream of. I am so grateful for her keeping me on track with my own dreams.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

1) Become a consistent mentor. I am immensely grateful for all the mentorship and guidance I have received on my professional journey. Giving back and lifting up those after me is something I am looking forward to as I get more work and life experience.

2) Create an inclusive skincare/beauty brand from scratch. I’m still working on fleshing out this bucket list item. I didn’t think I had an entrepreneurial spirit before business school but the startup bug bites hard out here in the Bay.

What made Aditi such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Aditi has been fully engaged in supporting the community since joining the program. Despite the challenges of the COVID era she’s been a leader in student government working as VP of Communications to improve and maintain good communication between the school and the full-time MBA student population. Her energetic and positive attitude has helped carry others through a difficult time.

She has also served on the Board of Directors of a local non-profit organization through the Berkeley Board Fellows Program supporting NIAD a local art center and gallery for adult artists with disabilities.

Her enthusiasm for life and work her positive attitude and her genuine passion for serving her community have made her an invaluable member of our program.

Associated Press

As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Chicken recall:Tyson recalls 8.5 million pounds of frozen poultry for possible listeria contamination

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tbWVudGFyeS9hcnRpY2xlLXRoZS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50cy0yMDM1LWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtbWFuZGF0ZS1pcy1kZWx1c2lvbmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: The government's 2035 electric vehicle mandate is delusional,"Open this photo in gallery: A Volkswagen E-Golf electric vehicle. While some EVs are getting cheaper even the least expensive ones are about double the price of a comparable product with an internal combustion engine.Chris Helgren/Reuters

Whether or not you want one can afford one or think they will do essentially nothing to stop global warming electric vehicles are coming to Canada en masse. This week the Canadian government set 2035 as the “mandatory target” for the sale of zero-emission SUVs and light-duty trucks.

That means the sale of gasoline and diesel cars has to stop by then. Transport Minister Omar Alghabra called the target “a must.” The previous target was 2040.

It is a highly aspirational plan that verges on the delusional even if it earns Canada – a perennial laggard on the emission-reduction front – a few points at climate conferences. Herewith a few reasons why the plan may be unworkable unfair or less green than advertised.

Liberals say by 2035 all new cars light-duty trucks sold in Canada will be electric

Parkland to roll out electric-vehicle charging network in B.C. and Alberta

Sticker shock: There is a reason why EVs remain niche products in almost every market in the world (the notable exception is in wealthy Norway): They are bloody expensive. Unless EV prices drop dramatically in the next decade Ottawa’s announcement will price the poor out of the car market. Transportation costs are a big issue with the unrich. The 2018 gilets jaunes mass protests in France were triggered by rising fuel costs.

While some EVs are getting cheaper even the least expensive ones are about double the price of a comparable product with an internal combustion engine. Most EVs are luxury items. The market leader in Canada and the United States is Tesla. In Canada the cheapest Tesla the Model 3 (“standard range plus” version) costs $49000 before adding options and subtracting any government purchase incentives. A high-end Model S can set you back $170000.

To be sure prices will come down as production volumes increase. But the price decline might be slow for the simple reason that the cost of all the materials needed to make an EV – copper cobalt lithium nickel among them – is climbing sharply and may keep climbing as production increases straining supply lines.

Lithium prices have doubled since November. Copper has almost doubled in the past year. An EV contains five times more copper than a regular car. Glencore one of the biggest mining companies estimated that copper production needs to increase by a million tonnes a year until 2050 to meet the rising demand for EVs and wind turbines a daunting task given the dearth of new mining projects.

Will EVs be as cheap as gas cars in a decade or so? Impossible to say but given the recent price trends for raw materials probably not.

Not so green: There is no such thing as a zero-emission vehicle even if that’s the label used by governments to describe battery-powered cars. So think twice if you are buying an EV purely to paint yourself green.

In regions in Canada and elsewhere in the world that produce a lot of electricity from fossil-fuel plants driving an EV merely shifts the output of greenhouse gases and pollutants from the vehicle itself to the generating plant (according to the government more than 19 per cent of Canada’s electricity comes from coal natural gas and oil; in the United States 60 per cent).

An EV might make sense in Quebec where almost all the electricity comes from renewable sources. An EV makes little sense in Saskatchewan where only 17 per cent comes from renewables – the rest from fossil fuels. In Alberta only 8 per cent comes from renewables.

The EV supply chain is also energy-intensive. And speaking of the environment recycling or disposing of millions of toxic car batteries is bound to be a grubby process.

Where’s the juice?: Since the roofs of most homes in Canada and other parts of the world are not covered in solar panels plugging in an EV to recharge the battery means plugging into the electrical grid. What if millions of cars get plugged in at once on a hot day when everyone is running air conditioners?

The next few decades could emerge as an epic energy battle between power-hungry air conditioners whose demand is rising as summer temperatures rise and EVs. The strain of millions of AC units running at once in the summer of 2020 during California’s run of record-high temperatures pushed the state into rolling blackouts. A few days ago Alberta’s electricity system operator asked Albertans not to plug in their EVs because air conditioner use was straining the electricity supply.

According to the MIT Technology Review rising incomes populations and temperatures will triple the number of air conditioners used worldwide to six billion by mid-century. How will any warm country have enough power to recharge EVs and run air conditioners at the same time? The Canadian government didn’t say in its news release on the 2035 EV mandate. Will it fund the construction of new fleets of power stations?

The wrong government policy: The government’s announcement made it clear that widespread EV use – more cars – is central to its climate policy. Why not fewer cars and more public transportation? Cities don’t need more cars no matter the propulsion system. They need electrified buses subways and trains powered by renewable energy. But the idea of making cities more livable while reducing emissions is apparently an alien concept to this government.

Some thoughts/observations after a month driving:I heard most of these concerns raised 8 years ago when the touch-centric Model S was released--I'd argue this has not shown itself as an issueThe provide haptic feedback when pressed. The point is to be able to press the buttons without having to look at the yoke so not sure localized feedback is necessary. Is does take some time to understand what the car considers a long vs sort pressTested as this has been raised before--work with latex gloves and thin leather gloves but not with thick fleece gloves--OTOH the yoke is heated so maybe not a need to drive wiht thick gloves onNot really an issue can reach it by extending my left thumbHas happened once in. 1K mile of drivingThey are--by location:The bump in the wheel help you tell between thumb high and thumb low the other two are hard to confuse and they have pretty bit hit boxes. Again the idea is to be able to do this with wihout having to look--kinda like using a gaming controllerThey are lit when the car is on--have not had an issue seeing them even if bright mid-day sunThis is partially correct. Each button had a long and short pressed mapped to it. To turn you need a single long press and the the turn signal stays engaged until you complete your turn or you cancel it. A short (really soft) press engages your turn signal as long ad you thumb remains in place--I assume this is for lane changes. I would like to see this re-mapped so a short press gives you 3 blinks.Probably something to do with the airbag--if you press on the right side of the yoke wiht your palm (as you might press in the center of a steering wheel) the horn will also sound.I've driven with a touchscreen for 8 years now so I guess I am used to this. I can see this being disconcerting but I think folks underestimate their ability to adaptThey are by locationIn use it is obvious is you have hit or missed a button as something immediate happens you get the haptic buzz and some action immediately happens (turn signal is lit horn sounds voice command box posts up).In the last week or so I have really come to appreciate the ergonomics of the the yoke + stalkless controls. The yoke forces a 3/9 o'clock hand position which means the control buttons stay in know portions which facilitates muscle memory and being Abel to do things without having to look. Anyone that has used a gaming controller will be familiar with the concept. I find it an improvement to have controls always available under my thumb while still retaining a firm grip on the yoke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL2Vsb24tbXVzay1iZXJsaW4tdGVzbGEtZ2lnYWZhY3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNy8wMy82NDYzZmMyNi1jZjk5LTExZWItYTIyNC1iZDU5YmQyMjE5N2Nfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At Tesla's 'Gigafactory' site in Germany Elon Musk comes up against green activism and red tape,"GRÜNHEIDE Germany — This month was supposed to be another crowning moment for Elon Musk with the first German-made Teslas rolling from a new ""Gigafactory"" outside Berlin.

Tesla’s entry into the S&P 500 has cost investors tracking or benchmarked against the index of blue-chip US stocks more than $45bn since December.

The electric vehicle pioneer was already the world’s seventh-largest listed company when it was finally admitted to the S&P at the end of 2020 — more than a decade after entering some other indices such as the Russell 1000.

Its stock had rallied 764 per cent in the 12 months beforehand — partly in anticipation of forced buying on entry to the S&P 500 — and its market capitalisation equalled the total market cap of the nine largest automakers by sales volume which between them accounted for 94 per cent of global sales in 2020 according to Research Affiliates a Californian investment house.

Tesla’s share price then fell in the six months after its admission while the stock it replaced Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) rallied 48 per cent.

This rebalance cost investors 41 basis points of their portfolios said Rob Arnott chair of RA a tidy sum given that the S&P 500 is directly tracked by about $4.6tn of capital with a further $6.6tn benchmarked against it.

“AIV outperformed Tesla by a stupendous margin” Arnott said in a blog post. “A pensioner with a $100000 allocation to the S&P 500 is about $410 poorer as the result of the December index rebalance. Unfortunately this cost is totally unnoticed by investors because it is baked into the index’s performance.”

While Tesla is an extreme case Research Affiliates’ analysis suggests market cap-weighted indices have a clear tendency to systematically “buy high sell low” when they rebalance.

Since 2000 an average of 23 stocks have entered (and left) the S&P 500 each year sometimes because of corporate action such as mergers acquisitions or bankruptcy among existing constituents on other occasions as a result of growth by companies outside the index.

RA found that 65 per cent of new entrants see their share prices rally between the day their impending admission is announced and the day that change becomes effective.

In contrast 60 per cent of the discretionary deletions from the index fall between announcement and exit dates. On average deletions underperformed additions by 6.2 percentage points over this period plus a further 1 point on the day after the change is enacted as index trackers catch up.

Over the subsequent 12 months prices move in the opposite direction: additions on average underperform the index albeit by only 1 percentage point but deletions beat it by an average of almost 20 points.

As a result RA calculated that investors typically lose 20-40bp a year from “stocks [being] added at too high a price and sold at too low” during the rebalancing process.

“Traditional indices embody built-in performance-dragging inefficiencies” Arnott wrote. “The index rebalance is a great opportunity . . . to do the opposite of what the index does: buy the deletion and sell the addition.”

Arnott whose business is a proponent of factor-based “smart beta” investment said this was not a criticism of S&P per se but rather a flaw inherent to all market cap-weighted indices.

Vitali Kalesnik director of research for Europe at RA said the rebalancing effect was likely to be exacerbated by hedge funds buying stocks when their impending promotion is announced in the full knowledge that index trackers such as ETFs will need to buy them when they enter the index.

“Who benefits from this? hedge funds and other liquidity providers. Who pays? The investors a lot of which are pensioners that hold collectively billions of dollars in the S&P” Kalesnik said. “This applies to all indices and strategies whenever any trading pattern becomes predictable and can be front run.”

While an annual loss of 20-40bp may not be huge Kalesnik argued this “can be 10 times the stated management fee” for an index tracker with investors often switching funds in order to save a fraction of this amount.

While indices have little option but to rebalance periodically RA had some suggestions to lessen the impact.

Selecting additions based on their five-year average market cap can help avoid admitting “hot” stocks that prove to be temporary high-fliers while banding can limit “flip-flop trades” additions that are quickly reversed.

Kalesnik said any investor able to postpone trading of the S&P 500’s additions and deletions by a year “can outperform the index”.

Alternatively tracking an index that represents the full universe of US large-cap stocks rather than the “very narrow” S&P 500 avoids “entry point risk” he argued.

Gareth Parker a former director of index research and design at S&P who has also worked with RA and is now chairman and chief indexing officer of Moorgate Benchmarks believed that the selection methodology for the S&P 500 which includes the stipulation that a company should be profitable was “not ideal”.

“It is essentially ‘active management’. They don’t follow objective transparent rules.

“The result is anomalies such as adding Tesla and from memory Google and Microsoft far later than would have happened if the rules followed the normal approach of adding by size subject to basic eligibility criteria” Parker said.

However he was unconvinced by arguments that market cap indices inherently “buy high and sell low” given that the S&P 500’s track record “is remarkably good when compared to active management even before fees”.

Aye Soe global head of product management at S&P Dow Jones Indices said its data suggested what she termed the “index effect” had actually declined in the past decade reducing rebalancing-related losses.

“Market cap-weighting is the only way to show proportional representation of assets in an aggregate way it’s the only macro consistent way” she added. “People criticise it but if you look at active managers most can’t beat it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtcGxhaWQtZG9kZ2UtY2hhcmdlci1oZWxsY2F0LXJlZGV5ZS1tb3JlLWFsaWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model S Plaid and Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye: More Alike Than You Think,"A strange thought lingered briefly in my mind the other dayfor about the same 9.34 seconds it takes the new Tesla Model S Plaid to clear the quarter mile: Is the Model S Plaid essentially just an electric Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye? The electric Jekyll to the Charger's internal combustion Hyde?

Initially it sounds ridiculous to compare the Model S Plaid and Charger—and maybe it's the g forces talking—but they have a lot more in common than you probably think (aside from the fact we've actually compared them before). For starters both are full-size American four-door sedans. The Charger went into production in 2011 the Model S in 2012. Both were only offered out of the gate with rear-wheel drive but all-wheel drive is available today. Both were also relatively pedestrian compared to their 2022 counterparts when they first hit the market: The Tesla made 416 horsepower in its most potent trim and the Dodge Charger produced just 375 hp. New powertrains have been their only substantive updates since launch.

Here are some other ways the latest Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye and the 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid mirror each other:

Stupid Amounts of Horsepower

While Dodge has long sold a Charger SRT performance variant it really took things to the next level when it launched the first Hellcat-powered Dodge Charger in 2015. Supplanting the 470-hp Charger SRT8 as the new top dog (cat?) in the Charger lineup the then-new Charger SRT Hellcat made an unheard =0of 707 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque. The power came courtesy of a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that drove the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic. Since 2015 the Charger Hellcat has grown wider and more powerful: Thanks to lessons learned on the Dodge Challenger Demon the new 2021 Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye gains 90 hp and 57 lb-ft now producing 797 hp and 707 lb-ft.

Tesla wasn't far behind in the horsepower race. Following on the Model S P85's heels was the first-ever dual-motor all-wheel-drive performance Tesla the 2015 Model S P85D. Using front and rear motors the Insane Mode-equipped P85D made 691 hp and 687 lb-ft of torque combined. After successive steps up the horsepower ladder with various Ludicrous models Tesla recently released the 2022 Model S Plaid. It's Tesla's first-ever tri-motor vehicle and the Model S Plaid makes a Hellcat-smashing 1020 hp and 1080 lb-ft of torque.

With its horsepower and torque advantage over the Dodge plus an all-important traction advantage the 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid is quicker than not just the Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye but literally every other car we've tested. The Model S Plaid sprints to 60 mph in 2.07 seconds and on through the quarter mile in 9.34 seconds at 152.2 mph. The Charger Hellcat Redeye is no slouch but its best 0-60-mph run is a respectable (and traction limited) 4.0 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 11.9 seconds at 126.6 mph.

Nips and Tucks

Similarly while both the 2021 Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye and the 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid have received a lot of attention to their powertrains neither Dodge nor Tesla has devoted a lot of time to the cars' exterior sheetmetal.

The Dodge's changes have been more extensive however. The second-gen Charger sedan launched in 2011 featuring angular body work inspired by the Charger coupes of the late 1960s but Dodge face-lifted it in 2015 to give it a more aerodynamic and athletic Coke-bottle shape. The softer rounder Charger survives to this day with little change.

The Tesla's visual changes have been more subtle. The most obvious change occurred in 2016 when the Model S got a small nose job losing its black ""grille"" in favor of a grille-less nose that brought the Model S' design in line with the then-new Model X and upcoming Model 3. The 2021.5 Model S represents another subtle change with a larger radiator opening on the nose a revised hood and a new rear diffuser.

While Dodge has done more to the Charger's exterior than Tesla has to the Model S' the opposite is true when we're talking interiors.

The new Model S Plaid represents a fairly major interior redesign for Tesla's flagship sedan. In fact the automaker says the front-seat-riser covers are the only carryover pieces. For the 2021.5 model year the Model S Plaid replaces a traditional steering wheel with a less useful steering yoke trades its signature portrait-oriented infotainment screen for a landscape-oriented one and the car's cabin materials are all more luxurious and upscale than before.

The Charger's changes have been comparably minor. While it too has a newer steering wheel it thankfully remains circular in shape. It also has a better infotainment system and interior in 2021 than it did in 2011 but the ""spot-the-differences"" game is much more difficult in the Dodge than it is in the Tesla.

Why Haven't the Charger or Model S Been Updated Extensively?

Dodge's rationale for not thoroughly updating the Charger is pretty obvious: Aside from the fact the car completes in a shrinking segment and still sells relatively well the brand has had three different parent companies during the current model's production run.

Tesla's case is a bit more curious. Although the new 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid is the latest and greatest Model S we found it a bit odd Tesla spent its money on an extensive midcycle update instead of a true second-generation Model S to compete with a new generation of electric car challengers from Audi Mercedes-EQ Porsche and (eventually) Cadillac. A high-ranking Tesla source told us simply ""We didn't feel like we needed to go into a whole new program to make the 'best car. '""

We're not sure Tesla made the right call but it's pretty easy to forget about that for now; we're just enjoying these new horsepower wars."

In an interview with military.com a USSOCOM spokesperson said that “we [USSOCOM] are an enthusiastic supporter of the Army’s 6.8mm Next Generation Squad Weapons.”

As I previously wrote the NGSW program aims to replace both the M4 carbine and the M249 SAW platforms with two new weapons. Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems submitted designs that include magazine and belt-fed designs.

According to the Army the NGSW program aims to make individual solders deadlier at greater ranges. “The NGSW program significantly increases lethality and probability of hit at the squad level.” The M4 and M249 replacements will use a new type of ammunition as well replacing the venerable 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm NATO standards. The Army hopes their new projectile will be superior. “Due to the nature of the General Purpose ammunition the 6.8mm projectile will outperform even the most modern 5.56mm and 7.62mm ammunition. These weapons will give Soldiers significant capability improvements in accuracy range signature management and lethality.”

Lightweights

Significantly the 6.8 mm intermediate round won’t be like traditional brass-cased ammunition. The three companies in the NGSW program use different ammunition cases including a plastic composite case a hybrid brass-steel case and a plastic telescoped cartridge. These exotic-looking cases are an attempt at weight savings despite using a heavier round to allow individual soldiers to carry more ammunition without having to hump around extra pounds.

The more modest of the designs a brass-steel hybrid round might be the most promising. The cartridge case is mated to a steel base with an aluminum washer that the manufacturer Sig says shaves off 20% of cartridge weight. The base is subjected to a lot of stress during firing and a steel base could provide a good combination of light weight and durability.

General Dynamic’s case is likely even lighter thanks to doing away with brass entirely opting for an almost-entirely plastic case. A small band of metal along the case rim probably adds additional strength. Plastic cases might not be a strong as traditional brass though.

Textron Systems’ telescoped cartridge is perhaps the most ambitious and complicated. Textron’s design buries the 6.8 mm bullet inside the case (which is also made of plastic) for a shorter overall case length. Like the General Dynamics’ case polymer ammunition may not preform as well under prolonged firing.

Despite the radical new ammunition designs the program seems to be a hit. According to reporting by military.com the Army expects to choose one of the three entrants early in 2022 and fielding the winning design sometime afterward.

To screen the hub lncRNAs expressed during GIST malignant transformation 10 pairs of malignant gastric GISTs with different clinical risk classifications were collected along with adjacent normal tissues for RNA sequencing. The samples included three paired LR GISTs (tumor size 2–5 cm and mitotic rate ≤5 mitoses/50 HPFs) three paired HBS GISTs (tumor size >10 cm and mitotic rate ≤5 mitoses/50 HPFs) and four paired HBM GISTs (tumor size 2–5 cm and mitotic rate >10 mitoses/50 HPFs). The screening criteria and detailed clinicopathological features of the 10 sequencing samples are listed in Fig. 1A and Supplemental Table S1 respectively. After sequencing the significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between malignant and normal tissues were selected based on the fold change and p value and then subjected to Venn analysis to screen for co-upregulated lncRNAs in HBS and HBM (Fig. 1B). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis Oncomine and correlation analysis were employed to identify the hub lncRNAs in the Hippo signaling pathway (Fig. 1B). Finally the expression prognostic correlation function and mechanism of one candidate hub lncRNA DNM3OS were investigated in GIST cells (Fig. 1B).

Expression profiles of lncRNAs during malignant transformation of GISTs

To better analyze the potential function of lncRNAs in the malignant transformation of GISTs the expression profiles of coding genes and lncRNAs were analyzed by RNA sequencing. The expression profiles of all differentially expressed mRNAs in the LR (Fig. 2A) HBS (Fig. 2B) and HBM groups (Fig. 2C) were displayed using heatmap plots. The lncRNA expression profiles are also displayed in Fig. 2D–F. The results showed that 820 mRNAs (443 upregulated and 377 downregulated) were deregulated in LR GISTs 4816 mRNAs (2085 upregulated and 2731 downregulated) were deregulated in HBS GISTs and 4075 mRNAs (1504 upregulated and 2571 downregulated) were deregulated in HBM GISTs when compared with the corresponding levels in paired adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 2G). In addition 120 lncRNAs (45 upregulated and 75 downregulated) were deregulated in LR GISTs 818 lncRNAs (316 upregulated and 502 downregulated) were deregulated in HBS GISTs and 739 lncRNAs (421 upregulated and 318 downregulated) were deregulated in HBM GISTs when compared with the corresponding levels in paired adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 2G). To confirm the accuracy of the sequencing data two random mRNAs (GDF11 and TNXB) and two random lncRNAs (FP248 and TCONS-00023602) were selected for qPCR determination. We confirmed that the expression trends of GDF11 TNXB FP248 and TCONS-00023602 as detected by qPCR verified the RNA sequencing results (Fig. 2H). We performed KEGG pathway analysis of the upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs to identify possible pathways involved in GIST malignant transformation. The top 20 pathways for LR HBS and HBM are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. These results revealed the expression profiles of lncRNAs in GISTs and their potential functions.

Functional annotation of the co-upregulated lncRNAs in HBS and HBM GISTs

To determine the predictive roles of the identified lncRNAs in the malignant transformation of GISTs Venn diagram analysis was performed to distinguish the lncRNAs specifically upregulated in LR HBS and HBM GISTs which identified 37 193 and 299 specifically upregulated lncRNAs respectively (Fig. 3A). The intersection between the lncRNAs upregulated in HBS and HBM GISTs revealed 118 lncRNAs co-upregulated in both HBS and HBM GISTs (Fig. 3A). The expression profiles of the co-upregulated lncRNAs in HBS and HBM were displayed using a heatmap plot (Supplementary Fig. 2). Three random lncRNAs FP248 LOC107986890 and DNM3OS were selected for qPCR analysis and their expression trends were consistent with the RNA sequencing results (Fig. 3B). Next KEGG analysis was performed to identify the possible pathways containing the specific upregulated lncRNAs involved in GIST malignant transformation. The lncRNAs specifically upregulated in LR GISTs were found to be involved in B cell receptor signaling pathway cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway (Fig. 3C). The lncRNAs specifically upregulated in HBS GISTs were found to be involved in complement and coagulation cascades the Hippo signaling pathway and platelet activation (Fig. 3D). The main pathways for the lncRNAs specifically upregulated in HBM GISTs included tight junction alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and maturity onset diabetes of the young (Fig. 3E). Notably the co-upregulated lncRNAs in HBS and HBM GISTs appear to be involved in the Hippo signaling pathway complement and coagulation cascades and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that several signaling pathways especially the Hippo signaling pathway may be involved in the malignant transformation of GISTs.

Screening of hub lncRNAs in malignant transformation of GISTs by Oncomine analysis

To investigate the potentially oncogenic lncRNAs involved in the growth and proliferation of GISTs we focused on the lncRNAs involved in the most relevant signaling pathway identified by KEGG analysis of HBS/HBM co-upregulated lncRNAs the Hippo signaling pathway. The analysis identified 45 upregulated lncRNAs involved in the Hippo signaling pathway and 12 clinically relevant lncRNAs were selected for further Oncomine analysis. The expression details of the 12 lncRNAs are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Owing to the limited lncRNA expression data in the Oncomine database the top 150 coding genes correlated with the expression of the lncRNAs (positive and negative) were used in the Oncomine analysis. After mapping the gene clusters identified in the Oncomine database the top 1% of overlap between the top 150 genes correlated with the lncRNAs and the genes positively associated with various gastric cancer clinical signatures were displayed as a heatmap (Fig. 4A). Genes that were positively correlated with DNM3OS were significantly associated with clinical signatures related to high grade metastasis and gene mutations and genes negatively correlated with ZFHX4-AS1 were significantly associated with clinical signatures related to gene mutations (Fig. 4A and Supplemental Fig. 3). The top 20 coding genes that were positively or negatively correlated with DNM3OS and ZFHX4-AS1 are listed in Fig. 4B and C respectively. Based on the tight correlation between DNM3OS and the clinical signatures of gastric cancer we selected DNM3OS for further investigation.

Overexpression of DNM3OS is correlated with worse prognosis in patients with GISTs

To determine the expression and potential correlation between DNM3OS expression and the prognosis of patients with GISTs FISH staining was performed on three tissue microarrays containing 251 GISTs and corresponding adjacent normal tissues. The results demonstrated that the expression of DNM3OS was significantly elevated in the GISTs when compared to the levels in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 5A). The 251 patients were divided into LR HBS HBM and HBS/M (tumor size >10 cm and mitotic rate >10 mitoses/50 HPFs) groups. The results indicated that DNM3OS expression was markedly higher in HBS and HBM GISTs than in LR GISTs (Fig. 5B). Further analysis also suggested that DNM3OS is upregulated in HBS/M GISTs (Fig. 5B). Based on the median DNM3OS expression level the 251 patients with GISTs were divided into high (108 patients) and low DNM3OS groups (143 patients). Then the correlation between DNM3OS expression and various clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. The results indicated that DNM3OS expression was positively associated with tumor size mitotic count NIH risk classification and mutational status (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover Kaplan–Meier analyses revealed that higher DNM3OS expression was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (Fig. 5C D). Collectively these findings demonstrated that DNM3OS was upregulated in GIST tissues and was associated with poor patient prognosis.

DNM3OS knockdown suppresses GIST cell proliferation and mitosis

To investigate the potential biological role of DNM3OS in GIST cells we determined the location of DNM3OS in GIST-882 cells by FISH staining. As shown in Fig. 6A DNM3OS was mainly located in the nucleus. qPCR results for specific RNAs from the nucleus and cytoplasm also suggested that most DNM3OS was expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 6B). Next GIST-882 cells and GIST-T1 cells were infected with lentivirus-mediated shRNAs targeting DNM3OS and analysis showed significant downregulation of DNM3OS in GIST-882 cells and GIST-T1 cells stably infected with lenti-shDNM3OS-1020 and lenti-shDNM3OS-1341 (Fig. 6C). To clarify the role of DNM3OS in GIST cell proliferation the CCK-8 assay was performed and the results showed that DNM3OS knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 6D). To evaluate the effects of DNM3OS expression on the mitotic index p-histone H3 immunofluorescence was evaluated. The results showed that the mitotic index was significantly reduced in DNM3OS-knockdown cells (Fig. 6E). These data indicate that DNM3OS promotes GIST cell proliferation and mitosis.

DNM3OS regulates several pathways by promoting the expression of GLUT4 and CD36

To investigate the mechanism by which DNM3OS regulates GIST cell proliferation and mitosis GIST-882-shNC and GIST-882-shDNM3OS cells were collected for RNA sequencing. The results showed that in shDNM3OS cells 11 coding genes were upregulated and 87 coding genes were downregulated (Fig. 7A). The expression trends of two randomly selected genes CAPN11 and FAM129C as examined by qPCR verified the results from RNA sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 4). KEGG analysis suggested that the FoxO PPAR and AMPK signaling pathways are regulated by DNM3OS (Fig. 7B). GLUT4 and CD36 which were previously shown to be cancer oncogenes [21222324] were predicted to be downstream targets of DNM3OS. Thus we evaluated the expression levels of GLUT4 and CD36 in GIST-882 cells and GIST-T1 cells by western blotting. The results indicated that knockdown of DNM3OS in GIST cells inhibited the expression of GLUT4 and CD36 (Fig. 7C) suggesting that they also function as oncogenes in GISTs. PPI analysis based on the String database revealed the regulatory network of DNM3OS which is linked to GLUT4 and CD36. These results clarified the underlying mechanism by which DNM3OS regulates malignant transformation of GISTs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From their pig Panda to their duck Carl they take great pride in their companions.

And now they are helping Abilenians find just as much enjoyment with their animal friends.

The Stokers Spike and Leslie have opened their first Pet Supplies Plus store in Abilene — the fourth in their franchise — in the former Pier 1 Imports near the Mall of Abilene at 3950 S. Clack St.

With a focus on customer service that seems to be in short supply Spike Stoker said Pet Supplies Plus welcomes the entire family.

""We want everybody to come in"" Stoker said. ""We want pets with them they can bring the kids. It's a true family atmosphere.

""We've had everything in our stores from snakes and goats to baby calves. We've had folks come in with their monkeys. The fun part is everyone bringing in their fur babies and us getting to play with them.""

Abilene's budding pet corridor

While dog and cat supplies can be purchased any number of places around the city true pet stores for more selection and other more exotic options are fewer in number.

But they're also practically within walking distance of each other.

Aside from Stoker's new store which held its soft opening June 4 with plans for a two-day grand opening July 10-11 both Petco (3542 S. Clack St.) and Petsmart (3501 Catclaw Drive) are only a few blocks away in nearby shopping centers.

Stoker said the appeal of a Mall of Abilene-adjacent property mixed with childhood memories of coming to Abilene for a day in the ""big city"" made him excited to open the new location.

And Abilene seems to be a city filled with amazing pets.

""I grew up in Breckenridge"" he said. ""This is where we came to shop. It's an awesome place. There are a lot of great people here and there's a ton of pets. We just wanted to come here and help everyone with everything.""

Getting pawsitive traction

This family effort started at a Tractor Supply Co.

Stoker said he was running several stores in the vicinity of Stephenville when he suddenly got the urge that he was supposed to be doing something a bit different.

And on his own.

His own home the zoo-like setup that it is offered a great jumping off point for him to explore that next step. After meeting with Pet Supplies Plus corporate which is located in a suburb of Detroit Stoker said they took control of their first store.

They now own and operate locations in Stephenville Copperas Cove Weatherford and Abilene. A fifth store is planned soon for Lubbock meaning their ownership will cover about 320 miles of distance (from Copperas Cove to Lubbock).

After Lubbock the family hopes to open at least three more stores with one more each in Abilene and Lubbock if everything goes well Stoker said.

Opening up when things are closing up

""If everything goes well"" is a terrible thought for a new business starting up but it's also been reality for retail establishments across the country for more than a decade.

That's when the ""Retail Apocalypse"" started bringing longstanding behemoths to their knees. Abilene's seen a few of them fall such as department store giant Sears and Payless the discount shoe store.

Many consumers have shifted their shopping habits to online retailers. In the pets world that space is dominated by Chewy.

But Stoker said he has a plan to lure local shoppers away from online retailers and into his store. And it all starts with quality customer service.

""For me personally I only buy online when I can't get what I'm looking for or I can't get enough of what I need"" he said. ""Or if the place I can buy it is not friendly.

""If a customer needs something from us has questions about products or anything else that's what we're there for We're here to take care of our neighbors. We're getting back to what we're supposed to do in retail that a lot of stores have gotten away from.""

To combat the Chewys of the world wide web he said Pet Supplies Plus offers several online ordering options for in-store or curbside pickup. There's even same-day delivery if the product is purchased before 1 p.m.

""The online stores aren't going to have it to you the same day you buy it"" he said.

Though it isn't set up yet in Abilene due to COVID-19 delays the store also offers adoption opportunities for cats. Throughout all of their locations the company teams up with local animal shelters for these events.

These should be available soon Stoker said.

The “Calverton Industrial Park” proposed by Nassau County developer HK Ventures on 30 acres fronting Middle Country Road has been scaled back a bit from what was first proposed — 423964 square feet — to 412629 square feet.

The proposed industrial park would consist of eight buildings constructed in two phases providing light industrial warehouse uses (75%) and indoor manufacturing uses (25%) with an on-site cafeteria/commissary to serve the employees of the park’s industrial tenants according to the applicant’s draft environmental impact statement. The proposed buildings would range in size from approximately 44000-to 57000 square feet; the commissary would be 1500 square feet. The site is presently vacant land immediately east of the Tractor Supply/Sky Materials site. A former agricultural property it is located in the Industrial C zoning use district. Warehouses and indoor manufacturing are permitted uses as-of-right in the Industrial C district.

A market analysis prepared for the developer concludes there is sufficient demand in the market area to justify the development.

Phase one consisting of four buildings is expected to be completed by 2023 according to the DEIS. Phase two consisting of four buildings is expected to be completed by 2025 the document says. The proposed industrial development would be located on the south side of Middle Country Road 570 feet east of Fresh Pond Avenue. RiverheadLOCAL illustration. Image: Google Earth

The site would be fully cleared for the development which will also include surface parking areas providing 326 parking stalls loading areas for trucks sidewalks fencing and landscaping. Development would result in 21.5 acres of impervious surfaces and 7.8 acres of landscaping and lawns.

Approximately 1555 cubic yards of trees and shrubs would be cleared from the site requiring 65 truck trips in phase one and 13 truck trips in phase two according to the DEIS. Approximately 44512 cubic yards of topsoil would be removed from the site requiring 1917 truck trips the document says. About 4298 cubic yards of topsoil would be reused on site. Site grading would result in an “excess cut” of approximately 6279 cubic yards of material to be removed from the site requiring 309 truck trips in phase two. Removal of materials would require about six months for each phase.

No endangered threatened or rare species or significant ecological communities are known or expected to be present on the project site the DEIS says. The project site contains habitat that could be utilized by the northern long-eared bat a listed threatened species during the summer months. Six species listed as Species of Special Concern by New York State are expected to occur on the project site including eastern box turtle Cooper’s hawk sharp-shinned hawk grasshopper sparrow vesper sparrow and horned lark.

The proposal includes a proposed sewage treatment plant designed to treat 20000 gallons per day.

It also includes a proposed extension of and connection to the Riverhead Water District for its total projected potable water usage of 20000 gallons per day and 1881 gallons per day for irrigation (averaged over the year.) Currently only the first 500 feet of the site south of Middle Country Road is within the water district and there is no active connection from the site to the water main located in the road.

The water district informed the developer it is “currently unable to issue a water availability letter for a multitude of reasons for this project” according to the DEIS appendix I.

However based on consultations with the RWD the document says public water supply to the subject property for the proposed project would be possible with future planned infrastructure projects inclusive of new storage and supply wells. It is anticipated that an impact fee or tax levy may be imposed for the completion of the future planned infrastructure projects according to the DEIS.

The DEIS presents an alternative development plan calling for the installation of on-site wells to serve the industrial park rather than connection to the Riverhead Water District.

The developer’s traffic impact study says the proposed development will produce 164 peak hour trips in and out of the site during weekday peak hours mornings and evenings and 181 trips in and out during the Saturday midday peak hour. Most would be passenger vehicles with between 16 and 29 trucks expected in and out during each peak hour weekdays and Saturdays.

Most traffic would come from the Long Island Expressway via Edwards Avenue according to the study which states that the State Department of Transportation told the traffic consultant “the intersection of Middle Country Road and Edwards Avenue will undergo roadway improvements” consisting of the addition of exclusive left-turn lanes at all approaches and realignment of the northbound and southbound Edwards Avenue approaches to the intersection.

The proposal would generate approximately 50 to 60 construction jobs and 459 permanent jobs according to the DEIS.

At the current tax rate the proposed development would generate $1215000 per year in total property taxes.

The applicant has applied to the Riverhead Industrial Development Agency “for select tax exemptions including real property tax sales tax and mortgage recording tax” according to the DEIS. The applicant has not yet made a presentation at an IDA board of directors meeting and no information about the application appears on the IDA website.

Planned rooftop solar arrays would produce 2.4 megawatts of electricity that will be sold to LIPA the document says.

The public hearing before the Riverhead Planning Board will be held on Thursday Aug. 5 at Riverhead Town Hall. The public comment period close on Aug. 16. The DEIS may be accessed on the town’s website and copies for public review are available at the town clerk’s office at Riverhead Town Hall and at the Riverhead library.

The DEIS was prepared pursuant to a final scoping statement for the project adopted by the Riverhead Planning Board on Nov. 19 after a Nov. 5 public hearing. The town hired a consultant to assist it with preparing the scoping statement.

The Planning board on June 17 accepted the DEIS as complete for public review and circulation to involved agencies pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act. It was made available to the public after its June 30 publication in the state’s Environmental Notice Bulletin.",,,,,,,,,

Reports from Japan say that the Mitsubishi Electric factory in Nagasaki conducted tests under its own specifications fabricating test certificates based on the results of an earlier test conducted as specified by clients.

The fraudulent inspections were conducted between at least around 1985 and 2020 according to Mitsubishi Electric.

Reports in the Japan Times say the scandal may have affected up to 84600 train air conditioners. Of these 68800 units were for Japanese railway operators and 15800 were for export. The fraudulent inspections are also said to have affected up to 1000 air compressor units for brakes and other train parts.

Takeshi Sugiyama became CEO in 2018 and has been with Mitsubishi Electric for more than 40 years.

In 2020 only 718988 passengers were screened by TSA on the same date.

It's the latest of the convicted sex offender's valuable properties to hit the market.

A sprawling New Mexico ranch formerly owned by the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has hit the market.

Zorro Ranch stretches more than 7500 acres and includes a massive main mansion along with many other houses buildings and amenities according to a Realtor.com listing. The property located around 35 minutes from Santa Fe is asking $27.5 million and the sale is being handled by Sotheby's International Realty.

Zorro Ranch's three-bedroom four-story main residence is a gargantuan 30000 square feet according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported the listing on Thursday. Epstein purchased the land in 1993.

The property is also home to a small four-home village called Ranch Central along with a firehouse log cabin lodge yurt greenhouse tennis court stables and numerous storage buildings. There is also a private airstrip and hangar.

Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. Since then two of his high-dollar properties have changed hands.

A developer bought his Palm Beach Florida estate for $18.5 million with plans to demolish it and make way for a new house. In March a former Goldman Sachs executive purchased Epstein's Manhattan townhouse for $51 million.

What to keep in mind while renting a caravan:

Safety measures for these caravan trips are same for any travel

The big fat parking issue!

Before you rent a caravan you should keep in mind your budget number of people travelling places you are going to visit and the route.

This summer has seen an increase in the number of travellers opting to rent caravans. Caravan rental companies say that they have seen a massive jump in bookings and the demand in June and July is through the roof. Several states haven’t fully lifted restrictions yet but even in those states travellers have booked in advance for next month.A caravan trip offers social distancing amid pandemic is suitable for a flexible schedule fulfills all basic needs and is fabulously Instagram-worthy.However there are still concerns regarding parking and driving a caravan and safety precautions.Vidushi Saini Senior Business Development Manager Motorhome Adventures  says “Demand is through the roof in June post lockdown. Currently we have no vehicles available in Delhi as all have been rented for trips to Uttarakhand or Himachal. It is not just young professionals but families are also hiring it to travel to hills and other scenic locations.” “It’s a great option for when travelling with senior citizens so that they can get all the comforts of a home like kitchen and toilet anywhere they go” adds Neha Soman Director Wacation On Wheels.As Delhi started loosening lockdown curbs in June Harshita Dhall and Varun Kapoor took a two-day trip to Kasauli with their dog Luna and even celebrated Luna’s birthday in the caravan. “It is every traveller’s dream to travel in a caravan” Harshita says “We heated our dinner in the caravan’s kitchenette and set up chairs in the parking lot. It was just perfect. However I won’t call it affordable travel. For budget travellers it is a good option only if they are going in a group.”Travel enthusiasts and caravan rental companies say that this trend got popular in the pandemic. Instagram has plenty of photos of caravan travel these days with starry skies and campfires and #vanlife.Dharna Nar who went on a trip to Camp Sandrush – a short drive from Mumbai says “A caravan gives a lot of flexibility in schedule as there is no need for any hotel reservation. We found it very comfortable and convenient. You also don’t have to stop for bathroom breaks. Travelling with a toilet closet kitchen and bed means you don’t have to stick to any schedule.”Vathsala co-founder Trippy Wheels  says “In foreign countries caravans have long been considered as affordable way of travel while in India it is still in the bracket of luxury travel. We started in 2018 but it was post last year’s lockdown that caravan travel became mainstream as people understood the importance of safe travel. We’ve seen a jump of over 40% as compared to pre-pandemic. From hiring caravans for weekends to going all the way to hills we have all sorts of clients and several bookings for July.”When it comes to caravan holidays trip organisers say Goa is a favourite destination for people from Pune and Mumbai year round. The Konkan belt Nashik Gokarna and Gujarat are also very popular. In north India Manali Shimla Haridwar and Rishikesh are a favourite. Neha from Vacation On Wheels says “Hills are the safest places to travel to. You can park in remote valleys or hilltops with almost no one around you and enjoy the crystal clear night skies. Locals are always welcoming if you are respectful.”Prateek Athalye founder The Vacay Vans  says “Some travellers hire caravans for months to go on a multi-state trip. Six months one month one week and weekend bookings are roughly the trip categories. From Delhi most of the bookings are for the hills or Rajasthan from Maharashtra Lonavala and Goa are popular destinations. For MP travellers it is Kanha and Khajuraho while from Bengaluru people head to Hampi and BR Hills. One of the most popular camper van tours is the the coastline of Karnataka. It is on the bucket list of most travellers.”Camper vans come in different sizes so before going for a self-driven vehicle you need to check with the rental company if the vehicle can be driven with your driving license or not. Also take it on a test drive to ensure that you can handle it.Tosh Kothari a consultant from Jodhpur who went on a caravan trip says “I had never driven a caravan before and while I didn’t find it difficult the vehicle is certainly heavy. Maybe next time I’ll take a driver as it helps to have someone who understands the vehicle and can maintain it.”Most rental companies say that it is advisable to get a driver as they can handle the vehicle and can do emergency maintenance.Most caravans offer all essentials including kitchen AC TV and refrigerator. Before you rent a caravan you should keep in mind your budget number of people travelling places you are going to visit and the route.Jigyasu Joshi co-founder Carvaa Travelers Private Limited  says “Most queries we receive before bookings are about drivers trash disposal and parking. You need to also know where to light a campfire. When you hire a caravan with a driver then you don’t need to be bothered about all this.”Parking a caravan remains a huge concern. Unlike in the west where there are dedicated caravan parks very few destinations in India offer similar facilities. Ronnie Sachdev from Mumbai who owns a caravan shares “What’s important is to choose a destination that offers sufficient place for caravans to park and where the vehicles can stay safe overnight. Although India has a long way to go in terms of caravan-friendly infrastructure there still are some cool destinations like Gokarna Jaisalmer Hampi Sakleshpur and Coorg that offer sufficient parking spaces where one can park their caravans and explore the area.”Often trip organisers have collaborations with hotels dhabas for parking or there are bus stands and parking areas that allow caravans. Ask the rental company about parking options on your route.-With inputs from Rishabh Deb",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jlc3QtY2FyLXJlbnRhbC1hcHBzLWFuZHJvaWQtNzg0Mzg3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best car rental apps for Android,"Renting a car has changed very little over the last couple of decades. You walk in show your information pay some money and walk out with the keys to a car. Even today the process isn’t much different. However you can now use apps to locate car rental places and many companies have apps that help expedite the process. Travelers and vacationers rent cars frequently. It’s better when you can just get it over with quickly. Here are the best car rental apps for Android. Of course if you only need to run an errand or two and don’t need a whole car you can always hail an Uber Lyft or taxi with these apps too. Sometimes ride-sharing is the faster easier and cheaper alternative.

The best car rental apps for Android

Carngo Price: Free / Varies

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

Carngo is a smaller app but it has a lot of good things going for it. It works with Alamo AVIS Hertz National Payless Ace SIXT Enterprise Europcar and more. That makes it a fairly competent middle man for car rentals. The app is easy to work with and use. You book your car pick it up when applicable and drop it off when you’re done. The prices are fairly run-of-the-mill and there isn’t all that many surprises. It’s not everyday that we see an app this smooth in this space. You may want to shop around still but we found the app quite pleasant to use. The Google Play description and the website have a list of countries and airports where this app actually works. We appreciate knowing for sure and not needing to guess.

Enterprise Price: Free / Varies

Enterprise is one of the biggest names in car rental apps. Or really in car rental in general. The app does a pretty decent job as well. You can check out what cars Enterprise has available at the locations near you. You can also schedule a reservation manage your account and manage your rentals. Enterprise does have international support. You can use pretty much anywhere they have a location. The app is free to download. As you may imagine rentals will cost money.

Expedia Price: Free / Varies

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

Expedia is one of a few all-in-one solutions for car rental apps. This one covers car rentals along with airplane flights and hotels. You can use an app like this to find bundles on things like rooms flights and car rentals to save yourself a few bucks. Additionally the app has discovery features in case you’re going to a city that you don’t know. We wouldn’t recommend such an app for someone who needs just a car a rental. However it’s a good solution for those planning a vacation or a business trip somewhere.

KAYAK Price: Free / Varies

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

KAYAK is another all-in-one solution for car rental apps. A lot of the same stuff applies here as it did with Expedia. You can plan an entire trip through this app. That includes the plane flight the hotel and the car rental. It can do some other things as well. This one boasts mobile-only deals a trip organizer step-by-step instructions for airport navigation and countdown timers to keep track of your travel plans. Those who need just a car rental may find this app too bloated for their needs. However it’s a good app to plan a whole trip even the car rental.

Priceline Price: Free / Varies

Priceline is one of the more popular travel apps. It works similarly to the others on this list. You can book hotels plane flights and car rentals with this one. It also offers travel deals bundles and mobile deals. That means it could save you a few bucks. Like most this one should work worldwide. It has its fair share of issues. However most of them don’t affect your usage much. Again those who need one of the more basic car rental apps may need something less complicated than this.

Orbitz Price: Free / Varies

People know Orbitz for their clever marketing campaigns. Thankfully their app is actually pretty decent. Like most all-in-one apps it lets you book most things. That includes hotels car rentals plane tickets and even some activities. They also boast a variety of travel tools to help make things easier. It has a few issues here and there like most big name companies in this space. However it should work most of the time. You can use this as a car rental app alone if needed.

RENTAL24H Price: Free / Varies

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

RENTAL24H is a relatively decent car rental app. It’s an aggregate service that helps you find car rentals near you from 1600 different car rental companies. It works all over the world as well. Some additional features include the ability to rent cars based on certain attributes (4×4 luxury minivan etc) and you can book cars directly from the app. It works a bit like Priceline and others but this one focuses solely on car rentals. RENTAL24 also has all of the big names like Hertz and Enterprise so you can kill two birds with one stone. It works as intended and it’s actually one of our favorite options.

See also: The best car apps for Android for the best car experience

Rentalcars.com Car Rental App Price: Free / Varies

Rentalcars.com is one of the most popular car rental apps available. They source most popular car rental services. That includes Hertz Avis Alamo Budget Enterprise and several others. It also boasts 49000 locations worldwide prices in 91 currencies and support for 40 languages. You can find a rental car pretty much anywhere you go. The process is relatively painless but not perfect. It’s the one we’d recommend first since it does source most of the other services and its app is better than most of theirs.

Skyscanner Price: Free / Varies

Joe Hindy / Android Authority

Skyscanner actually boasts itself as an all-in-one travel app. It can do the usual stuff. That includes car rentals booking flights and booking hotels. It also includes price drop alerts 30000 car rental locations worldwide and it should save your recent searches. The app itself is the cleanest best-looking one on the list. Some parts of the app could use a little more finesse. However it generally works pretty well. Like all of the other all-in-one apps we’d recommend checking out a more specific app if you’re just looking for car rentals.

See also: The best car shopping apps for Android

Turo Price: Free / Varies

Turo is one of the most unique car rental apps. It sources cars from everyday normal people instead of from a company. It’s kind of like Airbnb for cars. The idea is that you rent a car from an individual. They bring you the car you pay them to use it for a few days and then go on your way. The app is still newer comparatively speaking. However it is coming along nicely compared to its early days. It’s also only available in the US UK Germany and Canada right now. However we’d like to see something like this grow more.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — More than 10000 people gathered at Truist Field to watch the Charlotte Knights play the Norfolk Tides followed by Charlotte’s annual Fourth of July SkyShow. It was the largest crowd in the history of Truist Field which opened in 2014.

“Honestly it’s a little overwhelming but I love it” said Dina West who says she’s been isolated at home for the past year. “I love actually being able to come out.”

The SkyShow Fireworks special was canceled last year because of the pandemic. This year 600 pounds of explosive weight shot up into the sky for the Fourth of July.

“There’s a lot of technology. These are all going to be computer shot. It’s one button pushed and the show runs” said Russ Ellis who is the technician for Pyro Shows and traveled from Tennessee to set up the show.

A spokesperson for Knights Stadium said this year it was encouraged for people who weren’t vaccinated to wear a mask.



“It is so awesome to be back out here” said Margaret Downs. “You just feel free wide-open and it’s just a refreshing 4th of July. It’s awesome.”

The event was one of several in the Charlotte area. Amanda Butler attended Gastonia’s 4th of July festival and firework show.

“I was working in healthcare [during the pandemic]” said Butler “So to be out with people again enjoy a little bit of company it feels good to be out in a little bit of normalcy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2FsMTAuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2ZyaWVkcy1waW5jaC1oaXQtc2luZ2xlLWxpZnRzLWJyYXZlcy1wYXN0LW1hcmxpbnMtOC03LWluLTEwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fried's pinch-hit single lifts Braves past Marlins 8-7 in 10,"The Atlanta Braves honor America with a giant flag display and members of the Sons of the American Revolution in period dress at Truist Park on July 4 2021 in Atlanta Georgia.

After the hit-by-pitch Braves manager Brian Snitker emerged from the dugout in anger especially because of this being a pretty regular occurrence over the last few years when the Marlins face Acuña. And after the umpires met to discuss how to handle the matter crew chief and second base umpire Dan Iassogna decided to eject Lopez.

Don Mattingly right now: pic.twitter.com/g8LzksKolb — Bally Sports South (@BallySportsSO) July 2 2021

Both sides are understandable here.

Again there’s a history with Acuña getting hit by a pitch five times vs the Marlins in 52 career games. He’s an absolute superstar and when there’s bad blood between two division rivals the best player getting hit by a pitch certainly looks suspicious- and naturally gets the team of that batter even more defensive and irritated. It also has the umpires more on alert and that pitch did look like an intentional hit-by-pitch frequently looks. So of course the Braves were furious and suggesting it was intentional and it’s understandable how the umpires came to the ejection conclusion as well.

But is Lopez really trying to hit Acuña on the first pitch of the game? While the last-place Marlins — 8.5 games back in the NL East — may not have realistic playoff chances (granted they do have the division’s best run differential at +20!) you’d think they wouldn’t want their very good starting pitcher — Lopez entered with a 2.87 ERA — intentionally throwing at the first batter of the game and potentially getting ejected. That immediately significantly decreases their chances to win a game and forces them to have to use — and exhaust — their bullpen for 27 outs. Perhaps it was simply a two-seamer that got away from Lopez and sometimes it takes pitchers time to get feel of their command in a game. Mattingly did seem genuinely shocked about the ejection.

Oh and that baserunner literally ended up being the difference in the game. Acuña came around to score on an Ozzie Albies sacrifice fly and the Braves won 1-0.",,,

1. He’s really really good at school

According to the National Center for Education only 41% of college students graduate with a degree in four years. Shough did it in three.

After just three academic years at the University of Oregon Shough flipped the tassel after receiving dual degrees in political science and criminal justice — the latter of which must have been inspired by his father who is a retired cop.

Now with three years of eligibility remaining at Texas Tech Shough can begin to pursue his Master’s degree. If the quarterback utilizes the entirety of his eligibility maybe we are calling him Dr. Tyler Shough his senior season in Lubbock.

2. Got benched at Oregon despite a successful first year

Last year was supposed to be the year of Shough in Eugene and for the most part it was.

The sophomore started all six of the team’s regular season games which allowed him to go near the top of multiple Pac-12 passing categories.

Shough finished second in total offense just 34 yards behind USC’s Kedon Slovis. He also finished fourth in passing yards per game and first in passing efficiency — nearly 15 points higher than anybody else in the league.

However after an 8-15 91-yard performance in Oregon’s Pac-12 Championship victory Shough was given a short leash in the team’s ensuing Fiesta Bowl.

In the loss to Iowa State after leading the Ducks to a first-series touchdown Shough was benched for Anthony Brown perhaps adding to his decision to transfer.

3. Highly touted coming out of high school

Shough’s collegiate success should not come as a surprise. The Chandler AZ native was one of the highest-ranked quarterbacks in the 2018 recruiting class.

In fact according to 247 Sports Shough was touted as the 147th ranked prospect in the country including being the 7th-ranked quarterback and the best player in the state of Arizona.

4. Originally committed to North Carolina

The heavily recruited quarterback must have liked his visit to Chapel Hill.

After taking multiple tours of schools and receiving myriad offers Shough committed to play at North Carolina a day after an unofficial visit and participating in a camp in the Tar Heel State according to 247.

However he must have liked his visit to Eugene better.

Just 111 days after his commitment to North Carolina Shough took an unofficial visit to Oregon. Three days later he announced his decision to both de-commit from North Carolina and commit to Oregon all in one Twitter post.

6. Heisman dark horse?

If you ignore the fact that Patrick Mahomes got overlooked during his three years in Lubbock you’ll realize that Tech has not had a Heisman finalist since 2008 when Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree finished 4th and 5th respectively.

According to Vegas oddsmakers Shough has a chance to end the 13-year drought.

DraftKings’ early Heisman odds gives Shough a +5000 chance to win tied with 16 other players for 16th-place.

Another online gambling platform Sports Betting Dime also gives Shough the 16th-best odds to win the prestigious award at +7500.

7. Brother is also a D1 athlete

Shough will not be the only Division 1 athlete in the family for much longer.

The youngest of the five Shough siblings Brady graduated from high school in the spring of 2021 and will suit up for Northern Arizona this fall.

The 6-2 195-pound recruit is listed as an athlete on 247 Sports where he is also rated as the 42nd-ranked player in the state of Arizona.

8. Petitioned for the 2020 season to be played in a letter to the Oregon governor

The 2020 season was weird for many reasons but most notably for the pandemic that put a question mark on if the season would actually take place.

While conferences like the Big 12 SEC and ACC announced early on that they will still allow a season to take place the Big 10 and Pac 12 had to scramble after originally saying no season would occur.

Finally a Pac 12 season did open in October but not after extensive pleading by the league’s personnel including Shough who wrote a letter to Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Twitter asking for her to approve the 2020 season.

9. Open about his faith

Scrolling up and down his social media it is easy to tell that Shough is open about his faith.

The quarterback often includes Bible verses in his tweets and references them when announcing big decisions in his life and career.

Many blessings and opportunities ahead! Hebrews 11:1 pic.twitter.com/e8MyWCwyn6 — Tyler Shough (@tylershough2) February 12 2021

Additionally Shough was baptized in a Eugene lake in 2019 which he shared a video of on his Twitter.

10. Famous friends

Shough participated in multiple quarterback camps in preparation for and during college including some run by big names.

In one camp Shough got the opportunity to learn from ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Trent Dilfer.

During this particular camp Shough learned alongside recent No. 1 NFL draft pick Trevor Lawerence.

The Red Raiders landed a commitment Saturday from a national top-250 recruit. Maurion Horn a running back and defensive back from Class 6A Broken Arrow Oklahoma announced for the Red Raiders.

Broken Arrow lists Horn as 5-foot-11 and 175 pounds. The 247Sports and Rivals recruiting services rank Horn No. 210 and No. 213 respectively among the nation's top recruits for the upcoming season and No. 4 and No. 5 respectively in Oklahoma.

According to the services he's also been offered scholarships by Baylor Iowa State Michigan State Nebraska Oklahoma Oklahoma State Oregon Texas and Southern California.

As a junior on a 7-4 team last season Horn carried 138 times for 1160 yards and nine touchdowns posting six 100-yard rushing performances. In 10 regular-season games he caught 16 passes for 235 yards and three TDs returned seven kickoffs for a 32.3-yard average and a touchdown and ran back five punts for a 10.2-yard average.

Horn could play on either side of the ball in college. Broken Arrow lists him as a running back cornerback and wide receiver. As a sophomore in the 2019 season he was credited with 36 tackles and five passes defended.

He's the sixth commitment for the Red Raiders in the current recruiting cycle and the highest-rated of the six.

The voluntary recall was issued after Agriculture Department investigators were notified last month about two people who had been sickened with listeriosis the department said in a statement on Saturday.

An investigation found evidence linking those cases to frozen chicken from Tyson Foods the agency said. Investigators eventually identified three cases linked to the recalled products including one death the department said.

Symptoms of listeriosis an infection caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes include fever convulsions muscle aches and gastrointestinal issues according to the Agriculture Department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RzYWZldHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3L3RoZS1zby1mYXItdGlueS1saXN0ZXJpYS1vdXRicmVhay1iZWhpbmQtbWFzc2l2ZS1yZWNhbGwtb2YtdHlzb24tY2hpY2tlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deadly Listeria outbreak behind massive recall of Tyson chicken,"Two Listeria monocytogenes illnesses in Texas and one in Delaware with one death between them is so far a small outbreak that’s brought on Saturday night’s massive recall of Tyson chicken.

Tyson’s Dexter MO unit recalled almost 85 million pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken products because of those illnesses. See the complete list of recalled products including product and date codes on the USDA-FSIS website.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta advises people not to eat sell or serve recalled products.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from April 6 2021 to June 5 2021. Sick people range in age from 60 to 95 years with a median age of 89 and 66% are male. All three people were hospitalized and one death reported is from Texas.

“The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses” nationally-known food safety attorney Bill Marler says. “This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria. In addition recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.”

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. All three people were in a long-term care facility or hospital when they got sick. These facilities served many food items including meals with precooked chicken.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people’s samples are identical. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

USDA-FSIS found the outbreak strain of Listeria in two samples of precooked chicken products during routine product testing. Along with the epidemiologic data this suggests that people likely got sick from eating pre-cooked chicken.

USDA-FSIS and state partners are collecting food purchase records from the long-term care facility and hospital to identify a common precooked chicken product that may be making people sick.

Until more is known CDC is advising people at higher risk for severe Listeria illness and facilities caring for them to take extra precautions: reheat the precooked chicken to an internal temperature of 165°F and do not eat cold dishes made with precooked chicken unless the chicken was reheated before being used in the dish.

Listeria is a bacterium that can cause common food poisoning symptoms such as diarrhea or fever. The symptoms typically start one to four weeks after ingesting tainted food but can be as long as 10 weeks afterward. Most people recover on their own but for people who are pregnant older than 65 or have weakened immune systems the illness can be dangerous or deadly.

Then the coronavirus pandemic came along forcing them and other bankers to curtail branch activities and sparking a new burst in digital banking.

By February this year nearly 80% of customer transactions at U.S. Bank were digital and nearly 60% of active customers did most of their banking that way.

""If you had told me that we would be at this stage 15 months later I would have thought that would be impossible"" said Tim Welsh the Minneapolis-based bank's president of consumer and business banking. ""I thought it was a five-year journey.""

Of course some people still go to a branch to cash a check or make a deposit. But many are going in less frequently and for a different reason.

To help manage social distancing as U.S. Bank began to reopen their lobbies last year it asked customers to make appointments with bankers. U.S. Bank booked more than a million such appointments last year and is on track to double that number this year.

At the U.S. Bank branch in Mound employees help clients without roped off lines and teller windows. The company has adopted similar design in new branches across its network.

""Where you used to come in and cash a check and leave in two minutes now you come in and you talk for 30 minutes about your finances with somebody at a scheduled time"" said Welsh. ""It's a completely different way of interacting with our customers.""

The pandemic has even prodded some older Americans who were previously more likely to go into a branch for routine transactions to transition to digital banking said Greg McBride chief financial analyst with Bankrate.com.

""Just as more and more grandparents were using FaceTime to keep up with the grandkids many of them were also downloading the bank's app and depositing checks for the first time or transferring money from their phone for the first time"" he said.

But this rapid shift has also meant that banks no longer see a need to have as many branches as they once did. Last year the pandemic spurred a record number of net branch closures in the U.S. according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

U.S. Bank was the leader in culling branches in 2020 with 349 followed by Wells Fargo with 331. U.S. Bank has recently been more aggressive than other banks in closing branches catching up to the broader industry after being prevented by regulators from making changes for several years ending in 2018.

U.S. Bank announced plans to close 10 to 15% of its branches before the pandemic hit but executives decided to close more as consumer behavior changed last year. They ended up shuttering about 700 going from around 3000 to about 2300 in 26 states.

When banks close branches it often leads to concerns that people who still depend on them will have to go farther to get access financial activities particularly in low-income minority and rural communities. Having to travel farther to get to a bank can be especially challenging for people with mobility issues and those without easy access to transportation.

Last year the advocacy group National Community Reinvestment Coalition raised concerns about this trend after tallying up more than 13000 closures or 14% of all branches between 2008 and 2020. It issued a report that noted that such closures often disproportionately impact rural low-income and minority communities where few branches might have existed in the first place.

However an analysis earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that branch closures in recent years have been concentrated in areas with lots of branches. So in most cases it has led to a relatively modest increase in distance to get to another full-service branch the researchers concluded.

Still Welsh acknowledged the concern and said it was a important consideration as U.S. Bank plotted out which branches to close. A company spokesman added that the bank did not see any changes in its share of branches in rural communities and actually saw a small increase in its percentage of branches in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods.

""We want everybody to have access"" Welsh said. ""But what we're finding is if you're not coming in to cash checks you don't need a branch five minutes away. But if you're coming in for an appointment you might be willing to drive a little bit more distance because it's a more substantive conversation.""

U.S. Bank is not planning any other big rounds of branch closures for the time being and expects to have a more moderate pace of openings and closings Welsh said.

The number of bank branches in the U.S. peaked around the Great Recession and has been on the decline since then as banks looked to cut costs and to adapt to consumers' shift to digital banking.

A swell of bank mergers and acquisitions has also contributed to the trend with banks often closing overlapping locations as they consolidate under one banner. For example Ohio-based Huntington Bank is closing about 200 branches after recently acquiring Detroit-based TCF Bank. None are in Minnesota.

Banks are also taking a more aggressive look at branch closures because it's harder for banks to make money right now with interest rates so low said Nathan Stovall lead banking analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence.

A recent survey by the firm found that 64% of consumers who visited branches since the start of the pandemic expect to use them less in the future. They became accustomed to banking apps.

""After doing it for a month they were like 'Well I'm never going to go back to doing it the old way. This is simply too easy'"" said Stovall. ""So there's a lot of stickiness to digital usage that you hadn't seen before.""

At the same time U.S. Bank's Welsh says that branches are still ""critical."" Finances can be complicated and confusing. And many people may need some extra help and guidance from someone in a branch to give them a tutorial in how to use new tools in the app.

""That human connection really matters"" he said.

U.S. Bank embraced a new branch design in the last couple years that's smaller and without once-standard features such as teller line. In some there's no cash on hand other than in an ATM. Instead they have more spaces where bankers can sit down with customers for a one-on-one consultation.

It's opened some of these newer branches around the Twin Cities as well as in its newest expansion market of Charlotte N.C. U.S. Bank opened its first branch in Charlotte in 2019. It now has two with plans for eventually opening 10 to 12 branches there over time in what executives refer to as their ""digital first-branch light"" strategy.

That's a big change from the old approach in which U.S. Bank might have opened 80 or so branches in a market of that size as it currently has in some of its older more traditional markets such as Minneapolis or St. Louis Welsh said.

In the meantime U.S. Bank continues to add digital tools. Last year it ramped up use of a co-browsing technology that allows customers to share their screen with a banker. A couple months ago it added a video option to that feature.

And in late May it began offering virtual appointments with a banker who in many cases may be at a local branch.

""What we're finding is that it matters that people know that you're at the intersection of 8th and Nicollet or wherever you are"" said Welsh. ""As opposed to I'm in a call center in some nameless faceless place. I'm actually your neighbor and we're here and we're here helping you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8wMy91cy81MC1iaWxsaW9uLW1pc3Rha2VubHktZGVwb3NpdGVkLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC1sb3Vpc2lhbmEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDcvMDMvdXMvNTAtYmlsbGlvbi1taXN0YWtlbmx5LWRlcG9zaXRlZC1iYW5rLWFjY291bnQtbG91aXNpYW5h?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A bank accidentally deposited $50 billion into a Louisiana family's account,"CNN —

For four days Darren James and his family were multibillionaires.

The real estate agent from Baton Rouge Louisiana and his wife were doing a routine check on their finances last Saturday when they noticed $50 billion had been mistakenly deposited into their Chase Bank account.

“That’s not like a one zero error or a two zero error that’s somebody that fell asleep on the keyboard error” James joked. “I was excited for sure. Really surprised how it got there and wondered if I had a rich uncle that gave it to me.”

But to his disappointment it wasn’t an inheritance – just an incredibly unusual error.

Chase Bank restored the family’s account to its correct balance on Tuesday James said.

“We’re still trying to figure out what happened why it happened how it happened but we know we aren’t the only ones this happened to” he told CNN. “The concern is whether my account was compromised and the bank hasn’t even called me. We haven’t heard anything from anyone.”

Chase Bank acknowledged the mistake to CNN but gave a different timeline for when it was fixed.

“We had a technical glitch a couple weeks ago impacting a limited number of accounts. The issue was resolved one day later and all accounts are showing accurate balances” Chase Bank spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus told CNN.

People who spend money mistakenly deposited into their bank accounts can be made to return the funds pay fees and even be charged with crimes. In 2019 a Pennsylvania couple faced felony theft charges after their bank accidentally deposited $120000 into their account and the couple spent most of it instead of contacting the bank police said.

But James said he never considered spending any of the money.

“My moral compass only goes one way and that’s the correct way” he said. “There’s a big difference between morality and legality. Honesty and good moral character immediately kicked in we can’t do anything with the money. I didn’t earn it it’s not ours to spend.”

Still he quipped: “Unless it was a rich uncle or one of those emails I probably responded to from a Saudi Arabian prince who promised to give me $50 billion that’s a different story.”

James said if the family was able to keep the money they would have tried to “bless” others in need.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvcmF2ZW5zL25ld3MvcmF2ZW5zLXN0YWRpdW0wNzAzMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&T Bank Stadium Ranked 25th Among NFL Venues,"M&T Bank Stadium is ranked 25th among all 30 NFL arenas according to a poll by Touchdownwire.

The rankings are based on such factors as fan participation as well as architectural design and climate.

Here is the breakdown of M&T Bank Stadium:

The stadium is your generic outdoor venue but the weather in latter months can be tough. The fans are spirited which tends to happen when an organization gives them something to cheer for. The Ravens originally had grass from 1998-2002 and then went to artificial turf from 2003-15. The Ravens have been back on a natural surface since 2016 which does add more character to the stadium.

The top five ranked stadiums are:

1. U.S. Bank Stadium (Minnesota Vikings)

2. State Farm Stadium (Arizona Cardinals)

3. Lambeau Field (Green Bay Packers)

4. Lumen Field (Seattle Seahawks)

A Baton Rouge Louisiana family had an extra $50 billion in their account for four days following a mistake by Chase bank Fox 11 reported.

Last month when Darren James returned home from work his wife told him about the billions of dollars in their bank account according to the report.

""I'm like 'Where did that come from?'"" James told Fox 11. ""And all we were thinking was who's going to be knocking on our door ... because we don't know anybody with that type of money to begin with.""

""We had a technical glitch a couple weeks ago impacting a limited number of accounts"" Chase Bank told CNN in a statement. ""The issue was resolved one day later and all accounts are showing accurate balances.""

The family did not spend any of the money according to the reports.

""We knew it wasn't ours. We didn't earn it so we couldn't do anything with it"" said James a former law enforcement officer told Fox 11.

A similar incident occurred earlier this year to a Louisiana woman in April. However she was arrested after she declined to return $1.2 million that was mistakenly deposited into her account.

BANNING CA — A 60-year-old man accused of holding up several banks around Southern California including at least two in Riverside County was in custody Saturday in lieu of $1 million bail.

Todd Cannady of Palm Springs was arrested on Thursday after allegedly committing an armed robbery at a Chase Bank in Jurupa Valley according to the Banning Police Department. Police said Cannady fled from the bank and led Riverside County sheriff's deputies on a brief vehicle pursuit before he was taken into custody.

Authorities said Cannady matched the description of a masked gunman who's robbed other banks in the Southland in recent months including a US Bank in the 300 block of South Highland Springs Avenue in Banning. According to Banning police a man wearing a camouflage baseball cap dark sunglasses and a black hooded mask walked into the bank on Feb. 16 just after it opened. He pulled a gun described as a black pistol and demanded money from a teller. The teller complied with the suspect's demands and the man successfully fled from the bank.

After learning about the bank robbery in Jurupa Valley Banning detectives served a search warrant at Cannady's home and allegedly found a large sum of money firearms and other evidence linking Cannady to several bank robberies police said. Cannady was booked into the Robert Presley Detention Center on suspicion of several felonies including second-degree robbery false imprisonment and being a felon in possession of a gun."

Yet despite offering cash incentives rideshare giants Uber and Lyft are still struggling to bring drivers back to full speed leading to longer wait times for customers and soaring prices.

Uber and Lyft have put millions into these efforts but some former drivers aren't even looking at these stimulus packages or trying to get in on surge pricing. A large percentage who are still holding out.

""Drivers are in a low-key strike"" Nicole Moore a volunteer organizer with Rideshare Drivers United told CNBC.

""Right now it's a mini debacle for Uber and Lyft in terms of driver shortages and surge pricing throughout the US"" Wedbush's Dan Ives said in an email. ""Drivers are ~40% below capacity.""

Former ride-sharing drivers are staying off the road for a variety of reasons.

For many it's fear of the continued pandemic which is what made them stop driving in the first place. Currently less than 50% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""This thing is not over yet people can still get sick"" Louis Wu a Texas resident and former rideshare driver told CNBC. According to Uber 80% of drivers planned to come back once vaccinated. The company has also heavily invested resources into getting people vaccinated offering free rides to vaccine spots through early July as a part of its effort to get people back on the road.

Others wanting to stay in the gig economy but fearful of transmission have switched to food or grocery delivery. That's also allowed them to put less wear-and-tear on their cars especially as gas prices and car parts prices increase.

""In times of Covid there's a lot less customer interaction with food delivery vs transporting a passenger in your backseat"" Harry Campbell who runs The Rideshare Guy blog said in an email. ""You also put less miles on your car as a delivery driver since people order from nearby restaurants vs a full-time ride-hail driver that can easily do 1000 miles per week or more. A lot of ride-hail drivers just get tired of dealing with people too.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdWJlci1kcml2ZXJzLWFwcC1nbGl0Y2gtY2hhcmdpbmctcmlkZXMtZmFyZXMtZmVlcy1yZWZ1bmQtMjAyMS020gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS91YmVyLWRyaXZlcnMtYXBwLWdsaXRjaC1jaGFyZ2luZy1yaWRlcy1mYXJlcy1mZWVzLXJlZnVuZC0yMDIxLTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber glitch: Drivers charged for rides one lost $50 and quit,"Some Uber drivers say they've been charged to drive passengers thanks to a glitch in the app.

Some Uber drivers are being charged rather than paid for rides because of a glitch in the app.

One driver was charged $2.20 for a 16-minute journey. Another lost $50 on a single ride.

Both were later reimbursed but said they quit the app because of the experience.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Some Uber drivers have effectively paid to drive their passengers around because a glitch in the app left them out of pocket after completing rides.

One driver in Illinois said he lost $2.20 on a 13.5-mile journey. The driver who spoke to Insider on the condition of anonymity said he had stopped driving for Uber and Uber Eats after what he said was a poor experience with the company's driver helpline.

Another driver said she was charged nearly $50 for a ride and didn't receive a fare for another.

Uber took days to reimburse the fares on some occasions the drivers said.

The Illinois driver said he decided to drive early morning on May 30 after noticing that prices were spiking. Uber pays drivers more during these so-called ""surges"" when it hikes up fares in areas with high demand and few drivers.

The driver said he accepted a request to drive a passenger from downtown Chicago to the city's Midway International Airport – a 16-minute 13.5-mile journey.

But after dropping the passenger off the driver checked his earnings on the Uber app and was surprised to find a negative balance for that ride.

He said it was the first time it had happened in his two years of driving for ride-hailing apps which he said included nearly 1700 rides for Uber and 500 for Lyft.

When the driver first accepted the ride the app displayed an estimated fare of $36.67 higher than normal because it added a surge multiplier he said. But when he checked his account he saw Uber had removed the surge and the passenger was only charged $9.06.

And after Uber deducted a $11.26 service fee the driver lost $2.20 from the trip he said.

The driver sent Insider screenshots of the app that verified these claims.







""It was completely crazy to me"" he said.

He isn't the first Uber driver to encounter this problem.

After sharing his experience on Reddit other drivers said that a common glitch was to blame and that he'd be refunded.

In a separate Reddit thread another Uber driver shared screenshots that showed they were charged $56.71 for driving a passenger also in Chicago.

""It's been going on for months now and people post about it here almost weekly"" one Reddit user said.

Brianna Woodham a former Uber driver in Atlanta Georgia told Insider that it had happened to her twice and that she had stopped driving for the company as a result.

It happened once in early April when Woodham was charged $49.54 for a ride per screenshots seen by Insider. This was due to a surge fare being deducted rather than added to her account on the app. During another journey two weeks later Woodham drove a passenger for 46 minutes – and earned nothing on it screenshots shared with Insider showed.

Other users on Reddit said that on some occasions they had only received their tip and not the full fare.

An Uber spokesperson told Insider that fares for certain trips booked through Uber Reserve which lets riders book journeys up to 30 days in advance were miscalculated ""due to a software bug.""

""This was a terrible customer experience for drivers and for that we apologize"" the spokesperson said. ""We've ensured drivers have been paid in full for all affected trips fixed the bug and have put new safeguards in place.""

But both drivers Insider spoke to said that their glitched journeys had been booked through the standard UberX service rather than Uber Reserve.

Drivers say they had problems contacting Uber for help

The Illinois driver said he called Uber's driver support line from the help section of the app. But the line is only staffed from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday according to the automated message drivers get when they call out-of-hours – meaning no one was there to answer the phone when the Illinois driver called.

""I didn't think it was right for me to lose money on a trip and then have to wait two days to call support to have them fix it"" he said.

The spokesperson told Insider that all drivers have access to 24/7 support via in-app messaging and that drivers who have completed 3000 trips or are Uber Pro Gold Diamond or Platinum drivers have access to 24/7 phone support. Drivers at the blue level have access to phone support on weekdays the spokesperson said.

The Illinois driver told Insider that he then turned to the Uber Twitter support account for help – and that after some back and forth the Uber Twitter account stopped replying to his messages.

The driver sent Insider screenshots of the Twitter conversation that verified his claims.

The driver decided to tweet about his experience. The tweet went viral – and Uber finally paid attention. A rep contacted him and Uber paid him the original $36.67 estimated fare he told Insider plus an extra $25 that the representative said was ""for the inconvenience.""

""It took the will of the internet to even get the issue addressed"" the driver said.

Woodham meanwhile said that she was refunded by Uber for the first journey around a week after it happened – but that she still hasn't been paid for the second glitched ride more than two months later.

She said that she had reached out to Uber multiple times but never received a helpful response or refund. She didn't think the issue would ever get resolved she told Insider.

Drivers quit Uber as a result

Because of the lack of support he received from Uber the Illinois driver said that he was worried he'd be in danger if a serious incident happened. Drivers were ""sitting ducks"" he said and referred to a recent incident in Cicero Illinois where a driver was shot and killed.

""If I have a serious issue it just opens my eyes to the fact that unless it's Monday through Friday business hours we're out there on our own there's not gonna be anybody there to reach out to to address an issue"" he said.

He said that he had stopped driving for Uber and planned to turn to food delivery instead and Woodham also said that she had stopped driving for Uber her the second glitched ride.

""It just made me rethink which gigs I do want to do"" the Illinois driver said. ""I should never be charged to work by anybody.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1zdGFiYmVkLW5ldy1yb2NoZWxsZS1zdGFiYmluZy13ZXN0Y2hlc3Rlci1jb3VudHkvMTA4NTk2OTQv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3bnkuY29tL2FtcC91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1zdGFiYmVkLW5ldy1yb2NoZWxsZS1zdGFiYmluZy13ZXN0Y2hlc3Rlci1jb3VudHkvMTA4NTk2OTQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 arrested charged in connection to New Rochelle Uber driver stabbing,"4 arrested charged in connection to New Rochelle Uber driver stabbing

With summer upon us I thought it’d be the perfect excuse to try out some new makeup. Aren’t we supposed to be swapping out our usual stuff for something lighter sheerer and more summery anyway?

So when the team decided to focus on the most intriguing makeup products from Black-owned brands this month the lightbulb went off. This is exactly where I’ll start.

5 Gorg Black-Owned Makeup Brands That Are Bringing The Shine

When shopping my thought processes these days usually involve a lot of overthinking and lists. Where am I buying from who is my money supporting and what kind of impact does my purchase have? After examining my list and hearing the announcement for this month’s roundup my questions were simplified: I’ll start with Black-owned beauty brands. Not only because my purchase will be better aligned with my values but also because these products are seriously exciting (and often cleaner and/or cruelty-free).

The team went ahead and picked out five Black-owned makeup brands we’ve been eyeing (or have already tried.) Heads-up: you may spend a greater amount of time than intended staring at these insanely good products. Don’t say I didn’t warn ya!

Beauty Bakerie’s cosmetics look amazing. Seriously gorgeous shadows glosses highlighters and more. The story behind the brand is what really drew me in though. After the owner of Beauty Bakerie Cashmere won her battle with breast cancer she became super conscious about the products we use on our bodies. With that she created a cruelty-free makeup brand that became known as “activists in makeup.” They started initiatives such as Sugar Homes supporting orphaned children. Claps all around.

Oh Fenty Beauty. You get me every time. Maybe it’s because Rihanna’s the brand creator and I’d probably give into anything she did (I stan) but I’ve heard crazy good things about both her beauty AND skincare products that are yes — clean vegan cruelty-free and gluten-free. (Kat dedicated a post on her obsession with the skincare.) I’ve personally been wanting to get my hands on her beauty line for ages so give me one excuse guys and I’ll add to cart!

The Lip Bar is a vegan and cruelty free makeup brand I was first drawn to because of their complexion quiz. It helps you find the right shade of makeup for your skin tone (something SO tricky especially when shopping online). You can even enter in existing foundations you use from other brands to find the exact right Lip Bar foundation. And of course hence the name we love their lip products.

Laura says: Have and love this gorgeous color and love that packaging! So rad. This stays on so well and as someone who still has to wear lip color under my mask I am thankful for that! ‘Unimpressed’ is a perfect pink for year-round: it’s deep but still reads as a light pink without going into either bubblegum or hot pink territory.

From DIY fashion and gender-neutral jewellery to shopping on TikTok many current fashion and retail trends are being driven by Gen Z. That same generation is also driving innovation in beauty from product categories to marketing—as well as more fundamental ways of thinking about beauty. Eden Palmer VP of merchandising global brand and 3rd party at Forma Brands speaks of a seismic splintering in the sector. “There is no longer a single definition of beauty” she says.

Gen Z is a digitally native generation with full access to social media to express their demands disagreement and doubts. That’s putting pressure on brands to respond ever-faster and more proactively. “Gen Zs are able to make their opinions heard so much more loudly than previous generations” says MaryLeigh Bliss VP of content at Gen Z and millennial research and insights company Y Pulse. “Being listened to is an expectation.

Date: July 3 2021

By Adam Levine-Weinberg The Motley Fool



Last week United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) announced a massive aircraft order and a bold new five-year plan. The airline giant plans to grow dramatically while shifting its fleet to significantly larger aircraft by 2026 to improve its profitability.

Management clearly recognizes the key shortcomings that have weighed on United Airlines' financial performance over the past decade. The company's growth plan tackles those issues head-on. But its planned expansion is likely to create new problems as it will flood the domestic travel market with capacity.

Extraordinary growth plans

United Airlines announced two big aircraft orders on Tuesday. It will buy 50 more 737 MAX 8s and 150 additional 737 MAX 10s from Boeing along with 70 A321neos from Airbus. These deals add to United's nearly 300 outstanding orders for mainline aircraft as of March 31: 180 737 MAX jets and nine 787-10 Dreamliners from Boeing along with 50 A321XLRs and 45 A350-900s from Airbus.

Most of these jets will arrive by 2026. In fact United now has 138 aircraft deliveries scheduled in 2023 alone. About 300 of the nearly 500 deliveries coming between now and 2026 will replace older less efficient jets. But most of the jets being retired are single-class 50-seat regional jets whereas the bulk of the new deliveries are 737 MAX 10s and A321neos that will likely accommodate 190 to 200 seats each.

As a result the combination of growing the fleet count and shifting to much larger jets will increase United Airlines' capacity at a 4% to 6% compound annual rate through 2026 relative to 2019.

That might not seem especially fast. But U.S. air travel demand won't fully recover to 2019 levels until at least 2022. At the midpoint of its target range United's 2026 capacity would be up 41% from 2019 with double-digit growth in 2023 and rapid capacity expansion continuing over the subsequent years.

What will happen to fares?

Replacing small regional jets with large narrow-body aircraft will boost United's average number of seats per departure in North America from 104 in 2019 (the least of any major airline) to 134 by 2026. This will help it reduce its non-fuel unit costs by 8% and boost its fuel efficiency by 11% compared to 2019. On the flip side growing so quickly could weigh on average fares.

The carrier hopes to mitigate that fare pressure in several ways. First its fleet transition will increase the proportion of premium seats (which command higher fares) in its domestic fleet. Second by operating more flights in each bank at its big hubs United will significantly increase the number of feasible connecting itineraries. That should help it gain market share all else equal. Third the aircraft replacement program and cabin upgrades for the remaining fleet will improve the customer experience making United a more desirable airline to fly.

Management estimates that it could generate an adjusted pre-tax margin of 14% by 2026 -- up from 9.4% in 2019 -- even if unit revenue remains 1% below 2019 levels at that time. The carrier believes this target is conservative.

However United Airlines is planning for an unprecedented amount of growth for an airline its size. Meanwhile there's very little chance that U.S. travel demand will grow 40% or more by 2026. Indeed it's possible that business travel would only get back to 2019 levels by around then. And rivals aren't going to let it gain massive market share without a fight. Thus United's growth plan could cause fares to erode far more than management anticipates offsetting the benefit from its unit cost reductions.





Going way out on a limb

To pull off its growth plan the airline expects to ramp up adjusted capital expenditures from $4.5 billion in 2021 and $4.2 billion in 2022 to a stunning $8.5 billion in 2023. Capex will likely remain elevated at least through 2026.

Despite this heavy capital spending management claims that adjusted net debt will top out at $25 billion for the next few years. By 2026 United projects that adjusted net debt will fall below its pre-pandemic level of $18 billion.

Yet if demand grows less than projected or the company's rapid growth triggers fare wars unit revenue and profitability could fall well short of United's targets. That would lead to lower cash flow driving the company's debt load higher. While the airline could change course and retire additional mainline jets to slow its growth rate it still runs the risk of having significantly more debt and lower profits than anticipated a few years from now.

If everything goes exactly to plan for United Airlines shares of the airline giant will soar over the next five years. However I'm skeptical that it will be able to grow as much as it plans without driving its fares significantly lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,

UNH,UnitedHealth Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9jb3ZpZC13YXJuaW5nLXdhcy1oaXMtZmluYWwtd2lzaC82MDAwNzQ3ODQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID warning was his final wish,"Rob Tersteeg figured at some point he'd probably get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Yet busy with his job and family this spring the 46-year-old oil field safety worker just didn't get around to it. Relatively young active and healthy Tersteeg didn't consider COVID-19 an immediate threat especially after evading illness for more than a year. As an essential worker who had regularly traveled despite steep virus peaks in his home state of North Dakota and across the country Tersteeg felt safe.

But as he sat in the emergency room of a Minot N.D. hospital in May struggling to breathe Tersteeg told his wife Amy of his vaccine regrets. A few weeks later he died in a hospital in Minneapolis where a COVID treatment of last resort wasn't enough to save him.

""Rob's final wish was that his journey with COVID might save even just one more loving husband son father uncle friend"" his family wrote in his obituary. ""Rob regretted not being vaccinated and immediately upon hospitalization made Amy promise to vaccinate the kids.""

Nearly everyone hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks and months has had the chance to get vaccinated likely preventing their illness or at least sparing them from the worst of the disease doctors say.

Some patients and families remain decidedly opposed to immunizations health officials say even after confronting the idea that the vaccine likely would have spared them. But others including patients who were on the fence about being immunized are admitting to feelings of regret and remorse.

Rob Tersteeg in May. While hospitalized he said he wanted to share his story after he recovered.

""I think it's easy for us looking from the outside or for even people in health care to think that everybody getting COVID right now is a vehement vaccine opponent"" said Dr. Andrew Olson the director of COVID medicine at M Health Fairview. ""That's not the case.

""Instead we're seeing people who just were busy and were not prioritizing it — and said 'I'll get it done when I get it done' and 'I don't want to miss a day of work.' ""

They're missing the vaccine ""for the same reason that we don't go to the dentist or we don't get our eyes checked"" Olson said. ""We just have to make it a priority.""

When Rob Tersteeg was hospitalized he talked with his doctor about sharing his COVID story once he recovered so others might better understand the consequences of illness as they considered whether to get vaccinated. The couple didn't want to be pushy with their message Amy Tersteeg said believing the ultimate decision on immunizations should always remain with individuals.

""We don't want to tell people to get the vaccine — we want people to read what COVID does and to decide for themselves"" she said. ""Rob was invincible until he wasn't.""

Young and active

Rob Tersteeg grew up on a farm near Bird Island Minn. about 90 miles west of the Twin Cities.

In his 20s he worked as a trucker based in his home state but later moved to North Dakota to work as a safety officer with energy companies in the Bakken oil fields. That's where he met Amy who moved from Minnesota for a job with Trinity Health which operates a hospital and clinic in Minot.

It was a second marriage for both when they wed in 2014. Amy had three children and the family quickly jelled with Rob aspiring to perfect attendance at the kids' sporting events and school fundraisers.

With Rob at the helm pontoon boat rides became the family's pastime — often with kids being pulled in a tube behind. A few times a week the couple could be found playing in cornhole tournaments or bowling in leagues around town.

When COVID-19 hit North Dakota in early 2020 Amy became part of the emergency response team at Trinity. This past winter she was an active part of the vaccination effort and was promptly immunized herself.

Rob never downplayed the significance of her stories Amy said as she described the pandemic suffering she witnessed or the joy for patients at being newly vaccinated.

But he didn't want to be sidelined by the short-term side-effects — chills aches and fatigue — that Amy experienced after her vaccination. And he tended to think COVID-19 while a serious issue for nursing home residents the elderly and those with significant health problems just wasn't reason for concern in his world.

""There was never a conversation like: 'Hell no. I'm not going to get it' "" Amy said. ""There was a feeling of: 'I don't need it. It's not going to take me down. I'm not old. I'm not sick.' ""

Sharing his story

The couple never argued over vaccination. As conservative Christians they both believed that vaccine decisions shouldn't be forced on people Amy said just like faith can't be forced on those who don't believe.

""I never pushed him"" she said. ""I didn't push our friends. I just didn't believe in that.""

That day in the ER though Rob's regret drove him to insist that his stepchildren get vaccinated as soon as possible. After a few days in the hospital he talked with Dr. Casmiar Nwaigwe an infectious disease physician at Trinity about the idea of sharing his story to warn others.

Letting Rob describe what they thought would be a near-miss with COVID would be helpful Nwaigwe believed because vaccination rates in the Minot area are significantly lower than in Minnesota and many parts of the country. Whereas 70% of Minnesota adults had received at least one dose of vaccine as of Thursday the North Dakota rate was just under 56%.

""At the point I had that discussion with him"" Nwaigwe said ""I thought he was going to turn around.""

Rob wasn't being treated for health problems like asthma diabetes or lung disease that put people at greater risk for bad cases of COVID-19. People who are overweight run greater COVID-19 risks and that description applied to Rob who stood 6 feet tall and weighed about 210 pounds.

But he looked like an average guy in his age group Nwaigwe said an active man who wasn't likely to become a pandemic casualty.

""The message I think people should take from his story is that COVID is a serious disease whether you're young or whether you're old"" Nwaigwe said. ""The best treatment is not to get it because it's unpredictable.""

During Rob's funeral last month in Bird Island one of the petitions — the portion of the Catholic mass where congregants seek help from God — asked: ""For all those considering their own individual decisions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine may their hearts be softened by Rob's willingness to share his very personal battle with COVID.""

Family members believe the message is making a difference as it circulates among those who knew Rob.

""We literally have gotten texts and folks have called us to say: 'I wasn't going to get vaccinated' or 'I was on the fence but now I've changed my mind' "" said Gina Fox a sister. ""I know my brother would say: 'It's a very personal decision but look what happened to me.' ""

For Amy Tersteeg the hope that Rob's story might help protect others is a source of comfort amid her loss.

""I can remember Rob saying: 'Yeah someday — I'll probably get the vaccine someday' "" she said. ""But there was never a thought in his mind that that someday had already passed until he was in the ER not able to breathe on his own.""

After a series of stakeholder and public meetings since 2019 TEP is preparing to file its final plan for the 138-kilovolt Kino to Demoss-Petrie Transmission Line — which will feature 75- to 110-foot power poles — with state regulators at the end of July.

TEP says the line is needed to boost power capacity in the area and to better serve the University of Arizona and Banner-University Medical Center Tucson.

But as TEP plans to file for approval of its final route with state regulators later this month neighborhood opponents who want the line buried underground have hired an attorney — and the city is preparing to defend an ordinance that would prohibit the utility from installing the line overhead.

About a dozen affected Tucson neighborhoods have formed a group called the Underground Coalition to advocate for installing all or part of the roughly seven-mile line underground arguing the line would ruin the aesthetics of many historic neighborhoods and cause property values to plunge.

Participating neighborhoods include Jefferson Park Sam Hughes Iron Horse Pie Allen West University and Catalina Vista.

“As a neighborhood we’re very concerned about the placement of the lines” said Colleen Nichols president of the Jefferson Park Neighborhood Association and a resident since 1977. “These are massive lines and they have no business in or near a residential area.”

The neighborhoods have found an ally in Tucson City Councilman Steve Kozachik who says TEP has not adequately addressed concerns over the proposed line.

He says the line which would run along much of South Kino Parkway and North Campbell Avenue would violate a city ordinance banning overhead power lines in so-called “Gateway Corridors” to the city.

“That’s a serious conversation that we still have to have and so far TEP has ignored it” said Kozachik whose Ward 6 encompasses Sam Hughes and several other neighborhoods on or near the proposed power-line route.

Cost gives pause

TEP says it is studying the legal issue with the city but maintains that “undergrounding” the line is an unnecessary expense that would cost more than 13.5 times the $1 million-per-mile cost of an overhead line. That would come to about $90 million for seven miles underground compared with about $7 million overhead; the substation is expected to cost about $30 million.

The utility says it would be unfair to force all of its ratepayers to pay the extra cost of burying the line suggesting that the city form a special underground utility taxing district to have affected property owners pay for the undergrounding.

TEP has been responsive to the neighborhoods throughout the public siting process and hasn’t ignored the undergrounding issue spokesman Joe Barrios said.

“As we've said publicly before we're more than happy to work with neighbors and other stakeholders to consider formation of an underground district” he said.

Formation of an underground district Barrios said would “ensure that all TEP customers are not asked to subsidize a discretionary and expensive expenditure that primarily benefits residents or property owners in one small area of our service territory.”

Barrios noted that TEP heard from some neighborhood and public officials who say customers not directly impacted by the line should not pay for undergrounding it.

TEP officials say the only underground lines on its system are lower-voltage distribution lines and those were all paid for by developers or other parties.

Kozachik and others argue that undergrounding the transmission line would preserve the aesthetics of a key city gateway for the benefit of all area residents and set a precedent for other areas of the city as TEP expands its high-voltage system.

Citywide concern?

Retired UA political-science professor John Schwarz lives several miles northwest of the proposed line but he’s jumped into the effort against TEP’s overhead power-line plan nonetheless.

“They affect the entire city these lines and they affect principles that are important to the city” said Schwarz a 51-year Tucson resident who taught public policy at the UA. “You shouldn’t have to live in one of the neighborhoods (along the line route) to be concerned.”

Schwarz said that like many of the neighborhood leaders opposed to overhead line he wholeheartedly supports the line as part of TEP’s efforts to improve service reliability.

But he says it’s also a matter of equity since the property owners in the path of the new line will bear a significant cost of an overhead line as a result of property devaluation.

A white paper Schwarz authored with two other Underground Coalition members cites a federal study that found homes within 1000 feet of an overhead high-voltage line could suffer property devaluation of 10%. Other studies have estimated devaluation of 2% to 9%.

Litigation over property devaluation stemming from an overhead line could run into the tens of millions of dollars — money TEP could put to use undergrounding the line Schwarz and Kozachik said.

TEP’s Barrios said the company has not estimated possible property devaluation related to the project but he said studies reviewed by TEP indicate that “though short‐term impacts to property values can occur long-term property values are not greatly affected by transmission lines.”

But Schwarz said making only the affected property owners pay for the undergrounding through a special utility district just adds insult to injury.

“That’s asking people TEP is damaging to pay for TEP not damaging them” he said.

The Underground Coalition has also questioned TEP’s cost estimates for undergrounding the line citing examples that cost as little as half TEP’s per-mile estimate as well as questioning TEP’s assertion that maintenance costs of underground lines would be much higher than overhead lines.

Barrios says TEP stands by its estimates which were developed by a third-party professional engineer.

“The cost analysis is based on the costs of actual projects that TEP’s consultant was involved with and actual material costs” Barrios said adding that wire used underground can't carry as much current and underground lines require special insulating infrastructure.

Whatever the cost premium it would represent a tiny fraction of TEP’s revenues — and barely 1/100th of TEP’s most recent rate increase Schwarz noted.

Bumpy road

TEP said it plans to file its formal line-siting request with the Arizona Corporation Commission by July 30. The matter then will go before the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Committee which after public hearings will make a recommendation to the Corporation Commission which has final say.

But the plan has hit some speed bumps at the city of Tucson and Kozachik has vowed to invoke the Gateway Corridor ordinance to stop the project.

In May a city zoning examiner denied TEP’s request for a special exception land-use permit to build the new Vine substation which would be built on the north end of the UA Banner campus and next to the Jefferson Park Neighborhood and link the two major sections of the Kino line.

The examiner said he could not determine the line proposal’s compliance with other area development plans because the line route in and out of the substation hadn’t been determined.

Barrios said TEP will refile the for the permit after it has filed its final route with the ACC.

But Kozachik said TEP will still have to deal with the Gateway Corridor ordinance prohibition on overhead power lines.

“The ordinance that we have mandates underground utilities on Gateway Corridors and that's what Kino is and it goes all the way to River Road” he said. “So they need to square that circle and decide whether they want to pursue that alignment with that understanding.”

Acknowledging that could lead to a court battle Kozachik said the City Attorney’s Office has assured him the ordinance is defensible though it’s never been tested in court.

TEP’s Barrios said the company is reviewing the city’s Uniform Development Code which deals with the Gateway Routes and expect to provide a response to that issue in the application to the Corporation Commission.",,,,,,,,,

""Our treaties say that we have a right to health care provided by the federal government"" said Abigail Echo-Hawk an enrolled member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and the executive Vice President of Seattle Indian Health Board. ""This is meant to be quality health care provided to enrolled members of federally recognized tribes to health care free of charge in that we already paid for it with the land that the United States is on.""

But according to a 2018 report from the independent and bipartisan Commission on Civil Rights the U.S. government has not adequately funded these programs leaving many indigenous communities without the ability to provide quality care.

""If we don't get the resources that we need it's always going to be a struggle for us to begin to address the underlying health conditions that were built as a result of the colonial oppression and suppression of both our health and our economic prosperity within Indian country"" Echo-Hawk said. ""Until we see full funding of the Indian Health Service we're always going to be struggling to do more than just provide the immediate needs of our people.""

In an emailed statement sent to CNBC the Indian Health Service said it had received ""historic investments"" of more than $9 billion since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic ""to address long-standing health inequities experienced by American Indians and Alaska Natives by ensuring a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.""

According to recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data Black Hispanic and Asian American communities are more likely to contract the coronavirus to be hospitalized because of the virus and to have an increased risk of death from the virus when compared to their white counterparts.

David Asch executive director of Penn Medicine’s Center for Health Care Innovation says he and his colleagues had conducted studies showing how the kind of hospital a person was admitted to could determine how likely the person was to recover from the virus.

“And we wondered whether that same phenomenon might help explain why there were racial differences in mortality” Asch said.

In other words was it possible that Black patients did worse than white patients because they were admitted to hospitals that provided worse care for all?

Recently that’s what Asch and a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and OptumLabs found. They examined hospital-level differences by looking at 10 months of de-identified hospitalization data from more than 44000 Medicare patients from 1188 hospitals across 41 states and the District of Columbia. After observing inpatient mortality rates in the 30 days after admission for each racial group and including those discharged to hospice care the study showed that the overall mortality for white patients was approximately 12.9% and 13.5% for Black patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYm1jcHVibGljaGVhbHRoLmJpb21lZGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLjExODYvczEyODg5LTAyMS0xMTM1NS140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pessimistic health and optimistic wealth distributions perceptions in Germany and the UK: evidence from an online ...,"Overall the data yielded three main findings. Firstly there was a broad consensus on ideal and estimated actual health distributions across the German and British samples and across demographic groups: The pronounced gap between ideal and estimated actual health distributions indicates that all groups – even the healthiest participants – would prefer their society to be healthier than their estimation of how healthy it actually was. Secondly and most noteworthy the three indicators of the actual health distributions (which were taken from the representative EHIS data sets for Germany and the UK) suggest that the actual distributions are better than the estimated distributions of health approaching the ideal level of health in the German sample and exceeding expectations in the British sample. Thirdly these gaps between ideal estimated and actual distributions of health are qualitatively different compared to findings in the domain of wealth.

Unlike wealth in which accumulation in one group of the society is inevitably linked to reduced wealth in other groups health is not a socially shared commodity and entitlements to health can be construed as an aspect of citizenship [26]. However rather than aiming for perfect health for the whole population the yardstick for the ideal distribution of very good or good health is set at 78 and 72% of the German and UK populations respectively. People seem willing to accept that to some degree detrimental conditions lead to a situation in which around a quarter of the population have a poor or modest health status. Beyond biological predispositions there is strong evidence that health is dependent on multiple factors ranging from individual decisions and habits to structural factors including income and social position which operate at various levels such as poor nutrition health behaviors working and life conditions access to health systems and public policy [272829 1]. More than the fact of existing health differences in the population as such views on the causes of ill-health might influence acceptance and perceived fairness of health differences. In this health inequalities attributed to economic or environmental circumstances as compared to individual predispositions or decisions seem deemed as particularly unfair and unjust [26 30 31].

The broad consensus that was observed across both samples and all demographic groups for ideal health distributions suggests that German and British participants may share a “normative” standard for the distribution of health despite having different health care systems and disagreeing about measures and policies that affect health distribution. “Normative” in this context is merely a descriptive term (see 11) which indicates that participants from different countries and demographic backgrounds agree on the ideal distribution of health in their societies. A society might have the level of health that participants construe as ideal but this might still not fully realize its actual potential nor be optimal from a public health or economic perspective.

The consensus that was observed for ideal health distributions also extended to the estimated actual distribution of health in the society. Woman and men younger and older healthier and less healthy rich and less rich groups all provided similar estimated distributions of their societies’ actual health with 34% of the German and 36% of the UK populations rated as being very healthy or healthy. The data indicates a profound gap between ideal and estimated actual distributions of health which differed by a factor of more than 2 regarding the proportion of people who should be and were estimated to be in good or very good health. The gap between ideal and estimated actual health distributions may serve as a proxy for evaluating the performance of public health care. This may in turn affect the framing of debates on health care systems with the “felt” gap between the nation’s ideal and estimated actual health potentially leading to a focus on negative developments funding issues and challenges rather than a comprehensive picture including positive developments and opportunities.

While people seemingly misperceive the distribution of both health and wealth the direction of misperception was in opposite direction. Previous studies comparing estimated actual and ideal wealth distributions to actual wealth distributions have produced consistent results across different samples and nations [32 10]. The present data replicate these findings since the participants’ underestimations of the actual amount of wealth inequality reveal an even larger gap between estimated-actual than ideal-actual wealth distributions. These positive views on actual wealth distribution contrast with rather negative ones on health. While participants positively misperceived the current level of wealth inequality suggesting that they are unaware of the actual wealth gap in their societies they negatively misperceived the current level of health inequality. As the assessment method for perceived and ideal health and wealth distributions were comparable the observed gaps between distributions does not seem to be caused by a general perception bias rather inequality perceptions were modulated by the respective topic. One might speculate that health perceptions are more pessimistic as various influencing factors such as information provided through the media social networks health care provides etc. is skewed towards “bad news” and diseases. Moreover assessing perceived and ideal health distributions for different wealth groups in the population probably will result in a differential pattern of results (e.g. Marmot Review [1]). Specifically people might underestimate the health in the population but overestimate the health in vulnerable groups.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

There are some caveats which need to be considered for the present data. Regarding actual health distributions our composite index includes GP visits and absence from work which may provide an overly optimistic picture of the actual distribution of health. For instance one can be sick and nonetheless go to work or decide not to visit a doctor. We readily acknowledge that other measures of health may possibly reveal different and more negative views on a nation’s health. However there is currently neither a gold standard of a composite nor a single measure of individual health indicators available which is consensually agreed. What we find most surprising is that the data on the distribution of self-reported health collected from representative German and UK samples within the framework of EHIS are rather similar to the ideal health distribution and sharply more positive than the estimated health distribution within countries. Furthermore the German and UK samples are not demographically representative of the German or British populations. Compared to the overall population the German and British samples were younger included more female participants and were better educated. However while not representative the robustness of the findings across several relevant demographic groups i.e. age gender health status and similarity of findings across the German and UK samples despite profound differences in health systems is reassuring and invites an examination of representative samples across a wider range of nations.

Implications of the study

(Mis) perceptions of health and wealth may substantially affect policy endorsement. For instance the Marmot Review [1] states that “… health follows a social gradient. Everyone below the top has greater risk of worse health than those at the top” (page 7.) and suggests the setting of strategic goals to reduce health inequality. It is presumed that perceptions of the steepness of the social gradient and how great the challenge to achieve a higher level of health actually is will affect societal agreement with health policy campaigns. Furthermore the distributions of the actual and ideal health data were rather similar leading to the surprising hypothesis that the status of their nation’s health is actually better than the participants from Germany and the UK perceived. While research has yet to demonstrate a strong relationship between the desired distribution of health and the endorsement of ensuing policies [10 11] awareness that ideal and actual health distribution are more similar would send a positive message possibly facilitating a mindset of opportunity to further increase the level of health in the population. One might speculate that the health related information provided by for example the media and social networks is more skewed towards “bad news” as compared to wealth related information which might have contributed to the observed discrepancy between the two topics.

Given that most people are not experts on public health they presumably report reflective interpretations and beliefs about the perceived actual situation which in turn presumably build upon intuitive processes and different sources [9]. One line of reasoning reflects social comparison processes. Specifically people often believe that they are healthier than their peers indicating unrealistic optimism ([33] for an overview see [34]). The present data support this notion since self-reported health distributions from the representative EHIS data sets for Germany and the UK were profoundly more positive than the estimated actual health distributions. Another possibility is that negative health perceptions may reflect sampling rates and a greater exposure to negative health information in the public and media. A tendency towards negative perceptions has been observed for a range of topics of public interest such as violence [35] or political news [36]. Similarly the media contains many advertisements promoting the health benefits of various products and campaigns requesting changes in life-style and health behaviors and political debates about the increasing costs of health systems often accompanied by concerns about inefficacy may contribute to the impression of a comparably unhealthy rather than healthy nation. Finally negative perceptions of the actual distribution of health may derive from an increasingly high standard of health. Research has shown that changes in concepts can occur when extreme cases are less frequently encountered [37]. Accordingly when people experience serious health threats less frequently a shift in concept may occur in which less severe health threats are now seen as riskier. Thus a prevalence induced concept shift of health may also lead to a pessimistic view on the nation’s health. It is worth noting that considering health beliefs as reflective and situation-bound interpretations of intuitions entails the notion that such beliefs are flexible and depend on stimulus input i.e. having a sensible ratio between positive and negative information and processing goals i.e. promotion vs. prevention. Insights into the fundamental processing characteristics of beliefs can be used to improve the discourse of public health professionals and for instance address overly pessimistic views on the national health distribution. However making people aware of the gap can potentially lead to changes in their perceptions without necessarily changing their pessimistic outlook. Considering results from other fields i.e. examining biases such as unrealistic optimism in health risk perceptions [38 39 32] one may assume that people may adapt their pessimistic perception of the current level of health in the population while simultaneously also changing their ideal health distribution which may preserve the observed gap between perceived and actual health distributions.

Outlook and future research

While the present study provides an important first step in examining perceptions of health inequality and their accuracy it also raises new issues. Future research should therefore investigate the reasons for negative misperceptions of health as well as the implications these misperceptions might have on trust in public health services social and economic policies and policymakers. Moreover building on the present results future studies should try to foster the integration of the subjective perspective into research on health inequalities as well as investigating environmental and structural aspects and their complex associations with perceived ideal and actual health. Monitoring and providing the public with assessable transparent and reliable information about objective health and wealth indicators in the population for example by using data visualizations seem therefore to be key for facilitating accurate perceptions and public trust. This in turn may also enable discussions about the causes of and opportunities for improving health and health equity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNy8wNC92aW4tbWFubml4LW1hcmF1ZGVycy1sZWNvbS1wYXJrLWNsaW1iaW5nLXJhbmtzLzc4MzE1ODQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VIN MANNIX: Marauders' LECOM Park climbing the ranks,"By Vin Mannix

byElectricity access is a critical enabler for building a robust and inclusive healthcare infrastructure for people around the world. A joint study by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank recently noted that without access to electricity many life-saving interventions cannot be undertaken. In countries such as India where a large majority of the population still lives in rural areas reliable power plays a crucial role in delivering essential healthcare services to the people. The rural healthcare system which follows a three-tier structure - Sub-centres Primary Health Centres and Community Health Centres - perform critical functions such as immunization labour and deliveries and antenatal and neonatal care.However one in every two Primary Health Centres in India is either un-electrified or suffers from irregular electricity supply. This in turn cripples the overall service delivery of the health centres despite having all medical equipment and necessary staff at their disposal. The rural communities are facing the worst of the pandemic. The second wave caused avoidable devastation that can be attributed to a lack of preparedness. For us to fare better in the upcoming waves it is important to understand how access to reliable electricity translates into a stable healthcare system.In India much of the policy discussion so far has revolved around improving direct factors such as expanding the network of health institutions training healthcare workforce skill development and financing the overall healthcare infrastructure. Electricity was never recognized as a prerequisite for effective healthcare delivery. The absence of reliable electricity in health facilities often disrupt the critical function of medical equipment such as radiant warmers (for new-born care) and refrigerators that are used for storing life-saving drugs. A recent study on the impact of Jyotigram Yojana (JGY) - a rural electrification program providing 24/7 electricity to rural non-agricultural users in Gujarat demonstrated that the implementation of JGY significantly improved the operational capacity of health facilities in particular primary health centres (PHCs) and increased the availability and functionality of a wide range of essential devices and equipment. Access to reliable power as evidence suggests can significantly improve the healthcare delivery system.Energy access is crucial for maternal and child health. Global data suggests that over 289000 women die every year from pregnancy related complications. Reliable energy access for lighting and key medical equipment function however can avert such life-threatening complications that are impacting pregnant women and new-borns in India and around the world. It is therefore imperative to equip the healthcare facilities in rural areas with reliable power to enable effective service delivery. The rural health facilities that cater to the millions of people in India need to be strengthened to achieve the government of India’s goal of universal health coverage for all.The two critical areas that could further strengthen India’s healthcare sector are as follows:Government of India has already recognized the role of off-grid energy solutions in providing reliable power to rural households. The efforts in this direction helped India in achieving 100 percent household electrification recently. A similar approach needs to be taken up to extend electricity access to rural healthcare facilities in India. Renewable energy can provide a sustainable solution to the age-old problem of unreliable electricity supply. Off-grid (stand-alone and mini-grid) renewable energy solutions are increasingly becoming cost-effective and sustainable that is rapidly deployable and reliable to electrify healthcare centres while strengthening global efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 that is good health and wellbeing for all.Though India has achieved significant progress in household electrification in recent years electrification of healthcare facilities continues to remain a major challenge due to poor infrastructure high maintenance costs and inadequate policy support. There are well-defined central and state government policies for off-grid and grid interactive solar power plants. But there is no such policy or guiding document that exists on the installation and maintenance of off-grid solar PV power plants for rural health centres. While the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and State governments have laid out guidelines for procurement and installation of off-grid PV power plants there is still no policy directive on the maintenance of these off-grid PV plants in rural health centres. The maintenance of these off-grid power plants still remains with the state level National Health Mission ( NHM ) offices or health departments or medical officers in Primary Health Centres/Community Health Centres (PHCs/CHCs). As a result the absence of a clear policy directive often leads to indefinite delays in maintenance work depriving the health centres of reliable electricity access. In such a scenario it is important to have well-defined guiding document for the stakeholders on procurement installation and especially for maintenance of the off-grid solar PV power plants for the PHCs and CHCs for effective healthcare service delivery.As India emerges from the devastating impact of the pandemic the healthcare sector needs a major overhaul and increased resource allocation to be future-ready. And reliable access to electricity should be at the centre of all interventions.Jaideep Mukherjee is the CEO at Smart Power India(DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHealthworld.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

The arena is expected to be known as AT&T Center until the contract expires in the fall of 2022 Front Office Sports adds. The telecom giant also recently sold off its 7% minority interest in the Spurs.

""This sale is a result of the ongoing strategic review of our balance sheet and assets to identify opportunities for monetization"" Fletcher Cook said VP of corporate communications for AT&T in an email to FOS. ""We want to ensure that our assets support our overall strategy and areas of market focus. Where this is not the case we transition them to owners who will provide incremental stewardship and investment.""

It is estimated that AT&T made about $125 million from its original investment in the Spurs which was made more than two decades ago. AT&T had paid about $2 million per year for the naming rights to the Spurs' arena.

Front Office Sports says AT&T is looking for ways to cut costs. The company still owns naming rights to the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium but it's no surprise it wants to keep the naming rights as the team is one of the most popular in the nation.

It's unclear which companies might be interested in purchasing naming rights for the Spurs' arena.

Este SUV completamente eléctrico presentado por primera vez en 2019 reportó 2465 unidades vendidas 225 unidades más que el Mustang de combustión interna el cual alcanzó vender 2240 unidades. El hecho resultó sorprendente para muchos debido al legado que ha construido el histórico Mustang por más de medio siglo un legado basado en la preferencia del público estadounidense.

A pesar de estos resultados el modelo tradicional mantiene su récord en el total anual llevando la delantera ante el Mach-E con una muy buena ventaja: 31950 unidades vendidas en lo que va de año una cifra que se traduce en 18975 unidades más que el SUV eléctrico el cual ya registra 12975 unidades vendidas en estos primeros seis meses de 2021.

Desde la aparición del Mach-E se ha comentado mucho sobre la posible desaparición del Mustang de combustión interna por varias razones entre ellas una muy particular que se ha estado reforzando gracias a la profunda transformación energética de la industria automotriz: la electrificación. Muchas marcas entre ellas Ford ya han iniciado su camino hacia la neutralidad de sus producciones las cuales se están mudando rápidamente hacia los modelos completamente eléctricos. En ese contexto el Mustang Mach-E superaría al modelo tradicional si lograra ganarse la preferencia del público estadounidense el cual ha estado fascinado por el Mustang de combustión interna por más de 50 años.

Según informa The Drive a pesar de estos profundos cambios es muy difícil que los rumores de la completa desaparición del Mustang tradicional terminen siendo ciertos al menos no hasta 2030 año en el que se supone aún existirá una nueva versión de este auto nombrada bajo el código S650 la cual estaría pautada para debutar el año entrante. Todo esto será posible si las operaciones de Ford se recuperan de la escasez de semiconductores un problema que sigue afectando a la compañía y que la ha llevado a interrumpir la producción de su Bronco 2021. Este problema también ha llevado a Ford a reportar ventas muy bajas en comparación con Toyota que recientemente superó a General Motors reportando el mejor número de ventas en Estados Unidos durante el segundo trimestre del año.

Seúl 4 de julio (Yonhap) -- Las ventas de vehículos ecológicos del Grupo Hyundai Motor en Corea del Sur han aumentado casi un 40 por ciento en el primer semestre en comparación interanual debido a la fuerte demanda de modelos híbridos y de nuevos vehículos eléctricos mostraron sus datos de ventas este domingo.

Las ventas locales combinadas de modelos ecológicos de las dos filiales del grupo automotriz surcoreano -Hyundai Motor Co. y Kia Corp.- alcanzaron las 94.435 unidades en el período enero-junio en comparación con las 67.798 unidades del año pasado según sus datos de ventas.

Entre ellas 65.473 unidades eran modelos híbridos que utilizan una combinación de un motor de combustión interna y un motor eléctrico de batería.

Otros modelos ecológicos incluyen vehículos eléctricos (VE) y vehículos eléctricos de pila de combustible de hidrógeno (FCEV según sus siglas en inglés).

Las ventas locales de automóviles ecológicos de Hyundai se dispararon un 355 por ciento interanual a 51.085 unidades en el primer semestre dado que lanzó en abril una gama más amplia de variantes híbridas y el Ioniq 5 totalmente eléctrico.

Durante dicho período Hyundai vendió en el mercado surcoreano 30.986 modelos híbridos 15.683 VE y 4.415 FCEV.

Las ventas de automóviles ecológicos de Kia aumentaron un 44 por ciento interanual a 43.350 unidades en los seis primeros meses del año impulsadas también por la fuerte demanda de modelos híbridos.

Kia vendió 34.487 modelos híbridos y 8.863 VE durante el período.

Entre ellos la variante híbrida del vehículo utilitario deportivo (SUV) Sorento de Kia fue el vehículo ecológico más vendido en el país.

Precisó que si bien del 2 al 4 de julio los establecimientos tuvieron un repunte del 30% respecto a otros fines de semana se esperaba que el incremento de ventas alcanzara el 60%.

Desafortunadamente en la semana previa al fin de semana largo en la Unión Americana. en pleno Centro histórico de Tijuana se suscitó una persecución y enfrentamiento entre autoridades y delincuentes. Esta nota que le dio la vuelta al mundo en redes sociales y medios de comunicación provocó que “la afluencia turística y derrama económica esperada no se diera” aseguró.

En un comunicado el también vicepresidente de la Cámara Nacional de Comercio Servicios y Turismo (Canaco-Servytur) de Tijuana detalló que en establecimientos de diferentes giros la recuperación económica tuvo en promedio un incremento del 30 por ciento respecto a un fin de semana habitual de 2021.

Lo cual los obliga a redoblar esfuerzos para tener una recuperación económica más acelerada después de que pasara lo más álgido de la pandemia de coronavirus y de esa manera resarcir los efectos de la crisis económica que causó a los comerciantes durante más de doce meses.

En el encuentro se analizó la crítica situación que enfrenta el país caracterizada por “un crecimiento de los precios minoristas por encima de los niveles diseñados en la Tarea Ordenamiento” y se reconoció que existe no solo escasez de oferta de alimentos sino además de medicamentos.

En su intervención Díaz Canel insistió una vez más en que a pesar de que muchos no comprendan la medida gracias a las tiendas en MLC hoy el desabastecimiento no es mayor en el país.

“Si no lo hubiéramos hecho el desabastecimiento hoy hubiese sido mucho mayor” remarcó el gobernante en referencia a los polémicos establecimientos impopulares por su carácter privativo ya que en ellos solo pueden comprar aquellos cubanos con una cuenta bancaria con depósitos en dólares estadounidenses euros libras esterlinas dólares canadienses u otras divisas extranjeras.

Según su argumentación en un primer momento la decisión de abrir tiendas en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC) tenía el objetivo de que no salieran del país los dólares y demás divisas que “escapaban” a mercados vecinos como Panamá o México.

“Esa medida perseguía inicialmente captar la divisa que se fugaba al exterior en función de las compras en otras naciones por parte de algunas personas con el propósito de lucrar con su ulterior reventa en el país” precisó y más adelante dijo:

“Con dichos recursos financieros se reaprovisionan las tiendas en MLC y con el resultado también se abastecen las que ofertan productos en Pesos. La industria nacional ha encontrado con la venta al mercado en MLC la posibilidad de financiar la producción destinada a satisfacer parcialmente la demanda en pesos”.

Sin embargo en Cuba las antiguas tiendas recaudadoras de divisas o shoppings como son reconocidas popularmente han quedado prácticamente deshabilitadas por falta de suministros sistemáticos. En muchas de ellas hoy solo se oferta agua y bebidas alcohólicas mientras que en otras apenas se venden productos asignados por la libreta de abastecimiento.

Se trata de una realidad muy diferente de la que prometiera en su momento el ministro de economía Alejandro Gil cuando aseguró en julio de 2020 que la apertura de tiendas en MLC no implicaría el desabastecimiento de las shoppings. Pero hoy no solo estas se encuentran desabastecidas sino incluso las propias tiendas en MLC.

En la reunión del Consejo de Ministros se analizó además el notable decrecimiento en la producción de alimentos sobre todo de arroz frijoles carne de cerdo y leche; aunque se estimó que existe un cumplimiento del plan de huevos y carne bovina aunque todavía por debajo de la demanda de la población.

Toda esta situación viene además gravada por la tensa situación epidemiológica que vive el país con un promedio de 3000 diagnósticos diarios de covid-19 en la última semana y ante la inminente afectación del huracán Elsa.

Aun cuando desde el gobierno se evita hacer alusiones comparativas con la crisis de los 90 Díaz Canel trazó un paralelismo con otros momentos complejos vividos desde 1959: “superamos los retos de los primeros años de la Revolución superamos el periodo especial y vamos a superar también este momento” sentenció.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY3JvbmljYS5jb20uZWMvMjAyMS8wNy8wMy9lbC1zZWN0b3ItZmxvcmljb2xhLWRlLWxvamEtcmVnaXN0cmEtbWluaW1hcy12ZW50YXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,El sector florícola de Loja registra mínimas ventas,"Quienes se dedican a la venta de flores en la ciudad de Loja consideran que el negocio no registra mejoras desde que inició la pandemia el año anterior. Incluso en algunas fechas especiales donde existía alta demanda pasan desapercibidas a raíz de la emergencia sanitaria.

La reactivación avanza poco a poco para la mayor parte de sectores de la actividad productiva en esta ciudad. El expendio de flores que suele ser común disminuyó considerablemente.

En el Parque de las Flores en los bajos del Centro Comercial Loja al igual que en la calle Sucre y mercado Gran Colombia suelen ser los sitios tradicionales para el expendio pero en lo que va del año son pocas las personas que frecuentan estos espacios de comercialización.

Situación

Sara María Benavides quien se dedica a la actividad precisa que están trabajando a pérdida porque la demanda ha disminuido significativamente. “Incluso las flores que se marchitan a los ochos días es un dinero que no podemos recuperar y afecta nuestra economía”.

Acota que solían tener alta demanda el Día de la Madre el 8 de Marzo por festejarse a la mujer pero tampoco este año tuvieron mayores ingresos. “En noviembre del año pasado tampoco se vendió como se lo solía hacer por recordarse a los santos difuntos porque incluso hasta los cementerios estuvieron cerrados” precisa la vendedora.

Mantener

Este mismo criterio mantiene Beatriz Reen Jiménez quien se dedica al expendio cuenta que los pedidos de las flores al por mayor los realizan a Tumbaco y Carcelén (Quito) desde ahí llegan las distintas especies pero desde el 2020 cuando inició la pandemia también ha disminuido el nivel de producción.

Incluso los costos se mantienen desde el año pasado hay arreglos desde los USD 3 a fin de incentivar a los clientes. “Al ser un producto natural solo duran de ocho a quince días y luego se estropean”.

Mejorar

La aspiración de quienes se dedican a la actividad es que la situación cambie con la vacuna contra la COVID-19; y las actividades y fechas especiales vuelvan a tener su auge para evitar laborar a pérdida.

“Pedimos a las autoridades más apoyo nos den las facilidades al momento de sacar créditos para poder reactivarnos y recuperarnos de este mal tiempo” acota Yajaira Estrada quien también se dedica a la actividad. (I)

En el Parque de las Flores se expende desde las 08h00 a 21h00 cuando no hay restricciones.

The West is getting roasted by hotter summer days while the East Coast is getting swamped by hotter and stickier summer nights an analysis of decades of U.S. summer weather data by The Associated Press shows.

State-by-state average temperature trends from 1990 to 2020 show America's summer swelter is increasing more in some of the places that just got baked with extreme heat over the past week: California Nevada New Mexico Arizona Utah Oregon and Colorado.

The West is the fastest-warming region in the country during June July and August up 3 degrees on average since 1990. The Northwest has warmed nearly twice as much in the past 30 years as it has in the Southeast.

That includes Portland Oregon which set a record 116-degree high that was 3 degrees warmer than temperatures ever recorded in Oklahoma City or Dallas-Fort Worth.

Although much of the primary cause of the past week's extreme heat was an unusual but natural weather condition scientists see the fingerprint of human-caused climate change citing altered weather patterns that park heat in different places for longer periods.

""The ridiculous temperatures in the Pacific Northwest may on one hand be considered a black swan (ultra-rare) event but on the other hand are totally consistent"" with long-term trends said meteorologist Judah Cohen of the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. ""So I am not going to predict when is the next time Portland will hit 116 but I believe hotter summers for the broader region are here to stay.""

Climate change is altering and weakening the jet stream narrow bands of wind that circle the Earth flowing west to east. Those changes allow key weather-producing patterns of high and low pressure to stall in place. High pressure is stalling more often in the West in summer said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann. High pressure brings hot and dry weather that when stalled can create what are known as heat domes. Low pressure brings wet weather.

Another factor is higher water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that also generate more so-called high-pressure ridges the West said Gerald Meehl a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist who studies heat waves.

These patterns are showing up so often that their effects can be seen in long-term data. The U.S. Northwest western Canada and Siberia which also just saw a stunning heat wave are among Earth's fastest warming land areas during summer since 1990 Cohen said.

The Midwest is warming slower during the summer than either coast. That's because stalled low pressure areas often drive cooler air into the Great Lakes region said North Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini.

Water explains the big difference between western and eastern heat trends scientists said.

""In western states where drought has been expanding and intensifying during the past decade soil moisture has been declining. Dry soil heats up faster than moist soil during the day because all the solar energy goes into heating rather than into evaporating moisture"" said Jennifer Francis a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. ""Dry soil also cools off faster at night.""

That's partly why the West which is getting drier by the decade and is mired in a 20-year megadrought is seeing those crazy triple digit daytime temperatures.

The East is getting wetter by the decade NOAA records show and the East Coast is seeing its biggest warming increase at night. The overnight lows in New Jersey and Delaware have warmed 3 degrees since 1990 the biggest increases in the nation.

Water vapor is a greenhouse gas Francis explained ""So at night it traps more of the heat.""

Kathie Dello North Carolina's state climatologist attributes the trends to human-caused warming. ""There's no other explanation"" she said.

She added that while the extreme daytime highs may be eye-popping warmer nights can also be dangerous. ""Warm nights may not sound like a problem but they are a public health risk for people who lack sufficient cooling"" she said.

And hiding from the heat is becoming harder and harder: ""All my places to go for a quick break were absurdly hot -- Oregon North Carolina even upstate New York? Where is left to go? Even Canada isn't safe.""

BUFFALO N.Y. — A new report from Verizon.Go is ranking Buffalo as the most business-minded city in New York State.

The company compared six weighted factors to determine what cities across the United States are the most ambitious. The factors were: mean income unemployment rate education level number of business applications homeownership and the percentage of the population who have started a new business.

Verizon.Go compiled the list of most ambitious cities in each state as well as the top 15 most ambitious cities in the country. The team only considered cities with a population of over 100000 people with the exceptions of Vermont and West Virginia.

Even though Buffalo ranked number one in New York State in terms of the entire country the Queen City falls at number 71. According to the report the most ambitious city in the United States is Sugar Land Texas.

Much like its predecessor the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price but this time you get more storage and 5G too.

It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy and kind of retro cool.

Excellent build quality

Only two years of security updates

Camera performance could be better $499 at Amazon How we rate and review products

Good looks aside I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good).

It also lacks compatibility with AT&T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much.

There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device but it still comes up short.

Rather than offering a faster refresh rate TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.

TCL 20 Pro 5G screen performance and battery

A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool particularly after leaving the camera app but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.

TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles with “vivid” as the default or turn it off entirely.

We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be.

TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates

The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real but the effect is hard to mimic.

TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here and there are a ton of functions you can map it to from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode like night or portrait.

It’s really useful but unfortunately it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll which nobody needs.

There’s another premium feature on board here too: wireless charging at up to 15W

Moving along to the top edge of the device there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.

The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging.

On the software side the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid none) is common in this class so that’s great to see. However it will get just two years of security updates which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone.

Otherwise TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.

There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.

TCL 20 Pro 5G camera

The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide 2-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front.

The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on but it’s not too distracting. However there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos.

Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.

All in all the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.

While it offers some premium features for its price the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.

There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.

There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally the camera is basic and Nxtvision is underwhelming.

some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device

And then there’s network compatibility — in the US it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces Verizon and AT&T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.

If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G offers a fast refresh rate screen better network compatibility and a solid four-year security support policy. The Google Pixel 4A 5G is a good option too with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives but depending on your priorities they may serve you better in the long run.

You might think playing a well-known commercial character is a simple gig but for AT&T’s Lily actress it was anything but. She said then that trolls on the Internet targeted her “milkies” and made other disparaging body comments effectively harassing her online. Now she says she was surprised by the controversy and reveals how it has impacted her entire career.

In an interview ahead of her new movie Werewolves Within Milana Vayntrub touched on her viral moment online revealing she found what happened to be “surprising” after she admitted to dealing with body shaming. She said the support” and “the controversy” were both shocks to her also recalling:

I wasn't upset because people shared their opinions on my appearance but I said something because just by showing up to do my job I received unwanted sexual and violent comments about my body and what people want to do to it.

Milana Vayntrub has had a lot of big appearances outside of her AT&T ads ranging from stints on This is Us and Silicon Valley to a new role in the flick Werewolves Within but she does say she feels she has to factor in a whole lot more before taking on a role since the body-shaming incidents gained a life of their own online. In the full interview over at Insider she mentioned the whole ordeal has had an impact on her choices: What gigs she should take and which she feels she needs to pass on due to how it often becomes a conversation about how the internet treats her.

Of course I take into account how much skin I'm showing and whether I have a violent scene or a sexual scene or honestly whether I'm showing my feet or not because it becomes a conversation about the way that I'm treated online. I'm unfortunately always thinking about it.

While Milana Vayntrub is still doing AT&T ads you may have noticed them looking different in recent months. (In fact AT&T itself is looking different in recent months.) Instead of the camera shots being focused on her body she’s often sitting behind a desk or wearing blazers that cover more of her figure. She previously said she directs ads now and has decided this has to be the way Lily moves forward if the character will continue to be a focal point in the ads. You can see a more recent commercial below.

Milana Vayntrub is still active on social media but she's been open and honest in the past about the types of comments she's gotten on the interwebs from the people who follow her on Instagram and elsewhere. It's easy to see why there's been a struggle for the TV film and commercial actress.

These days a lot of the stuff she posts is more focused on her career than anything personal -- like the trailer for Werewolves Within. Perusing the comments she still gets a lot of ""you are beautiful""-type thoughts from strangers but that doesn't appear to have put her off social media completely though she would not be the first celebrity to choose to leave social media due to the actions of others. For now catch her in Werewolves Within on VOD and in limited theaters now."

That was the Kellogg's cereal jingle you probably heard on TV. Very catchy very easy to remember and a diabolical earworm that appealed to both kids and adults.

Kellogg's had a handful of cereals aimed at the adults but let's face it...over the last 100+ years they had more pre-sweetened kid cereals than any other cereal company.

A Kellogg's Cereal for Everyone's Taste

There was a Kellogg's cereal to suit everybody's taste with two of them still around after 100 years: All-Bran and Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The Kellogg's Company was founded in 1906; but before that when Dr. John Kellogg was operating his Battle Creek sanitarium he had already created one cereal: Granose Flakes in 1895. He started the Sanitas Food Company in order to sell Granose and less than ten years later it was pushed aside by the Kellogg's Company.

Many others have survived the decades like Rice Krispies (1928) Raisin Bran (1942) Frosted Flakes (1952) Special K (1955) and Apple Jacks (1965).

These days Kellogg's is promoting themselves as ""one of the original plant-based well-being companies"".

Kellogg's has also discontinued many of its cereals over the past 100+ years. I've selected 40 former Kellogg's cereals from throughout the 1900s into the 2000s with one going as far back as 1895. Take a look at the gallery below.

LOOK: 40 Discontinued & Special Edition Kellogg's Cereals",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vbmV3czI0L2JpLWFyY2hpdmUvY2FyZC1vbmxpbmUtcGF5bWVudHMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLTIwMjEtNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s how online and card payment options compare in South Africa,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

Accepting credit card and mobile payments is no longer as costly and complicated as it once was.

A slew of agile local and international solutions are challenging those offered by big banks.

Small business owners who want to accept card and online payments can expect to pay between 2.2% and 3.5% per transaction.

Some options also charge monthly fees and sliding scales for higher turnover.

Here's how leading options currently stack up.

Local card and online payment solutions - particularly for small businesses - have increased and improved significantly in recent years. The days of small businesses relying on big banks and pricey card machines are now largely gone - and in their place are agile startups with apps hardware and gateways that offer fairly competitive rates.

Aside from the direct offerings from big banks businesses looking to accept credit card payments - either via websites or in-person - now have several options. These are thanks to a selection of startups selling cheap and sleek card machines those offering Quick Response (QR) solutions for in-person payments and online-only payment solutions.

These businesses make a lot of their money directly through fees and commissions charged to business owners - usually in the region of 3% depending on turnover. But many also generate revenue from payment analytics. Businesses that want to learn more about their customers' spending habits can also tap into these features - and modern analytics software often offered for free with payment processing packages can help shape business strategies.

Some payment gateways also offer add-ons like shopping carts of varying quality that can also help close sales.

For these reasons cheapest isn't necessarily best particularly for growing businesses and it's worth digging into each company's feature set and tailored offerings to find out if there's a solution that's particularly relevant to your business.

Here's how several of the leading players excluding options directly from the big banks stack up:

SnapScan

SnapScan was one of the forerunners in the QR payment revolution in South Africa and in some regions it's still the most ubiquitous payment method of its kind.

It's a common in-person payment solution for small businesses like market stalls and coffee shops thanks in part to integrated features like automatic tip calculation and no need for card processing hardware.

In recent years SnapScan has also made moves into online payments with the ability to process online directly without the need to scan a code - though customers will have had to upload their payment details to the SnapScan app to participate.

Standard Bank bought a majority stake in the company in 2016.

Number of merchants: 60000

Monthly fee: None

Standard commission: 3% (excluding VAT). Decreases to a minimum of 2.6% depending on SnapScan turnover.

Zapper

Zapper is another scan-to-pay option that started with a primary focus on app-based QR code processing. It's expanded to include online payments and has a presence in multiple countries.

Like SnapScan it gained initial popularity among small businesses that could accept card-based payments without the need for expensive hardware.

Zapper has partnered with Mastercard's digital wallet MasterPass which drastically increased the app's reach - it's now accepted at over 70000 Masterpass-enabled merchants.

Number of merchants: Unclear

Monthly fee: Free / R199

Standard commission: 2.9% (excluding VAT) on free account / 2.2% excluding VAT on paid account

Yoco

Yoco started as a way for small businesses in South Africa to accept physical card payments. It was founded on the principle that small businesses like restaurants coffee shops and market stall owners shouldn't have to invest in expensive hardware and exclusive agreements with big banks. It has since expanded into accepting online payments.

Yoco currently sells its entry-level card processing machine for a flat rate of R299 and a more advanced system for R999 both of which accept payments from most leading banks.

Number of merchants: 130000

Monthly fee: None

Standard commission (card machines): 2.95% (excluding VAT). Decreases to a minimum of 2.6% (excluding VAT) depending on turnover - with custom rates for amounts higher than R100000 per month.

DeCicco

Correspondent/Taunton Daily Gazette

BERKLEY — Three Berkley natives are proof that the drive for great accomplishments can't be confined by small town roots.

The emergency room at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston currently includes Laura Burke as an attending doctor who completed her residency there a decade ago and her brother Ethan Burke who started as a doctor in residency that is to say in training there two weeks ago.

Fellow Berkley native William Fyfe is just graduating from the third-year as a doctor in residency in the same department.

Laura Burke said when Fyfe was starting his residency she didn't know that he too was a Berkley native until seeing his biography on the hospital residency website.

Then she learned Fyfe has had some of the same teachers as she and her brother had when students in the Berkley school system.

No wonder all three cite similar influences inspiring them to be where they are today.

Laura Burke 41 said her family was the first influence leading her and her brother to medical careers.

Their parents were school teachers who decided to start an insurance company selling life home and auto insurance from their home and they encouraged them to get a good education. Their older sister Jacqueline Egan became a physician.

Influencing them in another way their younger sister Mary had an intellectual disability Angelman syndrome.

""It got us both interested in a health care career after accompanying her medical appointments and seeing her struggles "" Laura Burke said.

""And our parents were really supportive. They taught us we could go for it with whatever we wanted to do with our lives. And they emphasized that we should get a strong education.""

Laura said she knew at a young age that she wanted a medical career. Then when her sister became a doctor at Morton Hospital in Taunton Laura shadowed her. She said that's when she became even surer of what career she wanted.

Ethan Burke 39 did not follow a medical career path at first. He became a school teacher.

""Then I got to see Jackie and Laura and their progress in their careers"" he said. ""It was always in the back of my mind. Then I shadowed Laura. And that gave me the reason to go for it.""

""I finally got to see the day to day of the work. I saw the doctors and different specialists coming together to create a plan for a person's health care combining their talents. That confirmed what I wanted to do. That's what fueled my decision. I was mostly teaching then. At age 34 I was probably the oldest in my class. But it's what I wanted to do.""

Ethan added his experience in an emergency room residency position has been far more encouraging than discouraging.

""It's very encouraging"" he said ""It's been hands-on experience. This is what I've been working on this entire time. It's a lot of work. But it's work I've been working toward for a long time. I'm very happy and grateful to be here.""

All three Berkley doctors attended and graduated from the Berkley Public Schools Somerset High School and the UMass Medical School in Worcester.

Laura and Ethan however both say the hands-on real world experience they've received at Beth Israel has been their most valuable education especially under the difficult emergency room conditions they had to cope with during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""If I hadn't seen with my own eyes I wouldn't have known I wouldn't have had the knowledge I have today"" Ethan said.

Growing up in Berkley they said they also both had multiple excellent inspirational elementary and middle school teachers guiding them to where they are today.

Middle school science teacher Henry Botelho is the one that stands out in Laura's mind.

""He was so passionate about teaching"" she said. ""His enthusiasm about science and being a teacher stood out. He had great control of his classes and you learned so much from him. We were motivated by the passion he had.""

William Fyfe 34 describes a similar origin story.

He lived in Berkley from birth until age 18 when he left for college. He said his parents were probably his biggest inspiration. They are both career nurses and their stories inspired his initial interest in the medical field.

As far as inspirational Berkley teachers are concerned he said two names immediately come to mind.

Jennifer Francisco who is now the Berkley Community School principal was his fourth grade teacher.

""She was someone who was clearly passionate about her profession"" Fyfe said. ""She was always engaged and made us feel like she was excited to be there with us each day. I think when someone brings that kind of enthusiasm and devotion to their work it rubs off.""

The second is a name he shares with Laura and Ethan: His seventh and eighth grade science teacher Henry Botelho.

""When I've run across other Berkley school alumni over the years his is always the first name that comes up"" Fyfe said. ""His class was perpetually challenging but never monotonous. His ability to relate to his students challenge them and engage them was truly unparalleled in my experience.""

Fyfe graduated from Somerset High School in 2009 and attended the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London Connecticut for his undergraduate degree. He received a bachelor's of science in government in 2009 and paid back his academy time with five years of Coast Guard service two on a ship out of Seattle and three at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington DC.

While in DC he attended classes at the University of Maryland to complete medical school prerequisites before transferring to medical school at the University of Massachusetts Worcester where he graduated in 2018.

Soon it will be time for Fyfe to move on from his Berkley ties while working at Beth Israel. He's accepted a position as a physician in the emergency department of Falmouth Hospital starting in July.

But he'll always remember the training he received at Beth Israel.

""Residency can be a stressful and challenging time and you depend on the people around you from faculty fellow residents nurses and certainly your family and friends to get you through"" he said.

""I think the most important lesson I've taken away from my training is to practice humility. There are so many talented people throughout all walks of health care. Utilizing their knowledge and skills to augment your own will always result in better outcomes for the patients and a much more fulfilling and enjoyable career.""

He'll also always remember that his time as a resident included the year of COVID because he met his wife Vanessa a nurse while in residency and they got married in the middle of COVID this last November.

""Both she and her daughter Norah have enriched my life in ways I never could have anticipated. We are expecting our first child together in October"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS9uYW1lL3RvbnlhLWt1Yy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjI4MDI0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tonya Kuc Obituary (1972 - 2021) - St. Augustine FL - St. Augustine Record,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/staugustine/name/tonya-kuc-obituary?id=12280245 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS9uYW1lL3RvbnlhLWt1Yy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjI4MDI0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcHJhZGlvLm9yZy9uZXdzL25wci9zdG9yeT9zdG9yeWlkPTEwMTI2MDA2NjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.P.

As the countdown to the rearranged Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games edges ever closer we focus on the English athletes who will be travelling to Japan.

Alicia Wilson has credited her coaches and ‘support system’ for making her childhood dream of becoming an Olympian a reality.

“I’m incredibly excited” said the 21-year-old who is set to make her Olympic debut in Tokyo. “I think today [kitting out] just made it a lot more real and made me a bit overwhelmed.

“This is my dream come true so I really am buzzing”.

Wilson began her swimming journey at Leatherhead Swimming Club before making the move to Guilford City Swimming Club where she would remain for the next 10 years.

“It has definitely been a fun journey. I’ve been so lucky with the coaches there and to have that club nurture me. That enabled me to platform into the junior sphere and medal at nationals go to Junior Europeans – all those little meets.”

Date of Birth: 05/03/2000

05/03/2000 Club: University of California Berkley/Guildford City SC

University of California Berkley/Guildford City SC Olympic Record: Making Olympic debut at Tokyo Games.

The now University of California Berkley-based swimmer has thanked her home coaches at Guildford who saw her through her formative years as a young athlete and her current coach Teri McKeever for making her into an Olympian.

She said: “Now I’m training in America at the University of California Berkley and that is another dream come true as well.

“I am so thankful to Guilford for getting me there so thankful now to Teri now in California for making me into an Olympian.

“I’m so thankful for Guilford. I come back every year to do trials with them so I’m so thankful that I can still have that support system back in the UK and have that family that has become so close to me over the past 10 years.

“I rely on them even when I’m in California and ring them all the time and to have that friendship and network there has been invaluable to me.

“At trials this year I couldn’t have performed how I did without my club without the help of Lee Lewis Richard and all of the coaches.”

‘Inspired my journey’

Before becoming a club swimmer Wilson took part in school swimming which was her first introduction to the sport.

She explained: “Richard Garfield – who was the head of Guilford and still is – actually encouraged my older sister to get to a club and I kind of joined for the fun and that’s where our swimming journey started.

“It just took one school coach to say ‘I think you really should go into a club’ and that opened up so many more opportunities.”

She continued speaking about her fondest memory as a junior swimmer: “I think my best memory was when I was 12 years old and making my first nationals.

“It was London 2012 so gearing up towards my nationals felt so much more important than it actually was because you had all those Olympians. That’s definitely something that has inspired my journey now and it’s something that I’ve kept very close to my heart.”

Now she is set to become an Olympian herself Wilson has a definite plan heading into the Games – one that she hopes will see her perform at her best.

“Now that I’ve qualified I definitely don’t want to just go and say ‘I’ve been’” she said. “I want to perform as well as I can and get best times and be able to make a final and fortify those other dreams that I’ve had on top of being an Olympian.”

Her advice for any youngsters who are beginning their swimming journey is: “Enjoy the journey because it goes by so quickly!

“I wish that I celebrated the smaller wins so much more and just absorb being around your teammates.

“We’re all very lucky to have these clubs here and I wish that I had absorbed that a little bit more and just celebrated getting a national medal and all those things so much more before they were gone 10 years later down the line.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbWVyc2V0bGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3NvbWVyc2V0LW5ld3Mvc29tZXJzZXQtc2Nob29scy1uYW1lZC1vdXRzdGFuZGluZy1vZnN0ZWQtNTU4ODk4ONIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbWVyc2V0bGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3NvbWVyc2V0LW5ld3Mvc29tZXJzZXQtc2Nob29scy1uYW1lZC1vdXRzdGFuZGluZy1vZnN0ZWQtNTU4ODk4OC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Somerset schools named ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted,"We have more newsletters

Ofsted has announced that their full programme of graded school inspections will resume this autumn.

The government department which is responsible for inspecting schools and other social care services for children restarted their monitoring inspections in May having suspended activity during the coronavirus pandemic.

The monitoring inspections focused on schools graded ‘inadequate’ and ‘requires improvement’ at their last two full inspections.

A spokesperson for Ofsted said: “We will continue to prioritise inspections of all schools where significant concerns are raised when necessary.”

Schools which receive an ‘outstanding’ rating are exempt from regular Ofsted inspections but they can also request an inspection.

An Outstanding school rating means they provide “the highest quality education and care for their children”.

Los Angeles San Francisco and Sacramento are among the cities with the most organized retail crime in the country according to the California Retailer's Association. As a result stores have been closing early or permanently shuttering.

Target stores in San Francisco are now closing early moving from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a Financial District store closing as early as 5p.m. on Saturday according to hours listed on its website. Most stores open between 7 and 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.

Target told KPIX5 the decision to adjust its store hours in San Francisco was related to theft with a spokesperson confirming: ""For more than a month we’ve been experiencing a significant and alarming rise in theft and security incidents at our San Francisco stores similar to reports from other retailers in the area.

""Target is engaging local law enforcement elected officials and community partners to address our concerns. With the safety of our guests team members and communities as our top priority we've temporarily reduced our operating hours in six San Francisco stores.""

CVS AND WALGREENS WERE REELING. NOW THEY'RE RIDING A COVID-19 WAVE

Operators in the grocery and retail industries have also raised concerns about harsher penalties for theft. A video surfaced from earlier this month showing a man stealing items in a San Francisco Walgreens and leaving the store on his bike with the goods as security guards and onlookers filmed the incident.

""This has been a problem going on for years. We have been diligently trying to find solutions to this including pending legislation to continue funding for the Organized Retail Task Force. We are trying to attack it from all different ways. Our priority is the safety of our employees and consumers. We can’t have our security guards going after this – they are not law enforcement"" CRA President and CEO Rachel Michelin said in a statement.

Associated Press

As shockwaves spread across the country from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol corporate America took a stand against the lies that powered the mob. Or so it seemed.

Dozens of big companies citing their commitment to democracy pledged to avoid donating money to the 147 lawmakers who objected to Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s victory on the false grounds that voting fraud stole the election from then-President Donald Trump.

It was a striking gesture by some of the most familiar names in business but as it turns out it was largely an empty one.

Six months later many of those companies have resumed funneling cash to political action committees that benefit the election efforts of lawmakers whether they objected to the election certification or not. When it comes to seeking political influence through corporate giving business as usual is back if it ever left.

Walmart Pfizer Intel General Electric and AT&T are among companies that announced their pledges on behalf of democracy in the days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent bid to disrupt the transfer of power.

The companies contend that donating directly to a candidate is not the same as giving to a PAC that supports them. Given America’s porous campaign finance laws that’s a distinction without a difference to campaign finance experts.

The companies’ argument also glosses over the fact that in large measure they did their giving through PACs before their pledge rather than to individuals so in many cases nothing changed.

“Pledging not to give to a certain person doesn’t mean that much when there are so many other ways that corporate money reaches elected officials” said Daniel Weiner a former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. “These pledges are largely symbolic.”

Walmart’s moral stand lasted three months. In January the retail giant said it would suspend all donations to the 147 lawmakers who objected to the election results. But in April the company gave $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee the party organization that supports House Republicans in elections.

Two-thirds of those House members voted against certifying Biden’s win.

Walmart gave an additional $30000 to the House committee’s counterpart for Senate Republicans the National Republican Senatorial Committee. That group is led by an objector to the election’s certification Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who stands to benefit from the contribution along with seven other GOP senators who also sought to overturn the will of voters. Messages left with both committees by The Associated Press were not returned.

In January after the attack General Electric said it would “halt donations to lawmakers who voted against certification” because “we believe it is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company’s values and commitment to democracy.” But that’s not exactly what happened.

In April General Electric gave $15000 each to the House and Senate GOP election groups.

Likewise Pfizer pledged to suspend contributions to Republican objectors for six months. But after only three months it gave $20000 to the GOP’s Senate group. Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo told the AP that the company drew a distinction between giving money to individual lawmakers and to groups created to help those same lawmakers. “We just don’t think it is an accurate connection” she said.

Yet she said Pfizer had no commitment from the Senate election committee that the company’s donation would not be used to benefit the eight senators who voted against certification.

AT&T also pledged not to give money to lawmakers who objected but the company sent $5000 in February to the House Conservatives Fund. Company spokeswoman Margaret Boles said AT&T received assurances the money would not flow to lawmakers who objected to election results though the PAC is led by a lawmaker who did.

Campaign finance experts say there’s no way to know whether the money given to Republican PACs will end up directly in the campaign accounts of incumbents who objected to the election results. These Republican committees like the ones for Democrats help incumbents in a variety of ways whether through direct contributions or technical and professional help with voter data advertising and get-out-the-vote assistance.

Moreover corporate donations to the party committees do not include so-called dark money contributions given to groups that are not required to disclose details publicly. Dark money is a favored vehicle for corporate giving.

“It’s completely frustrating from an accountability point of view” Ciara Torres-Spelliscy a Stetson University Law School professor who studies corporate campaign finance.

Many of the lawmakers who objected to the certification leaned heavily on the GOP House and Senate election committees in the past and can be expected to want substantial help from them again.

For the 2020 election the NRCC passed along contributions to 39 Republican lawmakers who later objected to the election result compared with 11 who did not. Altogether the objectors of Jan. 6 got five times more money in total last year than did those who later voted to certify the states’ electoral tallies.

Pfizer GE Walmart and other companies contacted by the AP said their criticism of lawmakers who objected to the election results stands.

For other companies the pledges may just be a cynical attempt to look good in the eyes of the public. Few of the companies that made pledges tended to give big donations to individual lawmakers anyway preferring the big party PACs or dark money groups.

Weiner said that if companies were serious about using their clout to support democracy they would fund efforts to defeat Republican measures that would make it harder to vote in many states.

“I don’t think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection” Weiner said. “They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot reasons all related to their bottom line.”

Some companies did follow through on their pledges. Hallmark for instance said it would not donate to objectors — and the record to date shows no PAC donations by that company this year as well as no direct giving to the 147 objectors.

Hallmark also asked two objectors Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return direct contributions it made to them before the insurrection. Campaign finance records do not yet show those refunds. Messages seeking comment from the two senators were not returned.

Other companies said they would halt campaign contributions following Jan. 6 to give them time to reassess their campaign finance strategy. That list includes Charles Schwab Citigroup Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft Heinz.

The money given to Republican groups by companies that pledged not to support objectors is small compared with the huge amounts of cash given overall. Walmart’s $60000 contribution to the GOP Senate and House committees is just a fraction of the company’s overall political spending on both parties which last year topped $5 million.

Companies often give money to Democrats and Republicans alike as they try to cultivate good relations with whichever party is in power. The companies behind the pledges are no exception.

Jan. 6 seemed to shake up that calibration. The violent images from the Capitol were so visceral the assault at the core of American democracy so extraordinary and the falsehoods behind the attack so audacious that some loyal Republicans abandoned their president and denounced the objectors in their ranks.

If the objectors got their way Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that fraught night “our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

For a time all but the 147 seemed on the side of the angels and corporations jostled to get on board with their pro-democracy pledges. But the devil was in the details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9mb3VydGgtanVseS1vcGVuaW5nLWNsb3NpbmctdGltZXMtdGFyZ2V0LXdhbG1hcnQtY29zdGNvLTE2MDYzNTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Stores Open on July 5th?

Officers with the Natchez Police Department Adams County Sheriffs Office and Mississippi Highway Patrol responded to a shooting at Walmart Saturday night.

One woman was shot multiple times and taken to the hospital and two officers sustained injuries in the detention of a suspect. Natchez Police Chief Joseph Daughtry thanked the ACSO and MHP for their help.

Daughtry said allegedly an altercation took place between two individuals in the self-checkout line over the machine not giving 22 cents in change back. A gentleman in line offered to give the other man change but the man got irate and started cursing.

In the parking lot the gentleman went to get a quarter from his car to give it to the man he said. Then the altercation escalated into a shooting injuring a woman who was with one of the men. Two officers were injured while bringing a suspect into custody. An officer was treated on scene and the other officer was taken to the hospital with a non-life-threatening injury.

The man kicked several officers and he is being charged with aggravated assault as well as other charges Daughtry said.

“On a holiday weekend for individuals to get that irate over change” Daughtry said “We have families seniors getting last-minute items for a holiday. We have to come up with better solutions for situations.”

TAMPA Fla. — A new study by a team at the University of South Florida has shown that years of looking down to text on smartphones may be nullifying the damage caused by years of staring straight up while playing GameCube demos at Walmart for millennials.

“We’ve controlled for several variables in order to isolate potential confounding factors” said lead researcher Dr. Melvin Owens. “It’s clear that neck strength is directly correlated with how many hours you spent playing The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction at a 75 degree angle.”

Smartphone neck also known as “text neck” or “iHunch” affects over 600000000 young people worldwide a number that is growing every year. Owens hopes that their research may lead to new and exciting treatments.

“Our next project will examine the potential restorative effects of these kiosks” Owens continued. “Now that we know they can prevent the issue we suspect they can cure it retroactively. Emphasis on the retro! In a few years I expect every physical therapist will have an assortment of therapy GameCubes available!”

The new study will also include cohorts testing PS2 and Xbox kiosks to determine if any particular demo kiosk is most effective at forcing a gamer to crane their neck for an extended period of time.

“I was actually incapable of looking down until about 2010 when the iPhone 4 came out” said one participant in the original study. “When I was a kid my mom would abandon me for hours and hours in the electronics section. My only friends were Captain Olimar and Billy Hatcher. I almost died once because I couldn’t look both ways before crossing the street. Social media cured me. Scrolling saved my life.”

At press time several medical insurance companies confirmed that they do not and will not ever pay for a “therapy GameCube.”"

Last year “Must Do Disney” was unceremoniously removed from resort television across Walt Disney World. It was then quietly relocated to channel 73 under “Must Do Disney Sp” which previously showed the Spanish dubbed version of the show.

Now the original channel and 73 are showing an entirely new program. For a first-look at the new program check out our video:

“Must Do Disney” debuted in 2005 and was a staple on Walt Disney World Resort televisions for over 15 years. The show famously took viewers on a journey across “four theme parks two water parks and Disney Springs to bring you the must-do Disney attractions and entertainment at Walt Disney World that you well must do.”

The program was hosted by Stacey Aswad who gained a cult following from loyal Disney fans who loved to watch her show while visiting the Walt Disney World Resort.

In May 2021 Stacey took to her personal Instagram account to announce the show’s end and her gratitude for the support she received from fans. Notably “I wish we would be making more memories together but COVID changed those plans.”

Though Tinker Bell had been flying over Disneyland since 1961 our favorite pixie didn’t make her first flight over Magic Kingdom until 1985 drawing in more than 60000 guests for her inaugural flight. For more than 30 years she has been dazzling guests each night.

[metaslider id=”50088″]

Fantasy in the Sky

When Magic Kingdom opened in 1971 the fireworks show that was displayed for guests nightly at Disneyland was replicated for Walt Disney World.

Fantasy in the Sky was brought over to Walt Disney World (which you may remember as the show that predated both Wishes and Happily Ever After) but as guests quickly noticed one notable part of the performance was missing: Tinker Bell.

In Disneyland Tinker Bell had been kicking off evening showings of Fantasy in the Sky since 1961 where she flew across the park passing Sleeping Beauty Castle from atop the Matterhorn.

At Walt Disney World however Fantasy in the Sky opened to positive guest reviews yet Cast Members still received more than the occasional question of where Tinker Bell was. In 1985 Imagineers revamped Fantasy in the Sky to include Tinker Bell and she has flown most every night since.

All It Takes Is a Wish

Disney Parks are known around the world for their commitment to guest service and part of this philosophy includes taking in guest feedback. In the years following Magic Kingdom’s opening Disney became aware of guests hoping to see Tinker Bell fly across the hub by Cinderella Castle since they knew it took place in Disneyland.

The event was replicated before a special 4th of July version of the fireworks for the first time in 1985 to an overwhelmingly positive response from the 60000+ guests who were in the park.

Disney had originally intended to keep Tinker Bell’s flight as a special event that would take place on certain occasions at Walt Disney World but guests loved it so much it ended up sticking around.

Since July of 1985 Tinker Bell has flown nearly every night from atop Cinderella Castle to a rooftop in Tomorrowland. Inclement weather can keep Tinker Bell’s flight from taking place but with that one exception guests today can expect the flight to be a nightly occurrence while visiting the park.

Just a Little Bit of Pixie Dust

It takes more than pixie dust to get Tinker Bell to soar from Cinderella Castle to Tomorrowland. It requires a Cast Member who has just the right weight and frame—small enough to be a pixie but heavy enough to make it down the zipline.

Her role in the show is also not for the faint of heart. Cinderella Castle stands at 189 feet tall and Tinker Bell’s flight begins from the tallest point.

The space inside the spire from which Tink starts her flight is incredibly small. So small that only Tink and one other Cast Member can fit inside. Not only is her role not for those afraid of heights but it’s also not for those with fears of enclosed spaces. (We’d hazard a guess that Tinker Bell’s flight is more intense than most Disney attractions.)

Once she is in flight Tinker Bell moves at a rate of about 25 to 30 miles per hour meaning she can usually make it to her landing pad in Tomorrowland in just about 30 seconds.

Cast Members playing Tinker Bell are rumored to be paid well by the Mouse. While their pay has not been confirmed entertainment Cast Members in certain roles that are considered stunt performers receive a premium for their work. On top of this we’ve heard that Tinker Bell also receives hazard pay and 8 hours’ worth of compensation despite her flight being so quick.

One Cast Member portraying Tinker Bell did not retire until she was 72 so whether it’s the pay the adrenaline rush or simply the ability to create magic for guests from all over the world Tinker Bell seems to love what she does.

Wishes and Happily Ever After

The fireworks may have changed since 1971 but Tinker Bell’s flight has remained consistent.

Fantasy in the Sky came to a close and was replaced by Wishes in 2003 at which point Tinker Bell continued her flight at the beginning of the fireworks as a sort of introduction of what was to come.

When Happily Ever After debuted in 2017 Tinker Bell’s flight was moved toward the end of the show where it is perfectly timed with the quote from Peter Pan “You can fly.”

The finale follows Tinker Bell’s flight in the current Magic Kingdom fireworks so even more so than in previous shows her flight kicks off the climax of the performance and builds even more anticipation for guests of what’s to come.

Did you know? Magic Kingdom will debut a new nighttime spectacular called Disney Enchantment on October 1st to commemorate its 50th anniversary!

What’s more in Happily Ever After Tinker Bell really does sprinkle pixie dust over the Magic Kingdom. It may be easy to miss with all of the fireworks lasers and projections but during her flight pixie dust really does fall over the trees around the Castle and the hub.

If you don’t notice the pixie dust glittering atop the park’s trees during Happily Ever After stick around for a few minutes after the show and you should be able to see it.

Tinker Bell’s flight has been one of the most memorable experiences for Disney guests since it began in 1985. There is truly nothing like capping off a full day in the Magic Kingdom with a fireworks show complete with a classic flight by one of Disney’s most iconic characters.

Don’t miss Tinker Bell next time you’re in the Magic Kingdom. While Fantasyland offers a nice last-minute view of the fireworks plan to be in front of Cinderella Castle for the best possible view of Tinker Bell’s flight.

And although many restaurants at Disney World serve steak in some form or fashion some do it way better than others.

So we’re looking at what you’ve said in the AllEars Reviews about many of these restaurants that serve steak. And we’re ranking those restaurants according to what you told us!

SCORE: 5

“We ate here in 2019. Overpriced and not up to the quality level of a true high-end steak house. The preparation of their steaks was spot on but the meat was clearly not of the highest quality. They claim to use prime beef but frankly the meat we were served should have been graded choice at best. Sides are good. Service is hard to rate because the restaurant is so oppressively loud we weren’t able to hear our server.”

“The prices are WAYYYYY too much for what you get. When you pay $50 for an 8 oz steak you should get at least a potato and vegetables or a salad. My husband got sick immediately after eating.”

“My husband and I ate at STK on a Tuesday evening. It was loud and expensive even for Disney prices. The steak was just okay and the waitstaff was slow to respond to requests…”

SCORE: 7.3

“Our absolute must do every trip to Disney World. Amazing steak risotto beer cheese soup and bread. Nice to get indoors and have a fancy meal for birthdays and anniversaries while on vacation.”

“Food was very enjoyable. The menu was limited due to the pandemic but we were able to find things on the menu that tasted great. The filet mignon and ribeye were very good. Service wasn’t the best and they all seemed very stuck-up. The guests also acted the same way which was uncomfortable. But our dinner and dessert were awesome.”

“Beautiful atmosphere and even better food. We were celebrating a milestone birthday on our visit and this dinner made it all the more special. The breadbasket and cheese soup are delicious but the steak is the reason to come back again next time we are visiting WDW.”

SCORE: 7.47

“I’ve been here a good deal and have always had a positive experience. The cast members here are friendly the bread they bring before the meal is good and the steak and Mac and cheese is magic. This is also the only restaurant on property that has given me a little keepsake as a way of thank you for returning to the restaurant which always makes you feel special.”

“The food was great. My husband had the steak and said it was the best he had ever eaten.”

“Steak with Mac and cheese is amazing!”

SCORE: 7.47

“The meal here was pretty good overall although the desserts were a bit on the too sweet side for me personally. The appetizer FO Soup was delicious that melty cheese was to die for! The steak overall was delicious- small but to be expected because it’s a filet ordered medium rare and cooked to perfection. The steak came with mashed potatoes and for what you pay for there wasn’t a whole lot of them-like a tiny scoop on mine and my boyfriends plate. The meal also came with yummy bread and butter which I had no idea about and they shaped the butter like Mickey Mouse! Because of COVID couldn’t take pictures with the best and barely came out for more than a minute so that was super disappointing. This was more of a one and done dinner option for us maybe will try the regular quick service lunch menu next time when that’s back.”

“So disappointed with dinner at Be our Guest. I have never felt more ripped off than when I left this place. This is a very pricey location and they dont deliver. The food is average at best. My steak was so salty I could hardly eat it. They charge you $40 for a kids meal that consist of below average mac and cheese and hard chicken fingers. The Beast comes through in this dark restaurant so fast you barely can see him. Our server was nice but not efficient. We waited a very long time for every portion (drinks to dessert). We almost walked out without dessert because we waited almost 30 minutes for it. We the server finally came she forgot the coffee we ordered. Ten minutes later after we finished dessert the coffee arrived… COLD. She gave us to go cups of coffee which did is no good as you cant walk and drink in the park during Covid. We had already been in the restaurant much longer than expected due to the extremely slow service. With two kids we were ready to head back to the resort. This was my third time at Be our Guest. The first two times were breakfast and lunch. Im here to tell you breakfast and dinner are a complete RIP Off. If you want to experience this location for the Beast castle do lunch.”

“We went for my birthday dinner and everything was fantastic. My steak was cooked perfectly and everything else was delicious as well. The desserts were so cute and the grey stuff is to die for. Since our waitress knew it was my birthday she brought out a little extra birthday magic for me which made it even more special. Can’t wait to go back.”

SCORE: 7.72

“We recently got back from my kiddos first Disney trip! We did alot of character meals and really enjoyed most of them. CRT was a pretty great experience! The service was the best we had in all of Disney! We got a table by the window overlooking the carousel. This dinner was on our last day of the trip. We spent the dinner talking about the trip and being super excited to see cinderella. My husband and I both got the meat and cheese to start it was good but we had better throughout our trip. I had the beef loin as well as my husband. He had the steak at BOG and said that was better. I thought the steak was ok not my favorite. My husband got the cheesecake dessert it was very good. I really enjoyed the chocolate dessert. My daughter loves to decorate her own cupcake such a nice touch. We also got some pixie dust and got a free cupcake for my birthday here. My 2 year old got to eat the cupcake which kept him from wanting his sister’s dessert. This was the perfect ending to our trip.”

“I got the steak and I loved the food so much as well at the dessert (the clock strikes 12 is delicious)!”

“We went there without kids so that was our first mistake. The characters weren’t important to us and they all got sad faces when we said we really didn’t need our pictures with them. The food was okay. I had scallops for an appetizer and it came with one not very big scallop. I had steak and shrimp for the entree and ended up with about 5 spoonfuls of mashed potatoes a piece of steak that I could have hidden in the palm of my hand along with 2 average shrimps. The cheesecake and strawberry desert consisted of cheesecake and half of a strawberry.”

SCORE: 8.03

“My husband and I went here for our fancy dinner to celebrate our marriage. the view is amazing tho we sat farther into the restaurant which is still good but if you want a window view make sure you let them know beforehand. the pork chops are great as well as the steak and lobster combo. the stand out of our dinner was the pepperoni pizza its amazing. we also go 2 free glasses of champagne for celebrating getting married.”

“We all ordered the Cowboy Cut 19oz ribeye steak. We have different tastes in how well the meat is done but they all came out perfect. You could cut the steak with a fork. It was so juicy and seasoned just right. It was served with honey saffron-glazed carrots and aged Gouda macaroni and cheese. Wow the mac n cheese was so good! There was so much food only one of our group was able to finish the whole steak. “

“This was our first time dining here and we cannot wait to return. We were so lucky to be seated at the window although it looked like you would have a great view no matter where you sat. I am still dreaming about the steak I had and everyone else loved their food. Watching the fireworks while enjoying your dessert was such an awesome and unique experience with the music being piped in. It was very pricey but well worth the splurge for the very unique and memorable experience. Would love to do it again someday.”

SCORE: 8.12

“THE FOOD WAS SOOOOOO GOOD. Mouthwatering. Literally after every bite you had to moan a little. My mom and I had the shrimp cocktail for an app and then the filet mignon and grilled shrimp. The steak melted in your mouth. Fantastic.”

“My husband and I brought our 2 kids (9 & 7) here in August and we all ordered plant-based meals. My husband and I LOVED our plant based salisbury steak meals but the kids were not into the vegetarian pho (I tried it and it wasn’t great). Our lovely server also gave me free grapefruit cake because I was celebrating my nursing school graduation.”

“It was really fun to be in such a “fancy” place while in the middle of the park. I did feel underdressed but that obviously isn’t an issue because they know where they are and you aren’t judged for it. I got the steak when we went here and it was deeeelicious but very small. I know that is my typical American palate talking but for a 2 dining credit per person meal I was left wanting more. My husband got the pork chop and he really enjoyed it too. Same complaint on size though. He did try the grapefruit cake. Said it was okay.”

SCORE: 8.25

“This restaurant is at a moderate resort you say!? The food was so so so good. My wife and I dream about the steaks we’ve had there (LOL). The views of WDW are incredible. The interior design is beautiful!! We were celebrating my wife’s birthday here the waitress gave us a magical moment!”

“The attention our waiter Brian gave us was beyond amazing. The Ribeye steak was something my wife and I are still talking about. The Deserts are very good also. The best part is that we did not feel rushed we took our time enjoying our meal and drinks. The wait for our table was not long.”

“My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with a stay in the Grande Destino Tower at Coronado Springs Resort. We dined at the new Toledo’s on the top of the tower. The atmosphere was wonderful & we had a table with a window view of Hollywood Studios. We had the 28oz bone-in Ribeye for two which came with our choice of two sides. It was cooked to perfection! The best steak we’ve had at any restaurant on Disney property including the steakhouses! The service was great as well. After dinner the manager offered us a tour of the hotel’s club level lounge. It made me wish we’d spent the extra money to have access to the lounge…. there’s always next time!”

SCORE: 8.31

“The service was lovely and overall the food tasted very good. I do not feel the restaurant lived up to my expectations but I usually dine at the Yachtsman Steakhouse or Flying Fish. I enjoyed the Tuna Tartare but the mustard flavor was very powerful. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was very good and nicely presented. My son said his Duck Breast was just okay and my husband’s filet was very good but not worth the cost. Desserts were very attractive I can’t recall what they were…and that’s disappointing as we ate there last week.”

“The meal started with a small treat from the chef a cheese puff that was delicious. I had hot decaf tea with my meal and we had the bottled Evian water – both top shelf. Once we ordered the waiter called over the bread service waitress. There were several breads we could try – a baguette a multigrain roll mushroom rolls and many other selections. Every one we tried was delicious. I ordered the salad with pears and pecans that was absolutely phenomenal. I had asked for it without cheese and the French mustard dressing was soooooooo good. The pears were crisp and sweet – very much like a dessert. For entree I had the tenderloin with mushroom top – it is so hard to get a great well done steak but this was perfect! The entree came with a cappuccino mashed potatoes – which was a layer of mashed potatoes topped with a truffle foam – um! yum! For dessert I had to have the meringue with various creams and raspberry sorbet – OMG – so good! Arguably the BEST dessert on WDW property. “

“Easily the best meal we had on our entire trip. Though the food and drinks are expensive they are totally worth it. My wife and I enjoyed the entire scope of our meal and cannot recommend it enough to friends and family. Any trip to Disney without dinner here is wasteful.”

SCORE: 8.34

“2nd time eating here. Was fantastic food again! We had the prime rib the steak and the all you can eat platter. My son didn’t like some of the meat on the all you can eat platter as well as some of the other meat but he still had plenty to eat that was great. Had the crayfish bisque. Was very good but literally 2 pieces of crayfish in it! Chocolate creme brule dessert was one of the best we had all week! Good service very attentive. Interesting that this was the only place we ate of all the 8 days we were there that didn’t tell us happy birthday or happy anniversary (we both had bdays and our anniv that week and both had 2 buttons on). Not a big deal as we had tons of celebrations the whole time we were there but I realized it after dinner.”

“I ate at Boatwright’s in April of 2010. We were staying at Port Orleans Riverside and in the middle of our trip we had such a brutally hot day (mid 90s) that we decided to leave the park and skip our reservation at Crystal Palace. We stopped at Boatwright’s and explained the situation and they were able to fit us (a group of 10) in after a wait of only 20-30 minutes. I ordered the Prime Rib and I have to say it was the best steak I ate during our 10 day trip- and I had steak 5 times. The steak was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth.. just delicious. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes. For dessert I had the crÃ¨me brulee- admittedly the first time I have ever had crÃ¨me brulee and it was extremely tasty. Others from our group got the Prime Rib the Boatwright’s Jambalaya and the Louisiana Lugger (Pork Chop) and we all enjoyed the food.”

“Ate here Sept. 30. The prime rib was delicious as well as the masked potatoes and asparagus. First time that we ate here and will definitely be back. We stayed at OKW and took boats to Downtown Disney they Port Orleans Riverside. The trip was worth it and had a nice relaxing boat ride.”

SCORE: 8.58

“Our first experience at The Wave was dinner on Jan 17 2017. I canâ€™t say enough about the food and the service. The crab and shrimp cake appetizer was delicious. Our fillets were done perfectly and the roasted veggies were wonderful. They staff were so friendly and surprised us with a plate of a chocolate Minnie and chocolate covered strawberries truffle hearts balloons and wine glasses with champagne for our 50th anniversary. We will make this a must do each time we visit Disney World.”

“I would go over 10 here if I could. In a week where we ate at a lot of high end places this was the best we had hands down. The service was top notch and the food was great. Steaks were cooked perfect sides were very good just blown away. I even made a comment to my wife that I felt this blew California Grill out of the water. The Wave is now on a regular rotation for restaurants for our visits.”

“Always on my meal list never disappoints. Fantastic knowledgeable servers nice variety of menu choices. Their crab cake appetizer is not as good as it used to be far from it actually – choose something else The pork chop was excellent the strip steak as well (I’ve also had the beef tenderloin in past visits – highly popular for a delicious reason). A bit of a hidden gem like most resort restaurants.”

SCORE: 8.76

“I love Teppan Edo! It has always been a go-to for me and my family. I like how each entree comes with a salad and soup as well as rice (all are very delicious). You can do entree combinations like steak and shrimp chicken and shrimp and chicken and steak as well as filet mignon and salmon. The desserts in my opinion are not appealing but I’m sure you’ll be full after the entrees! Also it is a hibachi-style restaurant with a fun and entertaining chef for the kids and adults alike. Overall this is an excellent restaurant in EPCOT!”

“We sampled the tempura and wafu ribs appetizers. The tempura was delicious and a great start to our meal. The wafu ribs didn’t look appetizing but they were actually fall off the bone tender and tasty! For our entrees my boyfriend ordered the steak and shrimp and I ordered the hotate (scallops). Along with your main entree you also receive a salad a side of white rice and noodles with vegetables. The meal also is served with yum yum sauce and ginger sauce. The scallops were a little over cooked for my liking but the portion was generous and the flavors spot on. Overall we both enjoyed our meals and would definitely come back. Another person at our table ordered the salmon and it looked delicious! For dessert we had the green tea ice cream and mango cake. Since I was celebrating my birthday they brought out the cake with a candle in it and also a chef’s hat to wear. Super cute!”

“This used to be a must-do every trip. but when they changed to the sukiyaki rice a couple of years ago we skipped it our last two trips. We decided to try it again after I heard they still had steamed rice – all you had to do was ask for it. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that they brought back the steamed rice as the standard! I had the steak and chicken and both were cooked perfectly. My mom had the scallops which she said were the best she’s ever had and my dad had the filet which he also enjoyed. The veggies were great as well. This has now been added back to our “every trip” list.”

SCORE: 8.88

“Romantic signature dining restaurant at Animal Kingdom Lodge. Hands down the best steak I’ve ever eaten in my life! Service was impeccable. Extensive wine list!”

“The filet with the mac and cheese was the best they also bring you a little spoon from the Chef with a taste of one of his favorites. It think this one was the wild boar it was good what ever it was. the desserts are unusual and fun to try. If we cant get a reservation we ask if there is room at the area where they make the flatbreads and salads (it is just the two of us). It is fun to watch them make the stuff and they talk to you while they make it.”

“Wow what an amazing experience. Our meal was at a very leisurely pace and so fantastic. We had the Taste of Africa which was delicious. My husband had the Filet Mignon and I had the seafood curry. Both were great. We were here for the wine and it didn’t disappoint. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Everything was above and beyond expectations and I would love to go here again.”

SCORE: 8.95

“My wife and I had our final day “Disney dinner” at the Yachtsman in October of 2019. We stayed at the Yacht club so it was really easy to get there. We liked the ambiance and their main dining hall is very beautiful. Its about as classic steakhouse fare as you can think of but VERY well prepared. My wife got a seafood cioppino and I got a ribeye. Our server Bill was incredibly well informed and was able to pair our wine with our meals perfectly. He made many suggestions and brought us a complimentary wine that worked well with our dessert. He was an absolute blast ask for him! Everything we got at the Yachtsman was cooked to perfection seasoned well looked like a knockout and we were both satisfied beyond explanation. While its not a black tie level restaurant we were glad we dressed up a little prior to arriving because the ambiance definitely calls for it. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a high-end classic steakhouse meal!”

“The best steak I have ever eaten in my life! The service was fabulous as well! This will be on mu dining list every time I visit. The Cesar salad was amazing as well as the creme brulee. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!”

“My wife and I celebrated our 40th Anniversary at the Yachtsman and it was wonderful. They provided us with our personalized menu which said Happy Anniversary. The food was wonderful.

We started with the Lobster Bisque and then had the 32oz Porterhouse for two. It was the best steak I have eaten at Walt Disney World. For sides we had the Creamed Spinach Sauteed Mushrooms and The Summer Vegetable Fricassee. They were all good.”

AT&T has sold the downtown Atlanta complex that houses CNN offices and studios to a Florida company.

CP Group announced Thursday that is has purchased CNN Center. The cable television and internet news company has occupied its offices there since 1987.

WarnerMedia will lease its offices there ""for a number of years"" said CP Group which is based in Boca Raton Florida. But WarnerMedia said last year that it plans to consolidate CNN with other operations north of downtown near Georgia Tech over the long term. Those offices already house other networks founded by Ted Turner and now owned by Warner Media including TBS TNT and Cartoon Network.

AT&T has owned CNN since 2018 but is preparing to spin off WarnerMedia into a new company that will combine with Discovery Networks. That new company is supposed to be named Warner Bros. Discovery.

WarnerMedia has about 6000 employees in Atlanta.

(WDAM) - As Pine Belt residents celebrate the Fourth of July weekend with fireworks and festivities Waste Management is reminding folks that disposing of flammable waste properly protects the community.

According to Waste Management this time of the year sees an increase in flammable materials being disposed of curbside which creates dangerous situations.

Things like hot barbecue coals and ashes pool chemicals paint lighter fluid propane tanks lithium and ion rechargeable batteries and fireworks can lead to garbage truck fires creating an unsafe situation for workers neighbors and fire safety personnel.

Waste Management provided the following tips to make sure flammable material is disposed of safely:

Hot coals or ashes should never be placed in a trash container.

Cool coals for several days on the grill or in a metal container full of water then seal the container with a tight lid before placing in your trash can.

Never place used coals in plastic paper or wood containers for disposal.

Keep all flammable and hazardous materials out of your waste and recycling containers including lithium ion and rechargeable batteries paint chemical products fluorescent lights pesticides and oil rags. Visit your parish/city website to locate Household Hazardous Waste drop off locations in your area.

Collect your used lithium-ion batteries (from toys greeting cards and electronics) and rechargeable batteries in small plastic bags and take them to a hardware store or other drop-off point for recycling.

Make sure to properly dispose of used fireworks debris. The National Council on Fireworks Safety advises soaking used fireworks in water and letting them sit for 15 minutes before disposal. Dispose of all other debris including used matches wrappers etc. in your trash can to prevent littering and water contamination from gunpowder residue.

Waste Management also encourages people to celebrate Independence Day in an environmentally friendly way by using reusable dishware to reduce waste going into the landfill. Another alternative is buying environmentally friendly tableware such as products made from renewable plant-based materials like sugar cane and bamboo.

For International Plastic Bag Free Day we’re going back to Bangladesh to see how Rohingya refugees are finding sustainable solutions and upcycling single-use products.

Sustainable Solutions in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp

The bustling lanes of Kutupalong the world’s biggest refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar Bangladesh are always full of chatter as they wind through busy makeshift bazaars. The camp is home to more than 860000 Rohingya refugees from neighboring Myanmar all of whom receive support from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).

Seasonal fruits and vegetables clothes locks and keys – whatever people need the bazaar’s got it. Disappointment only creeps in with the piles of general waste.

The Rohingya camps generate 119.8 tons of waste per day. Much like everywhere else the waste problem in the camps demands a sustainable solution.

One way the U.N. World Food Programme is setting out to offset packaging waste is upcycling. Food from e-voucher outlets where Rohingya families pick up their groceries every month is packaging-free but aluminum metallized wraps have to be used for fortified food and special nutritional products.

Transforming Waste and Giving Hope

Through a new upcycling center this packaging waste is transformed back into useful products. Rohingya refugees have been able to brainstorm design and create user-friendly products from waste.

“My life is much better now — I can send my children to school” says Sayeda a Rohingya woman who makes different types of bags and masks using upcycled material and her skills as a tailor. “Now that I have started to earn I am treated well by other people in my community. The centre has upcycled over half a million food packets into 2500 different products since it started operating last September.”

Waste can create a significant environmental threat especially for groundwater. The finished products from the upcycling center is helping to improve the environmental health of the camps and surrounding areas.

From wallets and different kinds of bags — totes pouches zippers — to bins baskets bracelets floor mats and pen holders the center is experimenting widely with its product types and designs.

The process maintains a clear division of labour. Walking inside the center one can immediately spot the different groups working together on different tasks. Packaging is

sorted

washed

dried

compressed

and processed by different groups.

Each group of workers consists of six to seven volunteers from the Rohingya community. Currently there are 86 volunteers working in the upcycling centre: 41 men and 45 are women.

The Rohingya refugee crisis added to an already challenging task of waste management in this part of Bangladesh which relies on its coastlines and forests for food and livelihoods. Upcycling helps to keep the camp environment clean in two prominent ways:

preventing the risk of floods keeping the groundwater safe

The Environmental Threat of Packaging Waste

Most of the household waste in the camps ends up in the canals and poses a big threat of flood during the monsoon season. As part of the monsoon preparedness plan this year 50 miles of canals and drains were cleared and waste collected from these places.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZjc3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2Rpc3Bvc2UtdHJlYXRlZC13b29kLWlzc3Vlcy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLzc4NDg1MDcwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to dispose of treated wood in California,"David Goldstein

Special to Ventura County Star

Sometimes even the leader of an environmental organization opposes regulations making disposal too difficult.

This week Doug Kobold executive director of the California Product Stewardship Council told me why his organization supported the issuance of variances allowing some landfills to continue accepting treated wood waste. The council is at the forefront of legislative efforts to protect the environment by holding retailers and manufacturers responsible for the environmental costs of their products.

He said the landfill is the best place for treated wood waste.

“And if you make it too difficult to dispose you end up with treated wood dumped on the sides of the roads or illegally burned” Kobold said.

Previous regulations allowing treated wood waste to be handled with alternative management standards expired at the end of last year.

Without these alternative standards hazardous treated wood waste managed in California had to be stored and manifested as hazardous waste and transported to a landfill that can handle this type of specialized waste. There is only one such landfill in the state that could accept the materials.

More: Battery-based backup power may be an option for outages

As the deadline for the expiration of the alternative management standards approached without a legislative or regulatory solution contractors began rejecting jobs expected to generate treated wood waste and industrial generators prepared to stockpile.

Projected costs for managing treated wood rose from around $80 per ton to what Kobold estimated would be around $500 per ton for transport and authorized disposal.

Addressing the problem the California Department of Toxic Substances Control with existing legislative authority and following strict rules issued new variances a system that had not been used since before 2008.

Locally Toland Road Landfill did not obtain a variance so treated wood waste is not allowed for disposal there but the Simi Valley Landfill did obtain a variance and now charges $83.50 per ton to accept treated wood from Ventura County and $87.50 to accept it from outside Ventura County.

Waste Management which operates the Simi Valley Landfill will accept only pre-approved loads of treated lumber so customers must make arrangements prior to delivery by calling 805-579-7267 or obtaining pre-approval of the load online at www.wmsolutions.com.

Variances are valid for six months and can be renewed only once so generators and landfills are depending on legislation for a longer-term solution. Such legislation including Assembly Bill 332 is expected to arrive on the governor’s desk for final approval within the next few weeks.

For other materials high disposal costs are sometimes seen by recyclers as beneficial since cheap disposal can be a disincentive to reuse or recycling. However this is not the case with treated wood because reuse is limited and recycling is not viable.

Pressure treatment forces chemical preservatives into the cellular structure of wood. These chemicals are undesirable in mulch or compost so if your scrap lumber is lined with tiny holes or stained green these indicators of pressure treatment should prevent you from placing the wrong types of wood in your local curbside yard waste cart.

More: Law requiring organic recycling kicks into gear. Here's what some sites do

Reuse of pressure-treated wood is also problematic. Cutting and sanding require precautions to avoid breathing the sawdust which is considered toxic by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control although some home improvement websites say a dust mask safety goggle and a shower afterward are adequate to ensure safety.

Municipally sponsored household hazardous waste collection events are also an alternative for disposal of treated wood waste and to homeowners such events may look like a no-cost option. However using these events is actually the most expensive way to handle the material and the cost is placed on refuse rate payers whose fees pay for these programs.

According to Don Sheppard who manages Ventura County’s Pollution Prevention Center located between Ojai and Ventura household hazardous waste management contractors charge over $60 for each vehicle arriving at the event.

They would charge their cost plus 20% to accept treated wood package it haul it to an authorized site and pay the fee for the site to accept the material. The center received no treated wood during the past year according to Sheppard.

Block said he was first approached by Tomer Feingold and then separately by Dov Malnik in 2010 after publishing a short-selling report on a Chinese company called Orient Paper Inc. Malnik and Feingold claimed to only have passing familiarity with one another at the time when in fact he said he later discovered they were close friends.

The pair played significant roles in the field research and trading for some of Muddy Waters' most successful early short-selling reports starting in 2010 Block said in an interview. Their work included contributions to reports on Sino-Forest Corp. the one-time Chinese forestry giant that Block and his team helped expose as one of the biggest frauds in Canadian stock market history.

However Block's professional relationship with Feingold and Malnik ended in early 2014 when he said he began to suspect and gather what he says was evidence that the duo were selling information from Muddy Waters reports to outsiders before publication.

It was a discovery that amounted to what Block said was a ""massive betrayal of my trust."" They were never co-founders of the Muddy Waters brand but ""through significant deceit they integrated themselves into my business and personal life"" he said.

Malnik and Feingold told a different tale in a lawsuit they brought against Block and Muddy Waters claiming Block denied them their rightful share of the Muddy Waters' brand which they said they'd played a critical role in building.

Block and his company ""wrongfully alleged that plaintiffs 'have misappropriated information from [Mr. Block personally] and Muddy Waters LLC to engage in unauthorized trading on behalf of themselves and others'"" according to their 2014 lawsuit in New York.

Block made the allegations in a private legal arbitration case which was referenced in the New York lawsuit.

Feingold and Malnik argued they met Block on several occasions in which they agreed to publish research reports under the name Muddy Waters but then Block ""wrongfully asserted control over the jointly-developed brand and have excluded plaintiffs"" from working together.""

Block said in the interview he ceased professional contact with Malnik and Feingold and halted any shared trading activities after he began suspecting they were selling information in Muddy Waters reports to outsiders.

A New York judge dismissed the case in early 2015 after being informed by lawyers on both sides that it had been or was about to be settled.

Block wouldn't comment on whether a settlement had been reached or provide any details on the matter. The New York lawyer who represented Malnik in that dispute declined to comment and Feingold's lawyer in the case didn't return messages seeking comment.

Around the time the relationship began to sour Feingold and Malnik set up a trading business in Geneva completely independent of Muddy Waters according to U.S. prosecutors. It was there that between 2013-17 Feingold and Malnik allegedly received confidential information about health care acquisitions and potential deals from an unnamed local securities trader allowing them to reap millions of dollars in illegal profits according to a U.S. federal indictment unsealed in June.

During his trial in the United States last year former Geneva trader Marc Demane Debih said the pair were both part of an international insider-trading ring that U.S. French and U.K. prosecutors have been investigating since at least 2014.

Malnik was extradited from Switzerland to the U.S earlier last month. After pleading innocent on June 11 upon his arrival in New York to 14 charges of securities fraud and wire fraud and one charge of concealment of a money-laundering conspiracy he changed his mind.

Under an agreement with prosecutors Malnik 43 pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of one count of securities fraud for trading in the stock of Omnicare Inc. based on confidential information he received in the summer of 2015. He will forfeit $1.5 million and faces 37 to 46 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines and a fine of between $7500 and $5 million as part of the agreement.

""I will forever regret my conduct and the impact it has had on my family and friends"" Malnik said before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan.

A lawyer for Feingold whose current whereabouts are unknown declined to comment.

After severing relations with Malnik and Feingold in 2014 Block said he was approached by FBI agents and U.S. Department of Justice officials. They asked whether large trades ahead of Muddy Waters reports made from offshore accounts allegedly linked to Malnik and Feingold were authorized according to Block.

A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. An email sent to the FBI's main press office was not immediately returned.

Block says he told the agents he had no knowledge of the trades and that they were not approved by Muddy Waters. The scope of the unauthorized trading ahead of its research reports went beyond accounts controlled by Malnik and Feingold says Block. He said he learned of this after FBI agents showed him the trades.

""While I have no window into their outside activities the fact that they have been charged with crimes does not surprise me"" said Block.

NFTs or non-fungible tokens which aim to lock in the value of digital intellectual property have taken the art and music worlds by storm and are now being expanded into more traditional media spheres.

The drama an English and Cantonese language hybrid is planned to shoot across multiple countries with the fictional narrative taking place against a backdrop of real events with figures in the cryptocurrency space appearing on the show. It will be presented as 12 episodes executive directed by Philip Ma and delivered in 2022. The producers have not yet finalized a distribution company.

The story follows a group of young Hongkongers competing with a team of American bankers to create the next Bitcoin-like digital currency. As relations between the East and West sour the two teams become part of a wider geopolitical movement and put their personal and professional lives at stake to dominate in the world of crypto.

Popular on Variety

“Crypto Keepers” will be structured as a Hong Kong-U.K.-U.S. co-production. Development has been handled in partnership with Kudos co-founder Debbie Mason (“Life on Mars” “Spooks”). Hong Kong-based tech company CryptoBLK is responsible for developing the series as an NFT. It is produced and co-financed by Phoenix Waters Productions Hong Kong-based asset management firm YG Capital and AMM Global.

“ ‘Crypto Keepers’ is part of our strategy to tell international topical stories that bridge the gap between the East and West in a trailblazing manner” said Bizhan Tong who is senior executive at AMM founder of Phoenix Waters and a former banker. Tong will be showrunner on the series.

Tong says that NFTs can strengthen viewers’ relationship with the show so that they engage with its characters and ecosystem after the show’s run time. “This exists in various forms and taking inspiration from arguably the most interactive form of storytelling – videogames. We are incorporating some of those functions via the use of NFTs from the unlocking of concept art to collecting characters and even some of its most memorable scenes Tong told Variety. “Other uses include collecting scripts props and all kinds of collectible artifacts.”

Bright orange flames jumping out of water resembling molten lava was dubbed an ""eye of fire"" on social media due to the blaze's circular shape as it raged a short distance from a Pemex oil platform.

The fire took more than five hours to fully put out according to Pemex.

The fire began in an underwater pipeline that connects to a platform at Pemex's flagship Ku Maloob Zaap oil development the company's most important four sources told Reuters earlier.

Ku Maloob Zaap is located just up from the southern rim of the Gulf of Mexico.

Pemex said no injuries were reported and production from the project was not affected after the gas leak ignited around 5:15 a.m. local time. It was completely extinguished by 10:30 a.m.

The company added it would investigate the cause of the fire.

Pemex which has a long record of major industrial accidents at its facilities added it also shut the valves of the 12-inch-diameter pipeline.

Angel Carrizales head of Mexico's oil safety regulator ASEA wrote on Twitter that the incident ""did not generate any spill."" He did not explain what was burning on the water's surface.

Ku Maloob Zaap is Pemex's biggest crude oil producer accounting for more than 40% of its nearly 1.7 million barrels of daily output.

""The turbomachinery of Ku Maloob Zaap's active production facilities were affected by an electrical storm and heavy rains"" according to a Pemex incident report shared by one of Reuters' sources.

Company workers used nitrogen to control the fire the report added.

Details from the incident report were not mentioned in Pemex's brief press statement and the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Greenpeace Mexico said the accident Friday appeared to have been caused by the failure of an underwater valve and that it illustrates the dangers of Mexico policy of promoting fossil fuels.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has bet heavily on drilling more wells and buying or building oil refineries. He touts oil as “the best business in the world.”

Greenpeace wrote in a statement that the fire which took five hours to extinguish “demonstrates the serious risks that Mexico’s fossil fuel model poses for the environment and people’s safety.”

Climate activist Greta Thunberg reposted a video clip of the massive fireball on her Twitter account.

“Meanwhile the people in power call themselves ‘climate leaders’ as they open up new oilfields pipelines and coal power plants – granting new oil licenses exploring future oil drilling sites” Thunberg wrote. “This is the world they are leaving for us.”

Mexico’s state-owned oil company said Friday that an undersea gas pipeline ruptured near a drilling platform in the Gulf.

Petroleos Mexicanos dispatched fire control boats to pump more water over the flames.

Pemex as the company is known said nobody was injured in the incident in the offshore Ku-Maloob-Zaap field.

The leak near dawn Friday occurred about 150 yards (meters) from a drilling platform. The company said it had brought the gas leak under control about five hours later.

It was unclear how much environmental damage the gas leak and oceanic fireball had caused.

Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on Saturday on the 2nd hole at Mount Juliet Estate. Getty Images

Tiger Woods unfastened his white golf glove with the black strap from his left hand and dropped it into his right back pocket. It was there as he two-putted the 18th at Mount Juliet Estate to win the 2002 World Golf Championships-American Express Championship. It was there as Woods walked off 18 to sign for his victory and it was there as he came back to 18 to lift his trophy.

It was there as a 13-year-old from Northern Ireland snuck under the ropes to stand no more than a pitching wedge away from his idol.

Tiger Woods’ golf glove was right there.

“The last time I was on the 18th green here was during the prize ceremony when Tiger won and I remember I somehow sneaked my way like under the rope onto the back of the green and I was standing right behind him and his glove was still in his back pocket” Rory McIlroy shared earlier this week ahead of the Irish Open. “And like I could have reached and got it and ran; it would have been a good story to tell him but I obviously didn’t.”

It’s a good story nonetheless. From there of course Woods would win 48 times on the PGA Tour including seven majors. Mount Juliet would host the 2004 WGC-American Express that McIlroy also attended — “I remember being in the clubhouse and stuff and meeting Ernie [Els] after he won” — and the course in Kilkenny is this week’s Irish Open home.

And McIlroy would join Woods on the Tour win 27 times internationally including four majors — and wear a white glove that he this week at least drops in his left back pocket.

“It was the first time I ever watched Tiger play live” McIlroy said of the 2002 tournament. “I remember the first shot I ever saw him hit was a drive off the 5th hole the par-5 and he hit a 2-iron into the green. It was really cool. I idolized him growing up and to actually see the man in the flesh was pretty exciting. …

“But yeah really good memories coming down here watching. It’s amazing that it’s been 17 years and the tournament hasn’t been back since. Glad to be back and certainly a lot’s changed in the last 17 years since the last time I was here.”

Indeed. This week McIlroy is playing his first Irish Open since 2018 and because of the pandemic his first tournament in Europe since the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in late September of 2019. Entering Sunday’s final round at Mount Juliet he’s tied for 48th after rounds of even-par 72 67 and 73.

In two weeks he’ll play the Open Championship at Royal St. George’s. At the other majors this year he missed the cut at the Masters tied for 49th at the PGA Championship and tied for seventh at the U.S. Open and in May he broke a year-plus winless drought with a victory at the Wells Fargo Championship.

“Hopefully I’ll have a good day tomorrow and shoot a good score” McIlroy said Saturday. “My iron play is pretty good. I hit a couple of bad tee shots today that cost me four shots. … So I need to sort of just try to figure that out.”

(Credit: Grant Parpan)

On Sunday a caller reported that a boat a mile off Soundview Road in Southold appeared to be in distress. Police responded to find the vessel was not under power and was not in distress. Later in the day as darkness fell “a light was observed coming from the vessel and from a distance it appeared the light might have been flashing” according to a report. The bay constable responded and found two persons aboard the vessel who said they were not in distress and did not need assistance.

• On Sunday police investigated the theft of 18 plants worth $108 from an address on Rocky Point Road in East Marion. The report says the plants were removed by an unknown male and that the incident was captured on a security camera. The facility was closed at the time. Investigation is continuing.

• Police arrested Juanita Torres of Calverton Saturday after pulling her car over on Route 25 in Southold for failing to maintain its line of travel. A sobriety test was administered which she failed. She was placed under arrest and transported to headquarters for a morning arraignment.

• A Southold man told police on June 21 that his email account was hacked and the person who did this emailed the names on the man’s contact list asking for funds to purchase Amazon gift cards. None of the people on the contact list complied and there was no financial loss.

• A Cutchogue woman told police an unknown person opened an account at Wells Fargo using her personal information. The woman said the bank corrected the matter and there was no financial loss.

• Fire crews responded to a house on Wickham Avenue in Mattituck Saturday after black smoke was seen coming from a crawlspace. The source of the fire was found in the northeast corner of the structure and was extinquished.

• Police responded Sunday to Claudio’s Clam Bar in Greenport after noise complaints were received. The DJ there was told to lower volume of the music.

• Police responded Saturday to a Cutchogue residence after reports of “loud amplified music” were received. A wedding organizer at the address said amplifiers would be turned in the opposite direction and the volume would be lowered.

• Graffiti painted inside a portable restroom at an address on Wells Avenue in Southold was reported to police June 21. The report states: “This is the third time something has happened at this property.”

• On Saturday police reponded to a fight at an address on Front Street in Greenport. The occupant at the address told police two men were fighting and were told to leave the property. One of the men became angry and when police arrived said he had pain in his neck. He was transported to Stony Brook Eastern Long Island hospital for evaluation. No other information was available.

• On June 24 police received a call about a person on the rocks off Orient Point waving his arms at passing boats. The person had been fishing on the sandbar when the tide came in and was unable to walk back due to the swift current. A bay constable responded as did the Orient Fire Department. A police officer on foot walked out to the subject to check on his condition and remained with him until a fire department boat could pick him up.

And there's considerable fear among investors that we could see a recession in the not-too-distant future if interest rates rise and consumer spending slows. So where should you put your money to prepare?

In this Fool Live video clip recorded on June 21 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP and Industry Focus host Jason Moser discuss how bank stocks typically perform in inflationary environments as well as during recessions.

10 stocks we like better than Bank of America

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7 2021

Matt Frankel: TMF New Fool says ""What's the best kind of investment that I can make to hedge myself against inflation and/or recession? Are financial stocks a good way to go about it? I'm thinking Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Chase (NYSE: JPM) Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). Also is it a good time to invest in these stocks or are they too expensive right now?""

No one can tell you if they're too expensive right now. If you ask Jason and I what bank stocks are going to do over the next couple of weeks you'll get two different answers and they'll probably both be wrong. I see a piano I don't see a crystal ball back behind Jason. But generally speaking financial stocks are good ways to hedge against inflation if inflation doesn't get out of control.

Jason Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If inflation gets to the point where the Fed has to raise rates a few times that usually trickles down into higher rates on mortgages credit cards auto loans things like that for the banks. All three of the ones you mentioned have big credit card operations which are directly tied to the federal funds rate.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: If the Fed hikes rates by 50 basis points credit card interest rates go by exactly 50 basis points. They make more money during mildly inflationary environments not when inflation gets out of control and people can't afford things and there's a lot of uncertainty. Then consumer demand falls and it's not good. It's really a fine line but banks tend to do well in mildly inflationary environments.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: As far as recessions go banks are bad investments. Banks are very cyclical in that sense in terms of -- you'll see housing demand drop you'll see auto loan demand drop dramatically. You'll see defaults increase dramatically during recessions. Banks can be bad investments during recessions which is why they plunged so badly during the first part of the COVID pandemic. A lot of those normal recessionary things like lower loan demand like higher defaults -- people feared that those are really going to hit it. In terms of inflation I would say yes but with a caveat. Recession I would say financials are a no. If you want recession-proof -- utility things that people will buy no matter what the economy is doing Apple.

Moser: What do you think about insurance in a time like that?

Frankel: Sure. Yeah. One of the reason Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) works in a recessionary environment. Geico -- people keep paying their auto insurance no matter what.

Moser: Yeah.

Frankel: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- people buy their iPhones no matter what the economy is doing.

Moser: Yeah. You're right. They do. The neat thing is they've come up with creative ways to finance those purchases. Like it's not just ""OK pay me $950 or pay me $1100.""

Frankel: Right. They are going to keep innovating with that.

Moser: Yeah exactly.

Frankel: Anything that sells things at a discounted nature is a good thing in a recession. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) -- Walmart was one of the very few stocks that actually went up in 2008 and it's because in tough times Walmart still has its loyal customer base that goes there because they have lower prices. But then people who normally shop at higher-end grocery stores who need to cut back will go to Walmart in tougher times. So they actually benefit in tougher times. Dollar stores are another one. Convenience stores things like that that people need -- those can actually benefit during tough times. But banks are not the best during recessions.

Find out which companies have raised their pay rates.

Many companies are facing a shortage of workers due to the coronavirus pandemic. With plenty of demand for their products and services they're having to find creative ways to attract more job applicants so they can continue to run their businesses effectively. To help bring in more employees some brands are now raising what they pay.

These companies increased employee wages

For workers in states with low minimum wages exploring other opportunities that pay better can improve their personal finances. Amid a pandemic when workers are putting their health at risk wage increases can make a significant difference.

Here are eight companies that have chosen to increase their wages to attract more workers.

1. Bank of America

In May Bank of America announced that it would increase its minimum wage in the United States to $25 by 2025. Additionally the company now requires its vendors to pay all their employees at least $15 per hour.

2. Best Buy

Best Buy announced its plans to increase wages in July of 2020. Beginning on August 2 2020 the company raised the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees to $15 per hour.

3. Chipotle

In May Chipotle announced that it would increase wages resulting in a $15 hourly average wage by the end of June. Hourly workers will see starting wages of $11 to $18 per hour. The company also introduced referral bonuses.

4. Costco

More than half of Costco's hourly workers are paid more than $25 per hour. And in early 2021 Costco announced plans to increase starting wages from $15 to $16 per hour.

5. McDonald's

In May Mcdonald's announced an average wage increase of 10% for its employees at company-owned restaurants. This increase will be rolled out over several months. The entry-level wage for crew members would be at least $11 to $17 an hour while the starting wage for shift managers would be at least $15 to $20 an hour.

6. Target

Target announced an increase in its starting wage in June of 2020 permanently increasing wages to $15 per hour for United States team members.

7. Under Armour

In May Under Armour announced an increase in the minimum pay rate for hourly employees in the United States and Canada. Workers saw an increase of up to 50% as the minimum pay rate went from $10 to $15 per hour. These changes went into effect on June 6.

8. Wells Fargo

In early 2020 Wells Fargo announced it would raise wages at most of its U.S. locations. The minimum hourly pay would range from $15 to $20 per hour depending on geographic area.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25

This shift in companies offering higher wages has gotten more people talking about the federal minimum wage and state minimum wages laws. According to the Economic Policy Institute increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour by 2025 would increase earnings for 32 million workers -- or 21% of the workforce.

It'll be interesting to see if more companies follow and pay workers better rates. Now that many businesses are paying better wages people are being more selective about what companies they choose to work for and are considering whether they're getting paid a fair wage for the work they do.

Let your money grow

If you've recently received a raise through your company or have switched jobs to take advantage of higher wages you might consider setting some of the funds aside in a separate savings account. Doing this can make it easier to establish an emergency fund or plan for a future big expense.

Setting up automatic withdrawals from your checking account will allow you to save automatically without any extra thinking or work. Plus you can earn interest by keeping your money in your savings account. For more information check out our banking resources."

New Delhi: In its latest drug safety alert the apex drug regulatory body the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has flagged 22 drug samples as Not of Standard Quality.

The drug samples failed to qualify random drug sample test for the month of May.

Rosuvas 20 Rosuvas F-5 manufactured by Sun Pharma Laboratories Paracetamol Tablets manufactured by Hindustan Antibiotics Telmisartan 40 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg Tablets manufactured by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals are popular drug samples that are declared not of standard quality among others.

Responding to the alerts Sun Pharma Spokesperson told the Medical Dialogues team in an official statement"" ""We have investigated the matter and found that both the batches (EMX0174 & EMX0685) of Rosuvas 20 (Rosuvastatin Tablets I.P. 20 mg) are spurious medicines.

WDC,Western Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8tZmFybS1jaGlhLWEtZ3VpZGUtdG8teGNoLXRva2VuLWZhcm1pbmctdXNpbmctYS1oYXJkLWRyaXZl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to farm Chia: A guide to XCH token farming using a hard drive,"Chia Network recently entered the cryptocurrency scene and has quickly piqued the interest of many miners and investors. There are several reasons for this: First the Chia blockchain operates using a novel proof-of-space-and-time (PoST) protocol which means that proof of the space used and time spent on the task is required to farm the cryptocurrency.

Second according to the creators of the currency Chia (XCH) is an environmentally friendly coin and is not mined rather it’s farmed with the protocol needing low energy to generate new coins.

Gene Hoffman president and chief operating officer of Chia Network told Cointelegraph that the project’s creator Bram Cohen wanted to bring environmental friendliness to the world of cryptocurrencies.

In the case of Chia an unused hard disc drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD) storage space can be replaced with hashing power. Krzysztof Pietrzak who also worked on the PoST protocol said the original model behind Chia was flawed. Hoffman added “That started off a back-and-forth of Bram coming up with potential solutions and Krzysztof proving them wrong until Bram proposed one that — as Krzysztof attempted to mathematically prove wrong — proved right.”

What is Chia Network?

The main selling point of Chia farming is that participants don’t need to use powerful GPUs and processors which are needed to mine Bitcoin (BTC). Chia can be farmed with an HDD or an SSD which is an attractive proposition for those unable to afford the latest greatest video cards. Hoffman explained:

“It was totally designed from the ground up to be as or more secure than proof of work and far more decentralized while using 1000 to 10000 times less power per unit of security.”

To farm Chia you can start with just a personal computer or laptop of any kind. All you need is a processor with a clock speed of 1.5 GHz 2 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD or HDD.

Next users need to download the “Chia Blockchain” client from the project’s official website or directly from GitHub. Then you create a wallet and save a private key after which you can start the farming process by clicking the “Create Plot” button. Farming one block gives a reward of 64 Chia tokens. And the speed of farming depends on the disk storage capacity used.

It is worth noting that for now only individual users can farm hia. Each individual farmer creates blocks — i.e. there is no need to join a pool to receive coins. According to the developers this ensures that Chia Network is decentralized. However the project team is currently working on creating an official pool protocol that will be released soon. Regarding the upcoming release Hoffman stated:

“It is impossible for a farmer to cheat. Pools can only cheat by not paying out the agreed amount and a farmer can leave a pool in thirty minutes if they think they’re being cheated. Further unlike nearly every other cryptocurrency with pooling the pools do not make the blocks — each individual farmer makes the blocks. That means it remains far more decentralized on top of the Chia blockchain being the largest ever blockchain by public node count.”

If you don’t have hardware and just want to buy Chia this can be done through several crypto exchanges. You should keep in mind that in order to buy Chia you first need to purchase a stablecoin such as Tether (USDT) or Bitcoin and then exchange it for Chia.

How to build a Chia farm

Now the main question is how to create a Chia farm and how to choose the best components for a rig to maximize profitability. Thankfully the process is fairly simple and resembles building a specialized home computer.

A processor

Any processor with four cores — like Intel’s Core i3 Core i5 or Core i7 or their AMD equivalents – are suitable for mining Chia. A good choice would be the Intel Core i5-11400 or Core i5-10400 which can be purchased for around $150 to $170. For even better productivity it is advised to choose a processor with an integrated graphics card since one slot can be used to connect additional storage.

Storage

The main piece of hardware required to farm the Chia token is the storage drives which can be either SSDs or HDDs that support a SATA III interface. To farm XCH it will be acceptable to use just the SSDs; however it’s better to use a combination of SSDs and HDDs since SSDs speed up the graphic process while HDDs are better at storing the graphs.

Overall you need at least 300 GB of storage capacity but it’s beneficial to have more. For example 2 TB will be enough for the simultaneous generation of six graphs while 10 graphs will require the purchase of a more spacious SSD or even several such devices. It is better to use high-speed SSDs that work through the M.2 slot. Farmers will need to find models with a high terabytes-written (TBW) capacity and it is also better to have several external hard drives as they are easier to interchange.

As for the prices there are a lot of HDDs and SDDs on the market and they are not expensive. For example a 1 TB Western Digital Purple HDD typically goes for around $50. When choosing an SSD it is worth remembering that at least 15% of the disc space should be left free in order to increase its durability and allow the drive to work properly. This will eliminate most problems with speed drops during operations.

Hoffman also drew attention to the fact that those who buy equipment specifically for Chia farming often rely on used equipment:

“For people buying specialized Chia growing equipment the first choice is recycled discs or used storage because the price is lower and they are suitable for Chia farming where no user data is stored. When people were in a rush to buy specialized hardware they opted for high-capacity hard drives because they consume less power per TB and storage density. There are farmers using SATA SAS and USB drives and we see a good mix of all.”

The motherboard

Preferably the motherboard should support SATA III and USB 3.0 ports. The same goes for PCI-e ports which should be version 3.0 and higher. Having more ports means that more drives can be used as part of the system. The board must have a network controller capable of 1000 Mbps and two network ports would be an advantage. Of course the faster the internet connection the better. An unlimited wired internet connection of 100 Mbps and above is the best choice. Here there is also a great variety of options at a range of various prices. A SuperMicro X9DR3_i-LN4F+ for example is available to purchase for around $115.

Power supply

Since SSDs and HDDs require little power consumption power of up to 500 watts is sufficient. Of course a 750-watt box can also be used but it is currently necessary. However it is important to choose a power supply that has multiple SATA Mole and PCI connectors for connecting additional drives. Such power supplies shouldn’t cost you more than $40.

RAM

The minimum amount of RAM needed for Chia farming is 2 GB but it’s recommended to use 4–8 GB of RAM. However this ultimately makes no difference in how productive the farm will be.

A stand

A farming stand with several disks can be built independently inside a large PC case. It is enough to remove the GPU card from the set up (if the processor has an integrated video chip) and install as many disks with SATA III ports as possible into the corresponding connectors on the board.

The future of Chia Network

Chia Network is a relatively new project but its popularity has already led to a deficit of HDDs and SDDs in some parts of the world. The two largest manufacturers of hard drives Western Digital and Seagate have reported increased demand for their products. This may inevitably lead to a rise in the costs of farming XCH.

Another issue is how fragile the drives are proving to be when mining Chia. At the end of May German cloud storage provider Hetzner banned users from farming Chia on its servers. The company claimed that the load on its equipment had increased significantly and that its hard drives had failed due to Chia farming.

One report even claimed that Chia farming can kill a 512 GB SSD in less than two months and a 1 TB drive in less than three months. Under normal conditions a disk can work for up to five years.

But according to Chia Network developers a solution to the problem is being developed. They have said that most in the Chia community are using preowned SSDs purchased from data centers and the company is working with many of the leading storage vendors to create specialized products for Chia.

Even if users decide to farm Chia and deal with the issue of having to periodically replace disks it all boils down to the price of the Chia coin itself to determine how profitable the endeavor could be. After the launch of its mainnet in early May XCH price soared to around $1600 but collapsed to $230 by the end of June.

Nevertheless at the end of May the Chia Network company was valued at half a billion dollars managing to raise $61 million in its previous round of funding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xhbXNoYW0uY29tL3dvcmxkL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvd2Qtb2ZmZXJzLWRhdGEtcmVjb3ZlcnktZm9yLWhhY2tlZC1teS1ib29rLWxpdmUtZGV2aWNlcy8yMi_SAWdodHRwczovL2dsYW1zaGFtLmNvbS93b3JsZC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3dkLW9mZmVycy1kYXRhLXJlY292ZXJ5LWZvci1oYWNrZWQtbXktYm9vay1saXZlLWRldmljZXMvMjIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD offers data recovery for hacked My Book Live devices,,,,,,,,,,

Williams had been approached by various companies over the years about signing a gas drilling lease but she had questions about the noise pollution and other factors that typically accompany urban drilling.

What You Need To Know Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies didn’t drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals.



The Railroad Commission of Texas is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own.



The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”



There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies.

“I wanted answers to questions” she said. “I didn't say ‘I won't ever do this.’ I said ‘I want answers to these questions’ and I never got the answers.""

The 76-year-old Fort Worth resident refused to sign a lease with Chesapeake Energy Corporation many years ago and now Total Energy — the France-based company that purchased the rights to minerals in Williams’ area near Lake Worth — is continuing its aggressive expansion in North Texas by using a little-known rule to grab all of the underground resources in the vicinity of her house whether neighbors agree to it or not.

Rule 37 was created to ensure that companies don't drill too close to an existing pad site to avoid tapping into overlapping pools of minerals. A spokesperson for the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) the state agency tasked with regulating oil and gas companies (which was created by the oil and gas industry) said “Statewide Rule 37 requires minimum distances between wells at drilling sites in order to protect field pressure and correlative rights.”

Under the rule the RRC is allowed to grant exceptions that allow drillers to move closer to minerals that they don’t own — the usual justification is that without the unlicensed pool of minerals the company won’t be able to generate enough pressure to bring the gas to the surface. But observers said oil and gas companies have learned that the RRC will almost always grant these exceptions whether they are justified or not.

The exception to Rule 37 has become a legal mechanism used by oil and gas companies that some critics have decried as “state-sponsored theft.”

There is an appeals process for landowners who don’t want to give away their minerals but most who have been through it say the hearing is little more than a dog-and-pony show and the RRC will side with the oil and gas companies. Though the RRC doesn’t keep aggregate data on the win-loss records on hearings for exceptions a spokesman for the organization pointed a reporter to three separate websites where the final orders on the hearings are stored. In a search of the first 50 cases on one of the pages the RRC arbiter sided with the oil and gas companies 100% of the time.

One industry insider said he’s never heard of a business losing a hearing and the only cases that residents ever win are on technicalities such as botched paperwork. The former oil and gas executive who asked not to be named for fear of hurting his current career guessed that the win-to-loss ratio was around 1000 to 1. The process is so tipped in the favor of these companies he said most people don’t bother to protest.

Elaine Williams is not most people. When the RRC told her that everyone in her neighborhood had been notified of the more than 200 Rule 37 exception cases that Total has filed in the area she went door-to-door to verify that people knew what was happening. Almost none of the people she spoke to knew anything about the Rule 37 applications.

“Whenever they sent [the notification letter] they gave me a long list — front and back — of people they said they had tried to contact or they said they had contacted” she said. “One of them was my neighbor caddy-corner to me. So I went over there and we talked in his driveway. Neither one of us has ever signed that we would take money or do anything with this. He signed a [protest] form right there in his driveway.”

After her initial protest was declared invalid because of a paperwork error she tried a second time to fight for her minerals. This time she successfully protested her case and helped neighbors file their protests. Total tried once again to buy her minerals but she said she’s past that point.

“In this process I have discovered that all of these things are hidden in plain sight” she said of the Rule 37 exception process. “I'm becoming aware of just how sneaky they are.”

Gas drilling in her area has already taken a toll on her health and quality of life she said.

“I literally cannot drink my own water in this house anymore” she said. “I tell my overnight visitors my family not to even brush their teeth with the water — to use my bottled water. Whenever I take a shower I'm very careful. I’ve been using paper plates and plastic [utensils] for years now.

“I literally was getting sick” she said. “I was getting so sick.”

Are the hearings a sham?

Williams and her neighbors who have chosen to protest Total’s application for a Rule 37 exemption are about to go through a process that critics allege is almost impossible to win.

Residents are required to travel to Austin on a weekday to attend their hearing — there is also an option to have the hearing over the phone but that has only existed since 2017 and it would make presenting evidence or fairly cross-examining witnesses nearly impossible. Residents can request an alternative hearing site but both parties would have to agree to the change.

Oil and gas companies employ a team of attorneys and expert witnesses to fight residents’ claims to their own minerals. While there is a discovery period most residents don’t have the legal savvy to ask for it and they are blindsided by testimony replete with myriad slides and dense scientific jargon. Anyone can hire an attorney to represent them but oil and gas attorneys are uniquely specialized and expensive. Spectrum News 1 reached out to one such attorney based in Fort Worth and his rates started at $300 an hour.

The judges in these cases are not required to be elected judges attorneys or even have a basic understanding of the law. They are political appointees who are handpicked by a government body known for protecting oil and gas interests.

Emeka Duruigbo Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Institute for International and Immigration Law Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University is one of the few academics who has done extensive scholarly research on the cross-section of property rights and oil and gas law. He said Rule 37 by itself is a good one — society he argues needs the underground gas to fuel our lives — but the hearing process for exceptions he said is inherently unfair.

“It’s a David versus Goliath fight and the little guy is outmatched” he said. “There’s a battery of lawyers with experience in these kinds of cases prepared to fight you. This is what they do. So the private citizen comes in with nothing. They don’t even have the scientific information to back up their claims.”

Ranjana Bhandari executive director of Livable Arlington — a grassroots environmental organization that frequently takes on oil and gas companies — went through the RRC’s Rule 37 exception hearing process. She just so happens to hold a Masters in economics and her husband a university professor holds a PhD in physics. Even with their unique expertise to argue their case the RRC’s arbiter still sided with the oil and gas company. The couple was given only a few minutes to examine the oil and gas company’s data.

“I can only speculate but it seemed that there was asymmetry in treatment of the two sides” she said. “Even though we were the victims we were the injured party. We were the ones being dragged out of our homes in Arlington on a working day at great inconvenience trying to learn all these arcane rules trying to understand the technology and trying to understand something that most mineral owners know very little about.

“I've never had heard of a case where a potential robber can go to the legal system and say ‘Can you please have Ranjana explain to you why you shouldn't rob her?”

Duruigbo emphasized that the hearings are well outside of any traditional legal standards.

“They are acting like a court” he said. “The Railroad Commission has the [judges] sit there. They're not required to be lawyers. They're not judges. They're usually political appointees or they are elected. So any politician who collects money from vested interests [through an election] sits there and makes decisions.”

In April 2013 Duruigbo conducted a focus group of residential property owners in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area who were targeted for gas drilling underneath their homes.

In the resulting article the professor concluded that unfair granting of the Rule 37 exception was an abuse of power and an affront to the rights of property owners.

“Participants numbering about 12 men and women decried energy developers’ interference with their property freedom and their ability to holdout when negotiations are orchestrated” the article says. “After examining applicable legal provisions and hearing the concerns of the focus group participants it is apparent that the … unfair granting of exceptions to spacing rules do interfere with the property freedom of small tract owners. They also encroach on their power to holdout for better deals or more desirable outcomes.”

Oil company landmen also know that the game is rigged and they frequently use that as a negotiation tactic when trying to buy a person’s gas rights.

“When landmen and Chesapeake's representatives contacted us a few times to see if they could change our mind their biggest selling point was ‘It's going to be expensive for you to defend yourself’ ” Bhandari said. “ ‘You are going to lose. So isn't it better for you to just sign the lease now? We are going to drill anyway. One way or the other we'll get permission to drill and the only difference will be that you won't be paid.’ I heard this over and over again from landman from Chesapeake employees who called us. And so because the system is so unfair to mineral owners they can very easily be coerced by the drillers.”

Even knowing all of this Williams said she is undeterred. Now that she’s had a chance to do more research on the environmental impact of urban gas drilling she’s determined to at least make herself a pest to Total Energy.

Since filing her appeal she said the company has once again contacted her about buying her minerals but this time at a reduced rate.

“I just laughed at him” she said of her recent encounter with a landman. “I said ‘If I didn't take over $5000 what makes you think I'm gonna take $1000?’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzAzL2p1bWFhbmUtd2lsbGlhbXMtdG8tc3Rhci1pbi1vZWRpcHVzLXRyaWxvZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jumaane Williams to star in Oedipus trilogy,"He’s a Public Advocate for All Seasons.

Jumaane Williams the city’s top public watchdog will take the stage in October when he is scheduled to appear in all three plays of Sophocles’ Oedipus Trilogy.

The show will be put on by Theater of War Productions and will be streamed online. Live performances are planned as well assuming no pandemic-related complications.

Williams 45 is currently slated to be among the chorus in “Oedipus Rex” and “Oedipus at Colonus” but will take on the larger role of Haemon in “Antigone.”

“He’s one of our best. We have over 200 actors in our company. He is a remarkable performer” Bryan Doerries the company’s artistic director told The Post. “It was a surprise to us as well when we first started working with him in 2016 before he was Public Advocate. He was a city councilman.”

Williams has appeared in no less than 43 Theater of War productions. Over the years he’s worked on some of the cannon’s most notable warhorses including Shakespeare’s “King Lear” Aeschylus’ “Prometheus Bound” Euripides’ “The Madness of Heracles” and Sophocles’ “Ajax.” He’s performed at the 9/11 Memorial Museum.

Theater of War bills itself as a social justice oriented company and the plays are performed to be part of a larger discussion with cast and audience about specific issues.

“What we’re after is public health and discussions about issues of social justice that are framed by theatrical performances” Doerries said. Williams starred in Doerries “Antigone in Ferguson” which had a New York City run in 2019 and focuses on the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson Mo.

Williams also took part in a dramatic reading of Martin Luther King’s “Drum Major Instinct” sermon in January which featured contributions from House squad members Rep. Jamaal Bowman and Rep. Ayanna Pressley.

Before he entered public life Williams had been an aspiring actor. In his 20s he took bit parts in music videos like “Touch Me” by Solo and “Da Joint” by rap pair EPDM.

“Theater was always the thing I wanted to do” Williams said in a 2019 interview and called acting his “first love.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGV2ZWxhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNy9lYXJseS1zdGFnZS1zaGVyd2luLXdpbGxpYW1zLXBsYW4tZm9yLWRvd250b3duLWhxLWNvbXBsZXgtaXMtYS1taXgtb2YtbW9zdGx5LWdvb2QtaWRlYXMtZGltaW5pc2hlZC1ieS1zb21lLWJhZC1vbmVzLmh0bWzSAa4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDcvZWFybHktc3RhZ2Utc2hlcndpbi13aWxsaWFtcy1wbGFuLWZvci1kb3dudG93bi1ocS1jb21wbGV4LWlzLWEtbWl4LW9mLW1vc3RseS1nb29kLWlkZWFzLWRpbWluaXNoZWQtYnktc29tZS1iYWQtb25lcy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Early-stage plan for Sherwin-Williams downtown HQ mixes mostly good ideas with some bad ones,"CLEVELAND Ohio — It was cause for excitement last year when Sherwin-Williams the global paint and coatings giant based in the Terminal Tower complex announced it would stay in downtown Cleveland and build a new headquarters west of Public Square.

Among other things the project held the promise of filling the parking lot wasteland that has blighted the city for decades since half of the historic Warehouse District was bulldozed in the 1970s and ’80s to make downtown friendlier for suburban car commuters.

It’s even better that a venerable Cleveland-based company wants to remain in its hometown where its investment could help trigger additional local development rather than leave for the Sunbelt or the coasts. Kudos to Sherwin-Williams for that.

But any hope that the company’s $300 million project would be a complete boon for downtown would have to be at least somewhat tempered by the early-stage designs released Thursday to City Hall and the media.

Buildings in the center foreground area were demolished from the 1960s to the 1990s to create surface parking lots to serve the Cuyahoga County Justice Center.Walter Leedy postcard collection Michael Schwartz Library Cleveland State UniversityMichael Schwartz Library Cleveland State University

The new plans which are only partially complete don’t yet show anything yet about the architecture of the headquarters which will occupy three blocks totaling 7 acres west of Public Square.

The plans focus on building footprints and overall bulk or massing. Buildings are indicated by colored boxes; there’s no description of how they might be sculpted and surfaced or what materials they might be made of. Nor do the plans show whether the buildings will create walkable inviting streetscapes around them or dead zones edged with facades of reflective glass. There will be exciting opportunities for public art around the project but there’s no hint of any direction the company might take.

Black-box process

For now there are things to like in the emerging plans and some very important things not to like. Before diving in let’s look at the design process which allows for public input in a nominally open but fundamentally secretive way.

Thursday’s unveiling marked the beginning of a review and approval process including meetings with the City Planning Commission scheduled for July 20 September 14 and November 30 when final designs could be approved.

In a joint news release the city and Sherwin-Williams said: “The agenda for each meeting and a meeting link will be posted on the Cleveland Planning Commission website 10 days prior to each meeting. Members of the public will be able to provide written comment and ask questions in a written format via the Commission website. Sherwin-Williams will provide responses to questions subsequent to each meeting presentation.”

In addition to the knothole described above the company plans to consult a community advisory committee whose members will sign a nondisclosure agreement. It will also consult privately with city planning officials community organizations residents downtown businesses and building managers.

This is a black-box process in which information will be received without allowing the community to hear questions and answers in real-time. That’s not exactly a public-spirited way to do business especially for a company expected to receive more than $100 million in public incentives for a project that will impact traffic patterns and the walkability of city streets not to mention the overall look of the city.

Adding to skyline

As for the design itself the early plans call for a 36-story tower a block west of Public Square at West Third Street and Superior Avenue with room for a potential second and most likely lower tower just to the west. The initial tower with a million square feet of space will rise roughly 600 feet and will add to the current three-tower ensemble around the square including Key Tower 200 Public Square and the Terminal Tower.

That’s all good. Adding to the skyline will make Cleveland look like a busier and more consequential place. If it fits well among its neighbors and embodies beautiful new ideas about how to shape the base shaft and pinnacle of an office tower the new building could be a joy to see from miles around.

Not so good is that the smallish block sandwiched between the tower site and Public Square will feature a two-story corporate welcome and learning center that will be attached to the big tower with an elevated walkway over West Third Street.

An aerial street rendering of the proposed new Sherwin-Williams campus.

The low-rise structure might look insubstantial next to the bulkier mid-rise buildings that now edge the square between the big three skyscrapers. A great deal depends on how the pavilion and the landscaping around it are designed.

Members of the design team headed by Bill Chilton a principal of the New Haven-based architecture firm of Pickard Chilton (working along with Cleveland-based Vocon) said the decision to push the tower to the block west of West Third Street was guided in part by the need to gross 28000 square feet per floor netting 20000 square feet after accounting for elevators stairwells and other necessities.

The smaller block immediately west of Public Square wouldn’t have allowed “floor plates” of that size. Then too if the tower were located immediately west of Public Square it would have stood awkwardly close to the glassy 22-story mid-century office tower at 55 Public Square located just to the north of narrow Frankfort Avenue.

Pulling the Sherwin-Williams tower one block to the west looks like a polite gesture to 55 Public Square enabling its tenants to keep their views of the Terminal Tower and the square. It will also put the new Sherwin-Williams tower immediately south of the 920-space parking garage that it wants to build north of Frankfort and west of West Third Street.

Closing a street adding skywalks

But the company also wants to close Frankfort to public traffic from West Third to West Sixth streets turning it into a private driveway to its garage and the main loading dock in the office tower. Employees and deliveries will enter from West Sixth Street. A barrier of some kind will be erected at Frankfort although it will remain open to pedestrians.

Closing and privatizing a downtown street is not a good idea because it will create a superblock — a large piece of urban turf that traffic and pedestrians have to circulate around. Downtown already has many blocks that are too big especially on the sides running east-west.

It’s also not good to allow skywalks to proliferate because they kill street life and encourage social stratification with elites above and the hoi polloi down below. The Sherwin-Williams project is setting a bad precedent in that regard.

A rendering Sherwin-Williams provided of plans it has for possible additional construction after its campus is built.

As for the garage it’s good that the company plans eventually to wrap the four-story structure on its east north and south sides with retail residential and office buildings. But those “liner” buildings will not happen immediately on the north side along St. Clair Avenue and on the West Side along West Sixth Street. Surface parking lots with 280 spaces will remain until the company decides to build on those sites and to build an office expansion west of its initial tower. That could take years to happen.

The big new garage will have nearly four times the number of spaces as the company now has at the Landmark Office Towers in the Tower City complex. Adding more parking is not good for downtown which is awash in it although the company argues that it’s providing spaces for only slightly more than a third of its employees meaning that it expects many to walk to work or use transit or to use existing parking.

Devon Energy World Headquarters Oklahoma City. Architects: Pickard Chilton Architects Gensler Alan Karchmer

Lastly it should be said that it’s encouraging that Sherwin-Williams is working with Pickard Chilton a firm with a solid reputation for thoughtful modernist design. Pickard Chilton designed the Eaton headquarters in Beachwood a suburban site that isn’t comparable to downtown but the firm has also designed handsome office towers in Chicago Milwaukee Oklahoma City and other cities.

Members of the firm have roots in the distinguished practice founded in New Haven by the late Cesar Pelli architect of Cleveland’s Key Tower and four fine buildings at the Cleveland Clinic.

A firm linked to that legacy wouldn’t want to design something awful next to Key Tower. And maybe if Pickard Chilton and Sherwin-Williams hear enough from the public through any available channel including social media the design for the company’s headquarters could evolve in a more completely positive direction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hdC05NC1yZXRpcmVkLWVuZ2luZWVyLWJsZXNzZWQtdG8taGF2ZS13ZWQtaWRlbnRpY2FsLXR3aW5zLzYwMDA3NDc2My_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At 94 retired engineer 'blessed' to have wed identical twins,"Accomplished electrical engineer Gerald Williams who turns 94 in North Oaks this July 4 is always happy to talk about the seven patents he earned as a pioneer with early Minnesota tech companies — including Univac and Control Data — or the sound company he started in the 1970s providing customized hearing aids for churches and hospitals.

But Williams was delighted to steer our phone conversation away from his career in transistors all the way back to 1946 and his first band rehearsal at St. Olaf College. That's where he believes God's plan and fate conspired to set the stage for his unique marital life wedding identical twin sisters — Lorraine Laura and Florraine Flora Hoffman of St. James Minn. — 59 years apart.

""What a blessing"" he said. ""I didn't realize it at the time but the St. Olaf band would become the most significant factor in my life.""

Williams recently completed a 10-year project writing a 241-page memoir for his grandkids ""who will never know me or what kind of life I lived."" How he ended up marrying twins emerges as the most intriguing subplot.

Williams began tinkering as a teenager repairing toasters lamps and appliances for an electrician in Cannon Falls Minn. His father Marland was the town doctor for decades after playing cornet in an Army band during the First World War in France.

Memories of battlefield horrors sleeping in barns and begging French civilians for food prompted Marland to persuade his son to enlist in the Navy — better food cleaner conditions — when the next war erupted. After his service as a radio technician at the end of World War II Jerry Williams came home at 19 eager to study electrical engineering. But the classes he wanted to take were full at the University of Minnesota.

So in 1946 he enrolled instead at St. Olaf in Northfield Minn. 15 miles west of Cannon Falls. When he tried out for the school band he bombed his alto saxophone tryout; though he had played it in high school he had put the horn down for three years during his Navy days. The band director said he could join the band if he'd play the college's baritone sax instead.

""I found one empty chair at the first rehearsal and the music on the stand was for baritone sax so I sat down"" he said telling the young women on either side: ""I guess we're new neighbors.""

To his left was alto sax player Shirley Hetland from Valley City N.D. who would become a lifelong friend. On his right sat the Hoffman twins Lorraine on alto clarinet and Florraine on the bassoon.

""Because the twins were inseparable the three of us soon became good friends"" Williams writes recalling how Lorraine and Florraine dressed alike so classmates could tell them apart only by their slightly different voices.

At one rehearsal break Williams told Lorraine he was struggling in chemistry class. She offered to tutor him and the chemistry soon clicked both academically and otherwise. ""I began to look at Lorraine differently"" he writes.

But he broke things off transferring to the U his junior year while Lorraine landed a job teaching high school home economics in Truman Minn. 20 miles southeast of her home in St. James. Regretting his breakup Williams sent a letter to Lorraine via her parents and rekindled things with an engagement three months later.

Florraine meanwhile was teaching home ec in Heron Lake Minn. 40 miles southwest of St. James when she became engaged to a man she met on the bus. The twins' mother Emmy Hoffman said the family couldn't afford to pay for two weddings. So Lorraine and Florraine decided on a double wedding on June 11 1950 at the First Lutheran Church in St. James.

""It was the talk of the town"" Williams writes.

Jerry and Lorraine were married for 56 years raising three children in Roseville and Edina who would later produce five grandkids and 11 great-grandchildren. Lorraine developed severe rheumatoid arthritis in her early 30s her pain medication slowly weakening her bones and leading to repeated fractures and surgeries. She died in 2006 at 79 after six bedridden final years.

Before she died Lorraine asked Jerry to look after Florraine whose second husband Bill Trygstad was in his late 80s.

""I assured her I would do that"" Williams writes ""but asked 'What would you think if I married Florraine because that would be the easiest way to care for her?' She replied 'That would be all right.' ""

Williams married Florraine five months after Trygstad died in 2009 — 63 years after that first band rehearsal.

""Since we were both 82 years old Florraine and I decided not to wait too long"" he writes detailing their travels to Hawaii Alaska the Panama Canal and the Grand Canyon. Florraine died on Nov. 17 2018 just shy of 92.

""Loneliness is a terrible thing when you live alone"" Williams writes. ""Our new life together was the right choice. In a sense Florraine and I were both 'leftovers' but leftovers can be pretty tasty after they get warmed up.""

July 04 2021 Chad Holloway PR & Media Manager

On Saturday the $10000 buy-in $10000000 GTD Wynn Millions came to a close as the final nine players from a 1328-entry field played down to a winner. The final table lasted approximately 11 hours and in the end it was Andrew Moreno walking away with the title and $1460106 in prize money.

Just before the Wynn Millions began Moreno posted the following on social media:

“In April I decided to I wanted to really focus on playing and studying live poker tournaments. I created two main goals for myself. The first was to move my career earnings to over $1 million dollars. I accomplished that with my most recent win at the venetian $1100 buy in where I bested a field of 637 players and took home $127740.

“The second goal I have this year is to get that illusive 7 figure cash I’ve been chasing. To help me accomplish this I secured a tournament coach (wishes to remain nameless) that I am very excited about working with. A special thank you to Kristy Moreno. We’re such a great team together. I’m beyond grateful to share in parenthood with you. See you soon little man. Oh and by the way you’ve already cashed in a tournament and been in a winners photo with your parents. So please remember we are cool when you’re a teenager.”

Moreno the husband of former PokerNews hostess Kristy Arnett (they’re expecting their first child) managed to accomplish his second goal in the Wynn Millions.

“I’m grateful above all else” said Moreno who began the final table seventh in chips. “I think just declaring what I wanted to do was really important to me because I believed in myself and I wanted to hold myself accountable … I’m just so shocked it happened so quickly.”

He continued: “I’ll be playing up until and through the WSOP until my son is born and then I’m taking a nice long break. This is what I will always remember. I’m just happy to have all these people here with me.”

Prior to the win Moreno had $1056155 in lifetime earnings according to The Hendon Mob. In May he finished sixth in the MSPT Sycuan Casino in San Diego for $20281 and then placed 22nd in June’s MSPT Venetian $1600 Main Event for $18627. Just four days later he broke through with a win when he took down the Venetian DeepStack Championship Poker Series Event #58: $1100 UltimateStack for $127740 then the fourth-largest score of his career.

In 2015 he finished 28th in the WSOP Main Event for $211821 and a year later took sixth in the 2016 WSOP Event #41: $1500 Monster Stack for a previous career-high $219632. In March 2019 Moreno came close to WSOP gold again when he finished runner-up to Sean Yu in the WSOP Circuit Bicycle Casino $1700 Main Event for $130295.

The Wynn Millions Final Table

Final Table Action

It took 53 hands before the first final table elimination which happened when Lion Yiming Lee lost a race with king-queen to the pocket sevens of France’s Julian Milliard-Feral. Two dozen hands later poker pro Joe Kuether bowed out after shoving the small blind with queen-four and failing to get there against Jaime Cervantes who called from the big with ace-seven.

Despite that win Dervantes was the next to go on Hand #88 after losing a massive flip with pocket queens to the Big Slick of Toby Lewis. Lewis then dispatched Philip Shing in sixth place after the former shoved the small blind with king-eight and held against the latter who called off with jack-nine suited.

At the dinner break Clayton Maguire held a near 2:1 chip lead over Lewis and Salim Admon while Moreno and Milliard-Feral sat on the short stacks. The latter wound up busting in a flip situation when ace-queen failed to get there against the pocket tens of Lewis but Moreno started to climb out of his hole.

In a pivotal hand his pocket queens held against the pocket nines of Salim Admon to send the latter out in fourth place. That hand gave Moreno a stack to compete against Maguire and Lewis so it didn’t take long before the idea of a deal was discussed.

The final three players each locked up seven-figure scores while shaving 10% of the prize pool to continue to play for – the winner would receive an additional $313000 and the runner-up $100907.

Maguire who began the final table as the chip leader would go on to dispatch Lewis setting up a heads-up match against Moreno. After securing a double to take over the chip lead Moreno had Maguire on the ropes. In the final hand Maguire got his stack in with ace-king only to fall to the ace-queen of Moreno after two queens appeared on the board.

“It was probably the best event I’ve ever played as far as the structure and the room” said Moreno. “The floors listen to the players a lot and there was always an open-ended conversation. Everything about the tournament was pristine.”

Moreno and his supporters.

There’s never a wrong time to win $1.4 million but Andrew Moreno sure found a right one.

With his wife Kristy who is eight months pregnant watching Moreno claimed the Wynn Millions title late Saturday at the Wynn poker room beating a field of 1328 entries to take home $1460105.

Moreno outdrew Clayton Maguire in two huge hands heads-up in the $10000 buy-in No-limit Hold’em event. First Moreno called all-in with ace-ten against Maguire’s ace-queen and hit a ten on the flop to take a big chip lead.

Then Moreno won the tournament when he called all-in with ace-queen against Maguire’s ace-king. Maguire flopped a king and Moreno flopped a queen then Moreno turned three-of-a-kind to secure the win.

Maguire still took home $1443757 as part of a deal the players negotiated three-handed.

Moreno credited his unborn son for luck turning his way.

“I feel like ‘baby run good’ is a real thing” he said. “I’ve been running very well. As soon as she got pregnant I started running really well. Maybe the universe wants me to take some time off from poker and spend it with my family.”

Moreno started focusing on tournaments in April with two goals: to cross $1 million in career earnings then snag a seven-figure score in a single event. He met the first goal by winning an $1100 event at The Venetian in June for $127740 and he accomplished the second Saturday.

Moreno held one of the shorter stacks for most of the day but he finally got into contention when he eliminated Salim Admon in fourth with pocket queens against pocket nines.

The three remaining players then negotiated for more than an hour about reducing the disparity of the original tournament payouts of $2018866 for first $1248886 for second and $871314 for third. Wynn tournament director Ray Pulford worked with the players but insisted that they still had to have a financial incentive to continue and play for the title.

Eventually the players agreed to guaranteed payouts based on their chip stacks — $1342850 for Maguire $1235204 for Toby Lewis and $1147105 for Moreno — with an additional $313000 going to the winner and $100907 to second place.

The Wynn Millions had a $10 million guaranteed prize pool among the largest ever for a poker tournament. The Super High Roller Bowl at the Aria in 2016 had a $15 million guarantee and the World Series of Poker Main Event had what amounted to a more than $10 million guarantee in 2014 by promising that much to the winner.

The Wynn Millions needed 1064 entries to make the guarantee and reached it with room to spare. Ryan Beauregard executive director of poker operations said he expects the Wynn Millions to have a permanent place on the poker calendar.

“It’s a great number” he said. “Really happy with it and something to build for in the future.”

The Incredible Life Story Of Kirk Kerkorian,"From Great Depression Rags To Multi-Billionaire Vegas Riches. The Incredible Life Story Of Kirk Kerkorian

On June 15 2015 a billionaire named Kirk Kerkorian passed away at the age of 98. Kirk may not have had the widespread name recognition as fellow billionaires like Mark Cuban Donald Trump or Warren Buffett. And that's kind of a shame because Kirk was probably one of the most interesting billionaires who has ever walked the earth. Don't believe me? This is his incredible life story…

Early Life

Kerkor ""Kirk"" Kerkorian was born on June 6 1917 in Fresno California. His parents were dirt poor Armenian immigrant farmers trying to survive the Great Depression. When Kirk was three years old the family lost their land. They moved to Los Angeles to seek better prospects. His father eventually operated a fruit stand. The family was so poor that Kirk was forced to drop out of school in the 8th grade to get a job.

When he wasn't working Kirk took up boxing as a hobby. His older brother trained him to the point where Kirk was able to win the Pacific Welterweight boxing championship under the name ""Rifle Right Kerkorian"".

""I didn't go to school but I went into buying and selling businesses at an early age. I got into a lot of different businesses. I had to have a lot of luck."" – Kirk Kerkorian

World War II and Aviation

When he wasn't boxing he was installing water hearing furnaces. At 22 he installed a furnace for a many name Ted O'Flaherty who happened to be an amateur pilot. One day Ted invited Kirk to go flying with him along the California coast. Something magical happened during that flight because from that point on Kirk was hooked on planes.

With World War II looming Kirk knew that he would be the perfect age for an eventual draft that would place him in the general infantry division. Fearing the infantry would not have a high survival rate Kirk started taking flying lessons in the Mojave Desert from a woman named Pancho Barnes. He couldn't afford the lessons so as payment he agreed to milk and look after Pancho's cows.

It took six months for Kirk to earn his pilot's license. He quickly joined the British Royal Air Force and began flying cargo missions that brought supplies from North America to Scotland. The planes he flew had fuel capacity for 2300 mile trips. The average length of the supply missions was 2200 miles. Not a lot of room for error. One out of every four planes that set out on this journey crashed.

Kirk was one of the lucky ones. Just seven months before he joined the Royal Air Force Kirk had never been in a plane and had barely ever left California let alone the United States. By the time WWII was over he had flown 33 different types of planes logged countless hours in the air and traveled to four continents.

During the war Kirk was very thrifty with his wages. In fact he managed to save most of everything he was ever paid. When the war was over Kirk spent his entire savings $5000 to buy his own Cessna plane ($5000 in the mid 1940s is the same as $67000 today). He then began working as a general aviation pilot chauffeuring rich people from Hollywood out to Las Vegas and back.

On one of these early piloting jobs Kirk found himself in Las Vegas Nevada for the first time. He immediately became hooked on gambling. Specifically craps.

In 1947 Kirk took $60000 he managed to win at the craps tables (roughly $635000 today) and purchased a small air-charter service company called Trans International Airlines that specialized in transporting gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

Over the next 20 years Kirk's business boomed. He expanded by buying up more planes and adding new routes up and down the west coast. In 1968 he sold Trans International to the Transamerica Corporation for $104 million (roughly $707 million today).

Viva Las Vegas

Aviation wasn't Kirk's only business interest. Back in 1962 he bought 80 acres of land in Las Vegas for $960000 ($7.5 million). Four years later his plot of land was the new home for a little casino called Caesars Palace.

Kerkorian didn't actually own Caesars Palace he simply rented them the land it was built on for $2 million per year ($15 million today). When Caesars was bought in 1968 Kirk agreed to sell the land for a $9 million payday ($61 million today).

One year before the Caesars sale Kirk purchased 82 acres of land on the strip for $5 million and began construction of the International Hotel. When construction was complete the International was the largest hotel in the world. Barbra Streisand and Elvis were the hotel's first performers. Elvis sold out every single show 4200 seats per show for 30 days straight.

Kirk soon came to own the Flamingo Hotel. He sold both the Flamingo and the International to the Hilton Hotel Corporation.

In 1969 Kirk bought movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer. He then opened the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Once again he broke the record for world's largest hotel. This is not the MGM Grand we know today because in 1986 Kirk sold his MGM Grand properties in Las Vegas and Reno to Bally Manufacturing for $594 million ($1.3 billion today). The Las Vegas property was renamed Bally's. He then built the MGM Grand most of us know today.

In 2000 Kerkorian bought Steve Wynn's Mirage Resorts for $6.4 billion. In 2004 he bought Mandalay Resorts for $4.8 billion.

Today MGM Resorts International owns the Bellagio the current MGM Grand New York – New York Circus Circus Mandalay Bay The Luxor The Excalibur and the Mirage. They now also own the newly built Las Vegas CityCenter complex.

During the last decades of his life Kirk Kerkorian literally owned more than half of all the hotel rooms in Las Vegas.

Kirk lived most of his later years on a 30 acre estate in Beverly Hills. He almost never gave interviews and rarely appeared in public. He donated $180 million to his homeland of Armenia after the country experienced a devastating earthquake in 1989. His charitable foundation distributed more than $400 million to various causes over the years. Despite performing these impressive acts of charity Kirk has famously never allowed anything to be named in his honor.

Kirk Kerkorian died earlier today at the age of 98. His most recent personal net worth was $4.2 billion. That's a far cry from the dirt poor Fresno farm boy he started out as! During his life Kirk was a boxer pilot war hero gambler hotel tycoon auto tycoon movie studio tycoon philanthropist and much more. We should all be so lucky to live such an impressive and long life as Mr. Kerkorian.

This month brings a new retrospective “Start Walkin’” of the mid-’60s sides she recorded with maverick singer/producer Lee Hazlewood (on the collectors’ label Light in the Attic) originally for her father Frank Sinatra’s label Reprise. The title of course comes from her oft-covered 1965 hit “These Boots Are Made for Walking” one of pop’s strongest and sexiest feminist anthems.

“That was the real me. That other person I’d been that Nancy Nice Lady person was stuck in a rut” she said in a phone interview this week. “Once I was allowed to be myself everything changed. Lee had been doing that song himself singing it in saloons throughout the country and I said ‘You know I don’t think that’s very attractive.’ Something about a woman singing it sounds better. I tended to want to do songs that were primarily sung by guys — I didn’t realize that was a feminist thing at the time but in retrospect it definitely was. And to tell you the truth it was great fun.”

“I will say that my wardrobe was very deliberate. I’d been to London a couple of times and fell in love with Mary Quant designs so I came back to L.A. with some great mod clothes from there. And I think I helped change fashion in Los Angeles. That was around the time that Twiggy was breaking through. She and I were wearing very much the same kind of clothes with the miniskirts. That started a trend and it’s never gone away. Girls still like to show their legs and guys like to look at them.”

She and Hazlewood (who died in 2007) made an odd musical couple. “Beauty and the beast is what he called us.” Another bit of magic they did together was the duet “Some Velvet Morning” now a cult classic and also part of the reissue.

“Nothing ever surprised me when it came to Lee Hazlewood’s lyrics. He was into the drug culture; LSD was a big deal at that time. What struck me about that song was the four-four three-four time change back and forth that was pretty fascinating. Lyrically it was more a nursery rhyme but I always believed it was about the drugs.”

But she points out that she never indulged herself. “I never did and I don’t know that Lee Hazlewood did either — he was a Chivas Regal kind of guy. I think I tried pot once and it just made me hungry.”

She also never romanced Elvis Presley offscreen but their movie together (1968’s “Speedway”) evinced some definite chemistry.

“We first met years before doing did my dad’s TV show together when he was welcomed home from the Army. So we were really good friends and we had a little history. We had a lot of fun together and if he had not been married it would have been completely different. But there are rules about that and I wasn’t going to be the other woman no way.”

Sinatra last recorded in 2004 when she made an album with an alt-rock dream team including U2 Morrissey and Sonic Youth.

“That was my daughter’s influence. She said ‘Mom there’s a whole group of popular musicians who love your work and I think we should explore it and get together with them.’ Morrissey is a unique special person. He showed up at my hotel in London with his arms full of my albums asking for me to sign them. But I knew who he was my daughter grew up with a Smiths poster over her bed for years.”

Now 81 and no longer touring she’s devoted much of her energy in recent years to representing all things Sinatra online.

“It’s been my job to keep the flame. That’s what my dad asked me to do. He said ‘I want people to know what I do.’ He was very humble and didn’t know what a force he was. But he felt close to his fans very much so and he credited them with his success. I remember actually sitting on my dad’s bed asking him questions that people wrote in and he’d answer. That was our first real encounter with fans on the internet and during that time he said ‘Please keep in touch with them.’ That’s what I’ve been doing ever since.”",,,

The pastoral setting is not a restored prairie. It's a solar installation in rural Chisago County — one of the 16 in Minnesota run by Enel Green Power a global renewable energy company based in Rome that supplies Xcel Energy.

In Minnesota at least the solar farms are generating more than electricity. Instead of turf bare ground or gravel the land beneath Enel's Minnesota installations were all seeded with native pollinator-friendly grasses sedges and wildflowers. They've matured into rich native habitats for bees insects and butterflies — in a landscape desperately short of them.

Minnesota state agencies such as the Public Utilities Commission Department of Natural Resources and the Board of Soil and Water Resources all encourage such plantings at solar sites as a matter of policy.

""One of the fastest growing trends in solar nationwide is doing better than turf grass under and around the panels"" said Rob Davis director of the Center for Pollinators in Energy at the St. Paul nonprofit Fresh Energy. That could be food or other types of vegetation.

Minnesota pioneered standards for what constitutes pollinator-friendly vegetation at solar sites — similar to standards for organic products — following legislation in 2016 to prevent greenwashing or false environment-friendly claims Davis said.

The Monarch Joint Venture in St. Paul is among the groups studying the results.

Laura Lukens the group's national monitoring coordinator has been at several Enel sites with her clipboard this summer taking inventories of the quality and abundance of flowering plants and milkweed and the native pollinators using them. She's also tracking the difference between the habitats growing directly under the panels vs. the ones in between. Lukens said she's excited by what she's seen.

""We've been seeing great things in terms of the floral community and the pollinators using the habitat there"" Lukens said. ""I saw monarchs breeding at every site I visited.""

On Wednesday the air was thick with life at Enel's Chisago County site near Shafer. The black-eyed Susans were in bloom for example mixed in with Canada wild rye and fox sedge and other native plants.

The vegetation cools the solar panels boosting electrical output as the long-rooted perennials help rebuild the soil explained Enel regional manager Jacob Fehlen walking the rows.

The array — one of the company's smaller sites — was built on 25 acres of converted farmland with 16632 panels that pivot to face the sun. They generate enough megawatts to power more than 600 nearby homes Fehlen said.

Like all of Enel's Minnesota sites it was seeded with a native pollinator-friendly mix by Otsego-based MNL formerly known as Minnesota Native Landscapes. MNL has taken it further adding sheep herds to manage the vegetation at many of the sites.

They are Katahdins a hair sheep variety that doesn't require shearing like wool sheep said Jake Janski MNL's director of services. The ""mob grazing"" replicates both prescribed fires and bison herds controlling dead material lowering fire hazards and stimulating new growth he said. The manure fertilizes.

""This is the next phase of land management that we're trying to normalize so it's not this bizarre concept"" Janski said. ""We're trying to normalize using animals to do what animals did in nature. I'm sick of just putting Band-aids on. We're trying to fix the prairie.""

Yes the sheep draw some laughs in other states said Enel's Fehlen. The company does it because they fit with ""sustainability needs"" he said. In Texas he said Enel is looking at possibly raising the height of its solar panels to graze cattle beneath them.

The sheep do come with a few challenges. As they sauntered around the rows of panels Wednesday workers were repairing an electric fence that a few ornery rams had torn through.

Then there are coyotes which sometimes scoot under the fence through the wildlife gap at the bottom. MNL sometimes brings in a mini donkey to protect the sheep from predators.

The entire model is spreading among solar operators Janski said.

""What needs to be proven is cost competitiveness over the long term"" he said. ""The industry is trying to vet out the long term.""

In fact it wasn’t until a road game in Montreal early in his first year in charge that Guerin truly realized Eriksson Ek’s importance.

“He blocked three Shea Weber slap shots in a row” Guerin recalled. “That kind of solidified what kind of guy he was in my mind. You don’t do that without having great character and great courage and from that moment on I really believed that he’s a guy that is going to help us win.”

On Friday afternoon Guerin put his money where his mouth is signing Eriksson Ek to an 8-year $42 million contract that will keep the 24-year-old forward from Sweden with the Wild through the 2028-29 season. Overall the contract negotiations went very smoothly and in the end both sides got what they wanted.

“We didn’t know where it was going to land when we first started talking” Guerin said. “This took three days. It just shows how much Joel wants to be here.”

Asked why he felt comfortable signing a max deal in terms of length Eriksson Ek said “I think we can build something really good.”

And Eriksson Ek is a big reason for that. To say he had a breakout season would be putting it lightly. He continued to star defensively game in and game out while flashing a scoring touch offensively that hadn’t yet been seen in his previous four NHL seasons.

“I’m just trying to get better every day” Eriksson Ek said. “Hopefully I still develop. Just trying to do my best to do so. I’m working hard and doing the right things in the summer to try to be as ready as I can when next season starts.”

Though there might be some pressure on Eriksson Ek moving forward — especially after scoring a career-high 19 goals last season — he’s taking those expectations in stride with a smile on his face.

“He’s a real pro” Guerin said. “At 24 years old he’s not even a finished product. He’s still a young man. Just the way he takes care of himself mentally and physically and the way he approaches the game and shows up on a consistent basis (you can see) there’s still more to come.”

While the pressure on the Wild now shifts to signing young snipers Kirill Kaprizov and Kevin Fiala — which won’t be the easiest thing in the world — the fact Guerin was able to lock up Eriksson Ek so quickly is something he can feel good about.

“It says a lot about what we’ve started to build here” Guerin said. “I think the players are really excited about what’s going on. You’ve seen guys like (Jared Spurgeon) sign long-term deals. (Marcus Foligno) signed before he went to UFA. You saw Ryan Hartman take a three-year deal with a bit of a pay cut because he wants to be here. And Joel takes an eight-year deal because he wants to be here and he believes in what’s going on. For me as the general manager it makes me feel good about what’s going on and the type of people we have here. I’m very excited about it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5rYXRvZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvYXNrLXVzLWZyZWUtcHJlc3Mtd2lsbGluZy10by1yZXVzZS1wbGFzdGljLW5ld3NwYXBlci1iYWdzL2FydGljbGVfODIwYzA5NTItZDlkYi0xMWViLTlkZTAtNGZhMGRlYzVhNjJmLmh0bWzSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFua2F0b2ZyZWVwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2Fzay11cy1mcmVlLXByZXNzLXdpbGxpbmctdG8tcmV1c2UtcGxhc3RpYy1uZXdzcGFwZXItYmFncy9hcnRpY2xlXzgyMGMwOTUyLWQ5ZGItMTFlYi05ZGUwLTRmYTBkZWM1YTYyZi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask Us: Free Press willing to reuse plastic newspaper bags,"Mankato MN (56001)

The pandemic definitely dampened that status for some especially the café brands that hadn't sustained loyal followings quite strongly enough into this decade (unlike Starbucks). Fortunately after several years of floundering a well known French-American bakery chain has narrowly escaped its final fate. An unexpected fast food franchisee has just stepped in not only to resuscitate this popular bakery but to give it a whole new life.

Legend has it that the French bakery equipment manufacturer Pavailler established Au Bon Pain in Boston in 1976 as an exhibition piece to demonstrate the utility of their equipment. Au Bon Pain grew incrementally throughout the late 1970s with locations in New York City and Hackensack New Jersey. Though it wasn't really known as a particularly massive money-maker in 1993 Au Bon Pain was acquired by Panera Bread's predecessor St. Louis Bread Company.

The Saddest Restaurant Closures in Your State

Even from that point the Au Bon Pain brand—which coins itself as ""the bakery café""—didn't become much of a mover and shaker… though it is largely regarded as a reliable fixture when city dwellers and airport travelers have a craving for a croissant or basic coffee. In recent years many Americans saw their nearby Au Bon Pain locations disappearing altogether or being converted to Panera stores. Today it's reported that Au Bon Pain currently has 171 locations throughout the U.S. mainly in city-center locations and airports plus nearly another 80 in India and Thailand. In the past few years rumors swirled to suggest the bakery chain just wasn't high on consumers' radars while the shifting tide of the pandemic surely had an impact too.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

However just as some spectators predicted that Au Bon Pain was about to collapse a buyer stepped in. Restaurant Dive has reported that on Tuesday Ampex Brands closed on the purchase of Au Bon Pain.

Ampex Brands is a franchisee of Yum Brands which is the company that owns Taco Bell Pizza Hut and KFC. With their Yum-brand business combined with several 7-Eleven locations it's reported Ampex Brands runs 400 restaurants and convenience stores. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Ampex Brand's purchase of Au Bon Pain includes approximately $60 million in assets.

It's a departure from the fast-food convenience Ampex has turned into a reported $500 million annual business to date but the company says they'll use Au Bon Pain to provide ""superior quality food that is also good for you"" to patrons who are looking for a snack at any time of day.

What does this mean for fans of Au Bon Pain? It's not clear how many of the current locations will remain active but it actually sounds as though the new owner is baking plans to take the brand bigger. Ampex itself will franchise Au Bon Pain out to a reported 131 potential new locations starting by growing Au Bon Pain along the East Coast taking it into locations like hospitals university campuses and transportation hubs. It seems the partnership could also see Au Bon Pain products sold in some of Ampex's 7-Eleven stores.

Ampex CEO Tabbassum Mumtaz said Panera's loss is his company's gain calling the Au Bon Pain acquisition ""a great opportunity to reposition a legacy brand."" Mumtaz added: ""The bakery café category will rebound and Au Bon Pain is well-positioned to grow.""

According to Mondoweiss Representative Tim Burchett cosigned a letter with representatives Greg Steube and Maria Salazar and sent it to the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division.

The letter claims according to Mondoweiss that there are “serious concerns” that Americans who donate to BDS-affiliated organisations could be financing terrorist groups.

The letter cited the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) and the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) claiming that they have links to “designated terror groups” like Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad.

Opinion: Don’t look away from Palestine

Mondoweiss reported that US President Biden has stated that he opposes the BDS movement. “I agree. We must stand with our ally Israel” Mondoweiss reported him posting on Twitter.

The website also cited Burchett’s response when asked about the BDS movement during a 2018 interview: “They totally disgust me. I remain loyal to Israel” he asserted.

In March a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the pro-Israeli Jewish National Fund along with 12 American citizens targeting the BNC and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR) for alleged connections to terrorism. The judge however said the claims were “not persuasive”.

""Up until now we have been using public barriers at certain habitats to ensure social distancing along with enhanced PPE worn by staff to protect our susceptible species from COVID-19. We're happy and relieved to now be able to better protect our animals with this vaccine and are very thankful to Zoetis for not only creating it but for donating it to us and dozens of other AZA-accredited zoos across the U.S."" said Dr. Alex Herman vice president of veterinary services at the Oakland Zoo.

Zoetis plans to donate more than 11000 doses of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health and well-being of more than 100 mammalian species living in nearly 70 zoos more than a dozen conservatories sanctuaries academic institutions and government organizations across 27 states.

""We are proud that our innovative research and development work and vaccine donations can help veterinary professionals within the zoo community continue to provide a high standard of care to the primates big cats and many other species they care for and reduce the risk of COVID-19"" said Dr. Mike McFarland chief medical officer at Zoetis.

The experimental vaccine has been authorized for use on a case-by-case basis by the USDA as well as appropriate state veterinarians and comes after the San Diego Zoo requested help in January following an outbreak of COVID-19 among the zoo's great apes.

""When the first dog was infected with COVID-19 in Hong Kong last year we immediately began to work on a vaccine that could be used in domestic animals and in eight months we completed our initial safety studies which we presented at the World One Health Congress last year. While thankfully a COVID-19 vaccine is not needed in pets or livestock at this time we are proud that our work can help zoo animals at risk of COVID-19"" said Mahesh Kumar senior vice president global biologics at Zoetis. ""More than ever before the COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the important connection between animal health and human health and we continue to monitor for emerging infectious diseases that can impact animals as well as people.""

Although the virus is the same as in human vaccines vaccines for animals vary based on the carrier that is used according to the Oakland Zoo.

""The unique combination of antigen and carrier ensures safety and efficacy for the species in which a vaccine is used"" said the zoo in the statement.

Oakland Zoo officials announced this week that they had received a substantial shipment of the experimental 'rona jab manufactured by pharmaceutical company Zoetis ... which presumably cooked their recipe up specifically for wild creatures across the board.

We say that because OZ says it's already administered the vaccine to a good portion of their furry friends ... including their lions tigers bears and ferrets. Oh my indeed!

The zoo was one of the first recipients of 11000 doses Zoetis made (and tested) ... and apparently more are being rolled out to other animal facilities in the coming weeks. This is a donation BTW -- for this time around at least -- so very generous on Zoetis' part.

The USDA has said this vaccine -- which was reportedly first tested out on minks -- can be used on a case-by-case basis ... but it clearly works to a high degree because Oakland is straight-up inoculating their animals seemingly en masse. It's unclear if more animal types will be included at some point -- but ya gotta figure they will be if the trial run goes well.

This is big news ... not just because different animals at zoos have contracted the virus -- including tigers and primates at places like the SD Zoo (which got a small shipment of Zoetis earlier this year to test on the latter) -- but it could have ramifications for dogs/cats.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L29ha2xhbmQtem9vLXZhY2NpbmF0aW5nLWFuaW1hbHMtY292aWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oakland Zoo vaccinating animals against COVID,"California's Oakland Zoo has begun vaccinating bears big cats and ferrets against COVID-19 after being donated doses from Zoetis of its experimental shots.
