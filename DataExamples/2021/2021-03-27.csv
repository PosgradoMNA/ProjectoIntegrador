3M became a giant in the military earplug market when it bought Aearo Technologies in 2008. The Maplewood-based company maintains that Combat Arms plugs were designed properly and worked as they should.

The size of the earplug litigation — nearly 230000 claims are pending before a federal court in Pensacola Fla. — dwarfs most mass torts. The case is being closely watched in legal circles.

""Anytime you get a case with this many people involved people turn their heads"" said Alexandra Lahav a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. ""It's an incredibly large number of complaints.""

If the verdicts go badly for 3M damages could tally in the hundreds of millions of dollars if not more based on the outcome of other large mass tort cases in recent years.

Judge M. Casey Rodgers of U.S. District Court for northern Florida will hear three consolidated claims in the first bellwether trial. It's expected to last through April. A bellwether trial is set for May and a third in June.

The plaintiffs in the first trial are Army veterans who claim hearing loss and tinnitus due to allegedly defective Combat Arms CAEv2 earplugs.

The CAEv2 plugs are the second version of Combat Arms which were developed by Aearo and sold to the government from 1999 to 2015 when 3M abruptly discontinued the product.

The lawsuits are roped together in a ""multidistrict litigation"" or ""MDL"" case which is used in the federal court system for complex product liability matters with many separate claims. MDL cases commonly feature bellwether trials which set a tone for resolving all claims.

""The parties will use these cases as a way of gauging their arguments and the strength of their positions"" said Henry Blair a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul. ""The bellwether is a way to gauge a settlement.""

Lahav said that the more variance in bellwether trial outcomes the more difficult for lawyers to forge a settlement. ""You might see 10 to 15 trials before they are ready to settle."" But ultimately ""they always settle around the bellwether.""

As of March 15 there were 229397 separate actions within the 3M earplug case according to the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. That makes it the largest MDL ever according to Bloomberg Law.

The second largest involved 192100 claims in an asbestos MDL. But actual asbestos product liability claims total around 750000 including suits in state courts that weren't consolidated into an MDL Lahav said.

In its 2020 annual report 3M said it was defending 3130 Combat Arms suits including 14 putative class actions that together involved 12400 claims. The gap between those numbers and federal MDL data appears to be claims that have yet to served on 3M or completely vetted by the court.

""The vast majority of claimants that are being reported have not actually filed lawsuits and are solely part of an administrative docket"" 3M said in a statement.

The earplug claims against 3M were lodged after the company settled a whistleblower suit in 2018.

That suit was brought by rival earplug maker Moldex-Metric on the U.S. government's behalf after an inquiry by the Army Criminal Investigations Command. The suit claimed Aearo knew about ""dangerous design defects"" in 2000.

In a 2018 report the Army concluded that had the government known about tests Aearo had done in 2000 it may not have purchased Combat Arms earplugs. In the whistleblower settlement 3M paid a $9.1 million penalty but denied all claims and did not admit liability.

At the heart of the MDL case is the U.S. Army's request in 1999 to Aearo to shorten the plugs so they would fit in a standard-issue military carrying case. The company did so but plaintiffs claim Aearo's fix caused bigger problems.

Tests in 2000 at Aearo's Indianapolis laboratory indicated that the shorter earplug didn't always fit properly — and thus wasn't always effective — unless it was inserted in a particular way according to internal Aearo documents filed in court.

3M claims it told the military about the fitting issues and that the military was responsible for informing soldiers about the earplugs' proper fit.

Plaintiffs claim the earplugs leaked noise damaging soldiers' hearing. 3M said in a statement that the ""product was not defectively or negligently designed and did not cause injuries.""

In July Rodgers nixed a key legal strategy that 3M had planned to use: the ""government contractor defense."" It shields contractors from tort liability for defects in products designed and developed for the federal government.

3M has claimed that the Combat Arms CAEv2 was designed in close collaboration with the military.

But Rodgers ruled that the Army never issued a request for a design proposal for the earplug; and there was no contract between the Army and Aearo when a military representative told the company that the plugs needed to be shortened.

3M plans on calling three retired Army medical staffers to testify at the trial two audiologists and a doctor who's an ear specialist.

All three can testify about deficiencies in the Army's hearing program that they observed or experienced. But Rodgers ruled that none of them can make any blanket conclusions about the program.

A DELIVEROO-style drugs menu with a £2 delivery charge and a ""no Sundays"" rule a chemsex ring used to run their £3million empire can be revealed today.

Brazilian husband and wife Diego Da Souza Arruda Reis 35 and Suellen Miguez 36 funded a lavish lifestyle after making millions from their sophisticated drug business.

The couple utilised technology to provide a dial-for-drugs delivery service with dozens of moped couriers dubbed the ""Asphalt Angels"".

Drivers were organised into different WhatsApp groups and delivered to customers who picked drugs from a menu.

Reis and Miguez were both jailed for a total of 26 years on Wednesday - and now a picture of their infamous drugs list has emerged.

Customers had to place a “minimum order of £32” – made up of £30 worth of drugs plus an additional £2 delivery fee.

Clients then provided their full postcode ahead of delivery.

The menu was split into four sections – including weed cocaine MDMA and heroin.

Prices for the selection of weed ranged from £80 for 28g and went up to £190 for the same weight.

DRUGS MENU

Meanwhile 1g of ""coke"" was £55 and 10g of speed was priced at £85.

One gram of MDMA cost £20 while 100 tabs of viagra would set back customers £50.

They also sold heroin dubbed ""Hero"" for £80 a gram.

The delivery service was in operation from Monday to Saturday with opening hours being 11.30am to 10.30pm for orders.

A squad of 30 moped riders earning £730-a-week delivered the drugs from 1pm with the gang saying: ""We don't work Sundays.""

Speaking after Reis and Miguez were jailed Damaris Lakin from the CPS said: “This was a vast and highly sophisticated drug network operating as if it were a legitimate business.

“The couriers had rotas they were paid a weekly wage the operation had its own Airbnb offices and there were even ways to put forward employee suggestions and incentives for the month’s best drivers.

“There was also a menu of different drugs that customers could choose from and a customer could only purchase products from the network if they had been referred and recommended to the WhatsApp group by another member – as if part of some kind of members club.

""As such undercover police officers were unable to infiltrate the organisation.

“These convictions have been successful in bringing down a major drug network responsible for the largest seizure of ‘chem sex’ drugs in London.""

A court heard Reis and his chemsex drug queen Miguez oversaw the organised crime network (OCN) through trusted lieutenants and stayed hands-off from the day to day running.

The couple rented a £12500-a-month mansion on the exclusive private estate of St George’s Hill in Weybridge Surrey a haven for Russian oligarchs Arab oil tycoons and VIPs.

The owners of the property were unaware of any wrongdoing.

They lived in the seven-bedroom neo-Regency pile which boasted a swimming pool luxury gym and spa facilities.

The private estate has its own security as well as lawn tennis courts and a championship golf course.

The couple also had a Central London riverside apartment drove an orange Lamborghini sports car and took luxury holidays abroad.

Miguez had a Harrods account and blew a fortune shopping in designer stores like Pravda and Louis Vuitton.

Judge Nigel Seed QC jailed Miguez and Reis for 13 years each at Inner London Crown Court on Wednesday.

Police seized drugs worth more than £3million when they smashed the gang of Brazilian nationals supplying London’s clubland and gay chemsex scene.

More than 2000 litres of potentially lethal GBL worth £2.2million and the biggest ever seizure of the drug in the UK was recovered from a storage facility.

And almost £1million worth of other drugs including crystal meth cocaine ecstasy ketamine heroin LSD and cannabis were also seized.

Cops swooped in July 2018 seizing a vast quantity of drugs from five storage units.

Gang member Isabella Braga Da Silva 22 was arrested in a car carrying £500000 worth of drugs.

Da Silva was lured to the UK to work with the crime group by boyfriend Bernardo Salles 27 and the couple described themselves as a modern-day ‘Bonnie and Clyde.’

Salles managed the drug courier business while Bristol-based Carlos Libardi Da Silva 35 laundered the money and managed cash flow and wages.

Miguez Salles and money man Libardi Da Silva were all convicted of 14 counts of conspiracy to supply Class A B and C drugs in March 2019 following an eight-week trial.

Gang member Dyego Melo Dos Passos 32 got six years and eight months while Braga Da Silva was jailed for three years and eight months after they were convicted of the same offences.

Salles and Libardi Da Silva were both jailed for eight years.

Gang boss Reis pleaded guilty in December 2018. Sentencing of him and his wife and their two lieutenants was delayed for a retrial of Andre Alves 22 and sister Thainara Alves 25. Both were cleared.

(Met Police)

Six members of a Deliveroo-style drug gang who couriered and supplied drugs across London have been jailed after they were busted by police.

Detectives shut down the multi-million-pound Brazilian operation and seized what is believed to be the UK's largest haul of the chemsex drug GBL worth £2.2 million.

Customers would order from a ""menu of narcotics"" including GBL methylamphetamine cocaine ketamine heroin and cannabis and have them delivered by courier in 10 minutes while drivers were paid £730 a week to collect the drugs from Airbnbs and self-storage lockers and collect the cash for the business.

Four members of the gang - who were making millions of pounds from the enterprise - were handed prison sentences at Inner London Crown Court the Met Police said after being convicted of 14 counts of conspiracy to supply or offer to supply Class A B and C drugs after a trial.

A fifth was sentenced after previously pleading guilty to 14 counts of conspiracy to supply or offer to supply Class A B and C drugs while a sixth was jailed earlier this month after being found guilty of 14 counts of conspiracy to supply or offer to supply Class A B and C drugs and has since been deported to serve her sentence in Brazil.

Police said the high-tech drugs delivery service operated from June 2016 until the gang were arrested in July 2018.

It was run by married couple Suellen Miguez 36 and Diego Arruda Reis 35 who lived an extravagant lifestyle featuring expensive homes in London and Surrey and luxury cars including a Lamborghini.

The couple's chief lieutenants Henrique Bernardo Medina Salles 27 and Carlos Eduardo Libardi Da Silva 35 ran the day-to-day running of the drug network and managed its finances respectively.

Detectives from the Met Police’s Specialist Crime South team started investigating the gang in March 2018 after receiving a tip-off about a 'drugs phone line' being used by the group.

They worked out how the operation ran with drugs supplied from temporary accommodation booked for short periods of time generally not for longer than a week.

Between January and July 2018 the gang operated from a total of 26 different addresses across London and used five storage facilities to supply drugs to them.

They employed around 30 moped couriers working six days a week with a full-time worker earning £730 a week but fined by the gang if they were late back from their deliveries.

Police swooped on the gang between July 25 and August 20 2018 carrying out a series of arrests in Wandsworth and Newham.

Braga Da Silva was arrested on July 25 2018 after £500000 worth of drugs were found in a vehicle along with three peli-cases containing the contents of a mobile drug supply unit. Officers also seized £40000 in cash and drug equipment from the vehicle including plastic wrapping and a credit card receiver to handle card transactions.

After his arrest Diego Da Souza Arruda Reis fled to Spain on the same day. He was extradited back to the UK in December 2018 where he pleaded guilty at Inner London Crown Court.

Miguez and Libardi Da Silva were arrested on July 30 2018 while Salles was linked to the gang through police surveillance and was arrested on August 20 2018.

Cocaine heroin crystal meth GBL and cannabis worth around £3 million was seized from five different storage facilities across London. The investigation found that the gang had sold more than £2.5 million worth of drugs between 2016 and 2018.

Reis and Miguez were each jailed for 13 years while Sallas and Carlos Libardi Da Silva were both jailed for eight years and Braga Da Silva was jailed for three years.

Detective Constable Gary Smith from the Met's Specialist Crime Command said: ""These men and women were supplying dangerous drugs to vulnerable people who often didn’t know what they were taking.

""They lived a lucrative lifestyle paying £12500 in rent for a property in St George’s Hill in Weybridge and driving around in a flamboyant orange Lamborghini. Their lives will now dramatically change as they spend many years in prison.

“Drugs can cause significant and life-altering harm have a horrendously negative physical and mental impact on users and this gang were making huge profits whilst potentially destroying lives.

""We will do everything in our power to disrupt these criminals. Please keep supplying us with information either about drug dealing or about people you feel may be exploited by drug dealers.”

Inspector Allen Davis from the Met’s Honour Belief and Sex (Crime and Vulnerability) Partnership Team added: “The Met is committed to working in partnership through Project Sagamore to tackle the crime-related risk harm and vulnerability within the Chemsex context.

""The drug(s) of choice predominantly but not exclusively used in the Chemsex context are Crystal Methamphetamine Mephedrone and GHB/GBL (G). With GBL there is also a significant risk of overdose which can result in death.

“The effects of the drugs used also promote extreme behaviours leading to vulnerability and exploitation; the use affects memory recall and results in evidential difficulties and barriers to reporting attracting perpetrators to the scene as a result.

“We recognise that controlled drugs used within the Chemsex context bring a number of challenges.

""In addition to the potential harm for the individual person who engages in sexualised substance misuse of addiction and health-risk sexual behaviours chems can be weaponised to harm others (particularly GHB/GBL) and as in this case the supply attracts the involvement of Organised Criminal Networks.”

The Nsukka Professors in collaboration with friends of Gov. Ugwuanyi voluntarily paid hospital bills of discharged indigent patients in both federal and state-owned health institutions in Enugu State as well as faith-based organizations totaling over N27.3 million to commemorate the governor’s 57th birthday.

According to the President of Association of Nsukka Professors Prof. Osita Okanya the association and friends of the governor paid N16950000 medical bills of discharged indigent patients in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Ituku/Ozalla; N4900000 at Orthopedic Hospital Enugu; N2405000 at ESUT Teaching Hospital Parklane Enugu; N1000000 at Bishop Shanahan Hospital Nsukka and N2062000 at Faith Foundation Hospital Nsukka totaling over N27.3 million.

Reacting to the development the State Chairman of CAN Rev. Emmanuel Ositadinma Edeh said that the humanitarian gesture displayed by the Nsukka Professors and friends of Gov. Ugwuanyi was rare commendable and a true reflection of the governor’s governance philosophy as a peaceful humble compassionate and devout Christian “who always identifies with the elderly orphans motherless babies widows less privileged and the sick ones in different hospitals during his birthday celebration and other festive periods”.

Rev. Edeh stated that the Nsukka professors and friends of Gov. Ugwuanyi who equally organized a symposium in honour of the governor “simply demonstrated to the entire world that they have learnt so many good lessons from the life of His Excellency Rt. Hon. Dr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi both from his words and deeds”.

The CAN Chairman added that “the organizers also proved to all and sundry that they have immortalized the living legacies of the governor by visiting different hospitals in Enugu State where they paid millions of naira as bills together with other kind gestures which the governor normally showed to the less privileged ones during his birthday”.

He therefore called on other privileged persons and groups to emulate the act of kindness demonstrated by the professors and friends of Gov. Ugwuanyi by also giving generously to the poor and the needy.

“While many people are too selfish and will never have anything to do with the poor and the needy the sick and the elderly the widows and the orphans there are some who are selfless and always giving hope to the hopeless and touching the lives of the less privileged and helpless ones in the society.

“As a matter of fact His Excellency Rt. Hon. Dr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi the Governor of Enugu State is one of the people who have always identified with the elderly orphans motherless babies widows less privileged ones and the sick ones in different hospitals during their birthday celebration and other festive periods.

“The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Enugu State chapter therefore commended the Association of Nsukka Professors and friends of Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for encouraging the governor to continue caring for the needy and the less privileged at all times especially during his birthday celebration” he said.

It would be recalled that Gov. Ugwuanyi shortly after the symposium celebrated his 57th birthday with the elderly at “Our Lady of Perpetual Help” where he identified with the aged tenderly and made a donation to enable them celebrate his birthday with him.

At the symposium the governor expressed gratitude that the Nsukka professors and his friends kept faith with his standing principle “by defraying very huge hospital bills for discharged indigent patients in many hospitals across the state saying: “For this I am indeed very grateful”.

The theme of symposium chaired by former Minister of Power Prof. Chinedu Nebo was “At Peace with God and Neighbour: Understanding the Mantra of Governance in Enugu State”.

The first paper entitled: “Understanding Governor Ugwuanyi’s ‘Enugu State is in the hands of God’ Against the Backdrop of the Biblical Moses and the Literary Ezeulu of Achebe’s Arrow of God” was presented by the Vice Chancellor of Godfrey Okoye University Enugu Rev. Fr. Prof. Christian Anieke.

The second paper “From Ashua to Nrashi: An Interrogation of the Nexus between Environment Struggle and Reward among the Igbo of Nigeria” was presented by Prof. Damian Ugwutikiri Opata of the Department of English and Literary Studies University of Nigeria Nsukka.

While the third paper delivered by Rev. Fr. Emeka Chikezie Ngwoke PhD of Department of Religion and Cultural Studies University of Nigeria Nsukka was entitled “Peace and Security in Enugu State: Building on the Bedrock of Conversation”.

The First National Bank (FNB) Tanzania yesterday unveiled four packages of home loans as it seeks to make an impact in a market that faces a deficit of three million housing units.

FNB’s home completion home equity loan home switch loan and loan for buying a completed house seeks to help Tanzanians who crave for long term financing so they can own their dream houses.

Demand for modern houses in Tanzania is growing at a rate of 200000 units annually.

“Our aim is to become competitive in the market so as to attract and retain customers…with this product we will offer solutions to individuals seeking long term finances for construction purchasing and renovation of houses” the bank’s head of Products and Digital Silvest Arumasi said in the city yesterday.

The interest rates will be calculated basing on a customer’s relationship with the bank and risk profile of the borrower – apparently to be collected from the credit reference bureau and through other means. They will also be negotiable.

Sales manager Emmanuel Mongella said the loan will be paid for a period of up to 20 years and the amount to be given is 80 per cent of the total value of the activity intended to be financed.

FNB Home Loans Consultant Patricia Nguma said the package targets people from all walks of life provided that they have the capacity to repay the amount that is applied for.

Dar es Salaam residents will be the first beneficiaries of the loans as the bank – which opened its business in the country in 2011 – currently has no branches. Plans are underway to open branches in Mwanza and Arusha."

The names Lou Costello and Bud Abbott are still alive and kicking despite the fact that both men have long since died. Famously known as the duo Abbott and Costello the two made it big in the 1930s. Costello tragically died in 1959 and Abbott followed him in 1974. But their legacy lives on in pop culture today. Their most famous bit “Who’s on First?” pops up in sitcoms and their very names are famous.

Lou Costello and Bud Abbott are cultural icons

In the 2016 movie Arrival linguist Louise attempts to communicate with alien visitors. The names she and other researchers give to these visitors are Abbott and Costello. Almost 50 years after Costello’s death and a full 80 years after Abbott and Costello first made it big they’re still here. Their names are so well known that writers can drop them into sitcoms podcasts and movies without a second thought. People still know who they are.

According to Esquire by the 1940s Abbott and Costello had solidified their place in the ethos of American pop culture. They were famous and most of their most lasting material had been recorded. The pair raised money for the troops during World War II along with other celebrities of the day. The dynamic duo split in 1957 after the IRS came after them for back taxes. But really the tax issue was just the final nail in the coffin. Costello never recovered from a devastating personal tragedy in 1943 and his health and career were basically at the end of their downward spiral by the time the government came for their money.

Lou Costello was never the same after a devastating personal tragedy

In 1943 Costello’s son also named Lou Costello tragically drowned in the family pool. Costello’s wife left the baby outside in a playpen but the newly mobile one-year-old escaped while she wasn’t looking. By the time she found him in the pool it was too late. Costello was likely in shock after his son’s death. He was preparing for a show when he got the news and still went on and performed with Abbott. While some see this as a hallmark of his devastation it’s likely he hadn’t fully accepted his son’s death at the time.

Costello’s career would last another 15 years but his son’s death likely marked the beginning of a very long end. Although Abbott and Costello continued to perform Costello’s health suffered immensely. The pair may have been funny on screen but things were not well between them. They fought over money. Although both men felt that they deserved a bigger cut the IRS would have the last word.

Comedian Lou Costello died at age 52

In 1957 the IRS essentially bankrupted Abbott and Costello. They could have continued performing together despite their tax troubles. In fact keeping the act going may have been a great way to make back some money. Their ultimate split likely had less to do with taxes and more to do with their declining relationship. Costello was unwell and died just two years later. He died of heart problems in 1959.

Abbott wasn’t done however. He continued performing for two decades after he and Costello split although he would never find the same success with another partner. Abbott died in 1974. Abbott and Costello reportedly hated each other by the end of their lives yet their names are inextricably linked forever in American cultural history. They lived parallel lives yet Costello seemed plagued by tragedy including his early death. Abbott may have lived a relatively tragedy-free life comparatively but he was nothing without Costello.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdWsueWFob28uY29tL25ld3MvZmFsbC1sb3ZlLWxpc2EtcmlubmEtaGFycnktMTIwMDAwNDgxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fall in Love with Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin's Sweetest Throwback Photos,"Glasgow Live

Gov. Greg Abbott blames President Joe Biden for the surge of immigrants coming from Central America into Texas. He wants to keep out all legal asylum seekers including unaccompanied minors and return to former President Donald Trump’s harsh border policies.

If the U.S. the “beacon of liberty” kept building higher longer walls Abbott would probably be pleased. He also mentions the possibility of human trafficking and implies Trump’s disastrous disregard for immigrant rights was a better deterrent.

To pretend to be concerned about immigrant welfare and simultaneously applaud inhumane measures is astounding. The real solution lies in Central America where the U.S. helped to create instability in past decades. Our nation spent billions funding murderous regimes in Central America in the ’80s but cut assistance to reformed governments in the ’90s. Lawless gangs took hold profiting from a vibrant drug trade to the U.S. These are the same gangs that kidnap main and kill to maintain control.

To solve the problem of too many asylum-seekers at the southern border the U.S. must find ways to help Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador find stability and create jobs. Abbott and most Republicans care little about just solutions.

Abbott feigns compassion

Dear Gov. Greg Abbott twice I voted for you. After betraying Texas’ investment in green energy on an appearance with Sean Hannity and comments like the ones you’ve made on the recent border situation I cannot bring myself to do so again. I grow more disgusted with a Republican Party which transforms even moderate Republicans like you into darlings of Trump voters.

You feign compassion for the unaccompanied minors who face “unacceptable and inhumane” conditions. Yet what is your solution? Send them to Mexico where they confront the cartels who prey on them in conditions just as flagrant? Return them to their home countries where they face the atrocities that first drove them here? Or maybe transfer them to the more humane facilities Donald Trump built in his four years as president? Oh wait.

Offer real solutions governor. Do not seduce us with your pretended concern if your intent is to sacrifice these kids on the altar of political gain.

Teens are jailed not housed

The more than 2000 teenage immigrants are not going to be “housed” in the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center — they are being jailed. Does our president have a plan for what happens after 90 days? I suggest they be transported to the South Lawn of the White House.

The president’s careless and reckless immigration policy is putting all citizens at risk and his judgment poses a clear and present danger to all.

Data shows seasonal influx

Re: “Officials inspect border facilities — Bipartisan Senate group’s visit comes as number of asylum seekers spikes” March 20 news story.

The discussion of the influx of migrants at the southern border is missing a very important piece of information which was supplied by this front page article. There is a chart on page A5 that goes with this article which clearly shows that the “surge” is an annual occurrence with the peak influx shown in May 2019 during former President Donald Trump’s term with nearly 150000 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and nearly 12000 unaccompanied minors were part of that number.

The February numbers of 100000 migrants and 9400 minors crossing the border suggest a normal annual seasonal influx. It is ridiculous to blame President Joe Biden for this current surge. It is more likely a surge due to favorable weather conditions which will naturally decrease when the Texas heat kicks in.

This data should be more widely reported. Kudos to the staff of The Dallas Morning News for digging into this and providing this useful analysis. Yes we have a problem with migration but pointing fingers to the new administration is not helping. Let’s work on solving the problem please.

Treat migrants with dignity

In his comments Gov. Greg Abbott resorts to using fear to deter the Dallas community’s support for migrants. Teenagers and children who come to this country seeking asylum and opportunity should be met with humanity not punishment. Our immigration policies must not be driven by our fears anxieties and insecurities.

As a descendant of Mexican immigrants and member of Amnesty International I know that no person should be held in detention based on their immigration status. Emergency facilities aren’t a suitable home for people especially children. The immigration system as it exists now holds unaccompanied children in temporary facilities in flagrant violation of their human rights. We as a community have a moral obligation to correct this injustice and ensure that all migrants are treated with dignity respect and fairness.

Investment in community-based support services and compassionate alternatives to detention must become the norm. The standard of our immigration system should be freedom not detention. While reformation will take time children who are in detention need access to education medical care legal services and social services coupled with fair and just access to safety.

Proud of president not senators

What does it tell us when Sen. John Cornyn complains that the “crisis” at the border was caused by the Biden administration that is treating immigrants in a humane manner? I am so proud Joe Biden is my president and so embarrassed that Cornyn and Ted Cruz represent my state in the Senate.

Enough whining solve problems

Crises or no crises if our state and national leaders including Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn really want to “lean in” on immigration why don’t they propose meaningful immigration reform? They are paid by all of us to solve problems not just whine about them! Enough with the back and forth let’s solve the problem for the long term.

Carol Moss Frisco

Where’s the transparency?

Joe Biden’s campaign message of softer immigration policies has signaled to migrants around the world that they would soon be offered a “get into America free” card. The message from the White House is “don’t come now” but the underlying message is “you can come later.” And the word is out that once inside the United States immigrants will receive free health care housing food and an array of social services all courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. And now we are paying $86 million to house immigrants in hotels.

While the Biden administration continues to deny there is a problem at the border they have simultaneously tried to keep the public from knowing how desperate the situation really is. You know things have reached critical mass when even the liberal press and some Democrats are decrying the lack of coverage and secrecy surrounding the conditions in the detention sites.

What happened to Biden’s promise of transparency?

MHA Jim Dinn who won re-election stands by her side. (Heather Gillis/CBC)

Shortly after learning Saturday that she lost her seat by 53 votes to Liberal John Abbott NDP Leader Alison Coffin told a small and sombre crowd that it was a historic day — but for all the wrong reasons and troubling ones at that.

""It will serve as a resounding lesson in democracy. It will be the dark day in our history telling us we must do better"" she said at a podium at the Alt Hotel in downtown St. John's.

""Our democratic sensibilities have been assailed amid a pandemic. We have the lowest voter turnout ever. Thousands more are complaining about the vote. Thousands more again are feeling disenfranchised.""

Coffin is correct when it comes to voter turnout — just 48 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot in an election that saw a last-minute shift to mail-in voting. The campaign dragged on for 10 weeks because of a spike in COVID-19 cases just days before Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were due to go to the polls.

Prior to this election the lowest voter turnout in a provincial election was 55 per cent.

Coffin had hammered Liberal Premier Andrew Furey about the timing of the election which he called Jan. 15. COVID-19 case counts remained low until the week of Feb 8 when an outbreak caused a dramatic spike and pushed the province into lockdown and in-person voting was suspended at first in almost half of the 40 districts a mere 12 hours before polls opened.

Various issues — voting deadlines extended four times people not receiving ballots or receiving too many some people allowed to vote by phone — plagued the 10-week campaign.

On Friday NDP president Kyle Rees claimed ""an unprecedented number"" had been spoiled. Elections NL said the claim has no basis. The NDP also claimed scrutineers were not being permitted to see vote tally sheets used to record results.

WATCH | Alison Coffin had caustic criticism of Andrew Furey in her concession speech:

Alison Coffin says 'dark' outcome for democracy in N.L. vote Duration 7:47 Defeated NDP leader addresses supporters in St. John's

""Andrew Furey's leadership and administration will be forever tarnished by the lingering questions posed by this election"" Coffin said.

""But Newfoundlanders and Labradorians will always question this election sure we're still talking about the Confederation vote"" she said.

Heart and soul conviction and values

Coffin pivoted to a more positive approach when speaking of her own party and candidates.

""New Democrats put their heart and soul into a campaign ran on conviction and values. We ran on transparency and accountability to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador"" she said.

NDP Leader Alison Coffin paused her campaigning in January to take in her regularly scheduled hockey game. (Newfoundland and Labrador NDP)

She listed off campaign promises including a dental care plan for seniors and a $15/hour minimum wage. She listed many of the NDP candidates by name including the two who won their seats and will return to the House of Assembly: Labrador West's Jordan Brown and St. John's Centre' Jim Dinn. In 2019 Brown squeaked out a win via a recount by just two votes. This time around he won handily by 579 votes.

""They will fight for everyday people of Newfoundland and Labrador. You have a voice in them"" Coffin said.

She added ""I will be here to help them however and whenever I can.""

'I have enjoyed every single minute'

Coffin was at times emotional on Saturday during her speech — a far cry from her jubilance in the May 2019 election upon learning she won.

""This is a new era"" Coffin said at the time of that victory.

She had stepped in shortly before that election after Gerry Rogers decided to leave politics.

Speaking with CBC Saturday Rogers called Coffin's defeat a ""loss to the province.""

""Alison has been a great politician"" adding she is someone who had a great handle on the economic situation on the province.

Coffin said it's been an honour to have served in the legislature for the last two years.

""I know in my heart and in my soul that two years ago I made the right decision to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador you deserve better than you have gotten from decades of Liberal and Conservative governments"" she said.

""I have enjoyed every single minute of this experience every conversation and every smile will be remembered for years to come quite fondly for that.""

Coffin did not say what's next for her.

She closed her speech with thanking her volunteer and campaign team.

But also took a parting shot at Furey and her perceived lack of his transparency.

""Today we saw the election results as they are today. Monday may bring something new. Probably not the Greene report"" she said referring to the delay in an interim report from a team looking at economic restructuring chaired by Moya Greene.

It is most in demand these days and in the upcoming years people will see many products related to AI as many tech companies have on going exciting projects related to this. Tech giants that are working on the future of AI also include Google Microsoft Facebook Accenture and of course Apple. We all know that Apple is one of the leading tech companies out there and the brand never ever loses on an opportunity to jump on something that has a bright future ahead for example Artificial Intelligence. Apple has been seen to invest heavily in the field of Artificial Intelligence. According to GlobalData's report  the number companies that Apple have bought from the years 2016 to 2020 makes it the tech giant having ownership of most amount of AI companies.The reason why these tech giants are so focused into AI and its associated companies is because AI is pretty much the main focus these days and it is well known that the future of the tech world lies in AI that is the reason why the market of Artificial Intelligence is in so much chaos these days so every other company out there wants to overpower the other with their AI developments leading to a major competition in the market at the moment. Amazon’s Alexa Google’s Assistant Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri have contributed a lot to this competition.CB Insights collected some insights and found out that there have been a total of 635 artificial intelligence investments in the last decade with a major increase of 38% in last year.It has been found that Apple has bought at least 25 AI companies and on the other hand Google has bought only 14 in the same time period. Google got hold of many well-known AI companies like DeepMind Technologies Api.ai and Superpod to develop Artificial Intelligence products and to improve the capabilities of Google Assistant. Other major tech giants that bought AI companies also include Microsoft with having bought 10 AI startups Facebook bought 8 and Amazon in total bought 7 AI startups. Out of the many tech companies out there these are the ones that are dominating in this field of Artificial Intelligence especially.The Senior Analyst on the Thematic Research Team at Global Data Sir Nicklas Nilsson feels that because Apple’s Siri is shadowed by Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa in terms of smartness Apple has decided beforehand to be in the lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence that is why Apple is dominating in the area of AI company acquisitions.Read next: Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G are among the best rated phones of 2021,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2N5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHkvZXRoaWNhbC1oYWNraW5nLXNhbGFyeS1pbi1pbmRpYS1pbi0yMDIxLWZvci1mcmVzaGVycy1leHBlcmllbmNlZNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5L2V0aGljYWwtaGFja2luZy1zYWxhcnktaW4taW5kaWEtaW4tMjAyMS1mb3ItZnJlc2hlcnMtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethical Hacking Salary in India in 2021: For Freshers & Experienced,With the increase in computer hacking government organisations financial institutions and renowned companies recruit skilled ethical hackers to keep their information safe and secured.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months Adobe's ROIC was 28.67 while its WACC came in at 7.52. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Adobe is shown below:

These tools have a flyout menu indicated by a small arrow in the lower-right corner of the tool. To access these additional tools click your mouse button until the flyout menu appears then select the desired tool.

Instructions in this article apply to Adobe InDesign 2020.

Indesign Frame Tools vs. Shape Tools

The tools work the same way but draw different shapes. Don't confuse the frame tools with the Rectangle Ellipse and Polygon shape tools. The frame tools create boxes (or frames) for graphics. The Rectangle Ellipse and Polygon tools draw shapes to fill or outline with color.

To access these tools using a keyboard command use F for frames and use M for shapes.

How to Use the Frame Tool

To use any of the frame tools select the Frame Tool in the Toolbox select a blank space in the workspace and then drag the pointer to draw the shape.

Holding Shift while you drag constrains the frame tool in the following ways:

Hold Shift while drawing with the Rectangle Frame Tool to create a perfectly square frame.

The frames created with the Rectangle Frame Ellipse Frame or Polygon Frame can hold text or graphics. Use the Type Tool to make the frame a text frame.

How to Place an Image in a Frame

Place an image in a frame using one of these methods:

Draw the Frame and Then Place the Image

Draw a frame by selecting a frame tool and dragging the mouse in the workspace. Select the frame you drew. Go to File > Place. Choose an image and select Open.

Select the Image and Select Automatic Placement

Go to File > Place without drawing any frames. Choose an image and select Open. Select anywhere on the workspace. The picture is automatically placed into a rectangular frame that is sized to fit the picture.

Resize a Frame or Resize a Graphic in a Frame

When you select an image in a frame with the Selection Tool you see a bounding box that is the bounding box of the image's Rectangular frame. If you select the same image with the Direct Selection Tool instead of selecting the frame that contains the picture select the picture inside the frame. You'll see a reddish-colored bounding box which is the bounding box of the image.

Resize only the frame but not the placed image by choosing the Selection Tool and dragging a corner or handle of the frame.

Resize a Frame With Text

Frames can also hold text. To resize a text frame:

Select the frame that contains the text and double-click any handle to reduce or expand the frame automatically so the text fits inside it.

If the frame is too large for the text that it holds double-click a handle to snap the frame to the end of the text.

If the frame is too small to display the text double-click a handle to expand the frame until it displays all the text.

Use the Shape Tools

The shape tools are often confused with the frame tools. Press and hold the Rectangle Tool to view a flyout menu to access the Ellipse and Polygon tools.

The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Torchlight Energy Resources is -41.5% which ranks in the bottom 10% of the companies in Oil & Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -145.2% which ranks in the bottom 10% of the companies in Oil & Gas industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Torchlight Energy Resources's return on invested capital is -10.14 and its cost of capital is 13.22. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Torchlight Energy Resources is shown below:

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

Need for Chips Sales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Automotives Computing Revenue $500B Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Note: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

From Horsepower to Chip Power Modern cars are relying more on electronics that include semiconductors 2010 2020 2030 2000 All automotive electronics: 18% 27% 40% 45% of total car cost 2010 2000 All automotive electronics: 18% 27% of total car cost 2020 2030 40% 45% 2010 2000 All automotive electronics: 18% 27% of total car cost 2020 2030 40% 45% 2010 2020 2030 2000 All automotive electronics: 18% 27% 40% 45% of total car cost Note: Forecasts as of April 2019.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February. Figures for Samsung include its System LSI unit; for Globalfoundries include the manufacturing unit acquired from IBM; for PSMC its foundry business only. Source: TrendForce

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Supply Chain Bottleneck TSMC manufactures chips for chip designers and semiconductor firms  which in turn supply major makers of consumer electronics and cars Note: The graphic captures only a subset of publicly-disclosed customers for TSMC and for its direct partners. Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsaWVkLW1hdGVyaWFscy1zdG9jay1zaG93cy1ldmVyeS0xNjEyMDYwNzkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applied Materials Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Significantly Overvalued,"- By GF Value

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 73% of the companies in Credit Services industry. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 30.2% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in Credit Services industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months PayPal Holdings's return on invested capital is 17.09 and its cost of capital is 8.66. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of PayPal Holdings is shown below:

And with all football games come tailgates a sense of camaraderie and an influx of people into Ann Arbor.

Last season’s Notre Dame-Michigan game brought in a record number of 2390 Airbnb guests for Ann Arbor hosts earning a whopping $735000 in supplemental income for Airbnb hosts. Airbnb data also suggested Airbnb guests provided an economic boost to the city as guests on average spent $110 per day at local restaurants and stores.

By the start of this upcoming football season however these short-term Airbnbs may be a thing of the past.

In an effort to improve house accessibility and affordability in Ann Arbor Ann Arbor City Council passed an ordinance Sept. 8 2020 that banned short-term rentals in Ann Arbor’s residential districts which included many Airbnbs. However the ordinance which was approved in a 7-4 vote still permitted Airbnbs and other short-term rentals in mixed-use — meaning both commercial and residential — zoning districts as well as in residential districts as long as the property was owner-occupied while being rented.

In 2018 the University of Michigan Poverty Report on Evictions reported that one in nine Washtenaw County residents faced eviction with only 2% being able to afford representation by a lawyer in court. In 2015 the urban planning firm CZB reported that Ann Arbor needs to create approximately 140 new units of affordable housing per year until 2035 to prevent permanent economic division and stratification.

Councilmember Elizabeth Nelson D-Ward 4 voted in favor of the ordinance and said the restrictions were meant to increase housing accessibility for University students and Ann Arbor residents. Nelson said short-term rentals tend to fall in neighborhoods close to downtown and by banning them permanent Ann Arbor residents will have the opportunity to live closer to those locations.

“Airbnbs have a profit opportunity for locations that are near the city center” Nelson said. “We want (residents) to be able to walk and bike to the places where they work or where they go to school.”

The Sept. ordinance which took effect March 1 did not affect long-term rentals. This was fortunate for LSA freshman Aishani Agrawal who moved into a long-term Airbnb after the University announced in November there would be reduced occupancy in residence halls for the Winter 2021 semester. Agrawal said the Airbnb was cheaper than the residence halls or an off-campus apartment and said her experience with the host was incredibly positive.

“It hasn’t been a stressful experience the host has been very nice and accommodating” Agrawal said. “We don’t have to pay for utilities and the prices are cheaper living in an Airbnb there haven’t been any negatives.”

Carol Skala owns and operates an Airbnb property in an Ann Arbor residential district in addition to her own personal residence. Over the course of the pandemic Skala said she has seen an increase in the amount of medical patients staying at her property as many of them have had to quarantine for 14 days prior to being admitted to Michigan Medicine. With the short-term rental ban Skala said she is not sure if these individuals will have that option in the future.

“We’re a housing option for visitors to the city of Ann Arbor and those visitors deserve to have these options available to them” Skala said. “Being a medical community over the last year we’ve had several families who’ve had to come to the University (hospital) and have had to quarantine before being admitted and you can’t do that in a hotel.”

Similarly for some students short-term rentals provided a place to quarantine outside of University facilities during the spikes of COVID-19 cases on campus.

LSA freshman Grace Martin stayed in an Ann Arbor Airbnb with her parents after being exposed to COVID-19 in U-M residence halls. Martin said the Airbnb experience was beneficial to her mental health and productivity levels as she navigated the end of her 14-day isolation.

“Being able to have a whole house versus just a single room especially when you’re doing everything remotely is pretty important” Martin said. “Everyone has their own space.”

Martin who is originally from Maryland said she would stay in an Airbnb again because of the relatively cheap space that it provided. Martin’s parents have already been searching for accommodations for Parent’s Weekend next fall and found that many of the hotels were charging high prices.

“My parents were already looking at hotel rooms and they were (very expensive)” Martin said. “Airbnb was the cheaper option for more space.”

But Amir Fleischmann Rackham student and Graduate Employees’ Organization secretary said the bans on short-term rentals and Airbnbs are necessary to solve the current housing problems Ann Arbor is facing. Fleischmann said graduate students are sometimes spending up to 50% of their paychecks on rent and banning short-term rentals so they could be sold into affordable housing could help bring that percentage down as well reduce overall homelessness in Ann Arbor.

“It’s a total fiction that the market is capable of provisioning housing for the amount of people living in this town so the government really needs to step in” Fleischmann said. “Right now the situation is so bad that we need every rental unit that’s possible and having potentially hundreds of… units taken off the (permanent housing) market to make money for Airbnb owners is completely unacceptable.”

Skala however said she does not think selling her property or converting it into a long-term rental would contribute to housing accessibility. Skala said she has invested almost $100000 since purchasing her property two years ago and the price she would have to sell or rent her house to break even wouldn’t be considered affordable.

“They haven’t been able to put forth a visionary development plan for affordable housing in Ann Arbor and that’s what council needs to do” Skala said. “If they think forcing us to sell our home or renting it long-term (is going to create affordable housing) … it’s not going to be an affordable rent because we’ve spent so much money fixing these homes up.”

Nelson on the other hand said the ability to rent out your home increases property values in Ann Arbor’s residential zones which makes it more expensive for a prospective Ann Arbor resident to purchase a home. Nelson said while the houses sold and rented out due to the ban likely wouldn’t create affordable housing the ban would decrease overall housing prices in residential zones therefore increasing accessibility.

“I’ve heard Airbnb investors say… ‘Oh well my house is so valuable anyways’ but that’s not the point” Nelson said. “The point is that housing prices are escalating and (short-term rentals) are part of the reason they are escalating.”

John Cameron adjunct professor of real estate construction and business law at the University said restrictions similar to City Council’s are also being implemented in states such as Texas and California. Cameron also said bylaws in some homeowner associations make it harder for short-term rentals and Airbnbs to operate regardless of zoning and ordinances.

“This is not something that is unique to Ann Arbor or unique to Michigan” Cameron said. “the problem is further complicated by restrictive covenants that various homeowners associations have in their declarations and in their bylaws that prohibit short term rentals regardless of what the zoning might be.”

Though some calls have been made for Airbnb investors to legally challenge these new restrictions Cameron said he was not confident these claims would be successful.

“A person’s property is not allowed to be taken without due process of law an argument could be made that this … eliminates one type of use that a person could put their property to” Cameron said. “It’s not beyond possibility that a taking claim could be asserted … (but) I wouldn’t be wildly optimistic about that claim succeeding.”

Amendments to the ordinance which are still being considered by City Council would allow for Airbnbs established before the restrictions to continue to operate as short-term rentals.

“There is a potential challenge out there for the prospect of grandfathering and I wouldn’t simply reject that out of hand” Cameron said. “It might not succeed but I think there is a claim to be asserted there.”

For owners like Skala these amendments may be their last chance to continue operating their Airbnbs as short-term rentals.

“The mayor has come back and requested an amendment of which language that would provide those of us who got caught in this zoning restriction legal non-conforming status to continue doing what we do” Skala said. “If the amending language is not passed we will either have to rent only on a month-to-month basis … or we could possibly have to consider selling the house.”

In an email to The Daily Airbnb representative Sam Randall wrote that Airbnb was thankful that City Council was considering amendments that took into account hosts like Skala who invested in Ann Arbor properties. Randall wrote Airbnbs considerably help tourism in Ann Arbor and contributed positively to the Ann Arbor economy.

“Airbnb has been an important driver of tourism to Ann Arbor” Randall said. “Allowing expanded travel options for families visiting students graduation and home-game weekends while putting valuable additional income into the pockets of Ann Arborites.”

Ann Arbor has postponed the enforcement of the new restrictions on short-term rentals that submitted proof of operation prior to March 1 until City Council makes its final decision regarding the proposed amendments. Current short-term airbnb owners and other short-term rental owners have until March 31 to apply for temporary legal status to continue renting.

Michael Dorr wants the high court to hear his objections to a state Court of Appeals ruling last Oct. 29 that upheld both a St. Clair Shores district court judge and Macomb County Circuit Court judge who maintained the misdemeanor offense against Dorr for violating the city Zoning Ordinance by providing short-term rentals in a single-family residential district.

Dorr who resides along a canal off Lake St. Clair was found guilty by Judge Joseph Oster in February 2019 and paid a fine for two overnight rentals in 2018. Circuit Judge Diane Druzinski upheld the conviction in July 2019.

Dorr’s attorney Derk Wilcox who is with the Mackinac Center in Midland argued the city does not prohibit short-term rentals and its zoning ordinance is “unconstitutionally vague” on the issue so violates due process.

“A resident cannot be criminally liable for actions which are not clearly prohibited; therefore the conviction should be overturned” Wilcox wrote in a legal brief seeking the right to appeal.

“If the city wants to prohibit short-term rentals then it should pass an ordinance doing so” Wilcox said in an interview.

The rise of Airbnb and other similar companies has raised questions nationally of whether homeowners can rent part or all of their homes.

Wilcox said the Center a nonprofit that says it “advances the principles of free markets and limited government” has had residents asking “whether they can rent their home or not.” He said some Michigan communities have passed ordinances regulating short-term rentals but many have not addressed the issue.

Nearby Warren recently put a moratorium on similar rentals while it studies the issue.

It appears there has not been any state Supreme Court or appeals court decisions on the issue Wilcox said.

Because of the potential consequences of the case the Michigan Realtors Association has asked the high court to allow it to submit a legal brief in the case. Association attorneys Melissa Hagen and David Pierson say the COA opinion “greatly diminishes the services the Association’s members offer and stifles a traditional resort culture and economy.”

“The Court of Appeal’s perplexing interpretation of the Ordinance at issue to exclude short-term rentals adversely impacts many similarly situated property owners potential tourists as well as employees and businesses associated with Michigan’s tourist industry. The resultant depreciation of property values forecasts a drop in tax revenue for local governments and the support of Michigan’s schools.”

The decision “impinges on the broad freedoms granted to Michigan citizens to legally use their property and in this instance be free from arbitrary criminal conviction” the association attorneys write.

Judge Stephen Borrello one of the two majority judges in the 2-1 opinion of the appeals panel wrote the zoning ordinance indicates a business can be operated in a single-family residential home only if the business is “incidental to the principal use of the dwelling unit for dwelling purposes.”

Rentals are not incidental they decided.

“The purpose of the (rental) business is identical not incidental to the principal use of the dwelling unit” the appeals court wrote in the 4-page opinion. “We concur with the trial court that a person of ordinary intelligence would reasonably understand from this language that the business therefore cannot be coextensive with the primary use of the dwelling as a dwelling and that the ordinance therefore prohibits the type of short-term rental business that the defendant was running from his home under these circumstances.”

Judge Kathleen Jansen the second judge in the majority says she agrees with the outcome but doesn’t explain why.

“I concur in the result only” wrote the former Macomb County judge.

The dissenting Judge Brock Swartzle says in a 2-page opinion that a “single-night stay in an Airbnb rental would not qualify as a ‘dwelling purpose'” so it should be part of the ordinance’s home-business exception.

“Two days over a year or more does not constitute ‘regularly engaged’ in renting one’s home on Airbnb” Swartzle wrote.

Swartzle adds he has a broader definition of “incidental” use saying it can include a temporary use of the “entire space” or permanent use of a single room such as a home office.

In addition Swartzle agrees with Dorr that the city should pass a rental ordinance.

“If the city wants to regulate or prohibit Airbnb rentals and the like then it should clearly say so” he says.

Wilcox said Ann Arbor passed a short-term rental ordinance that allows but regulates them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrMmhvdXN0b24uY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjgvcmV0cm8tc2Nob29sLWJ1cy1pbi10aGUtdGV4YXMtaGlsbC1jb3VudHJ5LWNvbnZlcnRlZC1pbnRvLWNvenktYWlyYm5iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retro school bus converted into cozy Airbnb in the Texas Hill Country,"Calling all unique Airbnb aficionados.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Align Technology is 20.1% which ranks better than 81% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.3% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Align Technology's return on invested capital is 59.02 and its cost of capital is 11.73. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Align Technology is shown below:

More Content Now USA TODAY NETWORK

Q: Greg I remember many years ago you did a column on your memories of growing up in the 1950s working at Sears & Roebuck as a teenager and also those Montgomery Ward and Sears auto centers. I'm not computer savvy so I'm wondering if you could revisit some of that column as it brought back so many great memories growing up for me too. — Gary L. Columbus Ohio

A: Gary I'm more than happy to oblige and add more as that column originated from a question from reader Dan York from Pottstown Pennsylvania back in 2017.

Here we are in 2021 and as I reread the answer I failed to mention many other major nostalgic memories all tied to cars or riding in my dad's cars that I enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s.

I clearly remember the new four-lane highways and turnpikes that were growing everywhere and with them came business expansions like Howard Johnson's restaurants Stuckey's Pecans Snacks and Gasoline Dairy Queen and more and more gas stations than ever. The first McDonald's I ever went to was in New Brunswick New Jersey with my aunt Rose and uncle John in their brand new ’60 Impala sport coupe somewhere along Route 18 heading towards Old Bridge New Jersey. The place was packed and everything was ""order at the window"" as no seating was available yet. Most were checking my uncle's blue and white Impala.

Cities Service gas centers around since the 1930s but never having seen one popped up at the service plazas on the turnpikes and were very impressive. And in the heyday of home service ice cream it's hard to forget the original Good Humor Ford trucks and then soon to follow Mr. Softie trucks. Charles Chips had their fleet of Chevy panel trucks and to this day is the only potato chip I know of that became famous because of home delivery. I still have my Charles Chips can and a Buddy L Charles Chip truck. Charles Chips ceased home delivery in 1975.

Those Sears and Montgomery Ward stores were great too. Dan noted he remembered that the toy departments were great to see at Christmas time and the hobby department was filled with 1/24-scale cars and other models. He also noted that his dad owned a Sears Elgin boat that he learned to water ski hooked behind. I'll add here you could buy a Henry-J automobile at some Sears stores in 1952 and 1953. It was called the Allstate and came with special badges and hood ornament Sears auto parts like spark plugs Allstate tires and some extra interior conveniences.

Dan knew from previous columns that I worked in the paint department at Sears in Vineland New Jersey in 1968 and he worked at both S.S. Kreske's (a forerunner of Kmart) and at the Kmart in Burlington New Jersey. He also noted that both Sears and Kmart in his town of Pottstown Pennsylvania had already closed in 2017.

The recollections I still have center on the Sears & Roebuck located at Landis Avenue and the circle of Route 47 in Vineland. When we relocated there as a family in 1957-58 Sears was the ""in-store"" to visit regardless of need. I remember many times my parents shopping while my dad's car received an oil change at the Sears Auto Center.

So be it those oil changes a set of tires tools a complete tune-up Ted Williams baseball glove or JC Higgins bicycle Sears had it all. Many Sears of the 1950s and ’60s had a Hires Root Beer stand in the middle of the store where they served hot dogs on a bread-type. semi-toasted roll. Sears had a great toy section and the holidays were my favorite time to visit Sears and await its spectacular Sears Christmas catalog that arrived in everyone's mail.

Sears aside the gas stations of the era are still ingrained in my head. There was so much activity back then as gas pump attendants were in full uniform many with bow ties. There was always a friendly hello and ""Happy Motoring"" at the end if it was an Esso fill-up. The gas attendants back then would clean your car windshield check the oil and even make sure the tire pressures were correct regardless of weather. The Flying A Sinclair Esso Gulf and Texaco stations stand out in my mind as does Sunoco and later American the latter the first to offer a no-lead gasoline before government mandates.

Unlike today's ""Food Mart"" gas stations the service stations of yesteryear were fascinating places for young and old. From engines being changed transmissions rebuilt to tires mounted and balanced I loved everything about a gas station and I asked a lot of questions. As for snacks most gas stations back then had Coca-Cola Nehi Orange Hires Root Beer or Pepsi Cola soda products. They also had to have a nice lineup of potato chips and pretzels and perhaps five or six selections of candy bars my favorites being Skybar Chunky or Sugar Daddy. Oh yes can't forget those Planters salted peanuts and Lance Nip-Chee crackers at 5 cents a pack.

Sadly as the years pass on and auto manufacturers further enhance today's modern computer-controlled cars the service stations we knew growing up have nearly disappeared. The few independent garages that survive are thanks mostly to dedicated baby boomer consumers although some of the younger generations have found out how good these little service garages are.

Still with high-tech cars advancing more every year and electric the future of our vehicles it's just a matter of time before more of these wonderful independents shut their doors. They still however serve as a great place for your collector car to be properly serviced as the small independents still know how to set up a Holley carburetor fix the water pump or replace a broken rocker arm. And a new camshaft for a 1966 Chevelle SS396?

Sure no problem.

Thanks for rekindling even more memories and your kind words Gary.

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Medtronic PLC's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. Medtronic PLC's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -2.3% which ranks worse than 70% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Medtronic PLC's return on invested capital is 5.45 and its cost of capital is 4.40. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Medtronic PLC is shown below:

AMZN,Amazon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbi1ldmFucy5jb20vYmVuZWRpY3RldmFucy8yMDIxLzMvMjgvYW1hem9uLXByaXZhdGUtbGFiZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's private labels — Benedict Evans,"Indeed like many of today’s retail innovations private label really goes back to department stores in the mid-19th century which were the disruptive dynamic innovative capitalist juggernauts of their day crushing small shopkeepers as they went. In Zola’s Au Bonheur des Dames a lightly disguised description of the creation of Bon Marché in the 1860s the entrepreneur at the centre of the story sells ‘Paris Delight’ a private label fabric as a loss-leader to drive footfall. (He also pioneers ‘returns’ which were apparently ‘a masterpiece of Jesuitical seduction’.) I have a theory that Jeff Bezos has a copy of this book in a safe behind his desk filled with PostIt notes.

Amazon is of course different to Bon Marché - but then so were Target Safeway Woolworths A&P (the world’s largest retailer in the 1930s and now almost forgotten) Macy’s and Sears itself. Amazon knows what you search for but Safeway can put milk at the back of the store and candy next to the till. Amazon uses placement to steer purchasing yes and so do all retailers. Amazon uses data yes and so do all retailers - Walmart bought its first computers in the 1960s and Tesco owns the leading loyalty card business. Retailers do in fact know what they sell. And no Amazon does not have a different kind of scale. It has 8-10% of US retail - it’s roughly the same size as Walmart.

The real challenge in these conversations is that it’s always been perfectly clear that Amazon is very tough on its suppliers (and its employees) but often rather less clear where that's any different from the rest of the retail or logistics industry. You can certainly object to private label believe it’s unethical and even think it should be illegal. The fact that the FTC wrote that report tells us that people have asked these questions for a long time. But in doing that you do have to recognise that your objection is not to something that Amazon does but to something that retail does. Private label is a third of Costco’s sales.

This is really a much broader question than private label or Amazon. Are you concerned by something because Amazon does it or is it always a problem and the Amazon case just makes us more aware of it? Is it different when Amazon does it and if so why? (No not because of data scale or placement.) Should we hold Amazon to a different standard or use its visibility to support a broader agenda? Is the problem Amazon or American labour laws or tax codes and talking about Amazon is a way to change those? (You can certainly understand that a lot of America isn’t unionised and still campaign for unions at Amazon.) But whatever it is you should try to be clear whether you think Amazon has invented a new way to be ‘evil’ or that it’s being evil the way all retailers are ‘evil’. And sometimes you should ask whether this is just moral panic and there’s really nothing wrong with this particular issue at all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIwMjEvMy8yOC8yMjM1NDYwNC9hbWF6b24tdHdpdHRlci1iZXJuaWUtc2FuZGVycy1qZWZmLWJlem9zLXVuaW9uLWFsYWJhbWEtZWxpemFiZXRoLXdhcnJlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Twitter war with Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren spurred by Jeff Bezos,"Amazon has long been at odds with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over their criticisms of the company’s labor and business practices. But the discord reached new heights last week when Amazon aggressively went after both senators on Twitter in an unusual attack for a large corporation. With each new snarky tweet from an Amazon executive or the company’s official Twitter account insiders and observers alike asked a version of the same question: “What the hell is going on?”

It turns out that Amazon leaders were following a broad mandate from the very top of the company: Fight back.

Recode has learned that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos expressed dissatisfaction in recent weeks that company officials weren’t more aggressive in how they pushed back against criticisms of the company that he and other leaders deem inaccurate or misleading. What followed was a series of snarky and aggressive tweets that ended up fueling their own media cycles.

The timing was likely not coincidental. Bezos and other Amazon leaders are on edge as the company is facing the largest union election in its history at its Bessemer Alabama warehouse. Election results will be tallied early this week and Amazon officials understand that if a majority of the employees vote to unionize it could set off a chain reaction at other facilities — potentially forcing the e-commerce giant to overhaul how it manages its hundreds of thousands of front-line US workers.

There was terror inside the executive ranks of Amazon the last time a union election was held at a US Amazon facility — and that was only a small subset of a warehouse’s workforce the majority of whom voted against unionization. That vote happened in early 2014 and consisted of just 27 technicians and mechanics at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware. In Alabama though the stakes are much higher with nearly 6000 workers eligible to vote. Bezos knows all of this well.

So when news broke last week that Sanders was planning to visit Alabama in the final days of voting top Amazon executive Dave Clark fired off a Twitter thread that started with the following post.

“I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace” Clark’s account posted on Wednesday. “I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.”

1/3 I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9 — Dave Clark (@davehclark) March 24 2021

A few hours later the official “Amazon News” media relations Twitter account with more than 170000 followers snapped back against House Rep. Mark Pocan who had questioned Clark’s “progressive workplace” assertion by alluding to stories of Amazon’s pace of work being so demanding that workers have to “urinate in water bottles.”

“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you?” the official Amazon News account tweeted. “If that were true nobody would work for us.”

1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you? If that were true nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do and have great wages and health care from day one. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) March 25 2021

And after a back-and-forth with Warren that began with her criticizing the company’s tax payments the same Amazon account “quote-tweeted” Warren with this message:

This is extraordinary and revealing. One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she’s going to break up an American company so that they can’t criticize her anymore. https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g — Amazon News (@amazonnews) March 26 2021

An Amazon spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.

If Bezos wanted the news cycle off of the union drive for a bit it sort of worked. But instead of talking about the union media outlets and industry observers have been focused on the rarity and judgment of a trillion-dollar company sparring with powerful lawmakers on Twitter. Amazon’s pushback on Pocan’s comment about workers peeing in bottles also ignited another news cycle after the Intercept revealed internal Amazon communications acknowledging that contractors who deliver Amazon packages sometimes defecate in bags and urinate in bottles.

Amazon warehouse workers who’ve spoken to Recode over the years say it is indeed rare to hear of warehouse employees — as opposed to a delivery driver — urinating in bottles at work. But the bigger point many make is that it’s not uncommon for workers to take other measures such as limiting how much they drink to reduce their need to use the bathroom for fear of missing their production quotas or getting written up by supervisors for too much “time off task” as Amazon calls it.

Inside Amazon rank-and-file employees were also perplexed by the company’s Twitter approach. “Suspicious activity on @amazonnews Twitter account” was the title of one internal support ticket — called a trouble ticket inside the company — filed by an Amazon security engineer last week according to a screenshot viewed by Recode.

“Over the past two days there have been two threads by @amazonnews in response to comments made by US Government officials that have received considerable attention” the ticket reads. “The tweets in question do not match the usual content posted by this account.”

The security engineer noted that the tweets were posted using Twitter’s web app rather than Sprinklr the social media management software typically used by the Amazon News account to post tweets.

The tweets according to the security engineer “are unnecessarily antagonistic (risking Amazon’s brand) and may be a result of unauthorized access.”

The support ticket was closed without action according to a source.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nb29nbGUtc2hvcHBpbmctYW1hem9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Aims to Be the Anti-Amazon of E-Commerce. It Has a Long Way to Go. (Published 2021),"OAKLAND Calif. — Google tried to copy Amazon’s playbook to become the shopping hub of the internet with little success. Now it is trying something different: the anti-Amazon strategy.

Google is trying to present itself as a cheaper and less restrictive option for independent sellers. And it is focused on driving traffic to sellers’ sites not selling its own version of products as Amazon does.

In the last year Google eliminated fees for merchants and allowed sellers to list their wares in its search results for free. It is also trying to make it easier for small independent shops to upload their inventory of products to appear in search results and buy ads on Google by teaming up with Shopify which powers online stores for 1.7 million merchants who sell directly to consumers.

But like Google’s many attempts during its two-decade quest to compete with Amazon this one shows little sign of working. Google has nothing as alluring as the $295 billion that passed through Amazon’s third-party marketplace in 2020. The amount of goods people buy on Google is “very small” by comparison — probably around $1 billion said Juozas Kaziukenas the founder of Marketplace Pulse a research company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzMvMjcvMjIzNTM5MjkvbGF3c3VpdC1hbGxlZ2VzLWFtYXpvbi1mYWlsZWQtYnJlYWtzLW92ZXJ0aW1lLXdhZ2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon faces lawsuit over missed lunch breaks,"A lawsuit that claims one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers in California failed to provide required meal breaks for employees has moved to federal court as attorneys seek class-action status. First filed in San Francisco County Superior Court in February the case was removed to US District Court California Northern District on Friday.

Lovenia Scott a former employee of the Vacaville California warehouse alleges that the company didn’t schedule the required 30-minute meal breaks for workers. When they did get their meal breaks workers were expected to monitor their walkie-talkies in case of any problems on the floor which sometimes cut into their break time the suit claims.

The matter of paying workers for time they spend waiting for employers while off the clock has come up in other cases as well. The Supreme Court decided in 2014 that Amazon workers at a Nevada warehouse weren’t entitled to pay for the time they spent waiting to have their bags searched after clocking out but before leaving the building.

Earlier this month in a separate case Amazon and an independent contractor it worked with in California were fined $6.4 million for wage theft by the California Labor Commission’s Office. The state investigation in that case found that Green Messengers the subcontractor for Amazon underpaid drivers scheduling them 10-hour days but with a workload that forced drivers to skip meal and rest breaks.

Due to the way the meal breaks were organized in Vacaville Scott claims many workers took their breaks at the same time. Lines would form at the computer system where employees swiped their badges to clock out for their break time meaning those at the end of the line saw their breaks shortened as they waited their turn. Scott’s lawsuit also says shifts were “chronically understaffed” which left some employees unable to take short 10-minute rest breaks in order to finish their work on time.

In addition workers were not compensated for using their personal cell phones to perform work tasks the lawsuit claims. Scott who worked at the Vacaville warehouse from October 2016 to January 2019 also says Amazon failed to timely pay her final wages.

Amazon has been bickering with US senators on Twitter the past few days via its @AmazonNews account questioning— among other things— the accuracy of reports that some of its delivery drivers are so overworked that they had to pee in bottles because they didn’t have time to take restroom breaks. Numerous news reports support this claim however. And Monday is the deadline for workers at Amazon’s plant in Bessemer Alabama to vote whether to form the first-ever Amazon union in the US.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLWhpdC13aXRoLWxhd3N1aXQtb3Zlci1jbGFpbXMtZGlkLW5vdC1wcm92aWRlLWx1bmNoLWJyZWFrcy0yMDIxLTPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1oaXQtd2l0aC1sYXdzdWl0LW92ZXItY2xhaW1zLWRpZC1ub3QtcHJvdmlkZS1sdW5jaC1icmVha3MtMjAyMS0zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon hit with lawsuit over claims it did not provide lunch breaks,"A former Amazon worker filed a lawsuit against the company over claims of missed lunch breaks.

A lawsuit against Amazon that claimed workers did not receive adequate lunch breaks at a California fulfilment center is moving ahead.

The case was transferred to US District Court California Northern District on Friday after its first filing in San Francisco County Superior Court in February.

Former employee Lovenia Scott is alleging that Amazon denied staff the required 30-minute meal breaks for each five-hour work period under Californian legislation.

Related stories

The suit claimed meal-break periods were shortened ""due to the time spent listening and responding to work-related obligations on their walkie talkies"" which workers were allegedly required to carry with them.

In addition the lawsuit alleged workers were instructed to take a break ""if and when they could get it.""

But according to Scott who worked in the Vacaville warehouse there were serious staffing issues and so much work being imposed on workers it was unlikely they would be able to take their breaks if they wanted to finish their work on time.

Insider has approached Amazon for comment.

These are not the only allegations over workers' rights that Amazon has faced in recent weeks. Reports of workers urinating in bottles back in 2018 re-emerged after a Twitter spat between the company and Democratic senators including Bernie Sanders over the matter.

A delivery driver in the Detroit area told Insider that rather than urinate inside the vans she used to hold it to the point of bladder infections.

Amazon delivery drivers also reported that they had to defecate in bags and struggled to change menstrual pads.

The company denied the claims about ""peeing in bottles"" and tweeted ""if that were true nobody would work for us."" However documents showing Amazon was aware of drivers' practice of urinating in bottles and defecating in bags were published by The Intercept on Thursday."

Missouri State Parks signed an interim trail use agreement in December 2019 with Ameren and its subsidiary Missouri Central Railroad Company which donated the 144.3-mile Rock Island Line Corridor to the state for the development of a trail. The agreement gives the Missouri State Parks Foundation until the end of this year to raise $9.8 million for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to take ownership of the corridor.

The section was formerly part of the Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad that runs from Windsor to Beaufort.

A national act established a process called ""railbanking"" where a railroad company and trail agency can use out-of-service corridors as a trail. Sutherland referenced the Katy Trail as an example of another ""rails-to-trails"" project as it was once a rail corridor.

Once the $9.8 million is raised the agreement will kick in and DNR can start working on the Rock Island Trail.

Sutherland said they have received continual support even through the COVID-19 pandemic although he did not discuss specifics on where they are monetarily.

""Certainly we're all diverted a lot of energy to dealing with the pandemic"" he said. ""That may have changed things a little bit but there's still been a lot of work going on. That support has continued among the general public and people along the corridor.""

Sutherland and Ron Bentch project director for Missourians for Responsible Transportation discussed details about the project and how the public can offer support during a Feb. 25 virtual event hosted by BikeWalkKC.

Once the trail is developed it will connect the 47.5-mile Rock Island Spur in Windsor which connects to the Katy Trail. This would create a 450-mile loop around Missouri - something Bentch said would be ""probably the coolest thing on the planet when it comes to a trail loop.""

""Currently different things (are happening) in phases"" Sutherland said about trail development in various parts of Missouri. ""If everything gets connected the user could go through and experience all of it.""

Sutherland said the possibility of connecting Kansas City St. Louis Columbia and Springfield along with small towns along the trail would be an exciting opportunity for the state. The Rock Island Line Corridor would offer key connections to those opportunities.

Connecting the corridor to smaller trails that go through the center of Missouri towns can bring trail-goers to restaurants shops and experiences within each town boosting their economy. Bentch noted many towns on the corridor have already started preparing restaurants and camping areas that can cater to guests once the corridor becomes official.

""It won't just impact those towns but the entire state"" he said. ""We believe it's going to be a huge boom for those towns. The railroad went out in the early '80s so a lot of towns have been struggling and see this as something beneficial.""

Sutherland said it would impact Missourians' quality of life as well. Creating a safe place to walk your dog or with your children and attracting more homeowners and businesses to an area would improve property values.

When asked about the environmental benefits of the trail development Sutherland said it won't be quite like Katy Trail due to its size - some parts of the corridor can be 100 feet wide while others are narrower - but it can offer access to natural resources like conservation areas.

He said it comes back to the three-part mission of state parks: recreation cultural preservation and natural resources.

""Where those opportunities exist surely we would explore them"" Sutherland said. ""While those might be more limited we still try to incorporate all three of those missions when we can.""

Once the trail is accepted Bentch and Sutherland said they'd look to individual towns to help develop their own sections adding their own ""mark of character"" to already established state regulations. Funding will be a large part of this process which communities would help with.

Bentch and Sutherland said those interested in the project can help by continuing to cultivate enthusiasm about it.

Sutherland said they've received support from philanthropic organizations and the state Legislature through the Rock Island Endowment Fund so the important next step is funding to make the project happen. With 91 locations in Missouri State Parks he said donors will be crucial in funding what could become a more expensive project down the line.

""As trail users and people that love biking across the state this is something we really need to grab hold of and support"" Bentch said. ""It would allow people from around the world to be drawn to Missouri. I know we're a little ways from that but we're not far from seeing that become reality. We feel like this is an opportunity we can't afford to lose in our state.""

AAL,American Airlines Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9jdXN0b21lci1hc2tzLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXR3aXR0ZXItdGVhbS1mb3ItaGVscC1hbmQtdGhleS1raWNrZWQtaGlzLWNvbXBhbmlvbi1vZmYtdGhlLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customer Asks American Airline's Twitter Team For Help And They Kicked His Companion Off The Flight,"An American Airlines Executive Platinum elite member reached out to the airline’s twitter team for help with a reservation – and the twitter team wound up kicking their companion off the flight.

The member shared they’re flying out of Oklahoma City on ‘web special’ award tickets booked under separate reservations. They confirmed earlier flights using American’s mobile app. Then he tweeted American asking for help to sponsor the friend’s upgrade as his companion.

However

Instead of doing so the AA Twitter agent unilaterally removed him from the new confirmed flight and placed him back on the original later flight despite the app allowing us to change in the first place. He then wrote this snide passive-aggressive reply with a final “really sorry.” So now we’re both separated and the flights are sold out. At the very least this is a huge customer service foul. How is this not an involuntary schedule change?

Here’s the message from American Airlines twitter:

Now Executive Platinum members receive free same day changes and so do their companions on the same reservation. However in this case the companion wasn’t on the same booking. And since it was a web saver award no changes are permitted. The agent took it upon themselves to undo what they decided shouldn’t have been allowed.

Yet American offered the change for free. They completed the change. The customer service agent kicked the the passenger off the flight they’d changed onto.

I asked American whether twitter agents were now allowed to make involuntary changes to a passenger’s itinerary. They confirmed for me that this should not have happened and they restored the booking.

This was an error not a policy change. The team has been in contact with the customer who shared this with you and he and his companion have been accommodated on their original flight and with the upgrade requests. We’re also following up with the team to better handle this in the future.

I do think there’s a lesson here and it’s one that I’ve talked about for many years. If you’ve gotten something from an airline that you aren’t strictly entitled to just go with it. You don’t want additional eyes on your reservation because the next agent could decide to do something unpleasant.

Why would this agent care? Why would they do something like this? Perhaps they’ve had a bad day. Perhaps it gives them a sense of control in a job that gives them very little. When you contact someone for customer service you never know who you’re going to get on the other end of things. Often you don’t even get simple things that you’re entitled to which is why you hang up call back.

Another lesson is that while the American Airlnes twitter team was once amazing (both pre-merger with US Airways and in the short period thereafter) that no longer seems to hold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9mbHlpbmctdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFuZC1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1iNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flying United Airlines and American Airlines B737 MAX - SamChui.com,"4 airlines in the US are currently flying scheduled passenger flights with the 737 MAX; American Alaska Southwest and United.

I recently flew domestic flights with both United on their B737 MAX 9 and American on their B737 MAX 8.

My United 737 MAX 9 flight was from Miami to Houston. After I booked on the MAX Flight United made it very clear that passengers have the flexibility to change their flight due to being booked on a MAX.

At the gate the aircraft type was clearly displayed on the screen.





Cabin Interior of United B737 MAX 9

United B737 MAX 9 seat map

The United 737 MAX 9 has 20 First Class recliner seats 48 Economy Plus seats and 111 Economy seats for a total capacity of 179 seats.

As you can see here the United 737 MAX 9 First Class is a fairly basic arrangement. The seat does however have a decent recline with seat being able to slide forward unfortunately row 5 is missing a window. The best 737 MAX 9 interior I have travelled on was with Copa Airlines.

The 737 MAX comes with a much bigger overhead bin. There are no seatback PTVs in any of the seats as the airline is encouraging passengers to stream content on their personal devices.





Row 5 is missing a window but you can lean forward for some views.

Cockpit and Pilot Training

United mentioned that all pilots who fly the 737 MAX have undergone FAA-approved training; to learn how the updated software will impact the flight controls also to practice how they should respond to given scenarios they may encounter in the sky. The training includes:

Computer-based instruction

Hands-on training in a full-flight simulator

A systems briefing checklist and quick-reference handbook

I met up with the pilots in the flight deck whilst they were preparing for departure. The captain was kind enough to talk me through all the features of the MAX; including the bigger display screens the new engine the stabilizer trim and the MCAS. Watch the video for the interaction.

United has a dedicated site for the 737 MAX which has some excellent graphic features and video on what's changed in the 737 MAX.

My flight UA704 took-off on-time from Miami runway 30. Flight time to Houston was scheduled for 2 hours 30 minutes with a cruising altitude of 30000 ft this was due to some expected turbulence above this altitude. The take-off and the cruise of the entire flight was very smooth.

During the flight I was served beverages of my choice. United First Class has a full beverage selection available including hot drinks sodas juices beers and other alcohol. This is an area where their offering is superior to that of Delta's. For a flight of over 2.5 hours a choice of a hot sandwich or a snack box is offered.

United First Class Hot Sandwich

The rest of the flight was completely non-eventful. It is worthwhile to mention that United did not block any middle seats as flights to/from holiday hotspots such as Florida can be totally full.

The landing was very smooth. We arrived at Houston on a sunny morning.

In summary as a passenger I did not feel any real difference flying on a 737 MAX. The only difference on this flight was the updated cabin interior over the B737-700/800/900 (NGs) and a bigger overhead bin. It was also slightly quieter on the MAX.

I think time will tell the MAX has some way to go before it proves itself in the eyes of the general public. Any further incident on the MAX from this point onward will be met with full media scrutiny in this digital age.

Flying American B737 MAX 8

My AA 737 MAX flight was a very short one from Orlando to Miami. Most of the American Airlines 737 MAXs are based in Miami serving short to medium haul domestic flights including the Caribbean and Central America.

The cabin of the American 737 MAX 8 was pretty ordinary. Similar to United it also has no seatback PTVs. It has a total of 172 seats which is quite dense for a 737 MAX 8.

American Airlines 737 MAX 8 seating

In First Class there is a tighter seat pitch with 16 seats total. There was no divider curtain or bulkhead to Economy. In Economy the seat pitch is 30"" which is about the same as a low cost carrier with the exception of Main Cabin Extra (where I was seated).

Given that the flight was so short being just 40 minutes there was no food no drink no service just sitting down during the entire flight. The taxi time and waiting at arrival for a gate in Miami was about the same as the flight time.





We flew past Fort Lauderdale and the coast of Florida it was a beautiful day for flying.









Conclusion of Flying 737 MAX

“The history of aviation is built around a chain of safety… When the chain of safety breaks it’s up to those of us in the industry to mend it and bring it back.” Captain Peter Gamble

“You won’t be able to rebuild the confidence of an airplane unless it is back on flying. It won’t re-build that confidence if it is grounded.” American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour

I enjoyed both of my MAX flights. Both of my flights were smooth and event-free and I simply took in the views from my window seats.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines is installing nine new touchless bag drop stations at DFW International Airport during the next week part of a wave of changes meant to reduce the number of times that customers have to touch kiosks interact with employees hand over identification cards and ultimately swap germs with other humans before they board planes.

After testing the technology at a handful of terminals at DFW and Washington D.C.’s Ronald Reagan National Airport American is ready to expand it and prove to federal security officials that it can replace the old process of handing over a driver’s license or passport to an airline employee who then tags and moves bags.

Touchless bag drop stations use a combination of mobile phone apps and facial-recognition. It could be a sample of what is to come at airports as airlines including American push to make these technologies the standard throughout the travel process from crossing through Transportation Security Administration lines to boarding.

After a year of dismal travel numbers and recording losses of more than $35 billion airlines are facing a reality that flying will never be the same as before COVID-19. On Tuesday a coalition of airlines employee unions and travel industry companies pushed the federal government to make a road map for reopening travel and international flights including guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that airline travel is safe.

But airlines are doing their part too with customers showing a steady desire to travel again.

“Eventually we would like to use our mobile app for the entire process to move through the airport” said Preston Peterson American’s director of customer experience innovation. “We aren’t there yet but the pandemic has given us the chance to test some of these technologies with fewer people and smaller crowds.”

American Dallas-based Southwest Airlines and other carriers spent much of 2020 developing new cleaning protocols and enforcing social distancing rules to give passengers some confidence that travel was safe. The industry touted partnerships with the Mayo Clinic major research universities including Harvard and medical groups like UT Southwestern to show that air filtering technologies could eliminate much of the risk of spreading COVID-19 for those who traveled while wearing a face mask.

But now airlines need to get back to work to stem those massive losses and billions in debt taken over the past 12 months. Southwest started selling planes to capacity again on Dec. 1 after essentially leaving middle seats open for nearly six months.

Airlines are bracing for their biggest crowds since the pandemic began heading into spring. More than 28 million passengers went through TSA checkpoints between March 1 and March 24 by far the strongest stretch in a year. Airline Reporting Corp. which tracks ticket sales for carriers has shown a steady uptick in ticket sales since the middle of February following a drop in COVID-19 cases and positive news about vaccination distribution.

“In terms of getting on planes the sentiment seems to have turned starting last month” said Erin Francis-Cummings president and CEO of travel research firm Destination Analysts.

The coronavirus that has killed nearly 550000 Americans and locked down the economy is still top of mind for travelers Francis-Cummings said. Travelers are opting for outdoor destinations such as beaches and mountains over big cities. Face masks and social distances are the two biggest concerns that travelers have noted in surveys she said.

Airlines and airports have been responding. DFW Airport has added touch-free soap dispensers paper towel dispensers and sinks to bathrooms. Delta Air Lines this month announced plans to add touch-free payments aboard flights.

American Airlines spent much of the past year installing new kiosks and refining menus to move customers through faster Peterson said. More customers are using mobile apps for boarding passes. The company also has expanded partnerships with COVID-19 testing companies to give access to parts of the world with strict travel restrictions.

Now many of those restrictions are coming down giving American Airlines and others time to focus on the long-term changes that will come after the pandemic has passed.

The new tests with mobile luggage drops coincide with using the same technology for access to some of its Admiral Lounges at DFW and Ronald Reagan Peterson said.

But even something like checking luggage isn’t so simple for an airline that needs to accommodate federal security requirements. TSA regulations say that every bag needs to be verified with a driver’s license or passport to make sure passengers aren’t smuggling explosives or other contraband.

With the new touchless bag drop test American has to prove to TSA that using a mobile app is just as secure as a human checking a driver’s license. For now American is using a third-party app called Airside which requires users to scan a driver’s license or passport and upload a selfie. ID cards are cross-referenced with state and federal databases and pictures are matched.

Users can then scan the app to get luggage tags and a facial recognition reader at the counter will verify identity. That will allow customers to tag their own bags and move them onto scales where airline employees handle the rest of the process. That eliminates the need to ever give a driver’s license or passport to an American Airlines employee.

The touchless bag drop and lounge access technology is optional for American customers. But like many technologies that have become a part of the travel experience optional eventually becomes essential for those wanting to quickly move through the check-in process.

Facial recognition is still a concern for travelers but passengers are more willing when the technology has a purpose and a benefit said Steve Karoly a former TSA official who now works as executive vice president for K2 Security Screening Group.

“COVID made it clear that something needs to be done to cut down on chokepoints at airports and cut down on contact” Karoly said. “This has all been coming for years but the pandemic has sped it up.”

TSA has been pushing technology for years to speed up the process including new security scanners that take 3D pictures of luggage and automated screening checkpoints that push passengers through faster.

Programs like TSA PreCheck Global Entry and CLEAR have been using advanced screening processes to even allow customers to walk through TSA with as little as an iris scan.

Biometric scanning such as facial recognition is considered more secure because it can map hundreds of points on a face for matches. The technology isn’t perfect yet but Karoly said it has come far even in the past year and can even usually match faces with a mask on.

“Biometrics is a way to get to self-service when we’ve had all these security barriers for years” Karoly said. “It’s all leaning down the same path. They want to reduce the risk of COVID transmission and a lot of this allows you to have less physical interaction with employees.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbGFqb2xsYW1vbS5jb20vc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWVhcmx5LWJvYXJkaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Pay $40 For Early Boarding On Southwest Airlines,"When you’re in Las Vegas and forget to purchase Early Bird Check-in on Southwest Airlines for your departing flight… it’s also easy to forget to manually check-in 24 hours in advance. In fact it totally slipped my mind (perhaps it was the cocktails). By the time I remembered their website was down for service so I had to call customer service. I was granted the dire boarding position of C22.

Anyone who flies Southwest knows that group C is an aggravating situation to be in especially when flying carry-on only. It is the very last boarding group which means the entire plane less 38 or so people would find their seats before me. I am not a fan of unassigned seating to say the least.

I wouldn’t care about a middle seat in the back of the plane if I had time to check my luggage. But in this case I had to get off the plane as soon as humanly possible and head straight home in order to make my daughter’s Girl Scout meeting. San Diego International Airport’s baggage claim is notoriously slow and I didn’t have a minute to spare.

I was surprised by how much stress the C22 boarding position caused me but it was likely due to a sub-par flight on the way up to Las Vegas that was delayed among other things.

At McCarran Airport the Southwest Airlines gate agent made an announcement that early boarding positions were available for $40. If the Business Select seats are all sold in advance on a flight this isn’t an option.

The flight from Las Vegas to San Diego is scheduled for just over an hour but is less than that in reality. Did I really need to spend $40?

I was the only one who paid the $40 for early boarding on the entire plane despite the declaration that our flight was full. I paid with a credit card at the gate and a new boarding position was stapled on my existing ticket — A6. Cue the huge sigh of relief. The A7-A15 boarding positions behind me were empty.

Boarding the plane was obviously easy and I slipped my carry-on bag in wheels first just like I did on the way up to Las Vegas and pretty much like I do on every flight. Strategically I took the aisle seat in the second row and settled in to catch up on email before the plane left the gate.

During boarding someone jammed their carry-on and other stuff in a manner that prevented our overhead bin from closing. My bag was moved a number of rows back before I could protest.

This means that I’d have to fight the stampede trying to disembark the plane in order to get my stupid carry-on that should have been in the second row in the bin above me. Believe me it was awkward but I held my ground after the plane landed. I had to leave my other bag in my seat in order to do it and over my shoulder I heard a passenger report a “lost bag” to the flight attendant and had to scream across the plane that it was mine and to not touch it.

Early Boarding on Southwest Airlines is worth it if you:

are in a major hurry.

have a tight connection.

forgot to buy Early Bird Check-in.

checked in late and have a terrible boarding position.

prefer the first few rows of the plane.

don’t mind spending $40 (obviously).

Keep in mind that early boarding isn’t always available at the gate so you can’t count on it. Have you purchased early boarding on Southwest Airlines?

In one room the flooring had simply washed away. The door to the back bedroom — her mother’s and still filled with her possessions — stayed closed. Those walls like many others in the house were streaked with mold.

And that was all before a winter storm last month left Ms. Hall shivering over a heater and caused pipes to leak. The culprit behind so much of the damage to her home had been Hurricane Harvey. The storm hit Houston in 2017 and for many the trauma endured as a haunting memory. But for Ms. Hall almost four years later the devastation remained a grinding reality.

“I think about it every day all day long” Ms. Hall 59 said as she walked through the house she had lived in since childhood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvY29uc3VtZXJzLXNob3BwaW5nLW9ubGluZS1jYXJzLWRlYWxlcnNoaXBzL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc2NjUwMDQy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvY29uc3VtZXJzLXNob3BwaW5nLW9ubGluZS1jYXJzLWRlYWxlcnNoaXBzL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc2NjUwMDQy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More consumers are shopping online for cars.

More consumers are shopping online for cars. Can dealerships keep up?

The rise of the internet and online shopping seemed to signal the ignoble end to the ubiquitous car dealership in the 1990s.

Those gloomy predictions from industry watchers turned out to be wrong; consumers continued to flock to dealerships which largely carried on despite the critics. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit closing showrooms sending sales teams home and driving consumers online to purchase vehicles.

Insiders again sounded the alarms that dealerships would not survive. In reality the exact opposite happened.

The pandemic has been a boon for U.S. dealers which reported record profits in 2020 even with reduced staff and a national recession. Nearly 30% of U.S. new car sales last year were completed online according to Alan Haig an automotive retail consultant and president of Haig Partners. Before the pandemic less than 2% of vehicles were purchased digitally.

""This shift to digital retail is positive for dealers who embrace it"" Haig told ABC News. ""For those that don't they will lose customers and be harmed by the trend.""

Dealerships moved quickly to stave off online competitors and rehabilitate their poor customer service rap. There were 16623 franchised new vehicle dealerships at the end of 2020 according to the National Automobile Dealers Association and more than 1.1 million workers are employed in the sector.

The retail experience was ""ripe for change"" but dealerships are not going away according to Michelle Krebs an executive analyst at Cox Automotive.

""Dealers have tremendous political power. The franchise laws were written in favor of dealerships"" she told ABC News.

(These laws protect dealers from competition and require auto manufacturers to sell new cars through franchised dealers.)

According to a recent Cox Automotive study buyer satisfaction also reached an all-time high in 2020. The overall car shopping experience took less time and was more efficient buyers reported and the number of dealerships visited and the amount of time spent in them dropped in 2020.

E-commerce will likely make up the core of dealership sales in a decade with the pandemic only accelerating the inevitable Haig said.

""Young people in particular want to purchase or lease a vehicle by using their cellphone"" he said. ""Online becomes a portal to a showroom. When consumers come to dealerships now they're there to buy.""

He went on ""Anything that enhances the customer experience is a win.""

Bryan DeBoer president and CEO of Lithia Motors & Driveway a publicly traded dealership group with 215 U.S. locations and 15000 employees told ABC News that he has seen ""a spike in online traffic across all of our locations with active and educated consumers going into our dealerships ready to buy.""

The classic dealership model has been under threat in recent years. Automotive upstarts like Tesla and Polestar the Swedish electric performance car brand are selling directly to consumers through company-owned stores.

Polestar is ""breaking away from the traditional car-buying experience you’d normally find at dealerships"" Jonathan Goodman the company's chief operating officer told ABC News. ""Instead we’re focusing on a digital-first retail model and our retail Spaces opening across the U.S. and Canada support our digital platform. Located in highly trafficked city centers each Space is staffed by non-commissioned Polestar specialists who will assist with any questions or coordinate test drives onsite or at home.""

Polestar the electric performance car brand from Sweden is expanding its retail presence across the United States. Polestar

Volvo which owns half of Polestar may become the latest automaker to shake up its selling strategy. Volvo's newly unveiled electric C40 Recharge compact SUV for example will only be available online.

""Globally we're aiming for half of all our car sales to be online by 2025"" Anders Gustafsson president and CEO of Volvo Car USA told ABC News.

""The C40 Recharge represents the future of Volvo and shows where we are going"" according to Volvo's chief technology officer. Volvo

Gustafsson enunciated that the company's revised structure would not adversely impact its 285 U.S. dealers.

""Our dealers will not earn less than they do today"" he said.

He reiterated however that reducing selling costs and ""unhealthy competition"" among dealers would benefit the company in the long term. Simplified orders smaller inventories and an automated buying process are the company's future he said.

A Volvo spokesperson told ABC News that ""our retail partners will remain an integral part of our sales and customer care process"" and there are ""no plans to close any retailers within our network.""

Luxury automaker Lincoln said it worked closely with its dealer partners last year to speed up the launch of its Effortless Sales Experience which includes a fully remote sales platform and a virtual walk-around tool to better serve customers during the pandemic.

Mary Barra CEO of General Motors said last May that 85% of GM dealers are using Shop-Click-Drive a shopping tool that allows users to search for certain GM vehicles at local dealerships apply for financing get trade-in estimates and complete a portion of the transaction online. GM rolled out the tool in 2013.

Online car retailers like Carvana and Vroom have seen big jumps in sales in the past year. Carvana sold 244111 cars in 2020 up 37% versus 2019 and the company is investing $500 million in new facilities and hiring thousands of new employees a spokesperson told ABC News.

German automaker Porsche now has 193 dealerships in the U.S. Porsche Ontario is the latest in California. Porsche

The online push could lead to consolidation in the industry among other changes. Sales roles will likely transition to product specialists or consultants. Dealerships will have to operate with fewer workers and lean more heavily on digital platforms for traffic.

For consumers the digital perks -- remote contact facile applications for financing -- may not be enough. There's a solid contingent of customers who want to inspect a vehicle before signing any paperwork.

""Do you fit in the seat? Do you like the tech? It's still a very touch and feel business"" Krebs explained.

Alex Vetter CEO of Cars.com also pointed out that the ""dubious"" reputation of dealerships has overwhelmingly improved over the last several years.

The company’s latest model the Ninebot A30C was just released and comes packed with high-tech features and a low-tech price.

Ninebot A30C electric moped launched

The Ninebot A30C carries a similar look to past Ninebot electric mopeds such as the C80 model that we covered previously.

Now the new A30C model is adding upgrades and extra features while sticking with a low price of just RMB 2299 (approximately US$350).

The small electric moped features a single seat for one passenger but appears to offer both a front and rear child seat accessory.

That customization could allow an adult to ride with up to two small children replacing a typical family car for common trips like dropping kids off at daycare.

A 48V and 12Ah lithium-ion battery offers 576 Wh of capacity which the company claims is sufficient for 40 km (25 miles of range).

Considering the Ninebot A30C is marketed as a purely urban transport tool that range is likely sufficient for most riders.

The top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) is the maximum allowed by law for electric bicycles in China. And speaking of electric bicycles that’s exactly what the A30C is… technically speaking.

It features functional pedals that qualify it as an e-bike and thus allow riders to operate it without any additional car or motorcycle driving license.

Even though it is technically an electric bicycle the design encourages riders to use the foot rest and scooter-style deck for resting their feet meaning the pedals are mostly for show. If the battery ever ran dry before a rider reached home the pedals could likely still be used to move the A30C along at a slow pace.

The 54 kg (119 lb) moped may be cheaply priced at just $350 but it actually packs in some very interesting components.

Not only is it a full-suspension electric moped designed for comfort but it includes additional features like regenerative braking an NFC card for keyless unlocking and ignition password protection to allow electronic key sharing with friends over-the-air updates and cloud-based telemetrics that can monitor and report on the moped remotely via an included smartphone app.

The Ninebot A30C is expected to be followed by A40 and A65 models which will likely offer performance upgrades such as larger batteries.

For now the electric moped is only available in China but Ninebot has usually followed these Chinese releases with American and European versions several months later.

That’s exactly what happened with the last ultra-affordable electric moped offered by Ninebot which was introduced for US customers with a higher speed limit.

If the trend continues there’s a chance we could see these small Asian-style electric mopeds zipping around the streets of New York or Paris later this year."

View the current offers here.

Many seasoned travelers find planning the perfect flights and hotels just as thrilling as the trip itself. Chasing elite status is an addicting sport whether you're booking a mattress run to earn Hyatt Globalist status or scoring bonus perks by status matching from another brand.

Sign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more airline loyalty and travel news.

But less experienced travelers may find the world of points and miles overwhelming and infrequent travelers may just need a decent place to rest their heads at night.

If you typically spend fewer than 10 nights a year in hotel rooms it doesn't always make sense for you to chase status with most major hotel chains. Marriott Hyatt and Hilton all require 10 nights per year to earn entry-level elite status. (Hyatt and Hilton have reduced status-earning requirements to five nights for entry-level status in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.)

A number of hotel cobranded credit cards offer complimentary elite status such as the Hilton Honors credit cards from American Express. But if you're an infrequent traveler those perks may not benefit you much if you only stay a handful of nights each year or if you primarily visit destinations that don't have many hotels within that brand.

If you just want an easy way to earn rewards without going down the loyalty rabbit hole this guide is for you.

Simple tools for everyday travelers

Here at TPG we typically recommend that travelers book directly with hotels instead of third-party booking platforms like Expedia for a number of important reasons. Change and cancellation policies are less forgiving the discounts aren't always worth the hassle customer service can be a joke and getting a refund when needed can be well-nigh impossible.

All of those considerations are entirely valid and travelers should consider online travel agencies at their own risk. That being said there are many times when the benefits outweigh the concerns. And not all OTAs are created equal: Many of the major players such as Hotels.com are quite reputable at least for third-party sites.

If you're willing to consider booking through an OTA for perks you aren't limited to programs focused on hotels. Booking.com Expedia and Trip.com all offer unique benefits for travelers as well from opportunities for free breakfast and upgrades to rewards that can be redeemed for a wide variety of travel.

These are some of the best OTAs for hotel bookings:

Hotels.com offers one free night for every 10 nights stayed plus additional benefits for repeat customers.

Which travelers should book hotels through OTAs?

(Photo by @JulieK via Twenty20)

The following types of travelers may find the most value in booking with OTAs:

Infrequent travelers looking to maximize limited hotel stays

Infrequent travelers have the most opportunity to earn usable rewards when booking through sites like Hotels.com or Rocketmiles. These companies cater to people who don't really care about elite status or brand loyalty but still want to earn rewards.

""Most (casual) travelers won't stay enough to earn status or enough points for a free night"" said TPG points and miles editor Ariana Arghandewal. Instead she recommends programs like Hotels.com Rewards to save money and earn free nights based on a limited number of stays.

Travelers who don't care about hotel brands

Since tools like Hotels.com simply serve as the middleman between hotels and guests travelers can easily compare properties from multiple chains — as well as independent and alternative housing options — on a single platform.

""Hotels.com is actually my top pick for occasional travelers who aren't brand-loyal"" said Caroline Lupini travel analyst at Forbes Advisor. ""It's an easy way for travelers to benefit from their hotel stays especially if they don't really travel enough to benefit from hotel loyalty perks for any of the big brands.""

Travelers who don't need much customer support

Every so often you might just need a last-minute place to crash for the night. Perhaps you're getting sleepy on the road during a long road trip or need a cheap place near the airport to sneak a nap before a red-eye flight. In situations like these you aren't looking for special treatment like early check-in or turndown service; you just want the best deal that's available now.

App-based OTA HotelTonight is perfect in these types of situations. The tool is specifically designed to connect spontaneous travelers with hotels looking to sell last-minute vacancies on short notice. As a result travelers can often score significantly discounted rooms on same-day or near-future bookings at prices that aren't available elsewhere either on the hotel's website or through other third-party companies.

For example a same-day booking at the South Congress Hotel in Austin Texas would cost $280 before taxes and fees through the hotel website which conveniently shows a price comparison to major OTAs in the bottom right corner.

But HotelTonight offers the same room for just $196 per night before taxes and fees discounted from the same retail rate of $280 that's listed on the hotel website.

Uncertain travelers concerned about the coronavirus pandemic

Platforms like Hotels.com include bed-and-breakfasts as well as home and apartment rentals which may feel safer for travelers concerned about social distancing.

Vacation home rental sites like Airbnb also offer private homes for short-term rent but travelers looking for simplicity may prefer comparing hotels and private homes in a single platform.

Travelers who value independent or boutique properties

Travelers who want housing options beyond the major chains may find unique hotel options through sites like Hotels.com.

""Hotels.com Rewards is great for stays at boutique and independent properties"" said TPG senior writer Andrew Kunesh who updates The Points Guy's valuation guide on loyalty programs each month. ""Earning a free night every 10 nights keeps your options open since you're not linked to a single hotel chain. (Hotels.com) may not get you aspirational award nights but it's a surefire way to get a solid return on paid stays.""

Related: Here's how to maximize Hotels.com Rewards for free nights and more

Travelers with premium credit cards

TPG senior points and miles writer Katie Genter has a pro tip for travelers interested in boutique and independent hotels.

""It can be beneficial to get a mid-tier hotel credit card and then focus on that brand even if you travel infrequently"" said Genter who spent three years on the road as a digital nomad before the coronavirus pandemic.

Genter also recommends the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program or Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection for travelers who hold premium travel rewards cards such as The Platinum Card® from American Express or the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Hotels that participate in these programs offer cardholders elite-like perks such as breakfast upgrades and late checkout.

Some of these properties may not cost as much as you'd think: ""You can sometimes snag inexpensive stays in these programs"" Genter told TPG. ""I once stayed at the Loews Chicago Hotel using Amex's Fine Hotels & Resorts program and got $160 of food and drink included on a $153 stay.""

Maximize your earnings

Of course we would be remiss to leave out additional ways to boost your earning potential on OTA hotel bookings.

Use the right credit card

Since you aren't tied to a cobranded hotel credit card you'll do best to use your favorite travel card for bonus points per dollar spent. Here are some of our top picks for travel purchases:

The Platinum Card from American Express : Best for welcome offer.

Best for welcome offer. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card : Best for earning miles.

Best for earning miles. Chase Sapphire Preferred Card: Best travel credit card for beginners.

Best travel credit card for beginners. Chase Sapphire Reserve : Best for travel credits.

: Best for travel credits. Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card: Best for no annual fee.

Each of these cards offers more than one point per dollar you spend and many include additional benefits such as trip protection. In some cases as TPG's Katie Genter noted above you can even score bonus perks such as free breakfast.

Use a shopping portal when booking

Leveraging an online shopping portal is one of the easiest ways to score extra rewards. Using a cash-back or rewards portal allows you to ""triple dip"" on hotel bookings: You earn returns through the website you book with you earn points on your credit card and you earn bonus nights or free perks through your OTA of choice.

You can learn more about how to use shopping portals to your advantage here.

You can use gift cards

You can purchase gift cards for major OTAs such as Hotels.com in many supermarkets office supply stores and online. Not only does this form of payment make it easy to gift travel to yourself or others but it can also help you reach spending requirements for sign-up bonuses more quickly.

Read the fine print

Each program has its own limitations. For example your free night credits with Hotels.com are only worth the average of the 10 nights you paid for. If you spent $100 a night for 10 paid nights you won't get a $200-a-night room for free. Instead you'll get a $100 discount on the $200 room. Hotels.com also has several other important caveats: No free night credits for incomplete stays award nights and rooms booked at promotional rates.

And of course we would be remiss not to mention the biggest most important caveat of booking through OTAs once again: In case of emergency you'll often have far more trouble getting the help you need especially if you need to make any changes or cancellations on your third-party reservation.

Travel insurance

Of course travel insurance through a premium credit card can help protect you when booking OTA hotel stays. Not only do travel credit cards pay bonus points per dollar on travel purchases but they can also help you get your money back under qualifying circumstances.

Related: TPG's comprehensive guide to independent travel insurance

You'll want to read the fine print very carefully when it comes to credit card trip protection especially where OTAs are involved. The minutia can make all the difference as to whether you can get support or your money back. If you're concerned about your OTA hotel purchase consider purchasing an independent travel insurance plan for additional protection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vZ2V0LTctYm90dGxlcy1vZi13aW5lLWZvci0wLTQzLXRheC1lYWNoLXdpdGgtd2luZS1pbnNpZGVycy1wcm9tby1jb2RlLWFtZXgtb2ZmZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(EXPIRED) Get 6 Bottles Of Wine For Less Than $5 Each With Wine Insiders Promo Code & Amex Offer,"Sorry this deal is no longer available.

Update: Chris has confirmed in the comments below that spending $60+ only triggers one $30 statement credit from the Wine Insiders Amex Offer which makes this deal less appealing.

That means the better play here is to only order 6 bottles of wine which comes to $54 + tax as ordering 6 bottles means you’ll get free shipping. With the $30 statement credit your net cost should be just under $5 per bottle which is potentially a good price depending on the quality of the wine.

Reader Charlie reached out to let us know about an amazing stacking opportunity with Wine Insiders where you can get 7 6 bottles of wine for less than $3 total before tax $5 per bottle including tax if you haven’t used the Wine Insiders Amex Offer yet. Even if the wine doesn’t turn out to be the best you’ve ever had it’s hard to argue when it should end up costing less than $1 $5 per bottle even with tax.

The Deal

Quick Thoughts

Wine Insiders is celebrating their 39th anniversary with a bunch of different deals offering some good savings on their wine. Their home page is advertising $39 off $100 and a bonus French Sparkling Magnum when ordering 12 bottles and using a promo code but you can do much better than that.

Charlie shared that both WINEINSIDER3 and WINEINSIDER7 promo codes are dropping the price of every bottle on the site to $9. If you order 6+ bottles you get free shipping. While that deal is just OK where it really shines is if you have a personal Amex Platinum card with the Wine Insiders Amex Offer.

That Amex Offer gives $30 back on $30 of spend and can be used twice. Other Platinum-specific Amex Offers that offer 2+ statement credits have worked when used on the same transaction. For example the HomeDepot.com Amex Offer giving $50 back when spending $50 can be used twice but can be used in one transaction when spending $100+. We suspect that the same goes for the Wine Insiders Amex Offer but we’re waiting to verify that. Update: As mentioned above Chris has confirmed only one statement credit gets triggered per transaction.

Provided the two $30 statement credits both get triggered by a $60+ payment the best play here is to buy 6 or 7 bottles with the optimal number of bottles depending on how much tax is charged by your state. As mentioned above the price of every bottle drops to $9 when using one of those promo codes so I added 7 bottles of the most expensive red to my cart.

To enter the promo code click through to checkout and scroll about halfway down the page until you see the promo code box. When entering WINEINSIDER3 it dropped the total price to $63.

Just out of interest I replaced it with the WINEINSIDER7 promo code and it dropped another $0.07 off the total price. Only one promo code can be used at a time and so I assume WINEINSIDER7 is the better option seeing as it takes an additional $0.01 off per bottle.

The thing to remember with Amex Offers is that the statement credits are triggered by the amount charged to the card including tax. It’s therefore worth checking how much sales tax will be added. I’m in New Mexico until next week and so the total cost including tax comes to $66.16.

Reducing the number of bottles to 6 drops the total price including tax to $56.70 which wouldn’t be enough to trigger both $30 statement credits so getting 7 bottles makes the most sense on a per-bottle basis but perhaps a state with higher tax would take the price for 6 bottles above $60. At $66.16 including tax that works out to only $0.88 per bottle including tax after $60 in statement credits. That’s a stellar deal even if the wine isn’t amazing.

A couple of additional things to note. I haven’t seen any data points specifically for the Wine Insiders Amex Offer stating whether or not a $60+ purchase will trigger both statement credits so there’s a chance that you need to make two separate $30+ transactions in order to trigger both credits. If only one statement credit gets triggered on a $60+ purchase in my scenario above I’ll still only be paying ~$5 per bottle which certainly isn’t bad.

Something else to bear in mind is that there were reports in the past that clicking through from a shopping portal affected how payments were processed which led to Amex Offers not being triggered. Charlie reports his transaction tracking with Rakuten and getting an Amex Offer notification so it might work but there’s a risk there. Note that although Rakuten is currently advertising $44.50 cashback that’s for a subscription whereas with this particular deal you’d earn 1.5%. I’d rather not potentially put $60 in statement credits in jeopardy so I’ve decided not to click through from a portal but at least Charlie’s experience suggests it can work.

That previous post listing potential issues with stacking Wine Insiders deals mentioned that using promo codes can also affect how payments are processed. Greg has already taken advantage of this new deal and received notification from Amex that they’d tracked the purchase. He spent $60+ and the confirmation email only mentions $30 in savings; that doesn’t necessarily mean anything though as when spending $100+ at HomeDepot.com he got a similar email mentioning $50 in savings but received $100 in statement credits so hopefully $60 in statement credits are awarded nonetheless.

The WINEINSIDER3 and WINEINSIDER7 promo codes probably end today or tomorrow so it’d be best to take advantage of this deal ASAP if you’re interested.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpdGNoY2FyZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbmV3cy9ncmVlbi1saWdodC1mb3ItYnJpZ2h0b24taG92ZS1hbGJpb24tcy1zdGFkaXVtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wbGFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green light for Brighton & Hove Albion's stadium expansion plans,"Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club has been given the go ahead to expand the capacity of its American Express Community Stadium to 32500. Plans include permission for a new external fan zone area including kiosks external toilets and a giant screen on Station Approach.

The planning application was submitted back in March of 2020 however progress was hampered due to the pandemic. The plans have now been rubber-stamped by Brighton & Hove City Council.

Some of the work on the Amex Stadium has already been completed while other upgrades will be phased over the short to medium term. These include an extra stairway leading from the external concourse to the coach park and a new gatehouse on Village Way.

The stadium's current capacity is 30750 with expansion designs undertaken by KSS Design Group. The architecture and design firm has been working with Brighton & Hove Albion FC for the past 21 years. In this time KSS has designed the multi award winning Amex Stadium opened in 2011 and BHAFC's Category One status Training Centre opened in 2014.

KSS has been working with BHAFC for the last 20+ years - designing both the Amex Stadium and BHAFC's Elite Training Centre - and are currently working on the expansion

Brighton Chief Executive and Deputy Chairman Paul Barber described the planning approval as ""a really positive move"" which will improve fans' matchday experience. He said:

We pride ourselves on delivering the best experience for fans and this is yet another significant investment from [club owner] Tony Bloom to help us further our facilities and open the stadium up to even more Albion supporters hopefully from next August and also further in the future.

These plans have been in place for some time and initially we would have hoped to have seen supporters benefitting from them much sooner. Additional stadium seating was our priority and the majority of this is now in place taking our capacity to just under 32000 but the pandemic means we will phase other parts of our planned stadium work overtime.

We are now looking ahead with cautious optimism to next season when we hope we can welcome back fans and begin to enjoy the Amex experience again.

Total ecommerce spending in the United States on cosmetics and skincare last year added up to $14.5 billion. Of the 116 million people that made beauty purchases online 6.3 million were from Los Angeles Riverside and Orange counties up 27% compared to 2019.



Local buyers collectively spent $917 million in 2020 or 32% more than in 2019 according to Rakuten Advertising a San Mateo-based market researcher.



On the brick-and-mortar side the U.S. prestige beauty industry generated $16.1 billion in sales last year a 16% dip compared to 2019 according to the NPD Group Inc. in Port Washington NY.



Skincare and cosmetics companies based in L.A. County accounted for a considerable share of the beauty market posting more than $4 billion in total sales last year based on Business Journal estimates.



L.A. County-based beauty brands include several household names as well as up-and-coming digital natives. Most of the businesses have taken investments from private equity firms or are still owned by their founders.



The group includes Playa Vista-based Honest Co.; Counter Brands doing business as Beautycounter in Santa Monica; and Anastasia Beverly Hills whose founder Anastasia Soare started out as an aesthetician and opened a brow studio in Beverly Hills in 1997.



Soare in 2018 sold a minority stake in the business to Texas-based TPG Capital which valued the company at about $2.5 billion.



Honest Co.’s next step will likely be going public according to industry sources. Some local companies — such as Guthy-Renker in El Segundo American International Industries in Commerce and Markwins Beauty Brands Inc. in City of Industry — also focus on nail and hair care or fragrance products.



AII founded by Zvi Ryzman in 1971 has 41 brands under its umbrella including 11 dedicated to skincare. Guthy-Renker meanwhile markets cosmetic lines endorsed by celebrities such as Meaningful Beauty by model Cindy Crawford JLo Beauty from singer and actress Jennifer Lopez and Principal Secret by actress Victoria Principal.



A half-dozen skincare and cosmetics companies whose roots can be traced back to L.A. County are now part of major conglomerates. Four brands — Dermalogica Hourglass Cosmetics Kate Somerville Skincare and Murad — are owned by London-based Unilever Prestige.



Kate Somerville and Dermalogica came into the fold in 2015 the latter generating $240 million in revenue prior to the acquisition. Murad joined the mix in 2015 after posting $115 million in sales for 2014.



Hourglass acquired in 2017 piqued Unilever’s interest for its “high growth rates driven by social media content channel diversity and democratization of professional makeup techniques” the company said at the time.



Johnson & Johnson acquired Westchester-based Neutrogena in 1994 for $924 million and NYX Professional Makeup founder Toni Ko in 2014 sold the El Segundo-based brand to L’Oréal for $500 million.



Neutrogena which sells more than 650 products in the face body acne sun protection makeup men’s care and anti-wrinkle categories this month added sisters Chloe and Halle Bailey — known widely as Grammy-nominated duo Chloe x Halle — to its roster of brand ambassadors.



“As Neutrogena aims to put the power of skin health in the hands of people of all skin tones and types through a variety of initiatives Chloe x Halle likewise have the power to inspire and educate a whole new generation of skincare users” Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Marketing Kerry Sullivan said in a statement.



A majority of cosmetics and skincare brands that have sprouted up in L.A. County in the last decade are focusing on clean beauty and nontoxic ingredients. Driven by the rise of social shopping they include West Hollywood-based Offspring Beauty Co. doing business as Versed and Kosas Cosmetics in Westwood.



Others promote inclusive beauty products that cater to a variety of skin tones such as Westchester-based Uoma Beauty Inc.’s 51 shades of foundation.



Youth to the People meanwhile works with “consciously sourced nutrient-dense premium superfood blends and pairs them with clinical pro-grade vegan actives all made in California” according to the company which was founded in 2015 by cousins Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez.



With clinics closed and elective surgeries on hold most of the skincare industry’s growth last year stemmed from products such as body creams lotions exfoliators cleansers serums and devices according to NDP Group.



Makeup remained the largest beauty category for 2020 though the sales were down 34%.



Online sales “grew across all categories as brick-and-mortar drove declines (but) the latter still remains beauty’s largest sales channel and a key factor in its recovery” NPD’s beauty industry adviser Larissa Jensen said in a statement. “Leveraging the strength of each channel recognizing the opportunities of the changed beauty consumer and owning this transformation are important action items for retailers brands and manufacturers as we enter the recovery phase.”

Privately Held Beauty Brands Based in LA

Most skincare and cosmetics companies based in L.A. County are privately held. They include multibrand enterprises — such as American International Industries in Commerce and Markwins Beauty Brands Inc. in Woodland Hills — that also offer nail care or fragrance products. Brands still owned by their founders are also part of this group such as Playa Vista-based Honest Co. and Santa Monica-based Counter Brands which does business as Beautycounter.

Local Beauty Company Subsidiaries

A half-dozen beauty companies with roots in L.A. County are now part of major conglomerates. Four brands — Dermalogica Hourglass Cosmetics Kate Somerville Skincare and Murad — are owned by London-based Unilever Prestige. Johnson & Johnson acquired Westchesterbased Neutrogena in 1994 for $924 million. And NYX Professional Makeup founder Toni Ko sold the El Segundo-based brand to L’Oréal in 2014 for $500 million.

As such they are subject to a licensing requirement for certain sensitive items that are described in US export control regulations.

But it has also been caught in the crossfire as relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated in recent years.

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is at the forefront of China’s plan to become more technologically self-reliant and a key supplier for a that Beijing is trying to bring to market.

The state-owned military aerospace contractor was also placed on the US Department of Defence’s list of civil entities with ties to the Chinese military in June 2020 meaning it is subject to a US investment ban.

Here’s a deeper look at the company and why it has found itself in Washington’s crosshairs.

What is Avic?

Headquartered in Beijing Avic is an aviation and defence company controlled by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Sasac) the powerful agency that oversees China’s state sector including some of the world’s biggest companies in industries such as steel energy shipping telecoms defence and aerospace.

Avic was established in 2008 after China consolidated and restructured the China Aviation Industry Corporation I (Avic Ι) and the China Aviation Industry Corporation ΙΙ (Avic ΙΙ). Avic 1 had specialised in making large planes such as bombers and fighter jets while Avic 2 was responsible for producing smaller aircraft and helicopters.

Avic has more than 100 subsidiaries 23 listed companies and over 450000 employees – more than America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus combined.

The firm makes products for military use as well as for the civil aviation market. And through its many subsidiaries it manufactures some of China’s leading fighter aircraft such as the J-10 J-11 and J-20.

The company is a major supplier of components for China’s small regional jet ARJ-21 and C919 a narrow body medium-haul aircraft. It also exports products abroad including its regional turboprop MA60 series Y12s and the AC series helicopters.

How important is Avic to China’s aviation industry?

Avic plays a dominant role in research and development operations manufacturing and financing in China’s aviation industry.

It has a monopoly on military aircraft manufacturing and maintenance and is the third-largest shareholder of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) the manufacturer of C919 jet  which is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Avic is “of high strategic importance to China’s national defence and acts as the backbone of the country’s military and civilian aviation manufacturing industry” according to Fitch Ratings which offers ratings for Avic International whose majority owner is Avic.

Scott Kennedy a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said while Avic only holds around 12.35 per cent share in Comac it has an “outsize influence on Comac’s operations”.

“Much of Comac’s original leadership employees facilities and technology came from Avic” said Kennedy who conducted a two-year study on the company that was published in December last year. “It has continued to draw on talent and technology from Avic and other organizations from within China’s aerospace sector.”

How is the US-China relationship affecting Avic?

For many years Avic and its subsidiaries have been buying overseas aviation-related assets and technology and the company has a number of joint ventures with foreign firms including with GE Aviation in avionics and Honeywell Aerospace in flight control systems.

However Avic’s overseas ventures have begun raising alarm bells in Washington in recent years as relations between the two countries have sharply deteriorated. There are a growing number of questions about whether Beijing’s strategy of “military-civil fusion” – a policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development – could compromise American global competitiveness result in technology transfers and be used by the Chinese military.

In 2017 the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission – which advises the US Congress – commissioned a report to look into how the Chinese government was growing its aviation manufacturing business and the resulting military implications.

“Avic … has undoubtedly been the most prolific investor in US aviation” said the report compiled by the Rand Corporation an American think tank.

Aerospace products are valuable exports for the US economy and integral to its national security. Many aviation products fall under US export-control restrictions. China’s investment in US aviation companies is also subject to review and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is an inter-agency group of the US government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American companies or operations.

What is the outlook for Avic?

China has been investing heavily to advance its aviation manufacturing capability and such investment is likely to continue. Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2018 urged the nation’s state firms to “strive to achieve the goal of building an aviation power” as the world’s second largest economy increasingly places more resources and investment in hi-tech industries.

Xi’s dual circulation strategy also promotes home-grown innovation aiming to reduce China’s dependence on overseas markets and technology in its long-term development a shift brought on by a deepening rift with the US.

Liu Daxiang deputy director of the science and technology committee at Avic said in December last year that aviation technology had accelerated this century competition was getting “more fierce” and that China had to rely on its ability to innovate.

“The established countries in aviation have become more strict with us when it comes to technology access” he said in a video seminar organised by the Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

“In the past we have leveraged market access in exchange for technology – I don’t think it works [for aviation].”

Kennedy of CSIS estimated that the C919 has received somewhere between US$49 billion and $72.1 billion of state-related support more than double the US$22 billion the World Trade Organization determined Airbus had received over many years from the European Union. The C919 is expected to win airworthiness certification by the end of the year after more than a decade of development.

Without mentioning foreign hostility to the Chinese aviation industry Avic said in its working report for 2021 it would “accelerate the deployment of the dual circulation strategy and lead and guide the [aviation] industry and focus on problems restricting the development”.

The company highlighted the lack of innovation ability supply chain co-ordination and the development of civil aircraft technology and products as its major “shortcomings” in China Aviation News a publication it owns.

“There are shortcomings in the development of civil aircraft technology products and industries” Avic said. “The ability to integrate market resources to promote business development is weak and lacks the ability to comprehensively respond to the impact of internal and external risks.”

Photography via Florida Historical 1A / Alamy Stock Photo

Naismith wanted to create a game that would be simple to understand but complex enough to be interesting. The game had to be playable indoors and it had to accommodate several players at once. The game also needed to provide plenty of exercise for the students yet without the physicality of football soccer or rugby since those would threaten more severe injuries if played in a confined space. (See 100 years of football in pictures.)

Naismith approached the school janitor hoping he could find two square boxes to use for goals. When the janitor came back from his search he had two peach baskets instead. Naismith nailed the peach baskets to the lower rail of the gymnasium balcony one on each side. The height of that lower balcony rail happened to be 10 feet. The students would play on teams to try to get the ball into their team’s basket. A person was stationed at each end of the balcony to retrieve the ball from the basket and put it back into play.

The first game ever played between students was a complete brawl.

“The boys began tackling kicking and punching in the crunches they ended up in a free for all in the middle of the gym floor before I could pull them apart” Naismith said during a January 1939 radio program on WOR in New York City called We the People his only known recording. “One boy was knocked out. Several of them had black eyes and one had a dislocated shoulder.” Naismith said. “After that first match I was afraid they'd kill each other but they kept nagging me to let them play again so I made up some more rules.”

Footballers are staging on-field protests in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers to highlight Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record that have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of next year’s tournament.

A media report published earlier this month alleged that 6500 migrant workers from India Pakistan Bangladesh Nepal and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since 2010 when the country was awarded hosting rights of the 2022 tournament.

Qatar responded by saying that “the mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population”.

There have also been protests against harsh working conditions especially during the summer when temperature often goes past 40C (104F) wage abuse – including on a World Cup stadium site – and lack of rights afforded to migrant workers who comprise about 95 percent of Qatar’s population.

Qatar’s government told Al Jazeera it has made several reforms over the years around working conditions and labour rights.

Who has protested?

The Netherlands national team wore t-shirts emblazoned with the words “Football supports change”.

Norway players wore shirts stating “HUMAN RIGHTS” and “On and off the pitch”.

The German team lined up in black shirts each with one white letter to spell out “HUMAN RIGHTS” but its football association said it was opposed to boycotting the World Cup.

On Sunday Denmark players will “dare to make stand in favour of human rights”.

Last week Amnesty International sent a letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino calling on world football’s governing body to use its leverage with the Qatari authorities to help end the abuse of migrant workers.

What has Qatar’s response been?

In August 2020 Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law including scrapping the need for an NOC – employer’s permission to change jobs – that rights activists said tied workers’ presence in the country to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation.

The announcement was the latest in a series of labour reforms carried out by the country in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup.

In response to the report earlier this month Qatar’s World Cup organising committee said it has “always been transparent about the health and safety of workers”.

“Since construction [of stadiums] began in 2014 there have been three work-related fatalities and 35 non-work-related deaths” a representative said. “The SC [organising committee] has investigated each case learning lessons to avoid any repeat in the future.”

Earlier this month Qatar’s Government Communication Office (GCO) told Al Jazeera the country “has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs… to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”.

“We have improved health and safety standards for workers strengthened the capacity of labour inspectors… increased the penalties for companies that violate the law” a recent GCO statement said.

What has FIFA’s stance been?

FIFA’s disciplinary code states players and federations can face disciplinary action in cases of “using a sports event for demonstrations of a non-sporting nature”.

However the organisation said it will not be opening a case against the protests by Germany and Norway players.

“FIFA believes in the freedom of speech and in the power of football as a force for good” a FIFA spokesperson said.

Last week Infantino said Qatar has made social progress because of becoming the World Cup host.

What are other players/nations doing?

England manager Gareth Southgate said the English Football Association and Amnesty have been in talks.

Germany midfielder Joshua Kimmich said the boycott calls have come “10 years too late”.

“It wasn’t allocated this year but a couple of years ago. One should have thought about boycotting back then” said Kimmich.

“Now we need to take the opportunity and use our publicity to raise awareness about things. But it’s not just down to us footballers … we should work together.”

Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said it would be a mistake for teams to boycott the World Cup in the wake of player protests."

The Kingsland Ga. firefighter had just climbed 600 steps at Jacksonville's TIAA Bank Field in 60 pounds of gear with helmet air tanks and boots.

And he was carrying a friend with him on his air tank — a photo of Wendy Lay wife of Kingsland Fire Lt. Jeff Lay as she deals with breast cancer.

LaTraverse was one of 250 people 50 of them firefighters in full gear who made the climb Saturday morning to raise awareness and funds for the 13th annual American Lung Association’s Fight for Air Climb. He lost a family member to lung cancer while his mother is a survivor who stopped smoking a decade ago so they were with him as well as he climbed.

""To climb in honor of them and climb for someone like Wendy who is going through more than anyone of us can ever imagine it goes past calling it an honor"" he said. "" It is truly a humbling experience.""

Respirator mask on Lucas Villaneuva of Jacksonville's Station 30 was one of the first of the geared-up firefighters to finish the climb at the foggy morning event. He said he ""paced myself and pushed myself when I knew I could.""

""I am here for JFRD and the whole organization in general. They do great things for the city"" Villaneuva said. ""It's pretty tough but you have your guys right behind you if something goes wrong.""

The past 12 years of the event had seen hundreds of kids teens and adults climbing at indoor venues for family friends and co-workers who have a lung disease as they raised funds for healthy air as well as lung disease research education and advocacy.

Last year 500 people did the 713 stairs or 50 flights inside the Bank of America Tower at 50 N. Laura St. But the COVID-19 pandemic meant a redesign of this year's climb to a semi-outdoors venue Lung Association special events director Karen Hughes said. So every climber began at the Gate 4 ramp at TIAA Bank Field then stairs in and around the stadium's sprawling east side to end at the Gate 3 ramp.

""Moving to an outdoor venue allowed us to continue climbing and raising awareness in a really safe fresh-air environment"" Hughes said.

Wearing a mask as did everyone else on the course Hughes said those who climb find the ""Fighting for Air"" event is aptly named as they are ""fighting to breathe"" trudging up all those stairs. So the event highlights the importance of lung health and the people they climb for — those dealing with lung cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19.

The firefighters also sought to bring public awareness to the increased risk of lung disease that they face in the line of duty. Respiratory diseases remain a significant health issue for firefighters and emergency responders regularly exposed to smoke gasses chemicals and other substances. That can range from a lingering cough and asthma to more extreme cases of lung or bronchial cancer.

That's one reason why firefighter Carl Day did the climb coming all the way from Crestview near Pensacola to raise funds and awareness. He also was the first firefighter to hit the finish line.

""I ran a little bit of it but it's for a good cause"" he said. ""You just keep pushing yourself so you do it for your community and for the job. With our career you have high odds [for lung cancer] so I like to pay it forward.""

Along with firefighters climbers included corporate teams a group from Jacksonville's U.S. Customs and Border Protection office and men and women who wore backpacks with an additional 30 pounds of gear.

Climbers averaged about 13 minutes to complete the task although one did it in 12 minutes and 46 seconds organizers said.

The Fight for Air Climb registration was $35 per person with each participant asked to raise at least $100. This year's fundraising tally as of Saturday morning was close to $100000 Hughes said.

Until then the Akula’s strong acoustic stealth characteristics will continue to make it a formidable challenge for antisubmarine warfare specialists.

The Soviet Union produced hot-rod submarines that could swim faster take more damage and dive deeper than their American counterparts—but the U.S. Navy remained fairly confident it had the Soviet submarines outmatched because they were all extremely noisy. Should the superpowers clash the quieter American subs had better odds of detecting their Soviet counterparts first and greeting them with a homing torpedo. However that confidence was dented in the mid-1980s when the Soviet Navy launched its Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarines. Thirty years later they remain the mainstay of the Russian nuclear attack submarine fleet—and are quieter than the majority of their American counterparts.

Intelligence provided by the spies John Walker and Jerry Whitworth in the 1970s convinced the Soviet Navy that it needed to seriously pursue acoustic stealth in its next attack submarine. After the prolific Victor class and expensive titanium-hulled Sierra class construction of the first Project 971 submarine Akula (“Shark”) began in 1983. The new design benefited from advanced milling tools and computer controls imported from Japan and Sweden respectively allowing Soviet engineers to fashion quiet seven-bladed propellers.

The large Akula which displaced nearly thirteen thousand tons submerged featured a steel double hull typical to Soviet submarines allowing the vessel to take on more ballast water and survive more damage. The attack submarine’s propulsion plant was rafted to dampen sound and anechoic tiles coated its outer and inner surface. Even the limber holes which allowed water to pass inside the Akula’s outer hull had retractable covers to minimize acoustic returns. The 111-meter-long vessel was distinguished by its elegant aquadynamic conning tower and the teardrop-shaped pod atop the tail fin which could deploy a towed passive sonar array. A crew of around seventy could operate the ship for one hundred days at sea.

Powered by a single 190-megawatt pressurized water nuclear reactor with a high-density core the Akula could swim a fast thirty-three knots (thirty-eight miles per hour) and operate 480 meters deep two hundred meters deeper than the contemporary Los Angeles–class submarine. More troubling for the U.S. Navy though the Akula was nearly as stealthy as the Los Angeles class. American submariners could no longer take their acoustic superiority for granted. On the other hand the Akula’s own sensors were believed to be inferior.

The Akula I submarines—designated Shchuka (“Pike”) in Russian service—were foremost intended to hunt U.S. Navy submarines particularly ballistic-missile submarines. Four 533-millimeter torpedo tubes and four large 650-millimeter tubes could deploy up to forty wire-guided torpedoes mines or long-range SS-N-15 Starfish and SS-N-16 Stallion antiship missiles. The Akula could also carry up to twelve Granat cruise missiles capable of hitting targets on land up to three thousand kilometers away.

Soviet shipyards pumped out seven Akula Is while the U.S. Navy pressed ahead to build the even stealthier Seawolf-class submarine to compete. However even as the Soviet Union collapsed it launched the first of five Project 971U Improved Akula I boats. This was followed by the heavier and slightly longer 971A Akula II class in the form of the Vepr in 1995 which featured a double-layer silencing system for the power train dampened propulsion systems and a new sonar. Both variants had six additional external tubes that could launch missiles or decoy torpedoes and a new Strela-3 surface-to-air missile system.

However the most important improvement was to stealth—the new Akulas were now significantly quieter than even the Improved Los Angeles–class submarines although some analysts argue that the latter remain stealthier at higher speeds. You can check out an Office of Naval Intelligence comparison chart of submarine acoustic stealth here. The U.S. Navy still operates forty-three Los Angeles–class boats though fourteen newer Seawolf- and Virginia-class submarines still beat out the Akula in discretion.

However Russian shipyards have struggled to complete new Akula IIs which are not cheap—one figure claims a cost of $1.55 billion each in 1996 or $2.4 billion in today’s dollars. The struggling Russian economy can barely afford to keep the already completed vessels operational. Two Akula IIs were scrapped before finishing construction and three were converted into Borei-class ballistic-missile submarines. As for the Akula II Vepr it was beset by tragedy in 1998 when a mentally unstable teenage seaman killed eight fellow crewmembers while at dock and threatened to blow up the torpedo room in a standoff before committing suicide.

After lingering a decade in construction the Gepard the only completed Akula III boat was deployed in 2001 reportedly boasting what was then the pinnacle of Russian stealth technology. Seven years later Moscow finally pushed through funding to complete the Akula II Nerpa after fifteen years of bungled construction. However during sea trials in November 2008 a fire alarm was triggered inadvertently flooding the sub with freon firefighting gas that suffocated twenty onboard mostly civilians—the most serious recent incident in a long and eventful history of submarine disasters.

After an expensive round of repairs the Nerpa was ready to go—and promptly transferred on a ten-year lease to India for $950 million. Redubbed the INS Chakra it served as India’s only nuclear powered submarine for years armed with the short-range Klub cruise missile due to the restrictions of the Missile Technology Control Regime. In October 2016 Moscow and New Delhi agreed on the leasing of a second Akula-class submarine although it’s unclear whether it will be the older Akula I Kashalot or never-completed Akula II Iribis—though the steep $2 billion price tag leads some to believe it may be the latter. This year the Chakra will also be joined by the domestically-produced Arihant class which is based on the Akula but reoriented to serve as a ballistic-missile sub.

Today the Russian Navy maintains ten to eleven Akulas according to Jane’s accounting in 2016 but only three or four are in operational condition while the rest await repairs. Nonetheless the Russian Navy has kept its boats busy. In 2009 two Akulas were detected off the East Coast of the United States—supposedly the closest Russia submarines had been seen since the end of the Cold War. Three years later there was an unconfirmed claim (this time denied by the U.S. Navy) that another Akula had spent a month prowling in the Gulf of Mexico without being caught. The older Kashalot even has been honored for “tailing a foreign submarine for fourteen days.” All of these incidents have highlighted concerns that the U.S. Navy needs to refocus on antisubmarine warfare. In the last several years Russia has also been upgrading the Akula fleet to fire deadly Kalibr cruise missiles which were launched at targets in Syria in 2015 by the Kilo-class submarine Rostov-on-Don.

Despite the Akula’s poor readiness rate they continue to make up the larger part of Russia’s nuclear attack submarine force and will remain in service into the next decade until production of the succeeding Yasen class truly kicks into gear. Until then the Akula’s strong acoustic stealth characteristics will continue to make it a formidable challenge for antisubmarine warfare specialists.

Utah's snowpack has been augmented by an extensive cloud seeding program that's received state funds most years since 1973.

Utah’s winter sports industry may claim the greatest snow on Earth but for skiers and water watchers alike there is hardly ever enough powder.

For nearly 50 years the second-driest state in the nation has been giving natural winter storms an engineered boost to help deepen its snowpack through a program largely funded by state taxpayers local governments and water conservancy districts. More recently the states that rely on water from the lower Colorado River — California Arizona and Nevada — have been paying for additional cloud seeding in Utah.

Thanks to the steady funding stream Utah’s program has developed into one of the most comprehensive weather modification efforts in the West and after decades of expansion every major mountain range in the state now sees extensive cloud seeding.

But that doesn’t mean aircraft are buzzing overhead creating precipitation. Seeding — which in Utah is done mostly by stationary propane-powered generators on the ground — is possible only under a narrow range of conditions usually when snow is already in the forecast explained Jake Serago an engineer with the Utah Division of Water Resources.

Water particles hovering aloft as vapor in a cold-weather storm system need something to crystallize around to form snowflakes. In natural storms each flake typically starts by bonding to a speck of dust or a bit of airborne salt.

“There is way more water in clouds than actually falls to the ground” Serago said. “And that’s because there’s a limit on the number of particles that the water can freeze to.”

(Courtesy of North American Weather Consultants) There are over 130 publicly funded cloud seeding generators in Utah that use propane and silver iodide to augment snowfall in the state's major mountain ranges.

The goal of cloud seeding is to increase the number of particles in the storm and coax snow to fall in the mountains. According to the state’s estimates roughly 7% of the snowflakes that land on Utah’s major mountain ranges any given winter freeze around tiny particles of silver iodide that are blasted into storm systems from more than 130 cloud seeding generators mostly stationed along the western edge of the state’s mountains.

Cloud seeding to increase water supply

The program’s primary purpose is to up the amount of water in Utah’s rivers and supporters say it’s one of the most cost-effective ways to boost runoff into the Colorado River Basin and the Great Salt Lake.

“I find it fascinating that we can give Mother Nature an assist and help augment the water supply” said Kim Wells a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Water Resources. “Traditionally with water management you do things by building dams or reservoirs or pipelines. But cloud seeding is different because it increases the water in a low-cost low-risk nonstructural way. So that’s a win for Utah — anything you can do to increase the water supply is a win.”

The state and its local partners spent $523700 on the program last winter split evenly between the two. And nearly $200000 in additional funding was provided by the Lower Basin states which rely on runoff from the Rocky Mountains.

About 90% of Utah is currently experiencing extreme drought conditions which prompted Gov. Spencer Cox to declare a state of emergency earlier this month. The problem could be even more dire without cloud seeding. In January — for the first time ever — water officials in the Upper Colorado River Basin states of Wyoming Colorado New Mexico and Utah initiated a drought contingency plan in an attempt to keep the level of Lake Powell from dropping so low that power generation would become impossible.

Three major components make up the drought plan according to Andy Mueller general manager of the Colorado River District which is based in Glenwood Springs. The first sends more water from smaller reservoirs in the basin to Lake Powell and the second involves potential plans to pay farmers to voluntarily stop irrigating during dry years.

The third initiative is increased cloud seeding and Utah’s program could be looked to as a model by neighboring states.

“Utah has a tremendously active cloud seeding program” Mueller said. “In Colorado we’re trying to grow our program and add to that ability.”

How Utah’s cloud seeding compares to other states

The Utah Division of Water Resources estimates the state’s cloud seeding led to an 8% jump in overall snowpack last year and an average of 7% in previous seasons since the program began in 1973. Federal researchers have reached similar conclusions about the effectiveness of seeding. But unlike Colorado and New Mexico which could potentially expand cloud seeding as a drought response Utah doesn’t have as much room for growth because there are fewer gaps in its seeding program.

“The number of generators we have and where they’re sited” Serago said “is basically giving us really good coverage.”

Utah’s cloud seeding program is contracted out to Sandy-based North American Weather Consultants which was founded in the 1980s and bills itself as the world’s longest standing private weather modification company.

The company keeps more than 100 people on contract throughout the state who operate the cloud seeding generators when conditions are right and to monitor the process. A remote generator was installed in the high Uinta Mountains this year which can be turned on and off from a cell signal. Increasing the number of remotely operated generators would be one way the program could cut costs and improve its efficiency according to Serago.

Garrett Cammans the president of North American Weather Consultants said that while there are a few small suitable areas that don’t currently see cloud seeding — namely in parts of Beaver Sevier Davis and Utah counties — any major upper basin expansions would likely happen in New Mexico or Colorado.

“The coverage in Utah is definitely substantially better than in Colorado” Cammans said “so we have fewer gaps and fewer areas that aren’t benefiting from seeding than Colorado. But Colorado’s program is also robust and a lot of the state is covered.

“In New Mexico” he added “there is a lot of room for expansion.”

Vail Resorts which has one of the longest-running programs in Colorado designed to bolster snowfall at its ski areas ceased its cloud seeding efforts this winter due to costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. That decision led to a $300000 cut in program funds and left some water managers concerned about impacts on runoff this spring.

Where cloud seeding occurs

Few ski areas seed clouds in Utah Cammans said and the state’s efforts are primarily designed to maximize runoff that supplies agriculture and municipal water reserves.

“During normal conditions we’re trying to seed areas at really high elevation — areas where the snow remains on the mountains well into the spring” Cammans said. That usually means trying to send the silver iodide into wind conditions that will result in snow above 9000 feet in elevation.

Cammans said his company does not seed in any heavily populated areas.

“Nobody’s shoveling more” he said “because we’re cloud seeding.”

(Courtesy of the Utah Division of Water Resources) A map of the active cloud seeding programs in Utah.

The cloud seeding particles quickly break down into silver and iodine once they’ve fallen to the ground he continued and both elements are generally considered to be environmentally safe. A 2013 paper from the Utah Department of Health noted that silver concentrations in the environment exceed naturally occurring background levels in areas that have cloud seeding programs but silver levels in water supplies remain well below recommended standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency across the state — despite decades of seeding.

Cammans compared the cloud seeding process to throwing salt on a sidewalk to melt ice. “That causes a phase change where the ice melts and turns into a liquid at a temperature where it should stay frozen” he said. “What we’re doing is the opposite. We use silver iodide to instigate a freezing process at a temperature where the water would normally stay liquid and aloft.”

The Utah Division of Water Resources Board approved $200000 in additional funding for the state’s cloud seeding program this winter and the program was expanded to the Book Cliffs near Emery County.

But even if there are significant expansions of cloud seeding efforts in the Upper Colorado River Basin under the drought contingency plan water managers like Mueller acknowledge that decreases in snowfall over the past 20 years and skyrocketing growth in the Colorado River Basin are issues that won’t be addressed by weather modification attempts alone.

A 2019 study from Utah State University’s Climate Center found that fewer than 55% of precipitating clouds were suitable for cloud seeding. And storm cycles could diminish due to climate change.

“It takes time and you have to have storms” Mueller said. “You can’t just all of a sudden start shooting [silver iodide] up into the clear blue sky and expect snow to fall.”

Analog Devices Stock Is Believed To Be Significantly Overvalued

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Analog Devices is 0.2% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 7.2% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Analog Devices's return on invested capital is 8.13 and its cost of capital is 8.96. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Analog Devices is shown below:

Large-scale transformation in the way healthcare is delivered was already underway before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 put new impetus into medical innovation. Prior to the 2020 pandemic aging populations in developed nations the near-universal availability of mobile broadband connectivity and the development of sophisticated sensing technologies were propelling the adoption of more personalized digital or remote methods of monitoring and diagnosing patients.

As the coronavirus pandemic increases pressure on limited hospital facilities medical service providers are accelerating the implementation of new technologies for testing and monitoring outside the hospital. Innovations in sensors now enable vital signs

to be measured with clinical-grade accuracy at home and specimens tested at the point of care eliminating the need to send samples for processing at a remote laboratory and producing quicker results for faster diagnosis.

This marks a break from the decades-old standard medical operating procedures. In the conventional model of medical treatment a patient visited the hospital when symptoms became apparent or for a routine annual checkup and was subjected to a one-time set

of tests that would often be sent away for laboratory analysis before diagnosis or a health assessment was made. In many cases this diagnosis would come long after the original consultation and based on this single snapshot of the patient’s condition.

This approach to treatment made sense when the sophisticated equipment required to monitor vital signs and symptoms was scarce and only available in hospitals or other dedicated medical facilities.

The development of new medical sensing technology has created conditions for a radically different conception of medical treatment. Instead of the large fixed medical monitoring equipment used in hospitals the new approach to patient monitoring uses

devices that:

 Are small or even wearable

 Consume little power so they can operate from a battery

 Provide accurate clinical-grade measurements

This enables medical monitoring and testing to be taken out of the hospital and performed in local facilities such as GP practices or in a patient’s home. For even greater convenience for the patient wearable devices such as patches can operate continuously and discreetly to enable 24/7 monitoring anywhere.

Better Diagnosis by Monitoring in Real Life

The motivation to implement new remote monitoring technologies is partly due to resource scarcity. The pressure on hospitals when COVID-19 infections peaked in 2020 proved that healthcare systems can quickly be overwhelmed by a rise in demand for acute care services. So it is a sensible long-term strategy to relocate patients who require monitoring of vital signs from a hospital bed to a clinic or to their own home.

But just as importantly monitoring with a portable or wearable device can provide more useful data and produce better patient outcomes. New medical monitoring technology allows for extended tracking of vital signs such as heart rate heart rate variability

blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature. Through continuous monitoring trends and patterns can be uncovered that cannot be detected in the single snapshot that a practitioner can capture in one appointment with a patient. The development in

parallel with artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic technology means that monitoring the stream of data can be automated.

Instead of swamping the patient’s physician with data this AI-based approach uses technology to monitor the patterns in vital signs in the background and only raise a flag when personal intervention by a doctor is required. By detecting precursor signals that

indicate future morbidity the patient and medical practitioner can work together on changes to medication lifestyle or diet to prevent the onset of conditions that previously would have ended up in a visit to a hospital’s acute care ward.

In addition monitoring at home or at a point-of-care facility reveals information about the state of the patient’s health in real life not in the artificial and often stressful setting of a hospital ward. The latest multiparameter wearable sensors can combine vital signs

with measurement of other indicators such as motion and sleep to put the medical data in the context of the patient’s lifestyle.

New Breakthroughs in the Application of Semiconductor Technology

The introduction of this new model of patient monitoring is the result of a series of developments in semiconductor technology and computer science in the 21 st century.

In the field of optoelectronics optical sensor solutions have been developed that can perform photoplethysmography ( PPG) which leverages noninvasive optical methods to calculate the heart rate respiration rate and SpO2. Miniature MEMS motion sensors

likewise can measure patient activity such as exercise sessions and sleep quality to put vital signs in context.

In hospitals much of the equipment used for monitoring vital signs are bulky and power-hungry. By implementing this measurement capability at chip-scale semiconductor manufacturers such as Analog Devices make it possible to create products such as medical

patches applied to the skin that can operate on battery power for days or weeks while transmitting measurements wirelessly to a host device such as a smartphone. Via this host the measurements can be uploaded securely to a cloud diagnostics service that can turn a stream of raw electrical signals into medically actionable data.

Technology Expertise Meets Application Know-How

It’s one thing to be able to describe the functional requirements of the semiconductor and computing systems that enable patients to wear a smartwatch or a patch for monitoring their vital signs. It is quite another to implement solutions using these technologies

in an actual product.

At Analog Devices we recognize that our service to healthcare technology innovators might start with semiconductor technology but it cannot end there. That’s why we support customers with a combination of technical experts and domain specialists in the

medical market.

It is the job of the medical domain experts to understand intimately the application requirements and key attributes such as regulation and data privacy that characterize the market. Customers developing complex medical products can innovate faster

with more freedom and greater confidence of a successful outcome when they are supported by experts who understand not only their technology but also their application.

In the field of vital signs monitoring this application expertise is backed by development platforms. The vital signs monitoring (VSM) study watch for instance is a multiparameter open development platform. Featuring a suite of sensors in a convenient wearable form factor it provides a continuous set of vital signs measurements for use in the development of biomedical algorithms.

The VSM study watch implements PPG and ECG to measure heart rate and heart rate variability. Its MEMS accelerometer performs step counting and is used to improve and inform algorithms sensitive to motion artifacts. Sensors on the watch measure temperature and impedance values used in algorithms to monitor stress and body composition. These capabilities support research carried out by medical and academic institutions to evaluate new use cases for remote patient monitoring.

The rewards of moving patient monitoring out of the hospital are clear. Drawing on precise low-power miniature components such as sensors analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors the robust VSM watch from Analog Devices and other such development platforms lay the groundwork on which innovative medical device manufacturers can build the monitoring devices of tomorrow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc2luZm90ZWNoLmNvbS9lbnRyeS1vZi12ci1hbmQtYXItaW4tdGhlLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1zZWN0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Entry of VR and AR in the Education Sector,"The electronic Learning or eLearning field has been a growing market since last few years but it got the needed push in the right direction and became a student’s first choice of learning during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.

With people forced to remain inside their homes educational technology (EdTech) thrived in the education sector showing its potential and future scope in the real world.

With this in mind let’s talk about the scope of Virtual and Augmented Reality in eLearning and other fields.

Virtual Reality Vs Augmented Reality

Virtual Reality or VR is typically defined as an immersive experience to an alternate world or reality simulated by a computer system that shut-down the physical world. Generally used in the gaming and entertainment field.

On the other hand Augmented Reality or AR simply adds some digital elements to the real world to create an artificial environment using a camera or smartphone. The best example of AR would be the Pokemon Go App that is widely famous all around the world.

Need of AR and VR in eLearning

The existing school system centers around conceptual knowledge of a topic while depicting ideal scenarios and situations to explain it which sometimes is a far cry from the practical world in some cases. And this led to rote learning that eventually does not benefit the student at all in the long race.

Some subjects are also extremely difficult to explain in a classroom or visualize through simple textbook photos or statements e.g. molecular structures anatomical concepts space phenomena or complex abstract topics. Due to which students fail to understand and remember how they might look and function.

This is where VR and AR technology comes to play their part. These technologies focus on active learning allowing students to interact with content and practice in real-time conditions.

And this leads to better understanding enhanced knowledge recall strengthened retention stimulated learners’ motivation and increased student engagement level. One lesson in the virtual world can be considered to successfully replace dozens of standard ones.

What is VR/AR Assisted Learning?

Generally people are more comfortable seeing a movie rather than reading its respective book. It’s the same with students. Modern students often face difficulty in understanding a new concept using traditional textbooks blackboards and paper handouts. They get easily distracted by their surroundings and often most of them spent more time on their mobile phone compared to their school textbooks.

To overcome this shortcoming immersive technology has been getting the needed push from the education sector. Immersive technologies allow learners to experience virtual scenarios that would not be possible otherwise and take action instead of merely observing things.

For example instead of reading about boring facts and photos of foreign countries students can see their topography and images using the Google Expeditions mobile app and a mobile headset.

With VR/AR technology’s advent in the coming years educators have started to integrate it into their normal teaching routines. Educators are also using AR apps to help their students to get a better understanding of the topic by animating science textbooks and topic related flashcards to make the experience more enjoyable for the student. Educators are also using AR tools to enhance homework by creating interactive puzzles and quizzes for their students.

Another novel way in which teachers have started to use AR in education is through AR Lab classes which allow students to interact with 3D models of humans animals and plants.

Merits of AR/VR in the Education Sector:

The use of AR/ VR in the education sector will create a new era of learning once it goes mainstream. It will change the way educational content is delivered. VR and AR can help solve the biggest problems of learning through their innovative teaching methods and interactive use.

Though we have already discussed many benefits of AR and VR above let’s take a quick look at some of the main merits of these technologies in the education sector:

Better Student Engagement: Thanks to the use of interactive 3D models VR and AR software can gamify the learning experience leading to better engagement from the students.

Some of the top companies working in this sector include:

Nearpod: Offers several educational solutions for K-12 such as pre-made lessons that can sync to student devices and many more.

Merge: Offers innovative experiences for the classroom for example a Merge Cube a hologram that displays objects such as the human heart an aquarium or the solar system and allows interaction with them.

zSpace: Widely popular in the US the company offers a unique all-in-one AR/VR laptop with content that can be manipulated with a stylus pen.

EON Reality: Offers an AVR Platform called EON-XR a comprehensive AR/VR teaching and learning application that simplifies lesson creation and allow anyone without coding knowledge to use AR and VR for learning.",,,

Wakatere Boating Club looks out onto the Hauraki Gulf © Wakatere Boating Club Wakatere Boating Club looks out onto the Hauraki Gulf © Wakatere Boating Club

by Yachting NZ 28 Mar 2021 19:34 PDT

Most good ideas are adaptations of other good ideas and the Wakatere Boating Club have taken an Emirates Team New Zealand mantra and applied it to how they run their club.

It's an approach that has served the club well in recent times. Not only is membership sitting at a healthy figure of about 400 but there's a clear strategy good synergy between the junior and senior fleets plenty of options for all types of sailors and a good atmosphere around the club.

""You hear the Team New Zealand mantra of 'does it make the boat go faster?' Wakatere commodore Ed Crook explains. ""A lot of what we are thinking about gets assessed against is this going to increase the number of people on the water and participating in our sport? If we can answer that with a yes then we will try to make it happen.""

Wakatere is probably one of the most active dinghy clubs in the country regularly hosting events both on and off the water - they will even host next month's Oceanbridge NZL Sailing Regatta. Their sailors have also achieved tremendous success over the years but this is not their principal aim.

""It’s very much a family-focused club to support participation in dinghy sailing"" Crook says. ""We don’t see ourselves as a club who sets out to focus our resources and time on the elite sailors. We think they will get there anyway. Rather we want to provide a place where everyone can come and enjoy dinghy sailing.""

This is borne out in their membership figures and family memberships make up 56 percent of their overall total. Head coach Lydia Grasberger has been instrumental in establishing a programme which has delivered a great pathway for those who are new to the sport and the senior classes enjoy strong growth through the 3.7 OK Dinghy and Sunburst fleets.

""We are really lucky to have the calibre of sailors who are active in the club whether as sailors themselves or as parents to junior sailors"" Crook says.

One of the club's recent learn to sail initiatives is the waka compass programme which is designed for beginners of all ages to introduce them to sailing. They run Waka Confidence (8-11 years) Waka Adventure (12-17 years) and Waka Adults and it has proved an overwhelmingly-popular approach.

Their adventure sailing component which is principally done in RS Fevas as well as windfoilers and powerboats to introduce participants to other types of craft is over-subscribed and proves that not everyone wants to go dinghy racing.

""We have a marketing team who work closely with our head coach to make sure what we are doing has a broad-based appeal and is understood by people who might not have a sailing background"" Crook says. ""We wanted to make sure there was a fun component to it and we weren’t losing the plot through focusing only on racing coaching and elite sailing.""

A big growth area of late has been in windsurfing and windfoiling. This has been led by long-standing club members Gary Hill and Ian Young who initiated a resurgence in the sport a few years ago and meant they were well placed when windfoiling came along.

Windfoilers now make up about 20 percent of the total fleet for club racing on Sundays although they have a later start time to minimise the overlap on the race course and help ensure everyone can enjoy good quality racing safely.

It means Wakatere are now regarded as the country's leading club for windfoilers and Yachting New Zealand's project development squad also base themselves there a lot of the time.

""We were really keen to see it grow because we could see it provided a pathway for youth sailors who weren’t overly rapt with the idea of the more conventional pathway and wanted something that was a bit more exciting and colourful"" Crook says. ""It was an easy thing to get in behind and support.""

It was a similar story when it came to the club's environmental and sustainability efforts and it could be argued they have set the standard for yachting and boating clubs in this country.

This was highlighted by their efforts during the 2019 OK Dinghy world championships when the club achieved gold status under the Sailors for the Sea clean seas regatta programme and they've since achieved platinum status for last year's RS Feva national championships.

""The credit for that sits with Delayne Salthouse who approached the club and said 'hey you need to do a better job on sustainability' and we said 'you’re right'"" Crook says. ""She came in with a huge amount of energy and made things happen.""

Of course not every club has so many willing volunteers but equally clubs need to create an environment in which fresh thinking is welcomed and then acted on. This encourages others to get involved and should help create a more vibrant culture.

""If I sit back and reflect now a lot of what we have done is had really good people who have put their hand up to do something and we’ve gone 'yep sounds great'"" Crook says.

The Aon Uni 7s kicked off today showcasing the talents of women’s sevens across the country.

In its fourth year as the premiere sevens competition in Australia a new format has been introduced that splits the competition between New South Wales and Queensland. This weekend’s regional rounds are being played concurrently at Woollahra Oval in Sydney and Easts Rugby Club in Brisbane.

With the Australian Women’s Sevens players not joining the competition until round 2 a number of players pushed their case for selection into the wider training squad with some new stars emerging during a dazzling display of rugby. The big upset of the day was Newcastle University beating University of Sydney while University of Queensland and UTS looked strong in their respective pools.

Here is how the action unfolded:

Round 1 Brisbane

09:00 UQ V Melbourne

UQ came out with high energy for the first game of the day and Renae Nona showed great hands to put away Giverny Robinson for the score in the first two 2 minutes after a quick tap exposed holes in Melbourne Uni’s defence.

Melbourne hit back with veteran Mel Kawa offloading the ball to Halley Derera who won the foot race down the left hand touchline.

Robinson scored in the corner for UQ followed by a try to Nona through the middle on halftime.

Wallaroos scrum-half Georgia Cormick sparked Melbourne into action providing great service to Derera to beat her opponent on the outside for a 45-metre try.

Caitlin Urwin put the game away with a late try as UQ’s expansive play proved the difference.

FT 26-12

09:20 Griffith V Adelaide

Two evenly matched teams went head-to-head for the second game and Adelaide Uni started strong with two quick tries to Alice Gregory and Lauren Potter before a turnover from Kiri Lingman inspired a Terri-Anne Egan hit back for Griffith Uni.

The Romas went off the boil after halftime and Griffith seemed rejuvenated leading to a great offload by Kahli Henwood setting up a Georgina Friedrichs score followed by another try from Egan.

Griffith shut out the game with aggressive defence Henwood and Ivana Lolesio combined for some scores to put the result beyond doubt.

FT 26-12

2021 Aon Uni 7s - Round 1 Day 1

Round 1 Sydney

11.07 University of Sydney V UTS

For the first game in Sydney UTS Captain Mahalia Murphy led-out a team brimming with talent to take on an impressive University of Sydney side.

UTS were first on the board as Tiarne Cavanagh beat Piper Duck to score after capitalising on a turnover but the lionesses hit back immediately after a burst from Wallaroo Grace Hamilton set up a try in the corner.

Mia Wood showed some electric pace to finish a tough fought try after pinning Sydney Uni in their 22 but they hit back with a try from Margot Vella.

Off the kick restart Murphy set up Betty Koula for a UTS try and Margot Vella once again pulled it back for Sydney Uni to even-up the game in the final minute. Murphy was strong all day with good carries and vision setting up a number of opportunities for UTS.

FT 15-15

11.30 Newcastle V Canberra

The seahorses came out firing early showing moments of incredible skill. Exciting prospect Jess Southwell put in a full length grubber and got an incredible offload away to set-up Kaitlan Leaney.

The “Leeton Express” Tess Staines hit back off the kickoff to go the full length to score with a sideline conversion from Ella Ryan.

Southwell then set herself up for a try with grubber and recover displaying great vision. Canberra blew a potential length-of-the-field try after Lily Mason-Spice couldn't get the ball away to her support just before half time.

Young talent Trudi Peterson came off the bench for Necastle to close out the game with a well-worked try. It was an entertaining matchup with Newcastle proving the surprise packet with young Southwell carving up all game.

Round 2 Brisbane

11.20 Griffith V Melbourne

Melbourne got on the scoreboard first through a try to Halley Derera showing incredible pace down the sideline but Griffith hit back with a Georgia Friedrichs try just before the half.

A double for Tiana Raftstrand-Smith in quick succession allowed the Griffith team to wrap-up that game finishing strong in a scrappy match.

Friedrichs was the difference with her leadership around the park and heads-up play with the travel factor starting to show early for the Melbourne side.

FT 19-7

11.40 UQ V Bond

The rivalry on the 7s field between UQ and Bond continued and there was plenty of feeling in the opening moments of the match before Georgia Sims exposed UQ’s slow defence to score the opening try.

UQ‘s Renae Nona crashed over following patient play and some good touches from Nat Wright. Steph Rutherford ran onto a clever pop ball and used her footwork and speed to streak away for a Bond try.

The highlight of the game was a massive hit from UQ that forced a turnover setting up a fantastic score for Sidney Taylor right on halftime that drew the scores level.

UQ pulled away after half time with tries to Caitlin Urwin and Mackenzie Sadler until Rutherford got her second try of the game for Bond. The game was decided moments later by Amber Kimmel sealing the game for UQ.

FT 33-19

Round 2 Sydney

13.20 University of Sydney v Canberra

Syd Uni were too strong for Canberra from the get-go shaking off the cobwebs of their first round match and putting in clinical performance. Claudia Nielsen showed a fast pair of heels to slice up the Canberra defence for the opening try and quickly backed it up with a double from a crisp pass by Wallaroos fullback Lori Cramer.

From there Sydney Uni heaped the pressure on Canberra. Ella Ryan and Lily Mason-Spice created a few opportunities but fatigue set in towards the end of the game. A late try to Tessa Staines was not enough for Canberra.

FT 19-7

13.45 UTS V Newcastle

Off a stolen lineout Maya Stewart carved up the defence to get an early score for UTS. They followed it up by pinning Newcastle in their own 22 and forcing a turnover going in near the posts.

Captain Murphy put Tatum Bird away down the sideline for a try and Skye Churchill diced up Newcastle with some sharp stepping.

Newcastle were able to pressure the UTS defence leading to a wayward kick which was quickly returned as Southwell showed skill to score in the corner.

A try to Betty Koula negated a comeback from Newcastle as a Maddie McArthur pop-ball allowed Courtney Currie to beat a defender and score. To close the gap Southwell finished with another try cementing her as a rising star of the tournament.

FT 31-19

Round 3 Brisbane

13.40 Bond V Griffiths

Alice Gregory returned serve for Adelaide putting on a goose-step and using her exceptional pace to burn the opposition on the outside.

From there Bond ran away with the game with Costello getting her second score and Georgia Sim Ellie Draper and Teagan Levi all crossing over.

Fatigue played a part as the Romas weren’t able to match Bond for pace and execution.

FT 29-5

14.20 UQ V Griffith

The two most impressive teams clashed for the final game of the day. It was an arm-wrestle in the first half before Griffith’s Goergina Friedrichs broke through for the first try.

UQ quickly countered through thanks to a double from Kaitlin Shave. Friedrichs got a double of her own after halftime.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Late last year Cupertino tech giant Apple Inc made an oft-rumored big shift for its MacBook notebook lineup when it introduced a custom in-house designed system-on-chip (SoC) for the lineup. Dubbed as the Apple M1 this chip is fabricated on the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 5nm semiconductor node - one of the most advanced chipmaking techniques in the world.

Yet even though the M1 and potential successors aim to power Apple's desktop and notebook computers taking a high-level look at the chip's design and comparing it to what Tesla Inc's HW 3.0 computer offers the aforementioned use cases might not be the only ones that Apple has in mind for them - or might end up using them for.

Apple's M1 SoC Lays Down Foundation To Bring Edge Computing For Autonomous Driving

To start off it's worthwhile to take a look at what HW 3.0 is made of first. Tesla's computer which features roughly six billion transistors per chip and was launched in 2019 is built on Samsung Electronics' 14nm manufacturing process. The HW 3.0 is responsible for running software updated to a vehicle from Tesla in order to locally (on the vehicle) determine the state of the world around it.

The HW 3.0 is capable of roughly 74 million Tera-Ops/second (TOPS)/chip a term that is used to determine the computing capacity of a neural engine. The data which a neural engine computes is different from what a central processing unit (CPU) computes and is related primarily to determining the state of the world outside a Tesla. Tesla's car computer all

o features one GPU/chip for a total of two GPUs for the entire system giving it 1.2 TFLOPS of output for the system and 600 GFLOPS for each chip. It also operates in a lock-step redundancy mode which results in both chips computing the data at the same time and verifying each other's calculations as well all the while acting as a backup in case one of them fails.

A larger area of each chip's die is dedicated to its GPU and NPU as opposed to the CPU which is self-explanatory due to its use-case. Apple's M1 chip on the other hand has a larger area dedicated to the CPU and GPU - which is once again understandable since the main purpose of the chip is to power notebooks instead of an autonomous driving system.

The block diagram of Apple's M1 labeled by the good folks over at Anandtech shows a larger area dedicated to the GPU and CPU instead of the Neural Processing Engine (NPU).

Tesla's HW 3.0 Leads The M1 For Neural Processing Due To Being Tailored To A Specific Use-Case

This octa-core powerhouse of a GPU on the M1 allows it to breeze past the HW 3.0 when comes to performance. The GPU performance of an Apple M1 is nearly double of Tesla's hardware as it is capable of a peak output of 2.6 TFLOPs (Trillion Floating Point Operations-Per-Second). What this means is that when Apple wants it can design its hardware to exceed other options in the market - in an endeavor that is aided by TSMC's 5nm process which has higher in performance and power efficiency terms over the older 14nm node. The process node advantage also allows Apple to squeeze in a remarkable 16 billion transistors in a 119mm² chip for more than 3x the transistors than a chip double its size (260mm² area for the HW 3.0).

For a chip-to-chip comparison let's put the specifications of both the chips into a table for easy reference:

M1: HW 3.0 Single Chip: CPU: 8 Cores (4x4 big.LITTLE). Max clock: 3.2GHz 12 Cortex A72 cores. Max clock: 2.2GHz GPU: 8 Cores for 2.6 TFLOPs Single GPU for 600 GFLOPs NPU: 16 Cores for 11 TOPs Two 2GHz cores for ~72 TOPs Transistors: 16 billion 6 billion Manufacturing Process: TSMC 5nm Samsung 14nm

What this rudimentary comparison reveals is that Apple's Mx design has the complete potential to take on Tesla when it comes to an autonomous driving computer. Tesla's HW 3.0 also uses a lower bit-width processing model through which it sacrifices the quality of data input to target more variables - whereas Apple's M1 has higher bit widths due to its use-case.

Summing it all up through the M1 Apple has successfully created a platform that it can tweak for a future autonomous driving chip. By reducing the bit-widths and removing elements such as the CPU and GPU in favor of the NPU the company can potentially create a platform that mirrors Tesla's HW 3.0 chip in terms of neural computing power.

A die shot of the single Tesla HW 3.0 computer chip. The two NPU cores have been circled in red by Wccftech.

Even If It Makes A Better Chip Than Tesla Apple Will Still Be Disadvantaged

It can then introduce this platform into the oft-rumored Project Titan (also dubbed as the Apple Car) or it can even sell this platform to other automakers. Apple's development of an off-the-shelf autonomous driving platform has also been in the rumor mill for quite some time but such a move also contrasts with the company's culture of developing exclusive products within a closed-gate ecosystem.

Finally even if Apple were to outdo Tesla and design a chip superior to the HW 3.0 it will still be unable to match the automaker's greatest advantage in the arena. This advantage is the billions of miles of data that Tesla has access to which allows the company to train its artificial intelligence networks. In the world of AI training is king and for training having access to copious amounts of data is the single biggest advantage for any company.

At this front Tesla's in the lead and with the company's planned Dojo supercomputing platform it hopes to significantly reduce the time needed to churn out new models. Additionally Tesla is rumored to be working with TSMC and Samsung both for its HW 4.0 computer. The TSMC rumor suggests that the company is looking into the 7nm process node for this chip likely due to no capacity available for the advanced 5nm node. The Samsung rumor believes that the next vehicle chip from Tesla will be built on the 5nm process node with it being possible that Tesla is considering both options open as the 5nm node entices it due to improved performance while the 7nm offering performance and shipment reliability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI1ODQ4OC8yMDIxMDMyOC9hcHBsZS1zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLTFzdC1nZW4taXBhZC1wcm90b3R5cGUtbXVsdGlwbGUtY2hhcmdpbmctc2xvdHMtZHVhbC1kb2NrLWRlc2lnbi1sZWFrLmh0bdIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNTg0ODgvMjAyMTAzMjgvYXBwbGUtc3RldmUtam9icy0xc3QtZ2VuLWlwYWQtcHJvdG90eXBlLW11bHRpcGxlLWNoYXJnaW5nLXNsb3RzLWR1YWwtZG9jay1kZXNpZ24tbGVhay5odG0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple: Steve Jobs' 1st-Gen iPad Prototype Has Multiple Charging Slots 'Dual Dock' Design But Now It's Missing,"An Apple first-generation iPad prototype was recently leaked on social media showing that it has two charging slots on its body to sync with its USB or charge from any of the two sides of the tablet said on Sunday March 28. Ultimately the prototype was trashed and the 1st-gen iPad known to the public has released with only one slot near its home button.

1st-gen iPad Prototype: Multiple Charging Ports

The first generation iPad was released by the company in 2010 but the public release only featured a single-docked tablet from Apple with the public having no knowledge of the tablet's dual dock version until now. Giulio Zompetti a leaker showcased the prototype photos via Twitter (@@1nsane_dev) showing an actual version of the tablet.

Twitter Error

Here Zompetti featured multi-angle shots of the iPad that has two docks on its body which is different from what the public has known and got acquainted with from Apple's lineup of the tablet. Currently the iPad is 11 years in production having four versions on its lineup with the iPad Classic iPad Air iPad Mini and the iPad Pro.

According to Zompetti the design never made it to Apple's DVT (design validation test) and was ultimately scrapped even before it undergone production from the Cupertino giant's factories. Initial prototypes of the dual-port iPad classic have surfaced before and it was auctioned via eBay as several design leaks were released.

iPad Has And Always Will Be Single-Docked

The iPad is a mainstay among Apple's list of devices since it was introduced in 2010 with the company showing no signs of discontinuing the tablet as it is one of its classic designs in their stores. Moreover its design featured a single-dock platform that only has its charging and sync port in one slot instead of the leaked prototype.

Currently there is no way of knowing whether Apple would be bashed or praised with their dual dock design especially if whether these features could support both charging and synching at both the docks. The computer synchronization to iTunes would already charge the tablet as it is connected but would only feature a slow rate of charge.

The initial iterations of the iPad Classic have always been single-docked and are with the first charging method of Apple featuring the 30-pin and wide bored setup that was used until the iPad 3rd generation. The 30-pin was known for only allowing one side to connect on the tablet without the capabilities of a ""flip flop"" entry like the Lightning cable.

In fact the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 61.9%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.

Apple’s Big Run: One company that has been a good investment in the last year has been iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Apple recently unveiled its family of iPhone 12 models which are the first to be compatible with 5G mobile networks.

Analysts are expecting 5G iPhones to trigger yet another massive global upgrade cycle among existing iPhone users.

When iPhone sales growth began to slow in recent years Apple made a massive pivot to a recurring services model a transition that is ongoing to this day.

As of the fiscal first quarter of 2021 Apple said it now has a massive installed user base of more than 1.65 billion active devices. Apple’s Services segment is all about further monetizing that user base and services revenue generates an impressive gross profit margin of about 68%.

Fortunately for Apple investors the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 didn’t negatively impact its business much at all.

In fact the iPhone 12 helped generate 5.5% revenue growth for Apple in fiscal 2020. Net profit was also up 3.9% to $57.4 billion on the year.

At the beginning of 2020 Apple shares were trading at around $296. By the beginning of March the stock was down to $282 after news of the coronavirus spreading in China prompting concerns about a U.S. pandemic.

Apple ultimately bottomed at $212.61 during the pandemic-driven March sell-off. Fortunately for Apple investors the dip did not last long.

By June Apple shares were back at new all-time highs above $330 and was as high as $514.14 in August prior to a four-to-one stock split.

Apple In 2021 Beyond: The stock eventually made it back up to new split-adjusted highs of $145.09 in January 2021.

In recent days the stock has pulled back from its highs settling back down to $120.

Still Apple investors who bought one year ago and held on have generated a big return on their investment. In fact $1000 in Apple stock bought on March 26 2020 would be worth about $1968 today assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead analysts are expecting even more upside for Apple in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 37 analysts covering the stock is $155 suggesting a 28.5% upside from current levels.

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February.

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9pcGhvbmUtNi12cy1pcGhvbmUtNi1wbHVzLTE5OTk1NzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Differences Between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,"It's easy to see how the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are different: The iPhone 6 Plus has a larger screen and is bigger overall.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Il marqua les mémoires par plusieurs dizaines d’incendies de maisons et de bâtiments agricoles entre janvier et mars.

L'hiver rouge qui marqua les mémoires

À la fin du XIX e siècle la plupart des maisons creusoises étaient couvertes en chaume matériau assurant une bonne protection contre le froid et la pluie mais facilitant la propagation du feu. Et l'hiver 1891 fut une saison de flammes.

Ces incendies entraînèrent d'importants dommages matériels. Il n'existait pas dans nos campagnes de compagnies de sapeurs-pompiers.

Pas de pompiers à l'époque pour éteindre le feu

La communauté villageoise se mobilisait donc faisant la chaîne entre la mare ou le ruisseau le plus proche s'il y en avait avec des seaux. On essayait aussi d'évacuer les meubles les animaux les outils agricoles les récoltes avant l'embrasement des bâtiments. Le journal « L'Abeille de la Creuse » relatait ainsi ces incendies :

Samedi 3 mars 1891 : « Dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi un grand et violent incendie a éclaté au village du Compeix commune de Saint-Pierre-le-Bost au préjudice de […] Maume Denis propriétaire ; Claverolas jacques négociant ; Piatte Eugène cultivateur ; Lamoureux cultivateur ; Lerousseau Joseph cultivateur ; Jaucent Jean marchand de lingerie ; Lebel Jean maçon ; Charles Marie ménagère ».

Les pertes comprennent : un corps de bâtiment composé de cinq maisons d'habitation et de deux écuries surmontées d'un grenier ; une grange contenant 56 kg de fourrages […] ; un autre corps de bâtiment composé d'une maison d'habitation. Les pertes sont estimées à 25.000 francs.

Le feu a été aperçu d'abord à la toiture de la maison Maume et s'est rapidement propagé aux autres maisons toutes couvertes en chaume. Les sinistrés disent qu'ils étaient tous couchés au moment où le feu a été vu à l'exception de Jaucent qui arrivait de Bourganeuf. Tout le mobilier a été détruit et les habitants des maisons incendiées se sont sauvés sans avoir pu s'habiller complètement. Il n'y a pas eu d'accident de personne. Tous les propriétaires sont assurés à diverses compagnies ».

Mercredi 7 mars 1891 : « Le télégraphe nous annonce un grand et violent incendie dans un village de la commune de Faux-la-Montagne. Les détails sont très restreints ; nous pouvons dire seulement qu'un corps de bâtiment d'une longueur de 100 mètres a été la proie des flammes ; de plus une femme a été grièvement brûlée. Les pertes seraient estimées à 32.000 francs au préjudice du sieur Thezillat propriétaire. Une assurance répond des pertes ».

Mardi 13 mars 1891 : « Le 7 mars à 10 heures du soir un incendie s'est déclaré au bourg de Châtelus-le-Marcheix dans les sous-sols de la maison d'habitation du sieur François Jacquemin menuisier et aubergiste […]. La gendarmerie et presque tous les habitants de la localité sont accourus sur les lieux mais déjà l'accès aux appartements situés au-dessus de la remise où avait pris le feu était devenu impossible ; on a donc été réduit à circonscrire el feu et à protéger les immeubles les plus rapprochés. Puis le gendarme Comby secondé par son collègue Fougeras qui bien que malade avait voulu aider dans la mesure de ses forces a pénétré dans une mansarde située au-dessus de l'atelier contigu à la maison d'habitation où le feu venait de pénétrer. Malgré la fumée suffocante qui avait envahi la pièce il est parvenu par un travail persévérant et non sans danger pour sa vie à éteindre la partie embrasée et à arrêter les progrès du feu qui menaçait de détruire les deux mansardes et l'atelier attenant. Toutes les personnes témoins de cet acte de dévouement ont été unanimes à louer le courage de ce brave militaire. Les dégâts évalués à 10.000 francs sont couverts par une assurance ».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljb2Z0b2dvLmNvbS90b3V0ZXMtbGVzLXJ1YnJpcXVlcy9wb2xpdGlxdWUvaWwtbmUtcGV1dC15LWF2b2lyLWRlLXZvaXgtZGlzY29yZGFudGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Il ne peut y avoir de voix discordantes',"Des hommes politiques se servent de la pandémie pour se faire de la pub.

Au cœur d’une polémique depuis quelque temps les réunions non-mixtes ont été évoquées par Audrey Pulvar interrogée à ce sujet notamment par BFMtv ce samedi 27 mars. La candidate francilienne est donc revenue sur la polémique autour des réunions non-mixtes raciales.

Audrey Pulvar a expliqué qu’en soi le fait ""que des personnes discriminées pour les mêmes raisons et de la même façon sentent la nécessité de devoir se réunir entre elles pour pouvoir en discuter ça ne me choque pas profondément selon la façon dont les choses sont formulées"".

Une polémique déclenchée à l'origine par l'Unef C'est depuis une interview de Mélanie Luce présidente de l'Unef que la polémique sur les groupes non-mixtes enfle. Elle expliquait que des réunions seulement entre femmes ou entre personnes touchées par le racismes pouvaient favoriser l'émergence de leur parole. ""Aujourd'hui quand on est une femme on subit des discriminations donc on organise des réunions pour permettre aux femmes d'exprimer les discriminations qu'elles peuvent subir. On organise aussi des réunions pour permettre aux personnes qui sont effectivement touchées par le racisme de pouvoir exprimer ce qu'elles subissent"" avait justifié Mélanie Luce sur Europe 1.

Plutôt ""réservées à"" qu'""interdites à""

Elle a ensuite expliqué que la notion d’interdiction la dérangeait toutefois et qu’elle préférait des réunions ""réservées à"" plutôt ""qu’interdites à"".

Et de renchérir sur le fait que dans l’éventualité ou une personne blanche voudrait venir à ces réunions ""j’aurais tendance à dire qu’il n’est pas question de le ou la jeter dehors en revanche on peut lui demander de se taire on peut lui demander d’être spectatrice ou spectateur silencieux"" a ajouté Audrey Pulvar.

Tollé au sein de la classe politique

En tenant ces propos elle s’est attiré les foudres de la droite et de l’extrême droite dont les personnalités politiques telles que Marine Le Pen Éric Ciotti ou encore Rachida Dati ont vivement réagi sur les réseaux sociaux.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon est l’une des rares personnalités politique à avoir démontré son soutien à Audrey Pulvar qu’il taxe plutôt de maladresse : ""Audrey Pulvar n’est pas raciste ! Elle a juste compris ce qu’est un groupe de parole. Ceux qui se jettent sur elle par contre n’arrivent pas à cacher leur pente sexiste et discriminante. Le débat public s’effondre. Le PS va-t-il défendre sa candidate en Île-de-France ?"" a-t-il tweeté.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZm10di5jb20vcGVvcGxlL3NldGgtcm9nZW4tcmV2ZWxlLXBvdXJxdW9pLWVtbWEtd2F0c29uLWEtcXVpdHRlLWRlLWZhY29uLWFicnVwdGUtbGUtdG91cm5hZ2UtZC11bi1kZS1zZXMtZmlsbXNfQU4tMjAyMTAzMjgwMTIzLmh0bWzSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmZtdHYuY29tL2FtcC9wZW9wbGUvc2V0aC1yb2dlbi1yZXZlbGUtcG91cnF1b2ktZW1tYS13YXRzb24tYS1xdWl0dGUtZGUtZmFjb24tYWJydXB0ZS1sZS10b3VybmFnZS1kLXVuLWRlLXNlcy1maWxtc19BTi0yMDIxMDMyODAxMjMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seth Rogen révèle pourquoi Emma Watson a quitté de façon abrupte le tournage d'un de ses films,"L'acteur et réalisateur se souvient du jour où la comédienne a refusé de tourner une scène pour les besoins de son film C'est la fin où elle joue son propre rôle.

POLITIQUE - Même face à l’extrême droite la gauche parvient à se diviser. Ils étaient pourtant nombreux dans l’ensemble de la classe politique à dénoncer l’intrusion jeudi 25 mars du conseil régional d’Occitanie par des militants de l’Action française aux pancartes sans équivoque “islamo-gauchistes traîtres à la France”.

La présidente de la région Carole Delga a immédiatement condamné “fermement” cette opération militante et a annoncé porter plainte le jour même en assurant que “face à l’extrême droite je ne lâcherai rien et ne céderai à aucune pression”.

On aurait pu s’arrêter là mais la dirigeante socialiste a ajouté un autre message le lendemain sur Twitter qui est loin d’avoir convaincu les autres partis de gauche. “Il faut cesser de monter les gens les uns contre les autres au risque de générer une société d’ennemis. Racisme antisémitisme et discriminations ne reculeront qu’en rassemblant d’abord les Français sur les droits et valeurs de la République. L’Unef gagnerait à suivre ce chemin” a tweeté Carole Delga le 26 mars.

C’est cette dernière phrase qui a mis le feu aux poudres alors que le syndicat étudiant est mis en cause depuis plusieurs semaines notamment à cause des réunions non mixtes qu’il organise pour évoquer les problématiques liées au racisme ou aux discriminations.

L’eurodéputé EELV David Cormand a immédiatement réagi au message de Carole Delga: “On ne peut pas mettre un signe égal entre les racistes et leur victime” oppose l’ex-dirigeant du parti. “Ce n’est pas l’Unef qui est responsable de l’attaque fasciste de votre conseil régional. Ce ne sont pas les militants antiracistes qui sont responsables des discriminations subies” déclare-t-il.

Carole Delga a réagi à ces propos dans l’Obs ce samedi 27 mars. “C’est délirant il perd complètement ses nerfs. Qu’un candidat à la présidence de la République puisse écrire des choses pareilles montre qu’il sort du cadre républicain! Il s’enfonce dans une violence verbale et dangereuse” a-t-elle déploré.

Au cours de cet entretien la présidente de la région Occitanie acte également la théorie des “gauches irréconciliables” chère à Manuel Valls: “Pour moi les choses sont claires la gauche réformiste et écologiste ne comprend pas Jean-Luc Mélenchon et ses proches” cingle-t-elle alors qu’un accord d’union de la gauche a été trouvé entre toutes ses composantes dans les Hauts-de-France en vue des régionales de juin.

“Ça se passe de commentaire” a de son côté réagi Olivier Faure premier secrétaire du PS en relayant les mots de Jean-Luc Mélenchon à l’égard de sa camarade du Sud.

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

This interview is ridiculous which you are doing right now” Noem said. “So you need to stop. It is OK. It is. Let’s talk about some real topics that Americans care about.”

“I’m afraid we’re out of time” Varney responded.

Noem has been on a media blitz for the past week promoting her new book “No Going Back” though the governor has been bombarded with questions surrounding her decision to kill her 14-month-old dog as detailed in the book. Noem has faced condemnation from both sides of the aisle after The Guardian reported that she writes in the book that she “hated” the “aggressive” dog who she says ruined a pheasant hunt and attacked her neighbor’s chickens.

When backlash to the story first surfaced Noem openly talked about and defended her decision to kill her dog saying that “South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down” and that she “chose the safety” of her children. Now it seems Noem has grown tired of defending her decision and claims that people are upset because “the fake news” twisted her story.

“Listen going through hard things and I’ve been through a few of them — I’m going through one right now I mean they’re just attacking me like crazy right now” Noem said Saturday during her speech at a Republican donor retreat hosted by Trump in Palm Beach Florida according to audio obtained by POLITICO.

The fallout of the dog story reached the local level last week when a Colorado county Republican group canceled a Saturday fundraiser that Noem was set to headline after the group received death threats over her previously scheduled appearance. The group and the governor’s office “mutually decided” that the safety risk was too great and canceled the event.

Noem has also faced backlash after the Dakota Scout reported on an anecdote in the book where Noem claims that she met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while serving in Congress. Noem said earlier this week that when she was made aware of the passage she asked that the book be corrected before its imminent release but has declined to say that she never met the North Korean leader.

“I took responsibility for it” Noem said in a Newsmax interview on Tuesday. “The buck stops with me. This anecdote I should not have put in the book and I asked to have it taken out and it is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1nbS1jYW50LWVudmlzaW9uLXNlbGxpbmctYXQtbWxiLXRyYWRlLWRlYWRsaW5lLWFtaWQtaG91c3RvbnMtc3RydWdnbGVzLWhvdy1jb3VsZC10ZWFyZG93bi13b3JrL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1nbS1jYW50LWVudmlzaW9uLXNlbGxpbmctYXQtbWxiLXRyYWRlLWRlYWRsaW5lLWFtaWQtaG91c3RvbnMtc3RydWdnbGVzLWhvdy1jb3VsZC10ZWFyZG93bi13b3JrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astros GM 'can't envision' selling at MLB trade deadline amid Houston's struggles: How could teardown work?,"The Houston Astros got stomped on Tuesday night 10-3 by the New York Yankees with future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander getting hammered for seven runs on eight hits in five innings.

Given how the 2024 season has gone for the Astros it wasn't entirely shocking. The loss dropped them to 12-23 good for last place in the AL West -- a division that includes a team that lost 112 games last season and one that lost Shohei Ohtani in the offseason (and Mike Trout during this season).

In fact the only teams that have a worse record in all of baseball are the utter dregs: the White Sox Rockies and Marlins. The Marlins already sold off a key piece with the trade of Luis Arraez to the Padres. As they are both on pace to lose 120+ games (for real) we can expect both the Rockies and White Sox to be sellers this season as well.

The Astros meanwhile are on pace right now to finish 56-106. If that sounds familiar that was the Astros' record in 2011 the first of three straight pitiful seasons before the tide started to turn for the franchise.

If things continue on this path the Astros could well be sellers this season.

General manager Dana Brown was asked Tuesday if he could foresee a scenario where that thought comes to fruition. He wouldn't hear of it.

""No"" he said on MLB Network. ""No I can't envision that. This ballclub is too good.""

On one hand you have to agree with Brown. Note that I said above that the tide turned for the franchise after the dreadful rebuilding years over a decade ago. They've now made the ALCS a whopping seven straight seasons a run that includes four AL pennants and two World Series championships. They were one game shy of the World Series last season and returned a very similar roster this season.

Knowing that the general manager absolutely should not be ready to pull the trigger on a selloff only 35 games into the season.

We don't have to be bound by the same mindset though. We can definitely explore whether or not the Astros are actually this bad and then dive even further into ""what if they are sellers?"" territory. Let's do just that.

Are they this bad?

It can be folly to judge teams based on run differential early in the season (for example note that the Cubs lost 17-0 one game totally wrecking the curve for a while) but the Astros' run differential of -27 says they should be around 15-20 instead of 12-23. I suppose that's a better sign than the actual record but 15-20 isn't exactly good. Small-sample caveats remain in play but Fangraph's ""BaseRuns"" has the Astros at -4 which indicates they've played more like a 16-19 team than their actual record. Again better but not good -- and those 23 losses in 35 games are banked and can't be taken back.

We could glance at the projection systems and see they still have a decent chance to make the playoffs. SportsLine has them finishing 87-75 and with a 47.1% chance to make the postseason. You don't sell with those odds.

If we glance at the personnel we could try to find players who will turn things around. Jose Altuve has been amazing so it's not him. Kyle Tucker is also having an excellent season. Yordan Alvarez isn't hitting well for average (.248) but he sits currently with a 123 OPS+ so while there's room for growth it's not like we should expect him to absolutely explode.

Alex Bregman is the one to watch. He's slashing .195/.275/.260 and we know with his track record he's much better than this.

Overall on offense things could stand to happen in a more timely fashion. They are first in the AL in batting average second in on-base percentage third in slugging and eighth in runs. The lag in runs can be partially attributed to sequencing or as noted a second ago timing. They are hitting .225/.313/.331 with runners in scoring position and two outs causing them to strand 253 runners -- or more than seven per game.

One would expect things to turn around on that front.

In the rotation they've dealt with injuries. Verlander has only made four starts. Framber Valdez has also only made four. Cristian Javier hit the IL after four himself. Hunter Brown and J.P. France have been bad in 12 combined starts though Ronel Blanco has been a surprising bright spot.

The bullpen has been an issue with Josh Hader (6.14 ERA) and Ryan Pressly (5.27) being terrible after entering the season as what should have been the most dominant back-end duo in baseball.

In all the Astros' 4.92 ERA is 14th of 15 AL teams.

It's very reasonable to conclude the likes of Bregman Alvarez Verlander Valdez Hader and Pressly pick it up while the offense starts to hit better in so-called clutch situations. That would then right the proverbial ship and Brown would be correct for not envisioning being a seller.

Still there is a world where this is just how the team plays all season. If that's the case ...

What if they sell?

Verlander has a $35 million option for next season that vests if he throws 140 innings this season and he's already been on the injured list. He might not make it and if he doesn't he'll hit free agency after the year. If he's healthy in July and the Astros are out of it he'll absolutely be discussed in trade rumors. It's possible there will teams willing to pay him that fee next season or at least split it up in some fashion with the Astros. And again there's no guarantee he'll get to 140.

Bregman is a free agent after this season so he would be a rental and could be a very attractive one. I know he isn't hitting right now but he's 30 years old and posted 4.9 WAR last season. Teams would be lining up to speak with the Astros about him.

There's a $14 million mutual option for Pressly for next season otherwise he'd be a free agent. Not only would that be attractive to potential bullpen buyers but he'd surely love a chance to return to closing duties after the Astros essentially demoted him when they signed Hader.

Speaking of the bullpen Kendall Graveman (free agent after this season) and Rafael Montero (free agent after 2025) could go as well.

These are all pieces that the Astros could move without impacting their plans to contend again in 2025.

For now that doesn't much matter. If the Astros keeping losing roughly 2/3 of their games however it's something worth watching."

Predictions are made skeptics respond and the vision reboots. The future offers few guarantees. But it also tends to develop over time rather than spring up shockingly new overnight.

In brief After making gradual inroads in drug and materials discovery in recent years artificial intelligence is suddenly appearing in a new light. Autonomous labs that link AI-based data analysis to robotic synthesis and validation are being demonstrated in both academia and industry. These labs prefigure a new work environment in which machines perform many of the traditional functions of researchers. Proponents argue that this self-driven R&D environment will enhance the efforts of multidisciplinary scientists who will maintain ultimate control. Chemical and drug firms are taking a serious look at what may be the lab of the future.

The lab of the future Platonic ideal that it remains has always had a foot in the door. But some say it crossed the threshold to reality entirely last year.

High-tech labs unveiled by academic researchers a computing giant and a major drug company all blend artificial intelligence computing and robotics in ways that may herald a new world of research. They suggest a kind of Renaissance lab for multidisciplinary scientists steeped in chemistry biology and data science.

Alán Aspuru-Guzik a professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto and colleagues reported in Science Advances the discovery of thin-film materials in a “self-driving laboratory” in which AI controls automated synthesis and validation in a cycle of machine-learning data analysis. Andrew I. Cooper director of the Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool and colleagues published results from an AI-directed robotics lab that optimized a photocatalytic process for generating hydrogen from water after running about 700 experiments in 8 days (Nature 2020 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2442-2).

Meanwhile IBM launched a self-driving—or autonomous—lab combining AI with robotics at its research facility in Zurich. And Eli Lilly and Company rang in 2020 with the debut of a self-driving lab at its biotechnology center in San Diego.

“My lab has already been able to close the loop” Aspuru-Guzik says describing a circuit of continuous learning in which AI algorithms guide data analysis and automation toward the identification synthesis and validation of novel molecules. The autonomous lab accesses produces and reprocesses data as it goes along.

You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time.



Alán Aspuru-Guzik professor of chemistry and computer science University of Toronto

These labs aren’t perfect yet and much work and convincing are needed before research managers in the drug and chemical industries embrace them. Observations vary on where the bottlenecks lie in the clocklike loops—some point to the data; others to the robots. But the innovators are unanimous regarding the importance of the third element in the loop: the human researcher.

“This idea of the clockwork laboratory is in the long term not the strongest approach” Cooper says of the notion of a self-sufficient research machine. “The strongest approach is to have the clockwork laboratory with a very permeable interface so that the human knowledge can be captured as well.”

The academics

AI most likely debuted in science fiction with Samuel Butler’s 1872 novel Erehwon or Over the Range. It made news in the real world a quarter century ago when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer took down Garry Kasparov the world chess champion. Kasparov came to terms with his defeat much as the research community has learned to stop worrying and love a machine that accelerates discovery.

“You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time” Aspuru-Guzik says. He points to rapid design techniques in industries such as automotive that rely on advanced materials and the urgency to confront climate change with new materials for storing sun and wind energy. “We have to enter the era of rapid prototyping in materials.”

Researchers say the challenge in accelerating discovery comes down to improving their data sets. That’s a primary function of machine learning in an autonomous lab as it cycles and directs data from synthesis and validation melding them with data from available published literature.

Assembling and fine-tuning a system in Toronto to demonstrate the power of closed-loop autonomous discovery took about a year and a half Aspuru-Guzik says. Once operational the machine was able to produce about 40 molecules in a production run he says “which is more than the number of published molecules in the field I am working on organic semiconductors for laser devices.”

But while the system is intended to support an around-the-clock process it is still operating in discrete runs each averaging a day and a half. “The biggest holdup is not AI” Aspuru-Guzik says. “Data bottlenecks? Zero. The area that is the challenge for getting the self-driving lab to work is the synthesis machinery. The robotics are a little finicky a little hard to control.”

Those robots are the source of the synthesis and validation data necessary for machine-learning algorithms to drive toward discovery. “The point is to generate data on the fly” he says. “That is what you’re getting a robot for.”

The University of Liverpool applied a twist to robotics in its autonomous lab. “It’s ironic that Alán calls his a self-driven laboratory” Cooper quips. “Our robots actually drive.” Indeed robotic agents scoot around a traditional-looking research space in a video released by Cooper’s group. “We decided to automate the chemist not the instrument” he says.

Cooper’s catalyst experiment operated nonstop for 8 days completing about 6500 manipulations in a complex workflow involving solid and liquid handling some under a nitrogen-sealed inert atmosphere and multiple measurements. The mobile robots scooted a total of 2.2 km in a room measuring 5 by 10 m. Cooper says the system can theoretically operate for much longer. “We used 8 different experimental stations” he says. “It could have been 18 or 80.”

As for bottlenecks Cooper also points to robot mechanics. “AI is most powerful when there are multiple choices a wide variety of measurements” he says. But the more involved the experiment the more complex the machinery “and every bit needs to be really reliable. Once you string 10 operations together even a failure point of 0.1% becomes quite significant.”

Regina Barzilay a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colead of the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium notes that AI can run into problems as it operates in new areas of chemical space. But the technology works to solve the problems partly through interaction with a researcher.

“You need to have a mechanism whereby the machine can tell you it needs to look in a particular part of chemical space where it needs to have more training” Barzilay says. “An essential component is to know when the machine is actually not confident in its own prediction which means it needs more help.”

Connor W. Coley assistant professor of chemical engineering at MIT and part of the consortium says advances made in pursuit of the autonomous laboratory reveal the critical importance of the human element. Even if the lab is a closed loop it intersects with an adjacent loop defined by researcher interaction with the machine starting from the word “Go.”

“Humans are always going to set the design objective and specify something that an algorithm can reduce to a numerical optimization” Coley says. “Humans will always be setting the big-picture goal” through rounds of interrogation.

“The big questions include which experiments are accessible to the platform compared to which are needed to prove or disprove the kinds of hypotheses we’re after” he continues. “Another big question is which are the workflows that we can physically automate as steps in the process.”

And there are considerations beyond academic labs like Coley’s. “The interesting question is whether industry is actually going to bite on this or whether it’s some academic bullshit” Cooper says. His laboratory is exploring this question directly: Mobotics a company spun off from Cooper’s lab is pursuing business with materials companies.

Similarly Aspuru-Guzik colaunched Kebotix an AI services firm working with robotics in 2017 when he was at Harvard University. He is also coordinating the launch of a consortium called Acceleration Consortium focused on autonomous technology in materials discovery. Members include industrial and academic researchers.

The start-ups

IBM followed up its chess win with a second popular showcase for AI by introducing Watson a question-answering computer as a contestant on the quiz show Jeopardy! In 2011 Watson defeated champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings winning $1 million.

IBM went on to launch Watson as a commercial product; its first application was in decision management for lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The firm also customized Watson for industrial research markets including chemicals in which companies including the big German firm Evonik Industries have deployed it.

In 2019 IBM announced that it would shift development in its Watson Health division from drug discovery in which the tool struggled to gain traction to clinical development. And the company is working on a new AI architecture to support autonomous chemical discovery in both materials and drug applications.

IBM’s RoboRXN for Chemistry combines AI algorithms commercially available robotics and cloud computing. The firm debuted RoboRXN in a fully autonomous lab last year at its Zurich research laboratory with experiments involving photoacid generator molecules carbon-capture materials and pharmaceutical compounds.

IBM began working on the system in 2017 with a project to apply natural language programming to predictive chemical synthesis problems. Philippe Schwaller a PhD student at IBM who studied reaction prediction at the Zurich lab says the AI component of RoboRXN digitizes chemistry through language to promote machine learning.

“Our models are trained on molecular representations where atoms are like characters molecules are like words and chemical reactions are like sentences” Schwaller says. Thus programmed the model can learn in a fashion that mimics human learning.

The model is also generating data says Teodoro Laino a research scientist and leader of the RoboRXN project. “AI is generating instructions” he says. “The net effect of AI is to add software that is writing software for the robot.”

IBM is working with industrial and institutional partners to implement the technology in research Laino says. For example XChem an experimental facility at Diamond Light Source the UK’s national synchrotron facility is testing whether RoboRXN can discover compounds from data the group generates on how small molecules bind to proteins.

IBM has competition in offering AI research services: start-ups like Insilico Medicine Exscientia and Citrine Informatics are landing contracts with big chemical and pharmaceutical firms. Some of them are also teaming up with lab robotics providers.

Insilico for example announced a partnership last July with Arctoris a supplier of automated drug discovery technology. Insilico CEO Alex Zhavoronkov says the company is looking for an optimum fit between AI and robotics in a closed-loop laboratory. “We are trying to get high-quality data from a controlled robotics environment” he says.

For Zhavoronkov as for Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto robots are the crux. “Synthesis is the main bottleneck. Currently we outsource synthesis” to a contract research organization (CRO) he says. Insilico used AI to discover an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis drug candidate earlier this year then signed on the CRO WuXi AppTec to synthesize it for testing.

‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists. Paul Collier research fellow Johnson Matthey

Exscientia launched in 2012 with a vision of automated drug design CEO Andrew Hopkins says. The firm is continually searching for elements of the process in which AI can increase productivity he says.

“Drug discovery is both a big data and a small data problem” Hopkins says. Databases patents and pertinent literature create a huge amount of data from which to build models he says. “But whenever we look at first-in-class drug targets chances are we know very little about them.” AI allows researchers to design algorithms that explore chemical space beyond the parameters of the original experimental model. “We think of drug discovery as a learning problem not a screening problem” he says.

The company which counts GlaxoSmithKline as a client is preparing to bring robots into the fold. “We are building labs in this space and hiring a director of automation” Hopkins says.

Citrine targets the materials industry and boasts the chemical giant BASF as a client. The company is keeping its focus on AI joining where needed with partners for robotics and other components of a closed-loop discovery system. CEO Greg Mulholland describes the role of AI in an autonomous lab as a central guidance system working hand in hand with the researcher. Other elements of the loop will vary from company to company as will the closedness of the loop Mulholland says.

The real-world users

“Artificial intelligence is very much on our agenda” says Henrik Hahn Evonik’s chief digital officer. The German chemical company has been working for several years to understand the implications of AI in materials discovery as part of a digitization program that has introduced AI at various stages of research. The firm is moving toward closed-loop AI and robotics but Hahn questions whether such an environment will ever fully evolve.

“The autonomous laboratory in materials discovery appears to be some kind of holy grail as computer programs and algorithms surpass the creativity of our materials science experts” he says. “But this is really rather a vision and a vision means it will never come true.”

Evonik is using IBM’s Watson AI technology in its labs and programing its own algorithms Hahn says. And it is beginning to explore automation looking for example into IBM’s RoboRXN technology.

Hahn emphasizes that the autonomous lab poses a steep management challenge. “Wherever we can automate we will try to do so” he says though costs can be an issue. And the people who work in the lab now are no small consideration. Lab automation “is clearly disrupting classic lab work” Hahn says. “This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings.”

Dow is similarly pacing itself toward achieving autonomy in the lab. “My vision of the lab of the future has been practiced at Dow for a while” says A. N. Sreeram the firm’s chief technology officer. He notes that Dow built and programmed its own supercomputers since late in the first decade of this century and is among the industry pioneers in automated research.

These days Sreeram adds the firm is working with robotics big data high-performance computing and now AI and machine learning. And the company has been accessing technology through partnerships. They include a 2017 pact with 1QBit to develop quantum computing applications and a deal announced last year with Microsoft to develop AI for polyurethane research.

The British chemical maker Johnson Matthey is working with Mobotics the company launched by Cooper at the University of Liverpool on robotics for data-driven discovery. The firm says the work builds on a tradition of enabling scientists in materials discovery through technology that supports synthesis characterization and measurement.

“The self-driving or self-guided laboratory is another practical capability which our scientists will use to speed up the innovation process” Paul Collier a research fellow at the company says in an email. “ ‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists.” AI-directed automation provides a tool “that complements human scientists rather than replacing them” he says.

Another chemical maker DSM recently announced a partnership with Delft University of Technology aimed at linking AI with automation. Marcus Remmers DSM’s chief technology officer says the project aims to supercharge aspects of industrial biotech research—automation modeling data management and AI—that are already in place.

This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings. Henrik Hahn chief digital officer Evonik Industries

A major focus will be on the researcher Remmers says. “In the early stages of our digital transformation in R&D we were focused on pilots and tools trying to work things out in small environments” he says. “As we mature we realize the tools are not the limiting factor any more. More so it is the mindset of the people. The scientist will have to reinvent what they are and how they see themselves and the value that they bring to this new world. If you see yourself as just somebody setting up a machine you may well end up missing the big picture.”

In drug discovery AI has gained traction managing data complexity. “Huge progress has been made over the last few years in comprehensively cleaning unlocking and harnessing the diverse and large volumes of discovery data accumulated over decades of research” Hugo Ceulemans scientific director of discovery data sciences at Janssen Research & Development says in an email.

Drug companies are investing in data generation and acquisition for traditional data types such as assays and chemical reactions as well as for new types such as high-content microscopy images. As a result Ceulemans says pharmaceutical research is building up an AI and automation infrastructure.

“The large data volumes flowing from automated pipelines boost AI impact on the portfolio” he says. AI-created insights are also beginning to direct the data that scientists collect he adds.

Biotech companies have the luxury of implementing AI from the ground up. Moderna’s success in arriving at a vaccine with 95% efficacy against COVID-19 in less than a year is partly attributed to AI algorithms according to an article in Digital Initiative published by Harvard Business School.

For established drug companies the adoption of AI can be a more protracted journey. Some major companies however are making a determined effort to close the research technology loop.

Eli Lilly and Company opened a robotics center in San Diego early last year in partnership with Strateos a developer of research-scheduling software. The Lilly Life Sciences Studio is a 1100 m2 facility that includes an autonomous lab with over 100 instruments and storage of over 5 million compounds. It is the culmination of a 6-year project says James P. Beck the head of medicinal chemistry at the center.

Like most drug companies Lilly has been doing automated biology for decades and automated chemistry for more than 10 years Beck says. The Life Sciences Studio puts the company’s expertise in chemistry in vitro biology sample management and analytical data acquisition in a closed loop. AI controls robots that Lilly researchers can access via the cloud he says.

The lab which is operated by Strateos is also accessible to outside researchers who can bring their own data compounds and experiments to the system.

Christos A. Nicolaou head of chemical informatics at Lilly says AI algorithms have evolved to the level where they can orchestrate automated operations in a lab. “AI is mature enough nowadays and we have enough good data to come down to earth and design with action in mind” he says. Lilly worked with software developers Nicolaou says but designed the AI architecture in-house.

“The lab of the future is here today” Beck says. But closing the loop requires heavy lifting. “It is a multifactorial challenge involving science hardware software and engineering” he says. “It is far more than a science story.”

In fact proponents of the autonomous lab suggest it is a human evolution story—one in which a technological environment rises around the enlightened scientist posing little threat to the human. “Imagination and creativity will remain human for the foreseeable future” the University of Liverpool’s Cooper says.

Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto takes that idea one step further quoting Jorge Luis Borges’s poem “Chess”:

God moves the player as he the pieces

But what god behind God plots the advent

Of dust and time and dreams and agonies?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVldGltZXMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5nLWRvd24tYW1hem9uLWF3cy1pbi1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWNvbnRleHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breaking Down Amazon AWS in Automotive Context,"//php echo do_shortcode('[responsivevoice_button voice=""US English Male"" buttontext=""Listen to Post""]') ?>

So how exactly has Amazon found its way into the automotive market? The short answer is through its AWS (Amazon Web Services).

Amazon AWS started developing API-based (application programming interface) cloud services around 2003. AWS cloud computing technology was for internal use until 2006 when Amazon launched AWS for external use. This means that AWS has at least 15 years of experience in developing testing updating and improving its cloud computing service portfolio — and simultaneously keeping up with Amazon’s amazing growth and vastly expanding its external customer base.

I have written two earlier columns on Amazon. The first column has perspectives on how big Amazon is and how it is a major user of transportation services and logistics: Amazon Quietly Worming Its Way into the Auto Industry. The second column is about what Amazon may do in autonomous vehicles for its logistics and its participation in AV use-cases: Amazon’s Playbook on Autonomous Vehicles.

AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing and has gained a lot of automotive customers in the last five years. I think a few quotes from a December 8 2020 press release by AWS and BMW is illustrative of how well Amazon AWS is doing in the auto industry

The companies will combine their strengths as industry leaders to jointly develop cloud-enabled solutions that increase efficiency performance and sustainability across every aspect of the automotive life cycle from vehicle design to after-sales services. As part of the wide-ranging collaboration the BMW Group will migrate data from across its business units and operations in over a hundred countries to AWS. The move will encompass a number of the BMW Group’s core IT systems and databases for functions such as sales manufacturing and maintenance and will help them increase agility achieve new insights and more quickly innovate new customer experiences. In addition the companies will invest in enabling and training up to 5000 BMW Group-affiliated software engineers in the latest AWS technologies and empower the company’s global workforce to make better use of data.

Yes there is some “PR-fluff” but it is still very clear that BMW has a strategic relationship with AWS and will be relying on AWS cloud platforms to a large extent instead of in-house IT centers.

SPONSORED | Introduction to Taipei City Investment and ITO

There are many other auto companies using AWS cloud computing resources and services. When I see an important trend like this I want to understand the why and how and potential future impact. This column is an attempt to do so but the research became complicated because AWS is doing so much and is rapidly evolving and improving IT and cloud technologies. The result is a lot of AWS product names where I make short explanations of what it means.

Let me first look at the overall factors that is making AWS so strong in all industries including automotive cloud applications:

Cloud experience and economy of scale. AWS revenue in 2020 was over $45 billion versus $3.1 billion in 2013.

Largest global cloud infrastructure company providing 200 cloud services. AWS has over 80 Availability Zones (AZ) in 25 regions of the world with each AZ having one or more data centers.

Huge ecosystem of companies that add innovative software tools apps and services.

Thousands of partners with expertise to help AWS customers to develop cloud services.

Flexible pricing strategy. Most of AWS cloud development tools are free to use during the customers’ product creation phase. The fees start when the developed product run on AWS cloud systems. Overall AWS prices are well below the cost of in-house IT systems with more flexibility.

AWS auto clients include: Audi BWM Continental Denso Elektrobit Honda Kia Lyft Mazda Mobileye Momenta Panasonic Renault Scania Tata Toyota TuSimple Uber Volvo Group WeRide VW WirelessCar and many more.

World class expertise in developing and using AI technology is a major advantage.

AWS has all the necessary capabilities to gain more automotive clients. The next figure is an attempt to use a picture to provide perspectives on what AWS can do and include auto client examples. I am using four product phases to illustrate the breadth of AWS products and automotive customer examples.

The blue boxes list the four product phases—create make market and use—with typical activities listed in each box. The four green boxes list a few AWS products with more explanation below the figure. The four red boxes are example AWS users—again using the four product phases.

AWS cloud computing and ecosystem

The above figure also has two black boxes that summarizes the core AWS cloud computing infrastructure in the top black box and the AWS ecosystem for developing cloud services for AWS customers in the middle black box.

The AWS cloud computing box list three key acronyms—IaaS PaaS and SaaS. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides cloud computing systems — including servers storage networking and operating software as a virtualized service. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) includes software development and system software resources where the customers can develop their own cloud applications. SaaS-based cloud platforms run on top of IaaS and PaaS.

AWS has built a valuable software and service ecosystem for its cloud computing environment. There are hundreds of software and cloud development tools from Amazon and its partners. There are thousands of developers builders and architects that can help create new cloud apps tailored to AWS customers’ needs and requirements.

AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that are easy to find test buy and deploy on AWS. AWS Marketplace has over 10000 products listed on the AWS website.

Another indication of the popularity of AWS is that Amazon’s virtual conference called re:Invent in December 2020 had over 570000 attendees. Amazon’s website has excellent coverage of announcements and presentations. Amazon had 145product announcements at this conference.

AWS product examples

AWS has an expanding product offering. The following paragraph (I shortened it slightly) is how AWS explain its services as of March 2021.

Currently AWS offers over 200 services for compute storage databases networking analytics robotics machine learning and AI IoT mobile security virtual and augmented reality and application development deployment and management from 80 Availability Zones (AZs) within 24 geographic regions with announced plans for 12 more AZs and four more AWS Regions in Indonesia Japan Spain and Switzerland. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups largest enterprises and leading government agencies—trust AWS to power their infrastructure become more agile and lower costs.

I have listed a few of these AWS products in the four green blocks. Many of the products will work in all of the four product phases: create-make-market-use. I tried to put each product examples where the functionality seemed to have the best match.

If you need better descriptions of the 200 AWS products the link here has separate links to each product’s functionality. It also has data on Amazon’s regions and what services are available by region. The data is updated daily. The following is a short description of the 16 product examples in the green boxes.

Lambda can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service with zero administration.

Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect process and analyze real-time streaming for timely insights and react quickly to new information.

Auto product phases

The auto product phases are shown in the four blue boxes. If you want more perspectives I wrote a column on this topic in November 2020: ‘Create-Make-Market-Use’ Applied to Automotive Analysis.

For software the create or development is the most crucial phase that has a major factor in determining success. AWS has a wealth of products and services to be successful in the create phase.

In the make phase AWS is very strong for all of the traditional functions such as factory and production management. AWS also has the needed portfolio for supply chain and inventory control and can replace a company’s internal IT systems in many cases.

The AWS story is the same for the marketing phase. AWS has a wealth of product and service for sales marketing customer acquisition tools and dealer logistics. AWS is again in position to substitute for in-house IT systems for some companies.

The use phase is becoming a major opportunity for SaaS and cloud computing applications and it is no surprise that AWS is at the forefront for introducing and deploying these functions. The previous column has perspectives on this topic: Changing Roles of Automotive Software.

Auto customer examples

The four red boxes show examples of how some auto OEMs use AWS as their platforms. I picked four examples for each of the four phases: create-make-market-use. All of the examples are described in more details at the AWS website.

BlackBerry IVY uses QNX data abstraction and AWS’ Edge cloud computing services and operates within a vehicle’s embedded systems. An API allows developers to create contextually aware in-car experiences without worrying about automotive programming languages hardware variations proprietary sensor data formats or accessing safety critical systems.

The latest ZeroLight Car Configurator was launched on Amazon Live streaming service in March 2021. Numerous OEMs are using it for sales and marketing.

Toyota Connected built a resilient scalable and cost-optimized mobility services platform that uses data insights to improve safety and convenience. The platform uses a serverless architecture that increase mobility for its individual and fleet customers. It is interesting that Toyota’s presentation on the project says “serverless” is equivalent to “just-in-time delivery”.

Volvo (Truck) Group migrated to AWS in 2015 with the goal of faster time to market and scalability. Since 2015 most of Volvo’s services are built on AWS and the AWS Cloud is the foundation for Volvo Group to deliver connected services to more than 800000 trucks buses and machines.

WirelessCar congestion charge service powered by AWS accelerates digital business models for car manufacturers by enriching vehicle journey data.

AWS has its own connected vehicle platform that is used by some OEMs. The AWS Connected Car Solution is a reference design to connect and authenticate vehicles to the AWS cloud. It includes local computing within vehicles sophisticated event rules data processing storage analytics and machine learning. It provides a framework to integrate AWS IoT and AWS Greengrass into the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) software stack.

Summary

As you can see from the above data Amazon AWS is already a formidable competitor in automotive electronics development and long-term operation during the cars’ lifetime use pattern. AWS is also taking over the IT functions in manufacturing sales and marketing for some auto OEMs. Amazon AWS has competitors with Microsoft Azure best positioned for automotive business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21pdC1zdHVkeS1maW5kcy1zeXN0ZW1hdGljLWxhYmVsaW5nLWVycm9ycy1pbi1wb3B1bGFyLWFpLWJlbmNobWFyay1kYXRhc2V0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MIT study finds 'systematic' labeling errors in popular AI benchmark datasets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/mit-study-finds-systematic-labeling-errors-in-popular-ai-benchmark-datasets/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21pdC1zdHVkeS1maW5kcy1zeXN0ZW1hdGljLWxhYmVsaW5nLWVycm9ycy1pbi1wb3B1bGFyLWFpLWJlbmNobWFyay1kYXRhc2V0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0dXMtaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL2lubm92YXRvcnMtZ3VpZGUvZGlzY292ZXItNS10b3AtYmlnLWRhdGEtc3RhcnR1cHMtaW1wYWN0aW5nLXRoZS1iaW90ZWNoLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover 5 Top Big Data Startups impacting the BioTech Industry,"Staying ahead of the technology curve means strengthening your competitive advantage.

Henry Lloyd-Hughes on playing a 'fallen' Sherlock Holmes in The Irregulars,"It would be fair to wonder if we really need a new Sherlock Holmes adaptation - the famous detective has been portrayed on screen plenty of times before with actors including Benedict Cumberbatch Robert Downey Jr and Henry Cavill all taking residence in 221b Baker Street.

But while Netflix's new series The Irregulars is certainly based on the mystery-solving characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in this Sherlock story we don't meet the detective himself until halfway through the series; and when we do he's a shadow of the brilliant man we've seen before.

Instead the show focuses on a group of teenagers - the eponymous Irregulars mentioned by Conan Doyle in the original stories - who are manipulated in to helping Dr Watson and his mysterious partner solve crimes.

Image: The Irregulars were a group of characters mentioned by writer Arthur Conan Doyle in his original stories

Henry Lloyd-Hughes who plays Sherlock told Sky News' Backstage podcast that this version is the perfect fit for current times.

""I think weirdly there's something much more 2020 and 2021 about arriving in a world where we're not even sure if he exists - what he is and what is a myth what is real"" he said.

""When we encounter him eventually in the show he's very much a deconstructed fallen version of the man the myth the legend. So maybe he feels a bit like we all feel right now.""

While the Sherlock who does eventually arrive on screen may come as a surprise audiences will get to see the expected oddball-yet-charming genius via flashback scenes.

Lloyd-Hughes says that in meeting Sherlock when he's not at his peak viewers get a different perspective on the well-known character.

""What becomes clear is that more than I think other versions this character is self-aware of the extent to which he has created his own myth and is dealing with the bruising repercussions of that. I think that's an interesting place to meet such a legendary well-known literary figure.""

The flashbacks tell the story of 15 years previously when the detective was at the top of his game.

""It's not every day that you get to age up 15 years at the turn of a page in a script"" Lloyd-Hughes said. ""We really went all out to try to see how we can push the extremes of both characters - so it's almost weirdly like playing two Sherlocks actually in the same show and in the same episodes and scene after scene.

""We wanted to push the physicality of the present-day Sherlock [who] is a kind of shuffling half-man addled with all sorts of problems and therefore because we knew that we were going to do that we wanted to push the younger Sherlock in another direction - so he's much more of a kind of charismatic better looking bit more of a rock star.""

Unlike other adaptations of Conan Doyle's work The Irregulars soon sees the characters dealing with supernatural elements and dark forces.

Lloyd-Hughes hopes that by combining genres and bringing horror to the detective story it will attract different audiences.

""When I was a teenager I was a huge fan of The X Files and it kind of reminds me of that like you have the monster of the week element but then you also have the overriding bigger plot points about a much kind of bigger conspiracy for want of a better word.

""I think it's going to be really interesting because apart from anything else horror or supernatural elements is such an enduring genre and it scoops so many people in. So I'm fascinated and I can't wait for audiences to see this because it's going to be a real collision of different genres and different flavours.""

SpaceX launched a batch of Starlink satellites into Earth's orbit on March 4. The rocket booster which was attached to a Falcon 9 failed to de-orbit on the same day and had been around our planet ever since. However the rocket booster has now made its way into Earth's atmosphere burning up as it did so.

Videos of the space debris falling through the skies were captured by onlookers in Washington along the northwestern coast of the US. The footage shows several fragments all in close proximity burning up after they entered the atmosphere. Many onlookers mistook the space debris for a meteorite and flocked to the International Meteor Organisation (IMO) to report their sighting.

Starting jobs at investment banks are notorious for long hours and a lot of pressure. But junior bankers say the pandemic booming markets and other factors are making their grueling jobs even more intense. Some are near or past breaking point.

Burnout on Wall Street became a hot topic of conversation this week after a group of 13 anonymous first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs circulated a slide deck — meticulously branded with footnotes — that described how 100-hour weeks were taking a toll on their mental and physical health. “I’m in a really dark place” one wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5rcy10cmFkaW5nLWFtZXJpY2FuLWRyZWFtLWRlYnQtMDExNjExNTEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks Trading American Dream Debt for Mall of America Stock,"Bankers are taking a minority stake in Triple Five Group’s Mall of America and West Edmonton Mall as a make good following a default on the firm’s American Dream mall complex WWD has confirmed.

J.P. Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and a group of real estate investors are set to receive a 49 percent stake in the two mammoth malls after the New Jersey entertainment complex fell short.

The Mall of America and West Edmonton was used as collateral for a loan to build American Dream. J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment and Triple Five could not immediately be reached over the weekend.

The Financial Times earlier reported the deal which could close soon but is complex.

American Dream which has been 20 years in the making and has seen repeated changes in ownership in 2019 finally opened some of its marquee entertainments including the Big Snow Ski and Snowboard Park. But the coronavirus lockdowns delayed the long-awaited opening of the retailing component last year and when the mall did open it was launching into the pandemic.

It cost more than $6 billion to build the 3.3 million square foot complex which also includes the world’s largest indoor wave pool encompassing 1.5 acres.

The very best ‘A’ malls with established businesses appear to be holding on in the pandemic but much of the rest of the mall world is struggling.

American Dream once called Xanadu is a massive project with huge debts and needed a steady flow of business to keep its books balanced.

The banks and lenders that bet on that dream are now going to be owners in other mega retail projects. The Mall of America features over 520 stores eight acres of skylights an aquarium events and more. And the West Edmonton Mall has over 800 stores two hotels and over 100 dining venues.

By Stephen Wilson

In a virtual environment exploring careers in distant cities has never been easier.

That’s what 260 students did thanks to 47 employer hosts. Over the course of December and January participants learned about media and communications in New York City; life science and finance in Boston and New York City; government communications and research in Washington D.C.; and technology and innovation in New York City Boston and the West Coast.

“The virtual nature of Career Tracks this year opened doors that regulations and restrictions can often keep closed when the program operates physically” says Mike Summers associate vice president of Gateway Career Center. “This afforded us opportunities that were broader and more distinct.”

This valuable behind-the-scenes look at specific industries helped students better understand their futures and build connections with alumni parents and friends of the College.

“I have found our hosts to be incredibly open about sharing their career experience as well as giving great advice around interviewing individual educational investment and work etiquette” says Holly Akers associate director of employer relations and outreach at Gateway Career Center.

“The virtual environment allowed us to invite alumni and hosts from across the country and globe to participate” says Josh Walker associate director of employer relations and outreach at Gateway Career Center. “Based on the feedback from students the impact this global perspective had on them was profound.”

Here are some highlights.

Finance

Tracks in New York City and Boston focused on a range of topics including bulge bracket boutique banks private banks financial consultants and wealth managers. Students had the opportunity to hear from successful alumni about what their career and daily work experience looks like.

“Lafayette’s true differentiator is the alumni network and their willingness to help out another Pard. I hadn’t participated in Career Tracks in the past because I live in Los Angeles so having it virtual was great. One of Morgan Stanley’s core values is ‘giving back.’ It’s nice to work for a firm that encourages their employees to do so. Career Tracks is a terrific value-add for students providing an opportunity to hear from successful alumni and parents who can offer an authentic lens into a career path they may have an interest in pursuing. Having the opportunity to connect and ask questions that they may not feel comfortable asking in an interview is a definite advantage of participating.”

John Tully ’07 director Equities Advisory Sales Bank of America Securities

“Career Tracks have been a pivotal aspect to Bank of America’s recruiting program. As an alumni I take great pride in facilitating Lafayette alumnus from across various business units inside the organization to participate in this now annual event.

“As a first-time alumni host my experience was extremely positive as I had the opportunity to virtually meet and engage a group of wildly talented students who are considering a career in public policy advocacy politics and government. To no surprise the Lafayette students were genuinely interested full of poise and asked great questions from how to start on Capitol Hill to navigating graduate school. The overall depth of interest encouraged me to facilitate a springtime alumni panel featuring a dozen successful alumni at various stages of their careers and across a broad spectrum of congressional offices government organizations and private business employers. Between Career Tracks and the alumni panel these student-alumni interactive events proved meaningful and rewarding.”

Pamela Passman ’83 corporate and philanthropic leader Washington D.C.

“I was excited when the Gateway Career Center approached me to be a part of their first-ever D.C.-focused Career Tracks. I appreciated the opportunity to share my experience and the various career paths I have seen available to students as they contemplate a first job or graduate school in Washington D.C.

“This year’s virtual approach allowed for more interactions than ever. Career Services did a phenomenal job at getting panelists who have different backgrounds within the same field. The panel was an open discussion so students had an opportunity to ask us whatever they wanted in a relaxed and friendly environment. About three or four students expressed interest in my company after the event. I experienced firsthand how making these connections is so important for students. I attended the Boston Career Tracks my senior year and met another alumni Tara Mayo ’10 who introduced me to ThermoFisher and the new grad programs they had.”

Mark Murawski ’93 director Contract Services Bayer U.S. LLC

“It’s important for me personally to give back to Lafayette. I’ve worked for three companies since I graduated and each time I moved companies there was a Lafayette alum on the interview panel who ultimately had a large stake in the hiring process. Networking is key. An undergraduate experience is about discovering who you are and making positive connections in the world. I’m more interested in hiring someone who is well rounded has great communication skills willing to work hard and is an avid learner over someone with a 4.0 that can’t hold a conversation.

Timothy R. Hylan ’88 lead Internal Medicine FMD Group and chair Pfizer

“There has never been a more exciting time for a career in biopharmaceuticals. We are all living in a world where we want science to win (and fast!) and bring breakthroughs that change patients’ lives to everyone sooner. We need to inspire the next generation of scientists and leaders to help chart the next innovation. I didn’t realize how much interest there would be in terms of follow-up following our session but within 24 hours after the session I got more than 10 email inquiries from students asking for further advice networking and questions about my career.”

Timothy Skinski ’83 global director Information Technology in Chromatography Services Boehringer Ingelheim

“After providing an overview of a IT laboratory systems group in a pharmaceutical company we had a very interactive discussion which covered many different topic areas (technical cultural international collaboration etc.). The virtual Zoom session enabled an international cross section of my team to participate. This would not have been possible in a traditional setting.”

“One of the students who attended graduated in December 2020 and was immediately able to interview for an associate project manager position. That candidate connected with a few of us after the event and before submitting an application. We’ve had at least one Lafayette alumnus/a join each year since 2015. That puts us at 11 Lafayette co-workers including co-founders Rob Hummel ’06 and Marc Lisi ’08.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvY29ycG9yYXRlLWRpdmVyc2l0eS1naXZlcy15b3UtYW4tZWRnZS1pbi1zdG9jay1pbnZlc3RpbmctdGhlc2Utc2l4LWNvbXBhbmllcy1maXQtdGhlLWJpbGwtMTE2MTY0MjAyNTnSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWdpdmVzLXlvdS1hbi1lZGdlLWluLXN0b2NrLWludmVzdGluZy10aGVzZS1zaXgtY29tcGFuaWVzLWZpdC10aGUtYmlsbC0xMTYxNjQyMDI1OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporate diversity gives you an edge in stock investing --- these six companies fit the bill,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/corporate-diversity-gives-you-an-edge-in-stock-investing-these-six-companies-fit-the-bill-11616420259 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvY29ycG9yYXRlLWRpdmVyc2l0eS1naXZlcy15b3UtYW4tZWRnZS1pbi1zdG9jay1pbnZlc3RpbmctdGhlc2Utc2l4LWNvbXBhbmllcy1maXQtdGhlLWJpbGwtMTE2MTY0MjAyNTnSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWdpdmVzLXlvdS1hbi1lZGdlLWluLXN0b2NrLWludmVzdGluZy10aGVzZS1zaXgtY29tcGFuaWVzLWZpdC10aGUtYmlsbC0xMTYxNjQyMDI1OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Nob3VsZC1pLXBheS1vZmYtbXktY2FyLWxvYW4tZWFybHktNDMzODIwL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy9zaG91bGQtaS1wYXktb2ZmLW15LWNhci1sb2FuLWVhcmx5LTQzMzgyMC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should I Pay Off My Car Loan Early?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cars.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

""We just spoke back at the beginning of April and he seemed to be in good spirits and having some positive musical activities and plans with musicians local to him near his home in Louisiana.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Why?,"Ahead of attending the Met Gala on Monday night Jessica Biel revealed a unique part of her red carpet prep: an Epsom salt bath. In a video taken on Sunday night and posted to TikTok the actress — who wowed in a pink Tamara Ralph couture gown at the star-studded New York City event — filmed herself preparing to soak in a bathtub filled with a whopping 20 pounds of salt.

The video shows Biel counting out five bags of Dr. Teal’s Pure Epsom Salt Soaking Solution before emptying them all into her bathtub. “With water as hot as you can take it [have a] 30-minute soak [the] night before” she shared. “Drink tons of water then and off to bed early. See you tomorrow Met Ball.”

What is the salt supposed to do — and is that much really necessary? Here’s what to know about Epsom salt baths and why there’s some controversy surrounding them.

What does an Epsom salt bath do?

Epsom salt is also known as magnesium sulfate or bath salt and contains magnesium which is associated with a number of health benefits including improved sleep and decreased levels of inflammation. Bathing in Epsom salt is said to reduce muscle pain and inflammation as well as promote relaxation and soften skin. Some doctors have also recommended it as an easy natural remedy to address daily aches and pains.

“[An] Epsom salt bath is well known to help soothe achy muscles and help you relax” Dr. Laura Purdy a family medicine physician and medical director of Swell Medical tells Yahoo Life. “Another believed benefit of Epsom salt baths is magnesium absorption in the skin. Magnesium is an important mineral that supports overall health — specifically brain and heart health sleep quality and muscle relaxation and when looking specifically [at] your diet it can help lower blood sugar levels.”

The scientific evidence to support these largely anecdotal claims however is lacking. There are no definitive studies showing that magnesium can be absorbed through the skin (via a soak) in amounts sufficient to provide the benefits seen after ingesting it through food or oral supplements.

Some claim that soaking in Epsom salt can help with weight loss. However Purdy says that any perceived change in the body’s appearance or weight after a soak in Epsom salt would have less to do with the magnesium components and more to do with the dehydrating effect of the salt and warm water combined.

“Epsom salt baths are known to reduce swelling and remove toxins from the body. These factors may impact weight management” she says. “There is no known evidence that Epsom salt baths are effective for losing weight but taking a hot bath can cause you to sweat and ultimately burn calories. So there could be a correlation of weight loss due to sweating which would reduce water weight.”

Biel for instance said she made the bathwater as hot as she could handle which Purdy says would lead to sweating and dehydration. It’s worth noting that the 20 pounds of Epsom salt that the actress used is significantly higher than the 2 cups recommended by the Mayo Clinic and Dr. Teal’s.

“For a standard-sized bathtub the desired therapeutic effects are achieved by combining approximately 2 cups of Epsom salt with warm bathwater” dermatologist Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh tells Yahoo Life. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions however can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose.”

When used in a bath for soaking purposes Purdy says Epsom salt is generally considered safe. However “there may be some skin reactions if you have sensitive skin like a rash or itchy skin” she says.

“Individuals with kidney problems or severe skin conditions should consult a health care provider before using Epsom salt baths” adds Singh.

Why there’s some controversy

Biel didn’t share why her Met Gala prep involved an Epsom bath soak but the implication — as suggested by People’s Instagram post — that it allowed her to “slip into” her gown has been called “so unhealthy and toxic” by some social media users. Other commenters shared their own experiences taking Epsom salt baths from taking them to slim down before a wrestling competition to regarding them as a “known hack” for models and bodybuilders.

Emily Van Eck a registered dietitian who specializes in body image and eating disorders tells Yahoo Life that it’s important that people don’t take Biel’s routine as guidance.

“This can definitely cause harm” she says. “The more you try behaviors like this that perpetuate trying to be as thin as possible the more at risk you are for developing an eating disorder.”

“Any fast fads for dropping pounds that start to circle the internet can impact someone’s mental health if they are personally experiencing body image issues” says Purdy. “Oftentimes these fads are not sustainable and are considered quick fixes based on how someone wants to look short-term and not considering their overall long-term health.”"

Inaugural Young Sports Stars Awards a huge success

By Stuart Tynan

With no Young Sports Stars Awards taking place this year due to Covid-19 The Connaught Telegraph will be taking a trip down memory lane and reviewing each of the five awards ceremonies that have taken place to date. Up first is the inaugural 2015 Connaught Telegraph Young Sports Stars Awards.

THE very first Connaught Telegraph Young Sports Stars Awards took place in Breaffy House Hotel on February 5 2016.

A unique aspect of the ceremony was that it would highlight the contributions of specifically young people competing in their chosen sport needing to be under the age of 23 to be eligible.

A total of 21 recipients across 12 different sporting disciplines including table tennis swimming boxing basketball Gaelic football soccer cycling and martial arts were honoured on the night which was seen as 'remarkable' by then Sports Minister Michael Ring with Mayo so steeped in GAA traditions.

He stated: ""It has given what is often described as 'the minority sports' a massive boost and it should always be remembered that they invest a huge amount of time and energy to their sports without the same type of financial supports that the bigger sports get.

He is pictured here with Martin Cosgrove and Ciaran Geraghty from category sponsors Baxter Healthcare and Connaught Telegraph representative Aiden Henry. Image 2 of 2 The overall Connaught Telegraph Young Female Sports Star 2015 was Michaela Walsh. She was presented with the Melissa Patterson Cup by Ciaran Geraghty and Martin Cosgrove of event sponsors Baxter Healthcare.

""The citations speak for themselves. Not only are the recipients county and provincial title winners but many of them are national and European champions in their respective codes and are competing at international level on a regular basis.""

Martin Carney chairman of the judging panel for the event recalled on the night how the county was left reeling following the untimely and tragic passing of two of its brighest sportspeople Darragh Doherty and Melissa Patterson whom the trophies for best young male and female sportspeople are named after in their honour.

""It is appropriate that there are special awards to commemorate the memories of Darragh Doherty and Melissa Patterson who in their short lifespans achieved more than many who have gone or who will succeed them.

“Here we had sportspeople achievers and two who through their contribution to sport enhanced their own the community's and their county's reputation.

""For the Doherty and Patterson families this event is one that is bittersweet and at the same time one where they can recall with pride the contribution made by Darragh and Melissa to the sporting tapestry in the county.""

Swinford native Michaela Walsh won the Melissa Patterson Perpetual Cup for Outstanding Young Sportswoman while Niall Joyce won the Darragh Doherty Perpetual Cup for Outstanding Young Sportsman. The other main award winner selected by The Connaught Telegraph readers was Castlebar martial artist Davitt Neary.",,,,,,,,,,,,

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L3doeS1kb2VzbnQtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtb3duLWFueS1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Doesn't Warren Buffett Own Any Renewable Energy Stocks?,"Even with Berkshire Hathaway Energy the Oracle of Omaha could use some more renewable stocks.

Warren Buffett is widely considered the greatest investor of all time. And rightfully so. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.01%) (BRK.B -0.00%) has handily outperformed the market since its inception. However Berkshire has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years -- largely because Buffett didn't own many of the growth stocks that drove the market's return.

Out of the 48 companies Berkshire Hathaway owns none of them are renewable energy stocks. Let's break down the reasons why Buffett has steered clear of renewables and why now might be the best time to alter his course.

Explaining Berkshire Hathaway Energy

It's important to first understand Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) and how it fits into Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway owns 91.1% of BHE. Buffett considers BHE part of his ""big four"" along with insurance companies 100% ownership of the largest U.S. railroad by freight volume (BNSF) and 5.4% ownership of Apple (AAPL 0.27%).

BHE is a leading U.S. energy operator meaning it's in a similar business as other utilities and energy infrastructure companies. BHE is huge owning over $100 billion in assets and generating $3.4 billion in 2020 net income. The vast majority of its holdings are regulated electric and natural gas utilities transmission and distribution businesses dealing mainly with fossil fuels. BHE Renewables is the primary exception.

As of 2020 year-end BHE Renewables has interests in 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power projects and has invested over $6 billion in 32 third-party wind energy projects. In 2020 BHE Renewables generated $936 million in revenue and $521 million in net income. For comparison Brookfield Renewable Corporation -- which is valued at $7.7 billion and owns and operates similar renewable assets to BHE -- has 18.8 GW of renewable capacity and generated $3.09 billion in 2020 revenue. So yes Buffett likes energy. But BHE doesn't own that many renewable energy assets for its size.

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio

Now that we have a better handle of how BHE fits into Berkshire Hathaway as a whole the remainder of our discussion will focus on Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies (not its subsidiaries).

Berkshire's portfolio has changed a lot over the last five years most notably with the purchase of Apple in 2016. Since then Apple has ballooned to become Berkshire's largest holding. Worth over $108 billion Apple stock comprises a staggering 38% of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies. Buffett has also added Snowflake and StoneCo two hyper-growth stocks that go against his traditional value investing bent. Since Buffett owns so much Apple his portfolio is actually double the tech concentration of the S&P 500. Buffett is also overweight financials and consumer staples and underweight every other sector. In fact Buffett's portfolio looks nothing like the S&P 500. The following charts compare the two.

Buffett has had a concentrated portfolio for decades -- so Berkshire's starkly contrasting allocation compared to the market isn't all too surprising. However what is surprising is that he hasn't added any renewables stocks given his openness to growth industries.

Why Buffett has avoided renewable energy stocks

The most likely reason Buffett has avoided renewables is profitability and valuation. Despite the growth trajectory the industry tends to be cyclical and can even be unprofitable. It seems like a distant memory now but 2016 was a downturn in the solar industry. The average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF lost 45% of its value in just one year. Fast forward to 2020 and the average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF went up over 230% and the average stock in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF gained 59%.

The narrative has flipped in 2021 as renewables are heavily underperforming the market. Although there are valid reasons why renewables are selling off right now discounted prices could give Buffett a more attractive entry point into a new sector. Renewables remain cyclical but costs have come down and established players have shown they can better manage profits throughout market cycles.

Renewable energy stocks worth consideration

Renewable energy stocks would fit perfectly in Berkshire's portfolio. Despite the sell-off the long-term tailwinds for renewable energy are brighter than ever before.

There are plenty of different ways to invest in the sector. As a utility operator BHE is already investing in a big part of the renewable supply chain. However a well-run utility like NextEra Energy (NEE 0.74%) stands out as a good buy. NextEra Energy Resources the company's renewable division had over $5 billion in 2020 revenue and a renewable capacity of over 27 GW at 2020 year-end. NextEra's overall business has a track record for earnings and dividend growth and is the largest U.S. utility by market cap.

Buffett could also invest in an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) like General Electric or Siemens. These companies design specifications and manage renewable energy projects. GE in particular has been targeting some big-time renewable growth.

Finally Buffett could go for a more pure-play renewable energy stock. Market leaders like Enphase Energy that ran too far too fast in 2020 have since come down in price and could be a good fit. If Buffett was feeling particularly adventurous smaller companies like wind blade manufacturer TPI Composites could be worth a look.

Takeaways

BHE is a core part of Berkshire Hathaway but its renewable assets are minor given the size of Buffett's holdings. Aside from utility operators Buffett lacks significant exposure to other aspects of renewable energy. If Buffett is open to investing in Snowflake and StoneCo then he could stand to benefit from adding some growing renewable energy stocks as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXktc3RvY2stZ2l2ZXMtZXZlcnktMjAxMjAzMDc2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway Stock Gives Every Indication Of Being Fairly Valued,"- By GF Value





The stock of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A 30-year Financials) shows every sign of being fairly valued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $387995 per share and the market cap of $591 billion Berkshire Hathaway stock gives every indication of being fairly valued. GF Value for Berkshire Hathaway is shown in the chart below.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Berkshire Hathaway has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.41 which is worse than 83% of the companies in Insurance industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Berkshire Hathaway at 5 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of Berkshire Hathaway is fair. This is the debt and cash of Berkshire Hathaway over the past years:

Investing in profitable companies carries less risk especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Berkshire Hathaway has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months the company had revenues of $286.3 billion and earnings of $27163 a share. Its operating margin of 0.00% in the bottom 10% of the companies in Insurance industry. Overall GuruFocus ranks Berkshire Hathaway's profitability as fair. This is the revenue and net income of Berkshire Hathaway over the past years:

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Berkshire Hathaway is 6.9% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Insurance industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 24.7% which ranks better than 84% of the companies in Insurance industry.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Berkshire Hathaway's ROIC is 6.37 while its WACC came in at 6.27. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Berkshire Hathaway is shown below:

Warren Buffett one of the greatest value investors of all time is turning 90 this year. Operating from his hometown of Omaha Nebraska Buffett lives in a modest house drives a modest car and enjoys the simple pleasures of life like an ice-cold Coke.

After sticking to the same investing game plan for years Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.01%) (BRK.B -0.00%) portfolio has gotten a fairly considerable revamp over the last few years. For instance trusting the wisdom of his closest Berkshire money managers the company began buying shares of tech growth stock Apple in 2016. Technology a sector that Buffett used to mostly avoid now comprises about 40% of Berkshire's portfolio.

So it's clear that Buffett is willing to go in new directions if the right opportunity comes along. With this in mind perhaps Buffett should consider Starbucks (SBUX 1.22%) Honeywell (HON 0.44%) and United Parcel Service (UPS 0.07%). These companies offer a great combination of market leadership dividends and value.

Here's why Buffett would love all three companies and why they would fit nicely into Berkshire's portfolio.

1. Starbucks

Berkshire Hathaway owns over $30 billion in shares of consumer staple stocks Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. Although Starbucks technically falls in the consumer discretionary category its product line has arguably become more of a staple for consumers than many offerings from Coke and Kraft Heinz. The shift in consumer sentiment away from sugar and preservatives toward healthier options hinders the growth prospects of soda and processed-food companies. Yet Starbucks manages to have a similar level of recession resilience as these companies (with a much brighter future in the forecast).

Starbucks was hit hard by the pandemic but has since reopened nearly all of its stores. Its revenue and earnings are close to pre-pandemic levels with U.S. same-store comps down just 5% year over year as of its most recent quarter. This is impressive considering 60% of its U.S. company-operated stores are still offering limited seating.

Starbucks leaned heavily on grab-and-go ordering and its mobile app during the pandemic. And it worked. Customers are using the app and spending more money per transaction than ever before which bodes well for Starbucks' future.

Since issuing its first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in April 2010 Starbucks has raised its annual payout every single year. Its quarterly dividend is now $0.45 per share which is a yield of 1.7% at today's prices. Starbucks has plans to build new stores focused solely on grab-and-go ordering -- which should help it grow earnings and its dividend for years to come.

2. Honeywell

Just over 2% of Berkshire's portfolio is dedicated to industrial stocks. If Buffett was looking for an industrial to add then Honeywell deserves to be a top contender.

Like most industrial stocks Honeywell suffered revenue and earnings declines last year. As results improved toward the end of the year management said it is now confident that the company can return to growth.

The same factors that hurt Honeywell's 2020 results should help it in 2021. Commercial aviation could rebound as air traffic improves. Higher oil prices and industrial production will help its performance materials and technologies segment. Honeywell's customers delayed building solutions projects in 2020. But in its fourth-quarter conference call Honeywell management announced orders were piling in putting its backlog in a good position for 2021. And finally safety and productivity solutions (SPS) -- the only segment that grew in 2020 -- should continue to benefit from warehouse automation and productivity solutions. SPS ended 2020 with a $4 billion backlog -- double the backlog at the end of 2019. Simply put Honeywell is seeing business pick up in all of its segments.

Aside from an optimistic outlook Honeywell has many qualities that Buffett would love. The company's strong balance sheet history of dividend increases and growth prospects give it long-term value. Despite last year's challenges Honeywell was able to generate tons of free cash flow that more than doubled its dividend payments.

Excess free cash flow continues to give Honeywell the dry powder needed to limit how much debt it adds to its balance sheet. Today its balance sheet remains one of the best of the major industrials.

3. UPS

Ranking 48 out of 48 on Buffett's list of holdings is UPS. So yes Buffett owns the stock. But at 0.003% of Berkshire's portfolio the company's UPS shares could double and it would hardly make an impact.

UPS rival FedEx reported encouraging earnings and guidance on March 18 that showed a strong recovery in business-to-business (B2B) sales and e-commerce growth. This is good news for UPS which would like its B2B volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.

UPS has the makings of a perfect Buffett stock. With 70% higher net income and double the market cap of FedEx UPS is the market leader in its industry. Its adjusted 2020 EPS of $8.23 per share gives it a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of around 19. UPS has a dividend yield of 2.6%. The company just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.02 per share more than double what it was 10 years ago.

UPS has plenty of growth prospects as well. It's leading the distribution process for COVID-19 vaccines a trend Buffett can appreciate seeing as he's been buying healthcare stocks. UPS was also one of the few industrial stocks that crushed earnings throughout 2020 not to mention notching its best quarter ever at the end of the year.

E-commerce is a booming trend that benefits UPS. The company has been expanding its fleet and laying the groundwork for what it expects to be years of e-commerce growth. The pandemic accelerated that trend which was a big part of UPS' strong 2020 performance. However there's reason to believe it will retain much of the business it gained while adding more in the years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluc3VyZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYW0tYmVzdC1hZmZpcm1zLWdlbi1yZXMtYS1yYXRpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AM Best affirms Gen Re’s A++ rating,"AM Best affirms Gen Re’s A++ rating

In this space on Monday I reported that a site plan in Shelby Township shows what appears to be an Amazon Fresh store envisioned for the 36500-square-foot former Gander Outdoors store on Hall Road at the northest corner of Schoenherr.

I drew that conclusion based on visuals in the plan which show things like paneling corrugated metal sconces and slats below the signage practically identical to some Amazon Fresh stores that have popped up around the country primarily in California and Illinois.

Two days later a tipster pointed me in the direction of the old Best Buy located at 2651 S. Rochester Road in the Hampton Village Centre south of downtown Rochester.

Lo and behold on Friday afternoon I received construction drawings — which only identify a 40600-square-foot grocery store going into the space — through a Freedom of Information Act request that appear to show a store very similar to the one planned for Shelby Township.

The parking lots for the stores both have similar features as well including 10 dedicated pickup parking spots and a pair of electric vehicle parking spots.

(KAIT) - The Mall at Turtle Creek was one of the most visibly damaged buildings when the March 28 2020 tornado tore through Jonesboro and one year later the damage remains.

Former Best Buy employee Damon Wallace was at the mall when the tornado hit last year.

“The devastation whenever I’d be driving down Highland was definitely a big reminder of what I’d been through” said Wallace.

The mall had closed all interior shops due to the pandemic but exterior shops like Best Buy were open for business.

Codey Pate was also working at the store when the tornado came through.

“That was the only time that I was thankful for COVID because had it not been there’s no telling what would have happened” said Pate.

“I would have never in a million years imagined a tornado coming across the middle of Jonesboro” said Pate. “Let alone the place that I work at. Let alone the only day that I work.”

Both Pate and Wallace said the store was getting ready to close for the day around 30 minutes before the tornado hit.

As Wallace was leaving his manager called him back to take shelter in an interior break room.

“I remember I got about three-quarters of the way to my car when he starts yelling at me get back inside run” said Wallace.

“Next thing I know it’s just going right over the top of us and it was just insane” said Pate.

The employees and some customers were all in the break room when the tornado hit.

“Outside of that room we were in an entire wall had collapsed and most of the ceiling down with it” said Wallace. “We didn’t hear the wall collapsing we heard wind.”

The tornado moved from the mall in a matter of minutes leaving a path of destruction.

From Dillard’s to Target damage to the building was visible.

“It was a building and then it wasn’t. It was just rubble” said Pate.

Most of the roof in the center of the mall was torn off doors and windows visibly busted and storefronts heavily damaged.

“We were expecting to see some damage but we were not expecting to go out and see that the store was gone” said Wallace.

Thankfully nobody was killed during the storm.

“I remember my first thought being something like how is everyone okay” said Wallace.

Wallace and Pate said employees waited around 10 minutes before leaving the break room.

They walked around the most heavily damaged parts of the building leaving through the Best Buy warehouse.

“I can literally still see the layout. I can see how everything was and to come out to just beams being on the ground and water flooding out and different areas of the place just being in absolute chaos it was just I was speechless” said Pate.

First responders were on the scene in a matter of minutes assessing damage and making sure mall employees were safe.

The effects of living through the tornado still linger for Pate and Wallace.

“I literally remember it like it was yesterday and to think that it’s already been a year it just blows my mind” said Pate. “I had no words at first because that was a place I worked for three years.”

Pate said he’s now found a new job but the changes in the last year have not been easy to overcome.

“I’m slowly but surely accepting the change and that’s my recommendation to everybody is accept it slowly but surely” said Pate. “For me it was I’m alive and I’m breathing and that’s all that matters to me.”

Wallace said one year later he’s still struggling to find employment but he’s optimistic.

“I think if you sat through a tornado destroying your workplace and the worst thing that happened that day is you lost your job I think I got out pretty okay” said Wallace.

The toll of living through a major storm still plays a part in Wallace’s life.

“It was definitely a bit taxing on my mental health. Tornadoes now feature a lot more in my nightmares” said Wallace.

Target Dillard’s and JC Penneys have all reopened since the tornado but the Mall at Turtle Creek didn’t start demolition on the middle of the mall until March 15 2021.

Region 8 News reached out to the general manager Rick Jackson multiple times to see if he would talk about the progress with no response.

Jonesboro Mayor Harold Copenhaver told Region 8 News the city is making sure the mall communicates with them.

“Not only is it an eyesore it’s a danger to our community but also it impedes our ability for economic development and jobs” said Copenhaver.

Copenhaver came into office after the tornado hit and at the time little progress had been made.

One of his first acts as mayor was to issue a 30-day notice ordering cleanup to begin.

“That’s the frustrating part it’s all about having communication. And we should have had open communication way before then” said Copenhaver.

Copenhaver said the current phase of demolition will clean from the center of the mall out.

“They’re looking at hopefully completing this by mid-June or first part of July” said Copenhaver. “We can get in operation from the west side which would be the Target side past the food court.”

The next phase focuses on damage from the food court down to Dillard’s.

“Their decision would have to be to destroy that or rebuild that” said Copenhaver.

Copenhaver did a walk-through of the mall before demolition began in March.

He said the internal structure is sound minus water damage and missing drywall.

“We have already had some of our departments engineering in there as well and they agreed so mainly it’s just a roof structure damage” said Copenhaver.

Copenhaver said he hopes to see the mall completely rebuilt and the city will provide the mall with whatever services they need to get back in operation as soon as possible.

“This is what we need to do we would like it back at full operation of what it was because of the services it provided” said Copenhaver.

Both Pate and Wallace say they’re excited about the possibilities rebuilding the mall could provide.

“Even though we did have something what will we have in the future? And I think Jonesboro’s growing beyond what I ever thought it would be” said Pate.

“I’m a bit hopeful of the opportunity that the new buildings that will come in their place will bring” said Wallace. “It might have kept us down for a bit but it is something that we can build from.”

You can find a list of stores in the mall that have moved locations announced they will rebuild or announced they will close by clicking here.

Region 8 News will continue trying to get updates from the Mall at Turtle Creek and give updates as that information is available.

If you're wondering which one you should buy we don't blame you. The Surface Pro 7+ was released after the Pro 7 and is undeniably an upgrade. But there is a catch: it is only being sold to business users through IT sites like CDW Staples Advantage and Verizon. That might turn the everyday consumer off and make them consider getting the aging Surface Pro 7 at their local Best Buy or on Amazon.

While it's already a year old the Surface Pro 7 remains a good option if you need a portable tablet that can be used as a laptop. Better yet unlike the Surface Pro 7+ the consumer model can be found at a heavy discount at various retailers. So do you go with value or raw performance? We're going to break down the similarities and differences between these tablets then help you decide which one to buy.

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Similarities

This won't be a typical face-off where we go through each round looking at how the two systems fare against each other. That's because the Surface Pro 7+ and Surface Pro 7 share many features and components.

So before we go through the differences let's talk about the similarities between these tablets. First the Surface Pro 7+ and Surface Pro 7 use the same accessories: the Type Cover keyboard and Surface Pen stylus. These aren't included with the purchase of either unit (you can however find Surface Pro 7 bundles) so put aside about $200 if you intend on buying both accessories.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The designs of these tablets are almost identical; we'll spotlight the few differences between them below -- just know that the Surface Pro 7+ isn't much of a redesign. These Surface models also have the same front and rear-camera setup and dual speakers. They even share the same ports (USB-C Surface Connect USB Type-A headphone jack) though the Surface Pro 7+ has a SIM card slot for 4G LTE .

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Value

Having been on the market for more than a year the Surface Pro 7 has enjoyed considerable price drops and deals. As I write this the Surface Pro 7 with an Intel Core i5 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD costs $699 or $200 below its retail price. Opting for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $899 or $300 off the list price.

Still the Surface Pro 7 can get pretty expensive. The tablet costs $1299 (originally $1499) when configured with a Core i7 CPU 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Pushing the storage up to a 512GB SSD brings the price to $1699.

You won't find much in the way of deals for the Surface Pro 7+. Whereas the Surface Pro 7 is sold at well-known retailers like Amazon Best Buy and B&H Photo Video the Surface Pro 7+ can be purchased directly through Microsoft or at IT stores like CDW Connection or Staples Advantage.

The base Surface Pro 7+ costs $899 and comes with an Intel Core i3 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. We recommend spending at least another $100 on the Core i5 model (adding LTE costs another $150).

The Wi-Fi version of the Surface Pro 7+ with a Core i5 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD costs $1299 or $400 more than the equivalent Surface Pro 7. You will need to spend $1599 to get a Core i7 CPU 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Again this is $300 more than the consumer version. Upgrading to a 512GB SSD raises the price to $1999.

Winner: Surface Pro 7

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Design

These two tablets look identical from afar. Get close and you'll spot minor differences that give the Surface Pro 7+ an edge. The newer tablet has a door under the kickstand for accessing the SSD .

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

You can easily swap the storage drive out using a SIM tool (those little needles that come with your smartphone). Speaking of SIM tools the Surface Pro 7+ also has a SIM slot because it supports 4G LTE whereas the Surface Pro 7 relies on a Wi-Fi connection.

That's it. Those are the only exterior differences between the Surface Pro 7 and Pro 7+. They're both slim lightweight magnesium tablets with a flexible kickstand and a connection for the optional Type Cover keyboard attachment. The chunky bezels on the Surface Pro 7+ are no thinner than they are on the Pro 7 so let's hope the upcoming Surface Pro 8 gets a visual refresh.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Display

There isn't much to say here. The Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 7+ both have 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824-pixel touchscreen displays . Based on our testing Microsoft is using similar panels on these systems.

That's a good thing because the screens are bright vivid and detailed. They're as good for watching movies and TV shows as they are for crunching numbers so you'll be happy using these slates for business and leisure alike.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Our testing spotted a few differences between the screens. Covering 75.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamut the Surface Pro 7+ is more vivid than the Surface Pro 7 (68.7%). Conversely the Surface Pro 7+'s display reached a maximum average of 358 nits of brightness making it dimmer than the Surface Pro 7 (395 nits).

It's possible Microsoft is using the same panels and that these differences are within the margin of error to account for any manufacturing variances. Whatever the case you're getting a really nice display regardless of which tablet you choose.

Winner: Draw

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Performance

The biggest difference between the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 7+ is the engine powering these tablets. The Surface Pro 7+ uses upgraded 11th Gen (Tiger Lake) Intel Core CPUs that deliver faster speeds than the 10th Gen chips in the Surface Pro 7.

Scoring a 4825 on the Geekbench 5.3 overall performance test the Surface Pro 7+ topped the Surface Pro 7 (4443) by around 8.5%. Both tablets beat the premium laptop average (4160) so you can expect zippy speeds from whichever tablet you're using.

(Image credit: Future)

In our real-world test the Surface Pro 7+ needed 23 minutes and 41 seconds to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution using the Handbrake app. That is a full 10 minutes faster than the Surface Pro 7 (32:47).

The 256GB SSD in our Surface Pro 7+ unit is sluggish compared with other products in this price range. That said it topped the Surface Pro 7. The Pro 7+'s storage drive took 1 minute and 17 seconds to convert a 25GB file equating to a 348.3 megabytes per second transfer rate. The Surface Pro 7's 256GB SSD puttered at a lowly 267.9 MBps. Both are far slower than the 606.1 average for premium laptops.

With integrated Iris Xe graphics  the Pro 7+ will be fine for basic 3D modeling or to run older games. It gets a nice boost over the Iris Plus graphics in the Surface Pro 7 but as we found in our testing neither tablet is meant for running graphics-demanding apps.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Battery life

Another area where the Surface Pro 7+ topples its consumer sibling is battery life . We were relieved to see some improvements considering the Surface Pro 7 struggled on our endurance test lasting only 7 hours and 30 minutes.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The Surface Pro 7+ does better powering down after 8 hours 49 minutes but that is still less than what we expect from a modern premium device and it's considerably worse than the 10 hour and 5-minute category average.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Which is best?

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The Surface Pro 7+ is the better of these two tablets but that doesn't mean we would recommend it. Price should be a major factor in deciding between these two slates. As it stands the Surface Pro 7 is up to $400 cheaper than a Surface Pro 7+ with comparable specs. Unless you absolutely need a swappable SSD or 4G LTE connectivity we recommend saving some money and going with the Surface Pro 7.

Yes the Surface Pro 7+ brings faster performance but you probably won't notice much of a speed boost in your day-to-day workflow. And while the business-oriented tablet has longer battery life the extra hour or so of runtime isn't worth the added cost in our book. If money isn't a factor and you're deciding between these two go with the Surface Pro 7+ for various albeit minor advantages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2RldHJvaXQvbmV3cy8yMDIxLWJlc3QtcGxhY2VzLXRvLWJ1eS1hLWhvdXNlLWluLW1ldHJvLWRldHJvaXQv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2RldHJvaXQvbmV3cy8yMDIxLWJlc3QtcGxhY2VzLXRvLWJ1eS1hLWhvdXNlLWluLW1ldHJvLWRldHJvaXQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Best Places To Buy A House In Metro Detroit,"(CBS Detroit) — Niche's 2021 Best Places to Live rankings live with several Michigan cities making it onto the lists.

The Herald-Mail

The chef at the newly opened Kimpton Cottonwood Hotel faced a pressing question.

Could the Reuben sandwich go home again?

The Reuben was born at the Blackstone Hotel on the very ground Chef Ryan Arensdorf’s kitchen now occupies or so Omahans believe. (Misguided New Yorkers claim it too.)

When developers revived the Blackstone as the Cottonwood last year they embraced elements of the historic hotel’s past. The Reuben was one of them and Arensdorf wanted his version to steal the spotlight from similar sandwiches at restaurants across town.

“It was basically mandatory that we take this sandwich seriously and try to put out the best Reuben that we can” he said.

By most accounts so far he got it right. The Reuben is the bestselling dish at the Cottonwood Arensdorf said and diners have given it rave reviews.

“It was amazing” Omahan Rachele Smith said. “We took a Sunday school party with us and they all thought it was among the best in Omaha.”

Arensdorf had help with the Reuben’s renaissance at the hotel from an inside source: Jay Kulakofsky the great-great-great nephew of the sandwich’s creator.

In the 1920s or ‘30s Kulakofsky’s Uncle Reuben regularly played late-night poker with a group of men in the Fern Room at the Blackstone. They always had food with meat and bread provided by Bernard Schimmel son of hotel owner Charles Schimmel.

Kulakofsky came up with a sandwich made of corned beef Swiss cheese sauerkraut Thousand Island dressing and rye bread. The younger Schimmel executed Kulakofsky’s idea and when it was a hit with the poker group he wrote it down to make it again.

The elder Schimmel was so impressed that he put it on the hotel menu (“Reuben Sandwich 40 cents” a 1934 entry said).

Twirl this on your fork: Takeout Tuesday turns to spaghetti

Decades later Arensdorf met Jay Kulakofsky when both worked at a Virginia resort and they became friends.

Jay is a graduate of Burke High School and Northwestern University who works on the service side of the food and beverage industry.

He said he’s known about his Reuben legacy since childhood.

“I remember seeing a story on the local news about the Reuben and my mom told me (about the connection) at the time” he said.

Kulakofsky shared the sandwich’s history with Arensdorf and when he saw the Cottonwood job listing he encouraged his chef friend to apply.

“I talked about the specific type of Swiss cheese the mixing of the drained kraut with the dressing the type of bread etc. and how it connected to the Blackstone Hotel” he said.

Arensdorf took note then set out to make a customized version for the Cottonwood.

“Everything is made from scratch” he said. “We use prime brisket that’s brined for nine to 10 days and cooked overnight. We make the sauerkraut in-house.”

The Thousand Island dressing is also house-made “from a very powerful recipe” Arensdorf said and high-end Gruyere cheese replaces the Swiss.

The result the chef said is an extremely rich sandwich that contains up to eight ounces of meat. So he added house-made mustard to add acidity.

Chocolat Abeille is moving from Omaha's Old Market to Bellevue

Interest in Reuben sandwiches has never waned in Omaha. Up to 50 restaurants serve them and there’s even a fairly new business that focuses solely on making Reubens for home delivery.

Smith the diner who praised the Cottonwood’s version said she has had Reubens all over town. Those at Crescent Moon which won The World-Herald’s Food Prowl in 2012 and Barrett’s Barleycorn Pub and Grill are among her favorites.

The Cottonwood Reuben has a complexity that others lack and the restaurant has atmosphere she said.

“Having it where it was invented with the whole vibe” makes it an experience she said. “As soon as you step into the hotel you feel like you are in a whole different era.”

As more reviews roll in Reuben purists will probably have something to say about Arensdorf’s approach.

“The menu leads me to believe that it won’t be right” one person messaged when we solicited feedback on social media from those who have tried the Cottonwood sandwich. “What — mustard?”

But the chef stands behind his work.

“There are always improvements you can make” he said “ (but) when we were taking pictures (for this story) I looked at it and said ‘You can’t tell me that’s not the best in Omaha.’ “

World-Famous or Legendary Muskie “Hotspots” – Part VII

by Larry Ramsell Muskellunge Historian

Where will the next World Record muskie come from? My good friend and fellow author Bill Hamblin (Billy and I co-wrote a five-year series of “Musky Hunter’s Almanacs” from 1996 thru 2000) believes it will come from Georgian Bay where he guided for several years. When I started writing this series on muskie “Hotspots” I reached out to him for multiple reasons least of which is his vast knowledge of Georgian Bay and the Legendary “Hotspots” he knows and has fished. These facts were borne out to me once again as I re-read his recently published (2015) GREAT book on fishing the Bay and one man’s story of spending “120 Days” of a single season chasing a record muskie there. The cover of his book is a photograph of a point of land in “Blackstone Harbour” (Canadian spelling)so we will have a look there. According to Bill “The photo features the point off of which Ken O’Brien caught his Canadian record 65-pound musky. It’s as famous a spot as there is on Georgian Bay.”

That to me makes “Blackstone Harbour” a must to be included in this series of World-Famous or Legendary Muskie “Hotspots”!

Blackstone Harbour

When I first wrote about the Moon River in the book “120 Days” I called it the Bays “Grand Buffet” – more because of its geological offerings and the multitude of opportunities it presents for either casters or trollers. Blackstone Harbour is connected to the Bay and the Moon River system by a man-made blasted channel. It’s a microcosm of that famous buffet. Blackstone has something for everyone sandy shoreline steep breaking rock shoreline rocky points large weed and rock covered flats rocky shoals a fast water inlet beautiful green cabbage deep water and oh yes – the magic alchemy of Georgian Bay genetics.

The Harbour so named for the protection it offers boaters from the bay rather than the actual existence of a physical harbour doesn’t have the storied past of say Coleman’s Reef on Eagle Lake Pete’s Bar on the Chippewa flowage or Wisconsin’s iconic Lac Vieux Desert but what it does have is consistent tales of giant fish. How can you go wrong! And Ken Obrien started it all for Blackstone Harbour on a cold morning October 16 1988.

As John Power the Toronto Stars musky enthused outdoor writer would pen in his column 3 days after witnessing

Ken O’Brien and friend – courtesy John Power.

the aftermath “The 28 year-year-old Toronto accountant rewrote the record book and debunked a heap of musky fishing theories with a mind boggling 65-pound lunge which unseated the Canadian Mark of 61 pounds nine ounces taken in Eagle Lake back in 1940.”

We’ll pause here from Bill’s dissertation and review the story of O’Brien’s record catch that I put together in 1988:

Toronto Ontario angler Ken O’Brien was fishing for “Whatever would bite” as he told me in a telephone interview. His catch made immediate international news and was covered in dozens of newspapers in the US and Canada and his catch story was written about by me in Fishing Facts magazine in the January 1989 issue as well as in Ontario Out of Doors magazine in the February 1989 issue by O’Brien with John Power. I had after getting the details of the catch from Ken on the telephone made a trip to Mac Tier and Toronto Ontario thereafter and viewed the frozen fish and obtained more information from one of his fishing partners.

On October 16 1988 Ken O’Brien pulled a modern-day giant from Blackstone Harbour of the Moon River in Ontario. For a brief time this muskie was recognized as the Internal Game Fish Association (IGFA) All-Tackle World Record after the Lawton record was set aside by them and before John Dettloff convinced the IGFA to replace it with the Cal Johnson

Hayward fish even though it had never undergone world record scrutiny. As of 2007 O’Brien’s fish is the IGFA 12-pound test line class record. It is also the 12-pound test line class record as well as the “Heaviest” muskellunge in the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame (NFWFHF) Muskie Power Trolling Subdivision.

When word of the O’Brien muskie spread it made sensational news all over North America and dozens of newspaper and magazine articles were written. I wrote an article about it for Fishing Facts magazine in the January 1989 issue entitled Mammoth Musky. Since my information was first-hand I shall refer to that article for the information that follows.

“Muskie anglers rejoice! There may still be a chance to catch a new world record Muskie! On October 16 1988 muskie history was made as a 65-pound monster was pulled from the Moon River basin of Ontario’s Georgian Bay by Toronto angler Ken O’Brien.

…”This is only the third verified 60+-pounder ever caught from Ontario waters…The monster fish is also a new Ontario and Canadian record.

…”As is always the case truly BIG muskies are females. This 65-pound behemoth was aged at about 29 years using the cleithrum method (the boomerang shaped “collar bone” at the back of the head under the gill plate) at the Royal Ontario Museum. This most accurate of aging processes was developed by Dr. John Casselman of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources).

“Toronto accountant Ken O’Brien and his fishing partners Mark Airstone and Rob Yamamoto plied the waters of the Moon on Saturday and came away empty. On Sunday they were “fishing for anything” in “Blackstone Harbour” and at 11:30 a.m. the 65-pounder was landed. Ken was trolling a 4 1/8th-inch long countdown Rapala on a 4-inch wire leader tied to 8-pound test Trilene line. Four split shot were clamped on the line just above the leader. Some fish attractant had also been put on the lure. Ken related that he had considerable fishing experience on other parts of Georgian Bay but was fairly inexperienced on the Moon. He said he figured his lure was running “about 15 to 20 feet down.” When I asked him what depth water he was fishing he said he didn’t know since he didn’t have a depth finder.

“Upon hooking the goliath muskie O’Brien thought he was snagged on the bottom until the “bottom” started to move. After 15 minutes of battling the unseen lunker it finally surfaced. O’Brien still wasn’t sure about what the near 5-foot fish was because he had never before seen a live muskie. I asked him about his trolling speed and he said “I was going slow. In fact all the other boats were passing me by (Muskies Canada was having a Derby and 25 boats of die-hard muskie hunters were also on the Moon).” At any rate the battle with the 65-pounder took about 25 minutes apparently without much trouble. Ken was fortunate that one of his fishing partners had a gaff along (even if it was a light 3-piece screw-together type) which they used to land the fish. Rob first missed the fish with the gaff then Mark gaffed it and had a heck of a time pulling it in despite being a weightlifter.

“The big “old” gal was probably reaching the end of her life span. I was told that she had only 2 of her big teeth left. Approximately 400 people gathered to see the MAMMOTH history-making fish when it was brought in….”

We’ll now return to Mr. Hamblin’s write-up:

Since that day musky hunters consumed with the prospect of catching the next world record and losing sleep over past failed prospects have stealthily launched their boats in Blackstone Harbour in search of the next world record. Noted



Gary Ishii Moon River – 55-pounds – 1981 Photo courtesy Gary Finkler

Moon River fisherman Gary Finkler (He guided his cousin to a monster 55-pounder at the Moon River 10 years earlier) may have come close in “Blackstone Harbour”. In 1991 Gary was casting his favorite 10 inch Suick jerk bait there when a behemoth belted his bait. Finkler said “It was mind boggling – dwarfing the 55-pounder that’s hanging at home. Almost as long as my rod which is close to six feet.” It was released! It’s encounters such as these that help perpetuate the mythology surrounding historical musky waters.

Blackstone is by no means an easy fish. John Power once wrote of it “Blackstone is a frustrating fishing hole. Your depth sounder tells you it’s chock-full of fish big and small but almost all afflicted with lock jaw.” This has been my experience more often than not. In fact my sonar often mistakes the dense clouds of bait baitfish for bottom. That said I am not without the occasional memorable moment on the fabled body of water.

Guiding on the Moon back in the ’90’s I would often reserve Blackstone for the final stop of the night. One evening I was guiding four fishermen two in my boat and two others of the group in another. I pulled up to an inconspicuous reef surrounded by deep water and waited for the others to join us. Anxious to unleash something (LOL!) they arrived under full 200hp in their Ranger not realizing they had just buzzed the daylights out of the shallow reef. Was their buddy in my boat ever pissed! But such is Blackstone. After a good 30 second tongue lashing he bent over picked up his rod and with one cast was hooked into his personal best a beautiful 50-inch sunset musky. On another occasion I was fishing with Wisconsin musky buddy Tommy Moes. Pete Maina’s Burt jerk bait had just hit the market and he gave me a couple to try out (actually he insisted). On the deepest point of the aforementioned reef I had an incredible strike within a few casts. The fish was gone in a flash! Given the slim profile hard plastic composition and excellent hooking potential of the bait I was stunned. At the very least it deserved close inspection upon its return to the boat. Sure enough imbedded in the bait were three Jurassic teeth. They had actually penetrated the baits body. Did I say something about losing sleep over failed prospects?

Top of my mind whenever I fish new musky waters is to search out its historical sections. Often it’s to live in the moment of an iconic fisherman after a life-times culmination of fishing who unbeknownst to them is about to enter a body of water into the historical archives. Case in point. After reading Larry Ramsell’s first “Compendium” and Part VI in this series I was taken with the story of Bill Tutt and his epic battle on the Turtle Flambeau-Flowage with “Big George”. Suffice to say the first time I ventured to Wisconsin to trace in depth the historical roots of musky fishing I met Bill Tutt then boated out to the Baraboo section and his personal contribution to the musky mythology.

US-based Blackstone said the portfolio it is purchasing from the railway group includes three prime assets: the 988-room Miyako Kyoto Hachijo across from Kyoto station; the 456-room Universal City adjacent to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka; and the newly built Miyako Hakata with 208 rooms next to Hakata station in Fukuoka.

“This is a unique opportunity that grants Blackstone access to a sizeable high-quality hotel portfolio in Japan’s top hospitality markets and we’re thrilled that Kintetsu has chosen to partner with us” said Christopher Heady head of real estate in Asia for the NYSE-listed firm.

The Japan deal is Blackstone’s third major hospitality acquisition to be announced this month and the third time this year that it is working with an established Japanese conglomerate to spin off assets as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain finances around the region.

Blackstone Checks into Hospitality

The sale price of the eight hotels was undisclosed however Kintetsu said in a statement that the properties had a book value of JPY 42.3 billion ($390 million) as of 31 March 2020 with the Miyako Hakata alone accounting for JPY 14.3 billion.

In addition to the three primary assets the remaining five properties Blackstone is purchasing from the railway operator are a mix of upscale hotels and resorts within the Greater Osaka and Nagoya regions with the smallest being the 30-room Miyako Kobe Kitano hotel.

The entire portfolio amounts to 2294 rooms with Kintetsu Group to continue to operate the properties under the current staff and the hotel names to remain unchanged following the transaction according to the statement.

Blackstone announced the deal as it proposes to take on a much larger hospitality package in Australia. Casino giant Crown Resorts announced early last week that the US fund manager had made a $6.2 billion offer to take over the firm.

Earlier this month the firm also teamed up with Starwood Capital to sign an agreement to purchase US hotel operator Extended Stay America for $6 billion after the suite-oriented hotel chain leveraged its popularity among temporary health care workers during the pandemic.

Japan Inc Slims Down

The Kintetsu deal marks the third instance in the last seven months of Blackstone buying Japanese assets from local conglomerates seeking to streamline their operations following acquisitions of department store operator Isetan’s residential property unit and Takeda Pharmaceutical’s consumer healthcare division.

The eight properties will be Blackstone’s first direct acquisitions of hotels in Japan although the firm formerly owned a stake in Hilton which operates hotels in the market. The Kintetsu deal is Blackstone’s second big hospitality acquisition announced this month after last week agreeing to buy hotel operator Extended Stay America for $6 billion with partner Starwood Capital Group.

Blackstone has been an active investor in the Japanese real estate market since 2010. The firm had a record 2020 in Japan with $7.3 billion in investments across real estate and private equity starting with the country’s biggest property deal ever: the buyback of a portfolio of Japanese rental apartments from Chinese insurer Anbang for JPY 300 billion.

According to local press accounts Kintetsu has seen its business performance deteriorate amid a decline in railway users over COVID concerns and the insolvency of KNT-CT Holdings a travel giant majority-owned by the group.

“Our team has established a great relationship with the Kintetsu management team over the past few months and we look forward to working closely with the experienced teams to further create value for the properties” said Daisuke Kitta Blackstone’s head of real estate in Japan.

Switching Tracks

Kintetsu isn’t the first troubled Japanese corporate to cash out of real estate assets with the help of a foreign suitor.

Late last year North American fund manager BentallGreenOak bought the Tokyo headquarters of entertainment conglomerate Avex Group for JPY 72 billion to add to a $1.6 billion opportunistic vehicle.

One element of the Avex sale may have been the group’s financial stress with the company led by impresario Max Matsuura having stated in November that it suffered a net loss of JPY 3.2 billion for the six months from April through the end of September.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mYi1yb3VuZHVwLWNyb3duLXJlc29ydHMtbWFycmlvdHQtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1ncm9zdmVub3ItZXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FB Roundup: Crown Resorts Marriott International Grosvenor Estate,"James Packer’s Crown Resorts considers $6.2 billion Blackstone bid

Crown Resorts Australia’s largest casino operator and majority owned by billionaire heir James Packer is mulling an acquisition offer of $6.2 billion from US private equity giant Blackstone.

The Melbourne-based Crown confirmed this week it received an unsolicited non-binding and indicative proposal to acquire all its shares at an indicative price of A$11.85 ($9.04) per share. Blackstone already held a 9.99% stake in Crown which it acquired from Melco Resorts and Entertainment for $8.15 per share in April 2020.

The New York-based group with $619 billion worth of assets under management bought the Bellagio casino resort in Las Vegas (pictured) for $4.25 billion in 2019. In January 2020 Blackstone entered a $4.6 billion joint venture to bring into its fold two additional MGM Resorts International properties on the Strip MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

The non-family Crown board said it had “not yet formed a view on the merits of the proposal”. The four directors were starting their assessment with the involvement of stakeholders regulators and legal and financial advisers. The board said it did not need to take any action regarding the bid and there was no certainty a deal would be made. Share prices rocketed 21% on the day of Crown’s Blackstone announcement.

James Packer (pictured above) 53 is the largest shareholder at 36% in Crown but stepped down for its board and resigned from the board of his family company Consolidated Press Holdings in 2018 to recover from mental health issues. Packer reportedly indicated this week he will follow the Crown board’s decision on the Blackstone proposal.

Packer is worth $3.5 billion according to Forbes. With his elder sister investor and philanthropist Gretel Packer 55 he is the only son of the late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer (pictured left). He is the grandson of the late Sir Frank Packer (pictured below) who founded Australian Consolidated Press in 1936 long since absorbed by other media companies.

James Packer may welcome a lucrative exit from Crown Resorts. Australian regulators ruled in February the operator was not fit to hold a gaming licence in Sydney citing money laundering and organised crime links. Five directors resigned from the Crown board. The states of Victoria and Western Australia will open their own inquiries into Crown in the coming months.

Due to Australia’s Covid-19 restrictions in March 2020 Crown was directed to close for an extended period its gaming activities and a significant part of its non-gaming operations at its integrated Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth resorts for the first time in the company’s history. The temporary closures were reflected in its dire 2020 finances with an 80% plunge in net profits to $79.5 million ($60.6 million) from a profit of A$401.8 million ($306.4 million) a year earlier.

In addition to its Melbourne and Perth resorts Crown developments include the Crown Sydney Hotel Resort and the One Queensbridge site in Melbourne. Crown owns and operates Crown Aspinalls in London and holds a 50% equity interest in the UK-based casino-operating Aspers Group co-created with the multi-millionaire Aspinall family.

Crown owns a 20% interest in the restaurant and hotel chain Nobu. It has interests in digital businesses including the wholly owned Betfair Australasia an 85% stake in DGN Games and 50% stake in Chill Gaming.

Next-gen hotel heir David Marriott to succeed father Bill Marriott

US hotel heir David Marriott has been elected as a director on the board of Marriott International in anticipation of succeeding his father as chairman in 2022.

Marriott (pictured left) 47 president of the company’s US full-service hotel division is the son of JW “Bill” Marriott Jr (pictured below) 89 and grandson of late founder J Willard Marriott.

The election of Marriott and Horacio Rozanski 53 president and chief executive at consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton swelled the board’s membership to 13 nine of whom are independent.

After consultation the company announced in May 2020 that Bill Marriott planned to transition from serving as executive chairman and chairman of the board to the role of chairman emeritus in 2022. The next-gen Marriott will assume the chairmanship on an unspecified date in 2022 and would step down from his presidency at the end of April 2021.

The appointments followed the loss of Arne Sorenson (pictured right) who died of cancer in February 2021 at the age of 62. Sorenson was the first non-family member to lead the company when he became chief executive in 2012. Praised as “exceptional” by Bill Marriott Sorenson led the transformation of the family business into the largest hotel chain in the world which involved the $13 billion acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

The new team will need to continue to manage the seismic impacts of Covid-19 restrictions on the hotel business. Marriott International reported a loss of $164 million in the fourth-quarter of 2020 compared to a profit of $279 million in the same quarter in 2019.

The third-generation David Marriott youngest son of four children joined Marriott International in 1999 and worked his way up through several operational roles. As president of the company’s US full-service hotel division he was responsible for overseeing more than 330 hotels operating under 14 brands in 34 states and French Polynesia. While he worked as chief operations officer for the brand’s Americas eastern region from 2010 to 2018 he oversaw the US integration of Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

He is a trustee of the J Willard and Alice S Marriott Foundation. The family charity co-created a hospitality career development fund in Sorenson’s name.

“Like me David grew up in the hospitality business” Bill Marriott said.

“While having Marriott as his last name opened the first door for him he has proven throughout his 21 years with the company that he is a disciplined operator a thoughtful collaborator with our owners and franchisees and a passionate steward of our culture. The board will benefit from his experience and insights.”

Based in Bethesda Maryland Marriott International encompasses more than 7600 properties under 30 leading brands spanning 133 countries and territories. Marriott also operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts around the world.

Grosvenor Estate appoints new family office head in management revamp

The Duke of Westminster says the new management structure of his family’s Grosvenor Estate including a new family office head will help shape long-term success in its commercial and social activities.

The Grosvenor Estate announced the promotion of Nicholas Dobbs rural estates’ director to the role of head of the Grosvenor Family Office from 1 April reporting to Mark Preston executive trustee and chief executive of the estate. The Grosvenor Family Office is responsible for the management and enhancement of environmentally sensitive habitats within the Grosvenor family’s rural estates and for supporting their philanthropic activities through the Westminster Foundation.

Chaired by Michael McLintock a new investment committee was formed comprising Grosvenor’s trustees the newly created role of chief investment officer the estate’s chief financial officer and two independent advisers. The committee will be responsible for capital allocation as well as for strategy and performance of the estate’s commercial activities in international urban property food and agriculture and in financial investments.

Family principal Hugh Grosvenor (pictured above) 30 became the 7th Duke of Westminster upon the death of his father Gerald Grosvenor (pictured left) aged 64 in 2016.

“These changes will help us shape our long-term success building on our international growth of the past 50 years and meeting the many and varied challenges of the next 50” the billionaire millennial aristocrat said.

“I am confident we will continue to adapt and change as we have many times in the past to make a sustainable and meaningful impact on the communities we support and work alongside.”

The duke personally gave £10 million ($13.8 million) in April 2020 following an initial donation of £2.5million ($3.4 million) in March 2020 to support the United Kingdom’s health service medical research and development and charities to help the country’s long-term recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.",,,

And today it's time to talk about a dangerous flight made by World Airways to the Vietnam while all sorts of trouble was going on there.

The Vietnam War was one of the saddest conflicts during the Cold War. The country divided in two faced a conflict between the sides of the North and the South with support from the Soviet Union and the United States respectively.

After 20 years of battles thousands of civilians dead the United States withdrew from the war by signing the Paris Agreement. Between 1973 and 1975 several troops left the place however the last days were the worst since the troops from the south definitely lost the financial support of the North Americans as well as the territories.

Since then members of the South Vietnamese armed forces have run but they have run a lot. In a short time the Soviets in the north could capture them and there is nothing worse than being a prisoner of a war that is already over.

World Airways special flights

To remove all Americans from Vietnamese soil the US opted for an excellent decision however poorly executed. They hired 20 World Airways chartered flights to get everyone out of Da Nang before the onset of Soviet rule.

The situation however quickly deteriorated and only three flights were carried out and authorized leading to the general despair of those who were in the place.

Ed Daly president and owner of World Airways was unhappy with the situation. Yes it is normal to find good-hearted people in the world fortunately.

Out of his own pocket and in defiance of the authorities in Vietnam Daly authorized the departure of two Boeing 727 planes directly to Da Nang with a focus on evacuating the place.

From the unlikely idea only one plane managed to land at Da Nang International Airport and with Daly himself on board who flew to Vietnam to mediate the situation.

This all happened on March 29 1975.

When the Boeing 727 arrived at the airport there was not even time to refuel. The crew knew that there would be no external infrastructure to serve the “clandestine” plane and they concentrated operations on the back stairs to board the women and children.

Did not work!

The fastest boarding in history

The crowd that was waiting for the last flights at Da Nang Airport quickly occupied the surroundings of the aircraft. The photo below represents well the chaos of number of people against the size of the plane.

A generalized rush took place on the ground due to a threat of invasion by enemy troops and 268 people boarded the aircraft something totally against the recommendations of the commander who should have been concerned with the safety limits of the plane.

Even knowing that in addition to transporting 100 more people in the cabin compared to the maximum capacity of the 727 they still had 60 more in the cargo hold the pilots soon commanded the start of the engines to get out of the situation that was only getting worse by the minute.

The same problem on the Boeing 727 started when the engines were revved (on ground they were not turned off) and the back door closed by Daly himself.

A mess started on the ground and the pilot quickly advanced from the apron to the local taxiway initiating an immediate takeoff since there was no chance of reaching the landing and takeoff runway blocked by the locals in this short stay on the ground.

At this time the plane was chased by military personnel in jeeps and pickup trucks as it taxied.

Do you remember that this plane was taking military personnel and their families mainly women and children from the place?

The military themselves began to attack the plane which overloaded was accelerating slowly to take off from the place. Simultaneously several people tried to enter the plane through the baggage holds and forcing the rear door to enter the aircraft.

In addition to the more than 330 people on board the Boeing 727 still took a burst of gunfire and a grenade exploded near its left wing which was damaged. The plane had several holes along the fuselage and even the pipes carrying fuel were out of order.

As Healy the flight commander continued his takeoff run he realized that he would have to go around a vehicle that was parked on the taxiway in front of him. A quick detour touching the grass and he was back on the runway but the plane didn't want to take off.

In the last few meters of the runway the Boeing 727 gained speed and took off but the situation was still tense. Healy decided to limit the flight to 10000 feet speed was also limited and a basic calculation was performed by the Flight Engineer to determine if the plane could proceed to Saigon on a flight that was supposed to last 50 minutes.

Even with overweight and damage to the flaps ailerons fuel lines and external surfaces without retracting the landing gear the Boeing 727 could withstand a flight to Saigon which lasted twice as long as well as the fuel consumption on this unusual flight. .

On all planes there is a speed limit for flights without the landing gear retracted.

Some people tried to get on the plane at all costs even on the wing. For this reason many unfortunately died during the take-off run or later in the first seconds of flight.

This is not a short story there are actually real scenes of all this madness. Check below:

Later the same company sent a DC-8 Cargo to rescue 57 orphans this time making a flight that still faced problems.

The US itself decided to control the serious situation and a few days after the DC-8 sent a ship to pick up the refugees mainly the workers of the US embassy in the place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2ZsMzYwYWVyby5jb20vZGV0YWlsL2JvZWluZy03Nzd4LXByb2dyYW0tZGVsYXktcGlsZWQtdXAtbWFueS1zaGFyay1maW5uZWQtd2hpdGUtdGFpbHMtcGFya2VkLW9uZS1hZnRlci1hbm90aGVyLWF0LWtwYWUtcGFpbmUtZmllbGQvNDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing 777X program delay piled up many Shark finned white tails parked one after another at KPAE - Paine Field.,"As Boeing 777X program is being delayed further due to Covid19 pandemic Travel market slump & lack of Long haul international flights

But Trump’s prized possession is far from touching the skies. Judging from a photo by CNN it’s in dire need of maintenance. One of its engines is shrink-wrapped and the other has been removed for repairs – which even by generous estimates should cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The national brand of healthy dining restaurants has announced the Reston location will open on April 28.

The new restaurant has been under construction for more than a year in the spot of a former steakhouse. There was a pause in construction for part of 2020 that was likely influenced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The True Food brand was founded by Dr. Andrew Weil a proponent of healthy eating with a focus on greens vegetables fruits and proteins that help fight chronic inflammation. Many of the dishes are gluten-free as well as vegetarian or vegan. Some of the menu items include Edamame Dumplings Grilled Chicken and Mozzarella Panini a Roasted Squash & Ricotta Panini and Grilled Sustainable Salmon.

Usually not but that hasn’t stopped them from trying,"A Globe sampling of leases from around the state found that a growing number of landlords are revising the annual contracts to replace generic anti-drug provisions with new restrictions on cannabis — and not just on smoking it. Some leases also contained legally dubious sections seeking to bar consumption of marijuana edibles on the premises or possessing any form of the drug often under the threat of immediate eviction for a single violation.

Five years after Massachusetts voters legalized marijuana the state’s apartment renters are increasingly being pressured to give up their ability to use or even possess the drug in their own homes.

Attorneys said such language almost certainly violates Massachusetts law which permits landlords to ban the smoking of tobacco and marijuana but explicitly says they may not otherwise restrict tenants from possessing cannabis and using its other forms.

The only exception is when failing to ban cannabis from the premises would cause the landlord to run afoul of federal regulations a scenario that primarily applies to public housing and university dorms that receive federal funding.

“The statute couldn’t be more clear” said Jim Smith a former state representative and Boston cannabis attorney. “To say you’d be immediately evicted for having an edible is just totally bogus. A court would be very very open to the tenant’s side of that argument.”

Most tenants are not aware of their rights however and usually have little to no leverage in lease negotiations. One medical marijuana patient seeking housing said more than a dozen Massachusetts rental agents simply stopped responding when he asked if the landlords they represented might accommodate his consumption.

Officials in the office of Attorney General Maura Healey meanwhile said they have never enforced the protections because renters rarely if ever complain.

As a result anti-marijuana lease provisions appear to be proliferating. And while most tenants simply ignore the rules and try to be discreet others described living in constant fear of eviction or adopting elaborate consumption routines to avoid detection. Several medical marijuana patients even said restrictive lease provisions prompted them to resume using pharmaceutical drugs they had previously replaced with cannabis despite suffering side effects.

Critics say the lease provisions whether or not they are ultimately enforceable amount to a form of intimidation by landlords. And along with the state’s prohibition on public consumption they can essentially leave Massachusetts tenants with no legal place to use a legal substance.

“I felt so unwelcome and out of place” said 24-year-old Zach Williams describing his recent tenancy at a large professionally managed apartment complex in Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood that bans marijuana smoking and vaping. “A lot of the time I would walk out to my [parked] car on the street and smoke in there which I know you’re not supposed to do but what choice did I have? I sat in the back seat so the cops wouldn’t think I was driving if they saw me.”

While a number of leases reviewed by the Globe contained only lawful restrictions on marijuana smoking others appeared to go much further.

One especially zealous Brighton landlord specified in an anti-pot lease addendum running several pages that residents and guests were barred from “inhaling exhaling breathing chewing carrying” or “injecting” marijuana an unheard-of practice. Claiming his triple-decker and the surrounding property had “been designated as a marijuana-free living environment” the landlord recently required two prospective residents to agree they would never possess any form of the drug there and pay $500 a day for any violations of the zero-tolerance policy plus any legal expenses he incurs in evicting them.

“We thought we found this holy grail of an apartment and were super excited until we saw that [addendum]” said one of the prospective tenants a medical marijuana patient who asked that her identity be withheld because she fears retaliation from her landlord. “Then it was just this sinking feeling of ‘Is this worth it or are we digging ourselves into an awful hole where we can’t feel comfortable in our own home?’ ”

The pair ultimately signed the contract figuring that objecting to it would only tip off the landlord and gambling that in practice he wouldn’t evict them for a single violation — the same calculus described by a number of renters who spoke with the Globe. Still the experience was “jarring” the patient said.

“I understand why landlords want to protect themselves but this is swinging too far in the other direction” she argued. “We’re great tenants with good jobs. We’re very mindful of not making the building stink of weed. Our past landlords always loved us. Yet here we are sneaking around like criminals.”

Doug Quattrochi the head of the MassLandlords association said most landlords whose leases restrict marijuana are simply trying to prevent annoying odors and damage from smoke or mold (which can occur in humid rooms used to grow cannabis). But he acknowledged leases banning edibles and cannabis possession were likely unlawful and said he strongly doubted claims by some landlords that they could be disqualified from receiving pandemic-related federal rental assistance if they did not completely ban marijuana.

“Those concerns may be a little far-fetched” Quattrochi said. “A lot of landlords … have gone full knee-jerk: No smoking no vaping no edibles no nothing. ... I’m sympathetic to folks who just want to consume weed in their own homes.”

Boston resident Patrick Walsh said the landlord of the Mission Hill apartment where he has lived for three years recently revised the lease to ban smoking not only indoors but also outdoors on the property. That has left him wondering where exactly he is supposed to use marijuana.

“It’s absurd” said Walsh 29. “How can the state legalize [marijuana] but you’re not allowed to use it anywhere?”

Quattrochi called on state lawmakers to provide renters with more legal places to consume cannabis perhaps including in public parks. A bill that would authorize ventilated marijuana consumption lounges is pending on Beacon Hill.

While state law is relatively clear on which marijuana restrictions landlords can and cannot impose the status of state-registered medical marijuana patients remains murky. A lawsuit brought in 2019 by an Agawam couple facing eviction over their medical cannabis use ended inconclusively when they moved out.

A 2018 decision by the Supreme Judicial Court could offer some protection for patients however. Justices ruled that Massachusetts employers could not summarily fire workers with medical marijuana cards just because they flunked a drug test and were instead obligated by disability law to negotiate possible accommodations in good faith.

Smith and other attorneys said the same principle could hypothetically be extended to landlords as well though doing so would likely necessitate prolonged litigation an impossibility for the average renter with a disability.

“Cannabis is not being treated as it should be here” Smith said. “It’s not like landlords complain if you bring home a case of scotch and drink all night. There’s really a stubborn stigma.”

The FDA endorsed Abecma—formerly known as idecabtagene vicleucel or ide-cel—to treat adults whose multiple myeloma has progressed after at least four previous rounds of treatment. It's the first CAR-T med approved in multiple myeloma and the first CAR-T in the B-cell maturation antigen-targeted (BCMA) class.

Friday’s approval was based on a phase 2 trial called KarMMa which showed the drug triggered a response in nearly three-quarters of patients with heavily pre-treated and highly refractory multiple myeloma. The study tested the CAR-T drug in 128 patients.

The therapy hit a snag on its way to market though. The FDA turned back ide-cel on manufacturing problems last year. BMS and bluebird made their way back to the FDA last year and the agency granted a priority review.

CAR-T meds are created using a patient’s own T cells which are extracted genetically modified and then infused back into patients to help the body kill a disease.

RELATED: Bristol Myers Squibb in hot water after FDA rebuffs CAR-T therapy on manufacturing concerns

Abecma’s approval was one requirement for a multibillion-dollar contingent value right associated with BMS’ Celgene buyout but setbacks on Breyanzi caused the payout to fall through.

The nod follows Breyanzi’s FDA approval last month to treat certain patients with large B-cell lymphoma who haven’t responded to two other systemic treatments or who have relapsed after receiving those treatments. But while there are now three licensed CAR-T lymphoma drugs BMS’ Abecma is the only such drug in multiple myeloma.

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

Need for Chips Sales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Automotives Computing Revenue $500B Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Note: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February. Figures for Samsung include its System LSI unit; for Globalfoundries include the manufacturing unit acquired from IBM; for PSMC its foundry business only. Source: TrendForce

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Residents who live near the intersection and by Grafton Street posted to Reddit Tuesday afternoon that their tap water had turned brown with some asking whether the water was safe to drink.

Thomas Matthews a spokesman for Worcester City Manager Eric Batista told MassLive the reason for the brown water was a 16-inch water main break at 725 Grafton St. that happened at 2 a.m. Tuesday. According to Matthews the water main break resulted in some nearby residents having rusty water giving it a brown color.

“Residents are advised that the water is not harmful and encouraged to run their cold water in a tub for about 10 minutes to help clear it up as crews work to make a repair” Matthews said.

The water main break closed both sides of Grafton Street at Valmor Street according to the Worcester Police Department. In a post on X the department advised drivers to find another route.

Matthews told MassLive that the pipe had been turned off since it was broken and repairs to the main were underway as of Tuesday afternoon.

According to a document created by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection the main reason for tap water having a brown yellow orange or red color is because of rust.

“Rusty water occurs from sediment in the pipes or rust from the inside walls of the water mains” the document reads. “The rust can be disturbed and temporarily suspended in water with unusual water flows from water main breaks or maintenance or by flushing of a hydrant.”

Even though the color of the water may look different the MassDEP states that having rusty water is not dangerous to drink compared to water filled with bacteria or lead.

Water main breaks in Worcester have happened before. On Feb. 4 2023 water from a broken pipe flooded into an apartment building on 425 Pleasant St. The owner of the apartment the Worcester Housing Authority said the flooding resulted in “catastrophic damage to the building’s electrical fire alarm and sprinkler systems.” Nearly 250 residents were evacuated from the building and found shelter in hotels during the three-month repair process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3VzLW5ld3MvdGVlbi1zaG90LWRlYWQtYnktYmlrZS1yaWRpbmctZ3VubWFuLWluLXNvaG8taXMtaWRkLWFzLWJyb29rbHluLXN0dWRlbnQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMtbmV3cy90ZWVuLXNob3QtZGVhZC1ieS1iaWtlLXJpZGluZy1ndW5tYW4taW4tc29oby1pcy1pZGQtYXMtYnJvb2tseW4tc3R1ZGVudC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen fatally shot by bike-riding gunman in Soho ID'd as Brooklyn student,"A teenager who was gunned down outside a swanky Soho hotel was an avid basketballer who played in a league run by an anti-gun violence group loved ones said Wednesday.

Mahki Brown 16 of Crown Heights Brooklyn died after being shot in the head by a Citi Bike-riding gunman opposite the Dominick Hotel on Spring Street in a brazen broad daylight attack shortly before 2:30 p.m. Tuesday police said.

Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Major US whiskey brands — from Woodford Reserve to Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark — have been on the rocks since 2018 over massive 25 percent tariffs imposed on their sales to Europe and the United Kingdom — thanks to a Trump-era war on steel and aluminum imports.

Now even as the Biden administration works to rebuild US trade relations with Europe and the UK tariffs on US whiskeys are poised to double on June 1 to 50 percent. Distillers say their sales to Europe a key market for whiskey will be put on ice indefinitely if that happens.

A 50 percent tariff would make us “so uncompetitive with a $30 bottle in the US costing 60 euros that I won’t be able to ship product to Europe anymore” Michael Langan general manager of Yellow Rose Distilling of Houston told The Post.

Yellow Rose’s shipments to Europe fell by fivefold to just 1000 cases last year as a result of the tariffs Langan said. If the 50 percent tariffs kick in his US exports to Europe will fall to zero he said and bouncing back will be tough.

“American whiskey is losing market share and shelf space in Europe to competitors from Japan and Asia who are taking our place” Langan lamented.

US whiskey exports to Europe were on the rise before the tariffs went into effect up 28 percent for the first six months of 2018 according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Since then however US whiskey exports have fallen by 37 percent to Europe and 53 percent to the UK the trade group said.

Among those suffering are Brown-Forman the maker of Jack Daniel’s which has been absorbing much of the added costs in an effort to not lose market share — suffering profit margin declines in the process.

But even a company like Brown-Forman which also makes Woodford Reserve and Finlandia vodka finds the impending 50 percent tariff hard to swallow.

“At a tariff rate of 25 percent we decided to shield our European customers … whenever possible” Chief Executive Lawson Whiting told Politico on March 11. “Everyone can imagine that at a rate of 50 percent suddenly that shielding becomes much more difficult.”

Brown-Forman is headquartered in Kentucky the birthplace of bourbon a type of whiskey that relies heavily on corn for its distinctive sweet flavor. Kentucky is also the home state of noted Trump ally Sen. Mitch McConnell which is a big reason the whiskey industry was targeted by European trade representatives in the first place experts said.

Tariffs on US whiskeys are poised to double on June 1 to 50 percent. Distillers say their sales to Europe will be put on ice indefinitely if that happens.

“The Trump administration took a very aggressive posture with the EU and as a result that contributed to the EU being very targeted at the time on where to apply the pressure points” Chris Swonger chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council told The Post. “There’s a lot of whiskey made in Kentucky.”

It’s not just Kentucky that’s suffering however. There are 37 states that export whiskey overseas and distillers from Virginia to New York say they are feeling the pain.

Cleveland Whiskey has already thrown in the towel on exporting to Europe as a result of the tariffs. “No one wanted to put product on a boat that they’d have to pay a lot more for when the product arrived” explained Tom Lix chief executive of the Ohio distillery which derived 20 percent of its revenues from exports in 2017.

Exporting whiskey had also been the fastest growing segment of New York Distilling Co.’s business in hipster Williamsburg Brooklyn before the tariffs accounting for 15 percent of sales in 2018 owner Tom Potter told The Post. The tariffs stopped that growth in its tracks and exports now account for just 5 percent of overall sales Potter said.

“We thought it could eventually reach 50 percent of our sales” said Potter whose company makes rye whiskeys with names like Mister Katz’s and Ragtime Rye. “We don’t know if we can count on exports helping our company again.”

The tariffs have also poured cold water on exports at Catoctin Creek Distilling a Purcellville Va. distillery whose internationally recognized hootch is sold at Manhattan’s popular Astor Wines & Spirits.

Catoctin Creek’s whiskeys currently generate about $10000 in sales from Europe versus several million in sales prior to the tariffs. “We had predicted that our overseas sales would double in 2018 to 22 percent” Scott Harris Catoctin Creek’s founder told The Post. “But now it’s about half a percent.”

The Biden administration reached a truce in Trump’s trade war over aircraft subsidies earlier this month resulting in a four-month freeze of tariffs that had been hammering a wide swath of US booze buyers and sellers — including a 25 percent tax by Europe on American rum brandy and vodka and a 25 percent tax by the US on wines imported from the UK Spain Germany and France.

And the president’s newly confirmed Trade Representative Katherine Tai is now offering the whiskey industry hope including a March 22 discussion with her EU and UK counterparts over “global steel and aluminum overcapacity” the trade office said.

But the industries hurt by the on-going steel and aluminum trade war — a group that also includes tobacco sellers and Harley-Davidson motorbikes — continue to be slammed as Biden faces pressure from steelmakers and their unions to maintain the steel tariffs.

Harris of Catoctin Creek popped a bottle of champagne and posted on Twitter when the aircraft tariff truce broke on March 5 because he initially thought it would help the whiskey industry he said.

“But then my wife sent me a private message telling me the reprieve wasn’t for us and I had to retract our congratulations that were going on out social media” he said. “We felt unloved.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc3JlcG9ydC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzE4NDQ3LWhvcm5pdG9zLXRlcXVpbGEtbGF1bmNoZXMtaGFyZC1zZWx0emVyLXJhbmdlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hornitos Tequila launches hard seltzer range,"Hornitos Tequila launches hard seltzer range

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

Need for Chips Sales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Automotives Computing Revenue $500B Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Note: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February. Figures for Samsung include its System LSI unit; for Globalfoundries include the manufacturing unit acquired from IBM; for PSMC its foundry business only. Source: TrendForce

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",,,,,,,,,,,,
CZR,Caesars Entertainment,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL21hci8yNy9leHBlcnRzLXNlZS1vcHRpbWlzbS1pbi12aXJnaW4taG90ZWxzLW9wZW5pbmctaW4tbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts see optimism in Virgin Hotels opening in Las Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) - Opening a new casino resort during a pandemic isn’t ideal but Virgin Hotels Las Vegas may have found a sweet spot with the timing of its launch.

After delaying its opening twice the off-Strip property opened Thursday.

Industry watchers say Las Vegas casino operators still face pandemic-related challenges but the operating environment today is much better than where Las Vegas stood just weeks ago.

“The prospects for summer look increasingly positive - with vaccination levels increasing and plenty of pent-up demand from people looking to put the pandemic behind them” Jonathan Day an associate professor of hospitality and tourism management at Purdue University told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “It’s a sign of optimism in the recovery that Virgin is committed to opening.”

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas initially planned to open in the fall after a $200 million renovation of the former Hard Rock Hotel. Plans were pushed back to January and delayed once again before Thursday’s opening date was announced.

Now Las Vegas is starting to show significant signs of recovery.

In recent earnings calls heads of casino operators Caesars Entertainment Inc. and MGM Resorts International revealed that bookings were increasing. Foot traffic on the Strip is on the rise. Casino floor operators can now operate at 50% capacity for the first time in months. And various surveys show that Americans are itching to take a leisure trip again as COVID-19 case numbers drop and vaccines roll out.

“Considering we had opening dates scheduled for late 2020 and early 2021 ultimately we feel good about our March 25 official opening date” said Richard “Boz” Bosworth president and CEO of J.C. Hospitality owner of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

“There are positive signs pointing to another great Las Vegas comeback” he said. “No city does it better than Las Vegas and we are excited to open our doors once again to our team members and welcome locals and tourists back to the city.”

Industry watchers expect to see Las Vegas tourism take off this summer after more than a year of lockdowns and strict operating restrictions.

“I think we’re going to have a killer summer. There’s pent-up demand to travel especially domestically” said Finley Cotrone an assistant professor in residence at UNLV’s college of hospitality. She called Virgin Hotels’ opening “really good timing.”

UNLV assistant professor of hospitality Amanda Belarmino said it didn’t make sense to open a new property back in the fall. At that time operators were closing amenities and some properties closed midweek because of lack of demand. Those properties have just started returning to full-week operations.

“There’s still a lot of uncertainty but we’re in the most optimistic place we’ve been since it started. So it makes sense (to open) now” Belarmino said.

She added that the reopening timeline is good for the city as well as the property. A new property going online should help drive foot traffic and bring back hundreds of workers.

Bosworth said Virgin Hotels is putting about 2000 local hospitality employees back to work. Some used to work at the Hard Rock.

Day thinks March will still be a challenging month to open a hotel but that the timing will allow Virgin Hotels to prepare for an influx of summer travelers.

“Opening now will give the opportunity to come up to speed as demand increases” he said in an email.

David Givens vice president of hotel operations for Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said he was looking forward to the opening.

“Everyone just wants to open” he said citing a busy recent weekends on the Strip. “It makes sense to get it open and then with the restrictions easing I think we’ll do OK.”

The property’s opening date does have downsides industry experts say.

For one Virgin Hotels’ doors opened a week after the initial weekend of this year’s NCAA Tournament one of the biggest annual events in Las Vegas.

“I would have opened early March. I would have wanted to get all of those kinks out for the first week of March Madness” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive. “The demand for that week is going to be tremendous and that March Madness crowd fits right in with Virgin.”

While the increased foot traffic during the first weekend of March Madness may have been a boon for Virgin Hotels it’s unclear how many travelers would have made a stop at the off-Strip property.

Sports betting partner Betfred is not yet licensed in Nevada and the property’s sportsbook isn’t set to open until the summer pending regulatory approval.

Cotrone also pointed out that while case numbers are down Virgin Hotels is still opening in the midst of a global pandemic. She voiced concern for some front-line workers especially knowing that some travelers will fly in from states that have dropped mask mandates.

“I do worry about our front-line employees as our guests come in (from) different states (and some are) convinced that the pandemic has passed” she said. “We still need to have these precautions with masks. Our front-line employees carry the brunt of that challenge.”

Bosworth told the Review-Journal that the safety of Virgin Hotels’ staff partners and guests is a top property.

“We would like to have brought all our team members back sooner but with the increase in COVID-19 cases and the restrictions that were in place it simply was not safe or profitable for us to open the doors at those earlier dates” he said.

“So after everything has been said and done I think everything worked out the way it was meant to be” he said. “The resort is primed and ready to kick off the recovery of the Las Vegas economy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zY29yZS9oYWdsZXItYW5kLW11Z2FiaS1zbHVnZmVzdC1vcHBvbmVudHMtd2l0aC1tdXR1YWwtcmVzcGVjdC0zMzM4NDQy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hagler and Mugabi: Slugfest opponents with mutual respect,"Marvin Hagler one of the greatest middleweight boxers in history died March 13 aged 66. The American southpaw won the World Boxing Council world middleweight title against Briton Alan Minter in London in 1980 and defended it 12 times before losing it to Sugar Ray Leonard in 1987.

Throughout his 67-fight professional career Hagler fought the best. But his story is incomplete if it misses his brawl with Ugandan John Mugabi – Hagler’s toughest fight a match made in hell.

After a third-round KO against Hagler in April 1985 Thomas Hearns wanted a rematch. But with 25 KOs in 25 fights Mugabi emerged the number one challenger to Hagler’s title despite fighting in junior middleweight.

The match between “Marvelous Marvin” the undisputed champion  and “The Beast” one of the most exciting knockout artists was definitely exciting.

Date and venue were set: November 14 1985 Caesars Palace Las Vegas.

But two weeks to the event Hagler broke his nose while sparring Zachary Hewitt the Citizen reported October 31 1985. The event was rescheduled to March 10 1986.

Mugabi’s baptism

After bagging silver at the 1980 Moscow Olympics Mugabi turned pro under British promoter Mickey Duff and trainer George Francis knocking out all his 25 opponents with only James Green lasting beyond six rounds.

That ruthless streak earned him “The Beast” nickname from Duff and his fanatics in Tampa Florida.

But Mugabi disliked the moniker: “Why they call me this?” he told Sports Illustrated. “I am a quiet man… if somebody calls me Beast I ask ‘Gosh what is he doing to me?’ I am a quiet man and a good man too I think.”

Three weeks to the match of his life Mugabi was baptised as a Roman Catholic John Paul Mugabi in Nogales on the US-Mexico border.

In the March 3 1986 article “This Beast Is A Beauty” Clive Gammon wrote for Sports Illustrated that “Father Anthony Clark is from Davenport Iowa but on loan to Sacred Heart with special responsibility for delinquent boys on both sides of the border…he recognised Mugabi at once.”

The cleric used boxing to sway young criminals off the streets and Mugabi bred in the abject poverty and delinquent life of Nakawa in suburban Kampala and Uganda’s political turbulence of the ‘70s was the perfect inspiration to Fr Anthony’s juveniles.

However having crossed the border from Mexico Mugabi was denied entry into the US his visa having expired. Fr Anthony’s intervention did not help: he was one of the 11 co-defendants in a case accusing nuns and priests “of sheltering illegal immigrants from El Salvador.”

Mugabi too pleaded in vain until Duff‘s lawyers sorted the matter.

The slugfest

None had lost since 1980 – the year Mugabi won Silver at the Mexico Games turned pro; the year Hagler first won this title.

Half an hour to the fight Duff Mugabi’s manager entered Hagler’s dressing room ranting that Hagler’s protective cup was not the right size “and there would be no fight” Sports Illustrated reported.

“Get him the hell out of here I can’t concentrate” Hagler told his team.

Duff just wanted to derail Hagler’s concentration no wonder the champion entered the ring with rage.

Mugabi had stopped the likes of Curtis Parker James Green Frank Fletcher and Ear Hargrove some on live television and this one was the first-ever fight on ShowTime after promoter Bob Arum disagreed with HBO.

The purse was equally handsome: a career-high $750000 for Mugabi and $2.5m a percentage of the revenue for Hagler.

Mugabi was aggressive from the onset and took the first round with solid hooks and a heavy jab punishing Hagler for fighting in orthodox unlike his natural southpaw stance.

But Hagler had found his rhythm by the end of the third round as his southpaw jab paved helped him avert Mugabi’s left hook. He got better in the fourth landing quick punches but “The Beast” braved the assault.

At the end of the round Mugabi landed a hard right uppercut that shook Hagler’s clean-shaven head. He added another heavy right to Hagler’s temple.

Haggler nearly stopped Mugabi in the sixth with hard right but referee Mills Lane paused play for eight seconds to warn Hagler for hitting low. The second warning saw Lane deduct a point from Hagler.

Nevertheless the champ was in the lead but toward the end of round nine Mugabi retaliated with a few hard rights. By the end of the 10th round though Mugabi’s steam was used up. His longest fight had lasted six rounds.

“Mugabi is tired…” the commentators said. “We love you” Father Anthony who was also in his corner encouraged him during the break. But Mugabi did not last the 11th round.

Hagler’s uppercuts early in the round missed the chin but toward the end three right hooks sent Mugabi to the ropes and down. The first time he had hit the canvas; he never beat the count.

Carried by his team fists in the air a big lump nearly shutting his right eye the champion celebrated the hardest-earned victory against a hard-punching iron-chinned challenger.

“I took the toughest opponent out there a guy with all those knockouts and I destroyed him... Now maybe all those doubters will shut up” Hagler said.

Aftermath

Boxing fans would have loved a Hagler-Mugabi rematch. But it never happened. What looked very imminent was the rematch between Hagler and Hearns. But that too never happened.

Instead the champion swayed by a record payday chose to give the fans the long-awaited match: against Leonard on April 6 1987 nearly three years since Leonard’s second retirement.

It is believed that after watching the Hagler-Mugabi action-packed slugfest ringside Leonard decided to return having studied Hagler’s weak point.

Leonard a former world champion who had fought only once in five years took Hagler’s WBC Middleweight title by split decision arguably the most hotly disputed result.

Hagler who often said the world was plotting his downfall retired.

Meanwhile according to Sports Illustrated of March 1986 Mugabi returned to junior middleweight (69kg) and didn’t even hint at a rematch with Hagler.

“Marvin is very tough and very strong and a great champion. Now I want to fight [Donald] Curry and Hearns.”

However years later Mugabi said the Hagler rematch did not happen because “Marvin went through hell.”

Both men were hospitalised urinating blood. Since then each highly respected the other eternally.

But Mugabi suffered his own hell. He returned to Caesar’s Palace on December 5 1986 in another title shot but again lost the WBC World Super Welter title to Duane Thomas after suffering a broken eye socket.

He underwent surgery and only returned to the ring on January 22 1988. After a streak of eight stoppages he finally landed a third title shot. This time Mugabi knocked out Frenchman Rene Jacquot to clinch the WBC World Super Welter title.

His final bout was a TKO loss to Glen Kelly January 16 1999 in Sydney. He retired after 42 wins [39KO] 7 losses and 1 draw. At 61 Mugabi a Florida Boxing Hall of Fame inductee lives in Brisbane Australia.

Mugabi on Hagler

In a 2017 interview for the ‘Best I Faced’ series with RingTV Mugabi chose Hagler in most of categories.

Best jab: His jab was very effective because he was a southpaw. It can destroy you. He also had a come-forward motion that helped him propel his jab with power and precision. The jab stung like hell.

Best chin: He was the only fighter I faced who didn’t go down to my clean punches especially an uppercut in the sixth round.

Smartest: Marvin changed stance after losing the first round from southpaw to orthodox and I made the mistake of changing to a southpaw and I got knocked out.

Best skills: His experience talent and toughness enabled him to show the best set of skills. I attribute this to Hagler’s length of time in the sport before becoming champion.

Best overall: He had too much experience for me. He had barely lost a fight from the start of his career (Hagler had lost two fights before facing Mugabi).

Marvin Hagler returned the respect when speaking about Mugabi and his personal career in the ring.

“Mugabi tried to knock my head off. I mean this guy here was kind of awkward. I mean he was a big puncher 25 fights 25 knockouts but I said ‘You know what? You’ve never been in the ring with the Marvelous One and I’ll tell you what. I will feast on ‘The Beast’” he told On the Ropes Boxing Radio.

About the opponents he respected the most he said: “I will give Mugabi Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns more respect because these guys came out there and tried to take my title. Not like [Sugar Ray] Leonard who ran like a little girl – excuse my language I’m sorry. They didn’t just try to survive and not to win the fight I really couldn’t see that.”",,,,,,,,,

Canadian companies don't have to tell you,"Despite having to disclose many details about ingredients specific allergens  calorie counts and other nutritional information on labels food manufacturers are not required to include the amount of added sugar a product contains and don't have to disclose that information to an inquiring consumer a CBC Marketplace investigation has found.

As part of its latest investigation Marketplace reached out to the Coca-Cola Company General Mills and Campbell Canada asking how much added sugar is in some of their popular products: Coca-Cola's Vitaminwater calcium orange General Mills' Liberté organic vanilla 0% yogurt and Campbell's condensed tomato soup.

Only one company told us how much added sugar is in its product — and it turns out they don't have to.

""I'm not surprised"" said David Hammond  professor and university research chair in public health at the University of Waterloo.

""I don't think it's in their interest to talk about just how many of their products and at what levels they add sugar.""

Under Canada's Food and Drugs Act  Canadian food labels must list the total amount of sugars which includes added sugars and any naturally occurring sugars like those in dairy fruit and vegetables. The labels do not have to specify how much sugar the manufacturer has added to the product often just for taste.

Canadian food labels lacking

In an email Health Canada said ""the Food and Drugs Act and its regulations do not permit the declaration of added sugars information in the nutrition facts table.""

However Health Canada told Marketplace that ""Consumers are free to contact manufacturers directly to seek additional information about foods or ingredients that are not on the list of priority allergens or about added sugars in a product. While many manufacturers will provide such information there is no obligation on the part of the manufacturer to do so.""

Dietitians recommend limiting daily added sugar intake and the World Health Organization (WHO) and Heart & Stroke Canada  among others offer guidelines.

The WHO recommends limiting daily ""free sugars"" to 25 grams or six teaspoons for maximum health benefits. ""Free sugars"" include not only added sugars but also the sugars naturally present in fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Heart & Stroke Canada recommends Canadians ideally consume less than five per cent or six teaspoons of added sugars a day.

David Hammond found added sugar in over 40000 packaged food and beverage products found on Canadian store shelves. (David Hammond)

Back in 2015 Hammond researched the presence of added sugar in over 40000 packaged food and beverage products available on Canadian store shelves by analyzing the ingredient list. He found added sugar in two-thirds of products and he doesn't believe anything has changed in the years since the study was published.

""It's not just cookies and cakes. Most Canadians would be surprised to learn that some of the leading sources of added sugars are things like yogurt bread"" said Hammond.

Amount of added sugar tough to uncover

Marketplace bought the Vitaminwater yogurt and soup products and tried to determine how much added sugar was in each.

With only total sugar required on a Canadian food label Marketplace worked with registered dietitian Stefania Palmeri to work out the nutrition math.

Liberté organic vanilla 0% yogurt and Liberté organic plain 0% yogurt. Plain yogurts generally have only naturally occurring sugars and no added sugars. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Liberté’s organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Liberté's organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving.

In contrast there is just five grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving in Liberté's organic plain 0% unsweetened yogurt.

Palmeri's best guess is that compared to the plain version the vanilla yogurt has a whopping 14 grams of added sugar per ¾-cup serving or about three teaspoons. Four grams of sugar is equivalent to about one teaspoon.

""We're not sure how much of this is added but we're still not doing well if this is the first thing we start with in the morning"" Palmeri said.

When Marketplace asked General Mills how much added sugar is in the yogurt the company said it follows Health Canada labelling regulations which include the labelling of total sugars in the product.

U.S. does disclose added sugar on food labels

Campbell's tomato soup was an interesting case.

Unlike in Canada added sugar is now listed on all nutrition facts labels in the United States — including the label for Campbell's tomato soup. That's because it's now required in the U.S. under new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On its U.S. website  the American Campbell's tomato soup is listed as having eight grams of added sugar per 240-millilitre serving.

WATCH | Here's how much added sugar is in this tomato soup:

Added sugar in your soup? The label won’t tell you how much Duration 2:38 This tomato soup has added sugar. But you won’t find how much on Canadian nutrition labels.

When Marketplace called Campbell's Canadian consumer line no information about added sugar was provided for the product sold in Canada. However later in emails Campbell's said it is ""prohibited"" by the Food and Drugs Act from including added sugar on the label but did explain that the tomato soup it sells in Canada has 11 grams of added sugar in one 250-millilitre (one-cup) serving.

Despite the slightly larger serving size that is still more sugar than the U.S. product.

Campbell’s condensed tomato soup has 16 grams of total sugar per one-cup serving. Campbell’s says 11 grams of it are added. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

""I don't think most people have an awareness of how many places added sugars can be hidden"" said Palmeri.

""When you're looking at a tomato soup thinking 'I'm trying to eat more vegetables' you wouldn't expect one of the ingredients to be glucose-fructose.""

Coca-Cola the owner of Vitaminwater products refused to tell Marketplace how many of the 32 grams of total sugar in its product are added sugar.

However it did say ""too much sugar isn't good for anyone"" and noted that it offers many low- or zero-sugar drinks including zero-sugar Vitaminwater.

Palmeri suspects all of it is added considering the second ingredient in the water is cane sugar. In the U.S. the label for Vitaminwater orange lists 27 grams of sugar all of it added.

Vitaminwater calcium orange has 32 grams of total sugar in one bottle. Our experts believe all of it is added. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Time for change

Hammond says consumers deserve to know about added sugar in their food.

""We need to do something because the status quo certainly isn't helping consumers at all"" he said.

Canadian consumers were consulted about new food labels back in 2013 and 2014. In the ""Consulting Canadians to Modernize and Improve Food Labels "" report Canadian consumers requested that new food labels include a daily maximum value for sugar as well as the breakdown of ""naturally occurring"" and ""added"" sugars.

But industry stakeholders pushed back  questioning the scientific basis of requiring that added sugars be on nutrition labels ""given that the body metabolizes naturally occurring and added sugars in the same way.""

Industry stakeholders also expressed other concerns including the cost of declaring added sugar information on labels and cited U.S. research that found consumers had a ""limited understanding"" of what added sugar means.

It's not clear which companies or manufacturers participated in the pushback.

In emails Marketplace asked Health Canada why added sugar will not be on the new nutrition labels  which are currently rolling out across the country.

Health Canada replied that feedback in 2014 indicated that Canadians found the information about added sugars ""confusing.""

Health Canada also said it determined that having an added sugars declaration would be inconsistent with the WHO guideline on sugars  which recommends that people reduce their consumption of free sugars and not just of added sugars. Health Canada also told Marketplace it believes that information on the new labels — including the ""% daily value"" (DV) and a new footnote indicating ""5% or less is a little 15% or more is a lot"" — will help educate consumers.

(Health Canada)

Health Canada also introduced the requirement to group sugars-based ingredients together within the list of ingredients following the term ""sugars."" The agency says that ""Together these new requirements will support reduction in Canadians' sugars intake.""

Hammond strongly disagrees and says research shows more Canadians were able to identify the presence of added sugar in a product when information for added sugar was clearly indicated on the nutrition label.

""Canadians are trying to make healthier choices … and one of the things they care about is how much added sugar is in there"" he said.

""This should not be rocket science.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

“There is agreement to sell a 90% stake in [Ethniki] Insurance to CVC Capital” one of the bankers told Reuters declining to be named. Private equity group CVC Capital with $109 billion of assets under management was the only bidder for NBG’s wholly owned insurance unit and submitted a binding bid one year ago. Reuters reported last month that NBG had completed talks to sell the insurance subsidiary to CVC Capital and that the bank’s management and board of directors backed the sale.

The divestment is part of NBG’s EU-approved restructuring plan to shed non-core assets. The bank has sold assets in the Balkans including operations in Bulgaria Albania and Romania and Turkey downsizing to focus on its core domestic banking business.

NBG 40% owned by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) Greece’s bank rescue fund was due to hold a board meeting late on Friday ahead of a scheduled full-year 2020 earnings announcement.

After all the allure of scoring that super-cheap fare may outweigh the negatives -- like being nickel-and-dimed for all the extras.

To help those of you who are considering purchasing a fare on low-cost carrier EasyJet (or are wondering if you should) TPG is here to tell you exactly what you need to know about flying the airline so you can have a pleasant travel experience. If you're interested in learning more about other low-cost carriers check out our low-cost carrier comparison guide and our guide to flying Ryanair.

Check in beforehand or at the airport

EasyJet is one of the few low-cost carriers that won't charge you to check in or print your boarding pass at the airport. But if you aren't checking a bag you can save time by checking in ahead of time and getting a mobile boarding pass. To check in online go to the EasyJet website under ""Manage Bookings"" or use the free app using your booking reference. You'll be prompted to enter your surname and booking reference then follow the instructions to download or send the mobile boarding pass to your phone.

Web check-in is available between 30 days and two hours before the flight giving you plenty of time to get your boarding pass printed or downloaded before you take off. Be prepared to enter advanced passenger information during check-in which can include details like nationality passport number birth date and more. And remember if you change your booking in any way (select new seats change the date name add an infant or special assistance) you'll have to reprint your boarding pass or download it again.

It's actually okay if you spell your name wrong

If you notice you made a typo when entering your name you can change it for free. However if you want to give your ticket to another person entirely you'll have to pay a fee of $34 to change it online if it's 60 days or more before travel. If it's 60 days or less before departure the fee is $69. These changes (and any others) to your booking can be made in the Manage Booking section on the EasyJet app or webpage.

Take advantage of EasyJet's impressive app

In 2019 EasyJet's app launched an interesting function: voice flight bookings. You can speak your departure city destination and travel dates into your mobile's microphone and voilà -- the app will pull up available flights.

This new feature is in addition to the app's Book with Instagram feature that's already available. Using it you can upload a screenshot of a destination you'd like to visit that you've snapped from social media. If EasyJet flies there (or close by) it will find the location and show you flight options.

You don't need a stamp

Unlike low-cost carrier Ryanair which mandates non-EU/EEA passengers must have their travel documents checked and stamped at the Ryanair Visa/Document Check Desk before certain flights EasyJet has no such rule.

If you have your boarding pass and you're not checking a bag the airline recommends you arrive 60 minutes before your scheduled departure and proceed directly to security. If you need to check a bag it's best to arrive a minimum of 90 minutes ahead of your scheduled flight to most destinations; however this may be different when flying to or from spots like Egypt Israel Jordan Morocco and Serbia.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

So make sure to check the EasyJet website ahead of time when traveling between those countries. Also note that bag drop closes 40 minutes before the departure time for most flights (60 minutes if departing from the aforementioned countries). And because many airports have self bag drops be prepared to tag your bag yourself in some cases.

Know the carry-on luggage rules

All passengers can bring one bag on board with a maximum size of 22x18x10 inches including handles and wheels. There is no weight limit but you must be able to lift your bag into the overhead bin.

Travelers who have purchased an extra-legroom/up front seat FLEXI fare or hold an EasyJet Plus card can bring an added personal item to place under the seat with a maximum size of 18x14x8 inches.

In some cases the airline staff may be lax to enforce this one-bag-only rule if you are flying with one bag and one small personal item like a purse. In other cases the staff at the gate may strongly enforce the rule. So if you decide to push the limit and travel with an additional personal item that's not included in your fare be prepared to put the smaller item inside your carry-on bag if asked in order to avoid paying extra fees.

According to EasyJet there is only room for 70 cabin bags in the airplanes' overhead lockers. All remaining cabin bags will be checked and can be collected from the baggage carousel on arrival. So if you want to be certain your baggage travels with you in the cabin pack a backpack that can fit under the seat or purchase speedy boarding to be one of the first passengers on the plane.

Know the checked luggage rules

Make sure to weigh your bags ahead of time. (Photo by doble-d/Getty Images)

Each traveler can bring three checked bags weighing under either 33 pounds 51 pounds or 71 pounds. Checked baggage fees are dependent on route flight and time of booking. If purchased online prices range from $10 to $48 for bags weighing up to 33 pounds and from $21 - $52 for those weighing more than 33 pounds up to 51 pounds. An extra $17 for every 7 pounds of weight is added for bags weighing more than 51 pounds on up to 71 pounds.

Passengers can only pay to check the lower-priced 33-pound or less bag online. If you wait to pay for your bag at the airport you'll be charged $55 at the bag-drop desk or $69 at the boarding gate for a bag up to 51 pounds. Additional weight can only be purchased online in increments of 7 pounds either at initial booking or post-booking. If your bag weighs more than the amount you pre-purchased expect to pay an extra $12 per pound above the pre-booked weight.

A final option is to take advantage of EasyJet's Hands Free option. This means that you check your carry-on bag at the bag drop allowing you to navigate the airport and security checks efficiently without dragging a bag with you. The bags also reportedly arrive first off the baggage carousel. This service costs $10 per person or $22 for a family or group of three to six passengers.

Here are TPG tips for checked baggage:

Always weigh your bag before traveling.

Pack a small travel scale to weigh it again before returning home.

Book and pay for your checked luggage online to avoid extra charges for doing so at the airport.

Ensure your checked baggage doesn't exceed the maximum size. The length + width + height must total under 108in.

Pay for your extras in advance

It's clear from reading the baggage rules that purchasing in advance will save you money. You should consider purchasing your seats and other extras in advance too not only to save money but to avoid hassle and disappointment later on. Each aircraft has up-front seats extra legroom seats and regular seats. Prices for seat selection range from $3- $11 for standard seats to $11 - $41 for front extra legroom or overwing seats. FLEXI fares or EasyJet Plus have seat selection included.

If you choose not to pay extra for seats and are traveling with a group be sure to check in as early as possible (remember you can do so 30 days in advance) for the best chance of being seated together. Unfortunately speedy boarding isn't available as a standalone purchase but it's available to travelers with an EasyJet Plus card FLEXI ticket or an up-front or extra-legroom seat.

Consider a FLEXI fare or EasyJet Plus

FLEXI fares allow changes to flight dates and times plus a free 51-pound checked bag dedicated bag drop speedy boarding Fast Track security at selected airports a seat at the front of the airplane an under-seat bag in addition to your cabin bag and a $10 (or currency equivalent) bistro voucher to spend onboard.

EasyJet Plus membership costs $275 per year and includes allocated seating every time you fly dedicated bag-drop desks Fast Track security at select airports speedy boarding an additional cabin bag and more. This option may be worth it if you fly EasyJet several times per year.

EasyJet partners with other airlines to fly you well everywhere

EasyJet flies to over 150 destinations across Europe and North Africa. They also partner with airlines like Emirates Cathay Pacific Norwegian Singapore Virgin and several others to help serve destinations the airline doesn't fly to itself like spots in North America the Caribbean Asia and beyond. To book these flights go to Worldwide EasyJet.

Be prepared

If you haven't flown EasyJet in a while you may be pleasantly surprised. Compared to some of the more bare-bones low-cost carriers EasyJet can seem like a delight -- they even have a seatback pocket!

But don't get too excited. The seats don't recline and have a pitch of a mere 30 inches. All food and beverages are at an added cost including water. You may have to line up for a while before boarding in order to board early enough to store your carry-on in the overhead bin.

To ensure you'll have a comfortable flight make sure to bring:

Noise-canceling headphones

Snacks

Water (post-security)

A neck pillow if you plan to sleep

A travel scarf or blanket if you get cold

Read the fine print

This EasyJet cheat sheet will definitely help you prepare for your flight but remember the airline can change their policies at any time -- baggage limitations check-in procedures or fees etc. So be sure to read the conditions of your fare and ticket before purchasing. It's also a good idea to know and understand your rights as a flyer in case of delays flight cancellations and strikes. Once you know the rules your airport and in-flight experience will be much easier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L25ldy15b3JrLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc2VyaWVzLXByZXZpZXctY2FwaXRhbHMtY2xhc2gtd2l0aC1yYW5nZXJzLWluLWhvbWUtYW5kLWhvbWUtc2V0L9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L25ldy15b3JrLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc2VyaWVzLXByZXZpZXctY2FwaXRhbHMtY2xhc2gtd2l0aC1yYW5nZXJzLWluLWhvbWUtYW5kLWhvbWUtc2V0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York-Washington Series Preview: Capitals Clash With Rangers In Home-And-Home Set,"Photo: Patrick Smith/Getty Images

The Washington Capitals clash with the New York Rangers in the nation’s capital on Sunday afternoon and in the Big Apple on Tuesday night for the fifth and sixth meetings against them this season respectively.

The Rangers have taken three of the first four games of the season set including a 3-1 win in Washington on March 20 in the teams’ last meeting (which snapped a seven game winning streak for the Capitals) and a 4-2 victory in New York on February 4. Overall the Rangers have won five of the last six games against the Capitals (5-1-0).

Action from Capital One Arena on Sunday can be seen on NBC beginning at 12 noon ET while NBC Sports Washington will cover Tuesday’s game at Madison Square Garden beginning at 7 PM ET.

Rangers

The Rangers conclude a three-game road trip and continue a stretch of 16 of 21 games away from the Garden. They earned a split in their series with the Philadelphia Flyers at Wells Fargo Center including a 2-1 loss on Saturday. The Rangers are 8-8-1 on the road this season and are 3-5-0 in their last eight away from Madison Square Garden. They are 7-6-3 at home but have gone 4-1-1 in their last six at MSG.

The Rangers have heated up lately as they have gone 11-7-1 since February 17 and are 8-5-1 in March to climb within five points of the Boston Bruins for the fourth spot in the East Division though Boston has three games in hand. They won four out of five (4-1-0) before falling to the Flyers on Saturday. Their 3.55 goals-per-game since February 15 ranks second in the NHL behind the Colorado Avalanche (3.65) and they have averaged 2.65 goals-against per game over that time (14th). They have gone 23.2% (10th) on the power play and an 85% on the penalty kill (fifth). They have also limited opponents to just 29 shots-per-game over that span (10th).

Forward Pavel Buchnevich leads the Rangers with 31 points in 32 games. His 13 goals trail only forward Chris Krieder’s 16. The 25-year-old saw a three-game point streak where he recorded three goals and five points end on Saturday. Krieder 29 has earned two goals and three points in his past three games. Defenseman Adam Fox’s 23 assists lead the Rangers. He has recorded one goal and 12 points in a six-game assist streak. Forward Artemi Panarin who has recorded three goals and 11 points in eight games since returning from a leave of absence leads the Rangers with an average of 1.32 points-per-game (29 in 22).

Their 1.011 PDO is tied with the Carolina Hurricanes and Edmonton Oilers for eighth.

Capitals

The Capitals close out a six-game homestand which matches their longest of the season on Sunday before starting a five-game road trip through the tri-state area on Tuesday. The Capitals have gone 8-2-1 over their past 11 game games with both regulation losses coming against the Rangers.

What’s better than a car commercial with one iconic basketball player?

Two obviously!

Throughout the NBA season American used-car realtor Carmax has partnered up and released various ads with Steph Curry where the continuous joke is Curry dealing with employees who have absolutely no idea who he is.

Though earlier Sunday Carmax’s latest commercial caught a lot of people’s attention as it showcased both Curry and WNBA superstar Sue Bird.

I mean that wave alone deserves an Emmy tbh 😂 @S10Bird https://t.co/3jwjq97D9f — Elizabeth Williams (@E_Williams_1) March 28 2021

Within the commercial the agent tells Curry “If you had told me this morning I’d be working with a four-time champ” before Curry corrects him that he has won three times and not four.

The agent corrects him right back stating how he actually just sold a car to Sue Bird before the camera pans to her waving while hoping into her big yellow bow decorated new vehicle.

“11 All-Star appearances can you imagine?”

Curry then tells him how he’s trying before the commercial ends.

It’s safe to say this is one of our new favourite commercials. Seeing this rare partnering between both an NBA and WNBA star has us excited to see what the future holds for promoting more stars within women’s sports.

And the internet pretty much felt the same way as their reactions were pretty on par!

CarMax currently has a number of used Teslas listed including multiple Model 3 units which is the fastest-selling used car on the market and also retains value better than small luxury cars.

CarMax is also offering transfers on many of these listings meaning that for a small fee you can have the Tesla you want to look at transferred from anywhere in the country to the CarMax location closest to you.

However some of the cars such as the 2020 Model Y Long Range with merely 10000 miles on it are listed for well over the MSRP of a new unit. One Reddit user theorized that may be because the Model Y could have the Full Self-Driving upgrade (worth $10000 USD) already purchased.

Or CarMax may simply be charging a premium for the ability to comprehensively test-drive a Tesla you’re thinking of getting before making a decision as well as providing its own warranty on top of Tesla’s existing factory warranty.

Another Reddit user reported two of the listings for used Teslas disappearing indicating that they may have already been snagged up by someone.

Used Teslas being available through third-party dealerships will make Tesla’s electric vehicles accessible to a wider array of people which is one of Tesla’s main goals moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYmlzY3VpdC5jb20vMjAwOC1ob25kYS1zMjAwMC1hcHByYWlzZWQtY2FybWF4LW9mZmVyLXN1cnByaXNlLXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Had my 2008 Honda S2000 Appraised at Carmax the Offer Will Surprise You,"“You have a Honda S2000?!

“You have a Honda S2000?! Those cars are going up in value” are words that I have heard over and over during the past four years that I have owned my car. Of course the value of my 2008 Honda S2000 has been something that’s been on the back of my mind. But I’ve never given it too much thought because I plan to keep the car as long as humanly possible and enjoy it for what it is.

But sometimes curiosity gets the best of me and I wonder what my car is really worth and if it is indeed going up in value. In order to scratch my curious itch I got my S2000 appraised by Carmax and Carvana recently and the offers were surprising.

Apparently Carvana likes my Honda S2000

As a little back story I bought my Honda S2000 back in 2017 for $24000. That price might sound a little high to you especially considering that the car retailed for around $31000 when it was new back in 2008. However it only had 49000 miles on the odometer and was painted in the highly-coveted Laguna Blue Pearl so the private dealer that sold it to me knew what he had.

Fast forward to September 2020 I was working on selling my leased 2019 Subaru Forester Sport and ended up getting it appraised by and selling it to Carvana. But while I was on the site I decided to have them appraise my S2000 just to see what kind of offer I could get.

At the time with a little over 86000 miles on the clock Carvana appraised it at $14000. That was a decent number but there’s no way I would ever sell it for that much.

Fast forward again March 2021 (earlier this week) and I appraised it through Carvana again this time with 86565 miles on the odometer. To my surprise Carvana came back with an instant appraisal of $17756. That means my car went up in value by over $3000 in six months.

Try doing that with your Toyota Corolla!

Carmax likes my S2000 even more

I couldn’t just take Carvana’s word for it though. So I checked with Vroom as well but they only offered $14000. So I figured I would complete the trifecta of used-car value appraisals and set up an appointment with Carmax to see what they would offer me for my trusty blue pocket rocket.

If you have never had your car appraised at Carmax I highly recommend it. The process was super simple and I was in and out within 25 minutes. The Carmax associate simply looked over my car took a bunch of pictures of it and then did some research to figure out a value for it.

“We don’t see these too often especially in Colorado” she said as she walked back into the building. I took a look around the lot and noticed the rows of Ford F-150s and Jeeps they had available. She’s right my car stuck out like a sore thumb.

When the Carmax associate came back she handed me the offer: $18000.

“What do you think?” she asked. I wanted to say “That’s awesome!” But I told her I would think about it and let her know.

Am I going to sell my S2000?

Nope. I’d rather wait another 10 years and see what the market is like then. Keep in mind that S2000 CR’s have sold recently to the tune of $50000 to $70000 and regular S2000s similar to mine are easily selling in the $20000 range in private party sales.

As far as I can tell its value can only go up from here so there’s no reason for me to sell it to Carmax only for them to turn around and sell it at auction (due to its age). That would be a shame.

But if you have the means I would suggest you buy an S2000. Apparently they’re increasing in value.",,,,,,

In an e-mail sent to guests and travel agents the cruise line said it had made no change in its plans to cruise in June 2021. The cruise line intends to sail only from US ports and as the president said before will not be moving ships to any other homeports to circumvent the CDC and its safe sailing framework.

However Carnival Cruise Line has changed its cancellation and payment policies to give guests more freedom to change or keep their reservations.

So while the competition has been shuffling ships around to accommodate new homeports in the Caribbean and Europe Carnival is steadfast in its belief that the US’s progress to battle the pandemic is paying off.

Of course this does not mean that guests are not eager to sail and are eager to find out whether Carnival will be canceling its cruises this June.

As of right now to provide further confidence the cruise line is offering guests the opportunity for several ways to handle the situation. First of all the cruise line offers guests an extended payment deadline for all June 2021 sailings. This means that final payments now need to be completed before April 30 2021.

Although this sounds like a long time before the cruise line will make any decisions the e-mail states that they will be deciding before that time. It merely serves to give those that have not made their final payments the chance to see what will be happening in the upcoming weeks.

Should guests want to keep their reservations active they do not have to take any action until April 30. Guests that would like to cancel their booking in light of the uncertainty have several options.

The Previous Offers Still Stand

Carnival has said the previous cancellation offers still stand and guests can still cancel June 2021 itineraries without penalty. However if a guest keeps the itinerary and the ship does sail guests will be eligible for a $100 onboard credit per cabin. The cruise line calls this an appreciation of loyalty from the guests.

Should a guest wish to cancel their cruise and this is done before April 30 they will receive a full refund of monies paid including a refund on any additional purchases like taxes gratuities beverage and WIFI packages and more.

Suppose a guest chooses this option and the voyage did not have a future cruise credit (FCC) or OBC applied to it and the voyage is eventually canceled. In that case they will not be eligible for any rebooking offers made to guests who have remained on the voyage.

If guests booked the voyage with an FCC they will receive a refund for any amount paid above the FCC. The FCC will remain in place as will any OBC as long as any next voyage is booked before September 30 2021 for any voyage departing by April 30 2023.

Carnival Cruise Line asks that guests who have any further questions regarding their sailings and bookings contact their travel agent or Carnival Personal Vacation Planner.

Carnival Will Not Budge

The message from the cruise line comes after President Christine Duffy said this week in her video message to guests and travel agents that the line does not intend to change their sailing locations or to move ships to any Caribbean or other ports for now:

“Here at Carnival Cruise Line we currently do not have any plans to move our ships away from their US homeports. I’ve always said Carnival Cruise Line is America’s Cruise Line. We sail from 14 US homeports 50% of our itineraries are less than 7-day sailings and a significant number of our guests drive to their Carnival cruise vacation.”

While Royal Caribbean has decided to change their ways and sail from new homeports and Norwegian Cruise Line has now canceled voyages for multiple ships for a possible redeployment it seems Carnival guests can still count on the line to remain true to their US homeports. Something Governor DeSantis of Florida will surely appreciate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMTAzMjcvY2Fybml2YWwtamFtYWljYS1lY29ub21pYy1mYWxsb3V0LWRvdWJsZXMtcmVjZW50LXBvc3Rwb25lbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival in Jamaica economic fallout doubles with recent postponement,"Earlier this week Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett announced that for the second consecutive year there is to be no carnival celebrations in Jamaica. The decision was made amid the spike in coronavirus cases across the island.

As of Thursday there are 19795 active COVID-19 cases islandwide with Kingston and St Andrew continuing to record some of the highest numbers of new cases daily. Bartlett said that based on trends a further postponement of Carnival was in every one's best interest.

While agreeing wholeheartedly that forgoing Carnival 2021 was the best decision for the country and its people Kamal Bankay chairman of the Carnival in Jamaica stakeholders committee said that no carnival two years in a row has resulted in a significant economic loss for the country.

In a recent interview with The Gleaner Bankay said with Jamaica having been in the advanced stages of execution for Carnival 2020 before the pandemic struck the country would have suffered a multibillion-dollar setback from the postponement. That number he says has doubled this year.

""The fact of the matter is that we were in our advanced stages of execution for Carnival in 2020 when the COVID-19 virus moved from an epidemic into a pandemic. While an epidemic is a localised issue a pandemic is global. Carnival was less than a month away when we were faced with this world issue. Costumes were made people made deposits venues would have been booked artistes would have been booked and we would have already solidified stuff with suppliers in terms of paraphernalia associated with Carnival and road march"" he said.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

The Carnival ecosystem said Bankay accounts for billions of dollars in revenue for the country annually. ""It's a very simple thing. The Government studies for Carnival in Jamaica actually puts Carnival as having an economic impact of round about $4.6 billion. Multiply that by two and it's easy to see the kinds of revenue we would have generated for 2020 and 2021.""

Bankay said Carnival in Jamaica ""has the highest economic impact of an event in Jamaica"" due to the length of the celebration and its many components. ""There is no other event that has a higher economic impact than Carnival in Jamaica. That is due to the fact that it is a season of events. It's nine/ten days of activities that culminate in the grand road march"" Bankay said. ""And by economic impact we are not just talking about what the persons directly associated with Carnival would have made but the indirect earnings as well. We are talking about understanding what each person that participates within Carnival spends each day times the amount of days times the amount of persons. Persons participating in Carnival each year are spending on a number of things from hotels to food and beverage to eyelashes stockings hair make-up transportation clothes. There is a whole ecosystem surrounding Carnival which profits the ordinary Jamaican as well.""

Still although the economic fallout from COVID was significant Bankay reiterated that all is not lost. He said that with Jamaica having been in the advanced stages of execution when the pandemic struck in March last year it will be easier for Carnival organisers to pick up where they left off and pull off a fast execution whenever the live event sector gets the green light again. ""Whenever we are able to do Carnival again safely Jamaica will be able to produce a world-class event on shorter notice than anybody else because of the advanced stage that we were when we had to push pause on the execution"" he said.

He notes that there was some optimism that Carnival could have been held if the island continued on its management trajectory. ""When we were turning the corner late last year and we saw the management of the pandemic by our Government with the number of hospitalisations and active cases keeping low we were optimistic that we could keep it that way and that would allow us to stage Carnival 2021 in a safe space especially with vaccinations and rapid testing on the cards"" Bankay said.

However with recent spikes it would not be safe to gather at this time. ""[Coming] around to this year COVID-19 has grown into an even bigger threat than it was last year this time and so it was just not in every one's best interest to host anything that could result in a spike in cases in any way. Gathering people for an event right now is risky. So we have to keep waiting until it's safe"" he said.​

In September Bartlett revealed that the carnival had been pushed back to 11April this year because of Covid-19. Since the dangers of the pandemic persist he has once had to tell the organisers and the public that preparations will have to cease entirely until further notice.

Delano Seiveright senior consultant and planner has advised that the Tourism Ministry is collaborating with carnival organisers to create a bubble concept for the carnival. They hope to reopen the sector as soon as it’s safe to do so.

That provides far greater range and bombing ability than anything offered by a ship.

HMS Furious the first real aircraft carrier entered service in early 1918. A converted cruiser she displaced about 20000 tons and flew about half a dozen Sopwith Camels an aircraft with a range of about 150 miles and a weapons payload just short of 100 pounds. Twenty-five years later Furious could carry 36 aircraft ranging at least twice as far with weapon loads of around 2000 pounds. Her larger purpose built cousins could carry double the number of aircraft. Armored flight decks improved anti-aircraft armament and better damage control procedures protected many of these later carriers from attacks that would sink their older brethren.

In short aircraft carriers are composite systems of warfare that can increase rapidly in lethality as their components improve. While the USN (and the other carrier fleets of the world) will likely never achieve the leaps forward in lethality that the inter-war navies experienced it can still expect that its carrier fleet will grow in effectiveness over time. The USN can increase the effectiveness of its carriers in one of three ways: increase their offensive striking power tighten their defense or (perhaps most difficult) bring their procurement costs into line. In this context here are five developments that could increase the lethality of the USN’s aircraft carrier fleet:

Integrated Missile Defense

The greatest present threat to the aircraft carrier appears to lie in the combination of cruise and precision ballistic missiles. Individually either of these can give a carrier a very bad day resulting in mission-killing damage to the flight deck or worse. In combination they present a lethal problem for fleet air defense to manage especially when the cruise missiles approach from multiple vectors.

Air defense isn’t a new problem for aircraft carriers; many World War II carriers were lost to air attack and the Soviets planned to destroy the USN’s carriers with huge flights of missile-carrying Backfire bombers. The combination of ballistic and cruise missiles presents a new tactical picture one that the USN has concentrated on ameliorating over the last decade by improving its ballistic missile defenses. Most recently the United States has reopened the possibility of “multi-object kill vehicles” interceptors which can destroy multiple incoming targets and decoys. The ability of carrier escorts to prevent damage to their charge unquestionably makes carriers more dangerous to prospective opponents.

Laser

The power generation capabilities of the Gerald Ford (CVN-78)-class vastly exceed those of the previous Nimitz-class carriers. In the short term this may not mean much although it will certainly make some tasks easier (including EMALS the new electromagnetic launch system). In the longer term this extra power generation capacity may make lasers an effective tool for air defense.

The U.S. Navy has devoted a great deal of attention to the prospect of making directed energy weapons a useful defense system. In theory lasers could resolve many of the problems associated with ballistic and cruise missile defense including the accuracy and limited number of interceptors. A carrier with sufficiently powerful laser defenses could curtail the threat of even large salvos of cruise and ballistic missiles providing a carrier group with an extra degree of security and lethality in contested areas.

Drones

With the post-Cold War cancellation of the A-12 Avenger and the retirement of the A-6 Intruder the USN’s carrier force has lacked a long-range strike option. The Navy has replaced this capability with the Tomahawk missile a system that poses considerably less risk to its operators than a manned aircraft. The USN has also focused on inflight refueling as a way of extending the range of its fighter-bombers although this practice has strained the airframes of many of the Navy’s planes.

At the moment probably the biggest debate in the Navy involves the UCLASS program an effort to supply the Navy with a long-range stealth drone. Much of the debate turns on what exactly the drone will be able to do; advocates want a long-range strike aircraft while the more cautious want a drone that can focus on ISR. The development of either would increase the lethality of the USN’s carrier force but a long-range strike drone while expensive would represent a welcome addition to the air wing.

Gens 5-6 Airwing

Fundamentally the strength of a carrier depends most on the capabilities of its air wing. In the next decade the aircraft launched from U.S. carriers will undergo considerable change. Most notably the arrival of the F-35C (whatever the larger problems with the program) will increase the stealth sensor capacity and communications capabilities of the air wing. In combination with the EA-18 Growler this will increase the lethality of the entire air wing.

Down the road the Navy’s pursuit of a sixth-generation fighter will hopefully keep the carrier air wing vital and effective even against strongly defended targets. The aircraft that the Gerald Ford enters service carrying will look little like those that it flies when it leaves service.

Cost Management

The biggest threat to the future of the aircraft carrier lies not in missiles or torpedoes but in the enormous combined cost of the ships their escorts and their air wings. This is a problem that has not improved over the past century; carriers have grown ever more expensive increasing the strain on defense budgets and national governments.

The Ford class and the F-35C have not been exceptions to this trend as both have exceeded cost expectations. In the future the Navy hopes to rein in costs by focusing on finding construction efficiencies and using “concurrency” to accelerate the development and operationalization of new technologies. Thus far the results haven’t been great. In the future the exorbitant cost of the ships and their aircraft may force the Navy to choose between smaller carriers or fewer carriers.

Wrap

Aircraft carriers are just big ships with flat decks. Their true power comes from their ability to provide a secure mobile airbase for a powerful air wing. Given the expected lifespan of the new carriers entering service with the USN (50 years or more) we can have no doubt that the ships will radically increase in lethality over the next decades.

Things get a little more complicated though when it comes to the finer points of law. A section of the Code of Federal Regulations relating to customs technically creates an opening for domestic moves of freight that are “incidental” to the cross-border run and in the same direction of travel.

But in most cases this provision — under “Entry of foreign-based trucks busses and taxicabs in international traffic” — is meaningless because of the following sentence: “An alien driver will not be permitted to operate a vehicle under this paragraph unless the driver is in compliance with the applicable regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.”

The trouble is that Canadian and Mexican drivers don’t allow them to engage in these kinds of moves under the terms of their entry into the United States. As U.S. Customs and Border Protection explains on its website: “No. For Immigration purposes that is considered point-to-point hauling within the United States and is not permitted. The driver may only take goods loaded in the United States to Canada or Mexico.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtZmx5aW5nLWVhc3lqZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everything you need to know about flying easyJet,"Traveling on a low-cost carrier probably isn't your favorite way to cruise the skies but if you play your cards right your experience doesn't have to be all that bad. After all the allure of scoring that super-cheap fare may outweigh the negatives -- like being nickel-and-dimed for all the extras.

To help those of you who are considering purchasing a fare on low-cost carrier EasyJet (or are wondering if you should) TPG is here to tell you exactly what you need to know about flying the airline so you can have a pleasant travel experience. If you're interested in learning more about other low-cost carriers check out our low-cost carrier comparison guide and our guide to flying Ryanair.

Check in beforehand or at the airport

EasyJet is one of the few low-cost carriers that won't charge you to check in or print your boarding pass at the airport. But if you aren't checking a bag you can save time by checking in ahead of time and getting a mobile boarding pass. To check in online go to the EasyJet website under ""Manage Bookings"" or use the free app using your booking reference. You'll be prompted to enter your surname and booking reference then follow the instructions to download or send the mobile boarding pass to your phone.

Web check-in is available between 30 days and two hours before the flight giving you plenty of time to get your boarding pass printed or downloaded before you take off. Be prepared to enter advanced passenger information during check-in which can include details like nationality passport number birth date and more. And remember if you change your booking in any way (select new seats change the date name add an infant or special assistance) you'll have to reprint your boarding pass or download it again.

It's actually okay if you spell your name wrong

If you notice you made a typo when entering your name you can change it for free. However if you want to give your ticket to another person entirely you'll have to pay a fee of $34 to change it online if it's 60 days or more before travel. If it's 60 days or less before departure the fee is $69. These changes (and any others) to your booking can be made in the Manage Booking section on the EasyJet app or webpage.

Take advantage of EasyJet's impressive app

In 2019 EasyJet's app launched an interesting function: voice flight bookings. You can speak your departure city destination and travel dates into your mobile's microphone and voilà -- the app will pull up available flights.

This new feature is in addition to the app's Book with Instagram feature that's already available. Using it you can upload a screenshot of a destination you'd like to visit that you've snapped from social media. If EasyJet flies there (or close by) it will find the location and show you flight options.

EasyJet will fuel your wanderlust into flight bookings. Screenshot by Ben Smithson.

You don't need a stamp

Unlike low-cost carrier Ryanair which mandates non-EU/EEA passengers must have their travel documents checked and stamped at the Ryanair Visa/Document Check Desk before certain flights EasyJet has no such rule.

If you have your boarding pass and you're not checking a bag the airline recommends you arrive 60 minutes before your scheduled departure and proceed directly to security. If you need to check a bag it's best to arrive a minimum of 90 minutes ahead of your scheduled flight to most destinations; however this may be different when flying to or from spots like Egypt Israel Jordan Morocco and Serbia.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

So make sure to check the EasyJet website ahead of time when traveling between those countries. Also note that bag drop closes 40 minutes before the departure time for most flights (60 minutes if departing from the aforementioned countries). And because many airports have self bag drops be prepared to tag your bag yourself in some cases.

Know the carry-on luggage rules

All passengers can bring one bag on board with a maximum size of 22x18x10 inches including handles and wheels. There is no weight limit but you must be able to lift your bag into the overhead bin.

Travelers who have purchased an extra-legroom/up front seat FLEXI fare or hold an EasyJet Plus card can bring an added personal item to place under the seat with a maximum size of 18x14x8 inches.

In some cases the airline staff may be lax to enforce this one-bag-only rule if you are flying with one bag and one small personal item like a purse. In other cases the staff at the gate may strongly enforce the rule. So if you decide to push the limit and travel with an additional personal item that's not included in your fare be prepared to put the smaller item inside your carry-on bag if asked in order to avoid paying extra fees.

According to EasyJet there is only room for 70 cabin bags in the airplanes' overhead lockers. All remaining cabin bags will be checked and can be collected from the baggage carousel on arrival. So if you want to be certain your baggage travels with you in the cabin pack a backpack that can fit under the seat or purchase speedy boarding to be one of the first passengers on the plane.

Know the checked luggage rules

Make sure to weigh your bags ahead of time. (Photo by doble-d/Getty Images)

Each traveler can bring three checked bags weighing under either 33 pounds 51 pounds or 71 pounds. Checked baggage fees are dependent on route flight and time of booking. If purchased online prices range from $10 to $48 for bags weighing up to 33 pounds and from $21 - $52 for those weighing more than 33 pounds up to 51 pounds. An extra $17 for every 7 pounds of weight is added for bags weighing more than 51 pounds on up to 71 pounds.

Passengers can only pay to check the lower-priced 33-pound or less bag online. If you wait to pay for your bag at the airport you'll be charged $55 at the bag-drop desk or $69 at the boarding gate for a bag up to 51 pounds. Additional weight can only be purchased online in increments of 7 pounds either at initial booking or post-booking. If your bag weighs more than the amount you pre-purchased expect to pay an extra $12 per pound above the pre-booked weight.

A final option is to take advantage of EasyJet's Hands Free option. This means that you check your carry-on bag at the bag drop allowing you to navigate the airport and security checks efficiently without dragging a bag with you. The bags also reportedly arrive first off the baggage carousel. This service costs $10 per person or $22 for a family or group of three to six passengers.

Here are TPG tips for checked baggage:

Always weigh your bag before traveling.

Pack a small travel scale to weigh it again before returning home.

Book and pay for your checked luggage online to avoid extra charges for doing so at the airport.

Ensure your checked baggage doesn't exceed the maximum size. The length + width + height must total under 108in.

Pay for your extras in advance

It's clear from reading the baggage rules that purchasing in advance will save you money. You should consider purchasing your seats and other extras in advance too not only to save money but to avoid hassle and disappointment later on. Each aircraft has up-front seats extra legroom seats and regular seats. Prices for seat selection range from $3- $11 for standard seats to $11 - $41 for front extra legroom or overwing seats. FLEXI fares or EasyJet Plus have seat selection included.

If you choose not to pay extra for seats and are traveling with a group be sure to check in as early as possible (remember you can do so 30 days in advance) for the best chance of being seated together. Unfortunately speedy boarding isn't available as a standalone purchase but it's available to travelers with an EasyJet Plus card FLEXI ticket or an up-front or extra-legroom seat.

Consider a FLEXI fare or EasyJet Plus

FLEXI fares allow changes to flight dates and times plus a free 51-pound checked bag dedicated bag drop speedy boarding Fast Track security at selected airports a seat at the front of the airplane an under-seat bag in addition to your cabin bag and a $10 (or currency equivalent) bistro voucher to spend onboard.

EasyJet Plus membership costs $275 per year and includes allocated seating every time you fly dedicated bag-drop desks Fast Track security at select airports speedy boarding an additional cabin bag and more. This option may be worth it if you fly EasyJet several times per year.

EasyJet partners with other airlines to fly you well everywhere

EasyJet flies to over 150 destinations across Europe and North Africa. They also partner with airlines like Emirates Cathay Pacific Norwegian Singapore Virgin and several others to help serve destinations the airline doesn't fly to itself like spots in North America the Caribbean Asia and beyond. To book these flights go to Worldwide EasyJet.

Be prepared

If you haven't flown EasyJet in a while you may be pleasantly surprised. Compared to some of the more bare-bones low-cost carriers EasyJet can seem like a delight -- they even have a seatback pocket!

But don't get too excited. The seats don't recline and have a pitch of a mere 30 inches. All food and beverages are at an added cost including water. You may have to line up for a while before boarding in order to board early enough to store your carry-on in the overhead bin.

To ensure you'll have a comfortable flight make sure to bring:

Noise-canceling headphones

Snacks

Water (post-security)

A neck pillow if you plan to sleep

A travel scarf or blanket if you get cold

Read the fine print

This EasyJet cheat sheet will definitely help you prepare for your flight but remember the airline can change their policies at any time -- baggage limitations check-in procedures or fees etc. So be sure to read the conditions of your fare and ticket before purchasing. It's also a good idea to know and understand your rights as a flyer in case of delays flight cancellations and strikes. Once you know the rules your airport and in-flight experience will be much easier."

Guest Article for the Tallahassee Democrat

April 2 2021 Release for the Tallahassee Democrat

By Brenda Buchan

Do you get the feeling that North Florida is being invaded by fuzzy caterpillars? And what is with all that webbing you see in the forks of trees?

The caterpillars you are seeing are eastern tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum) and those webs are their nests. We get invaded by them every year but some years seem to have greater numbers than usual. Also with more of us spending time in our yards these days they seem especially noticeable. Although based on what is climbing all over my plants deck and trees it appears we are having a banner year of caterpillars. Except for causing problems with digestion in horses these caterpillars are benign and when you see them they are usually on their way to find a place on the ground to pupate into a moth.

Eastern tent caterpillars’ preferred food includes wild cherry hawthorn and wild plum tree leaves but I have also seen them munching away on pecan trees. While they do defoliate some branches in the short run in the long run they will not harm those trees unless the tree is extremely young or small. According to UF/IFAS known predators for these caterpillars include frogs mice skunks and over 60 species of birds. And right now when we have so many birds nesting these caterpillars are a welcome food source.

The best thing to do is to leave the caterpillars alone and within a few weeks they will disappear. If you need to protect a small or young tree then the best way to get rid of the eastern tent caterpillars is to prune out the limbs where you see a caterpillar nest. If you feel the need to spray an insecticide on them please use an insecticide with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (a bacterium) or diflubenzuron as the active ingredients in these are less likely to harm other good insects such as bees. Whatever you do do not try to burn them out. For some reason that was a popular method to get rid of them 40 years ago and resulted in more human injuries and dead trees than eliminated caterpillars. It is just not worth it.

I noticed on a neighborhood website that a lot of parents were asking if it was okay for their children to play around them and the answer is yes. But it is still a good idea to confirm the caterpillar is the eastern tent caterpillar before your child encounters them because there are some fuzzy caterpillars that sting. The eastern tent caterpillar is described as two to two-and-a-half inches long has a black head and a body covered with long light brown hairs. It has a white stripe on its back bordered by yellow brown and black wavy lines. The moths that emerge from the caterpillars are reddish brown with white stripes.

Yes I understand that the eastern tent caterpillars may bother some people but basically they are not a problem insect and they will not harm you. Just think of them as free bird food and enjoy the springtime bird songs.

The Caterpillar 3512E Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending Engine sold around the world and made in Lafayette recently earned high honors from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA bestowed the 2020 Clean Air Excellence Award for Clean Air Technology on the 3512E engine crediting the machinery for enabling operations ""to reduce diesel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining power performance and reliability.""

The federal agency created by President Richard Nixon in 1970 and tasked with establishing and enforcing national standards for maintaining environmental laws described the Lafayette-made engine as ""the first and only Dynamic Gas Blending (DGB) engine in the industry.""

Given the only award in Clean Air Excellence Caterpillar joined other national companies on the EPA's 2020 award list including nods given for Community Action Education/Outreach and Transportation Efficiency Innovations.

The engine said Caterpillar Large Engine Operation General Manager Joe Markun is a brilliant invention built with the ability to switch between fuel sources – diesel and natural gas – in real time depending on what the customer needs in the moment.

""And the customer"" said Markun ""doesn't have to do the thinking.""

Two years in production the engine Markun said monitors hundreds of data points a minute burning diesel or gas as the situation requires and limiting the waste of natural gas a byproduct of oil-and-gas production.

""That means you save big on fuel without giving up the power performance reliability or ease of maintenance and packaging of a Cat diesel engine"" notes the Caterpillar description of the 3512E. ""No other DGB engine on the market can match it.""

Markun said the award serves as a testament to the people who work at the Lafayette plant.

""It's a big award from the EPA"" he said ""especially for an engine that is only made in Lafayette and is sent to customers all over the world.""

Attributes of the engine according to Caterpillar include:

Industry’s best diesel displacement rate of 85% — reducing operating costs significantly

Industry’s widest fuel flexibility — operating on CNG LNG pipeline gas and field gas

Industry’s greatest GHG reduction — resulting in no net increase compared to the diesel model

Industry’s biggest technology advancements — keeping displacement high and emissions low

Lowest possible fuel costs. Smaller environmental footprint. Robust diesel performance.

Headquartered in Deerfield Ill. since 2017 century-old Caterpillar is cited as a Fortune 100 company the cream of the United States' 500 top companies for total revenue. The Lafayette manufacturing building at 3701 South Street consists of nearly 1.3 million square feet under one roof according to the company's website.

Production reduced temporarily at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic but has returned to normal operations a company spokesperson told the Journal & Courier.

Caterpillar here employs as many as 1300 people and has posted jobs worth as much as $27.95 an hour according to the Journal & Courier. The local plant is hiring a spokesperson told the Journal & Courier and interested applicants can visit www.caterpiller.com/careers.

""When you look at some of the largest employers in the Lafayette area"" Markun said ""we are one of them. There are several good jobs here all the way from assembly to machinists – we need skilled labor.""

The Caterpillar plant works closely with schools and the area chambers of commerce to insure a pipeline of skilled employees he said.

In the larger deal LaSalle Investment Management acquired a Beverly Hills property owned by UBS Realty Investors for $74.4 million.



The five-story office building is located at 9033 Wilshire Blvd. It has nearly 50000 square feet and counts USC’s Keck Medical Center as an anchor tenant.



Newmark Group Inc.’s Kevin Shannon Rob Hannan Ken White and Laura Stumm represented the seller. Newmark’s Steven Salas also helped with the sale which the brokerage announced March 25.



“The medical sector is a high-conviction product for investment capital post-pandemic because of the typical predictability and durability of their tenants” Shannon said in a statement.



The property was renovated in 2011. It was designed by SIM & Associates and contains a surgery center a full-service pharmacy and valet parking.



Beverly Hills continues to see high demand for medical office space with direct vacancy in the single digits since 2002 according to Newmark data.



The property “is one of the elite medical office buildings in Beverly Hills. Its elevated status has attracted leading physicians in their practices who have patients travelling from all around the world for care” Hannan said in a statement.



In the second sale Brentwood-based GPI Cos. purchased a nearly 30000-square-foot medical office building in Santa Monica for $22.5 million.



The property located at 1450 10th St. was sold by Lexham. It was renovated in 2008 and is leased to Kaiser Permanente as well as medical specialists.



The building was 95% leased at the time of the sale according to CoStar Group Inc.



Medical office space has fared better than conventional offices during the Covid-19

pandemic. Market experts say patients prefer to go to office buildings near their homes instead of crowded hospitals during the pandemic while doctors favor offices spaces over hospitals for similar reasons.



Because of the high costs for a tenant to build out medical office space the buildings tend to have much lower turnover than conventional office properties.



Earlier in March Newmark announced the sale of an 8409-square-foot medical office building in Carson for $5.1 million. The building sits on more than an acre at 21501 Avalon Blvd. and is 100% leased to Providence Health & Services.

FRISCO Texas — Another California company plans to shift its corporate hub to North Texas and this time it’s in Frisco.

Wiley X which provides eyewear with military toughness for the outdoors is set to relocate its headquarters from Livermore located on the edge of the Bay Area according to David Villarina director of marketing for the company. The company which has over 100 employees will move its headquarters and manufacturing operations to Texas.

The company joins a growing list of California-based companies looking to the Dallas area for a new HQ home with recent shifts including Schwab and CBRE. For Wiley X Frisco provides a business-friendly environment and a location that makes shipping more efficient Villarina said.

“The executive team and the business owners are committed to growing the company” Villarina said. “And in order for us to take this company to the next level we believe that an environment such as the one in Frisco is going to help us accommodate more aggressive growth.”

The company specializes in eyewear that appeals not just to the military but to people who like to fish play volleyball or cycle. That includes sunglasses and eyeglasses. The testing can be intense for the products including for example whether a pair can withstand a blast from a 12-gauge.",,,,,,,,,

While flying along and through a strong band of thunderstorms the plane a Boeing 737-400 operated by iAero Airways lost pressure and oxygen masks were deployed.

Michigan was returning to Ann Arbor from San Antonio after a 78-75 loss in overtime to Baylor in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 on Saturday afternoon. The plane departed Texas at 8:16 p.m. Central time for the roughly 2½-hour flight but made the diverted landing at 10:07 Central according to the FlightAware plane tracking site.

As the plane flew through the band of storms there had been considerable turbulence before it made what was described as an ""aggressive descent."" Because of the loss of pressure the compartments containing oxygen masks opened and fell according to Sarah VanMetre who handles athletic department communications for Michigan women’s basketball.

We're running a new-subscriber special. Support local journalism and subscribe here.

There were no injuries VanMetre said in a text to The Detroit News ""other than being scared."" There were a few bloody noses several minutes after the flight landed but those resulted from the pressurization changes and not from any in-flight jostling VanMetre said. Coach Kim Barnes Arico and members of the team have not been available for comment.

According to FlightAware data the plane had reached an altitude of 37000 feet at 9:39:56 p.m. Central and by 9:41:57 had dropped to 27950. At 9:45:49 p.m. the plane had descended to 15700 feet and was diverted to Evansville at 9:45:56. It landed at 10:07 p.m.

The team which had departed its San Antonio hotel at 7 p.m. spent nearly six hours in the Evansville airport ordered pizza and boarded a differeplane for a 3:54 a.m. departure. The Wolverines were in the air for 59 minutes and landed at Willow Run in Ypsilanti at 5:53 a.m. Eastern time. VanMetre said Sunday morning optional vehicle travel had been arranged but with a 425-mile drive but everyone chose to fly.

News of the incident was shared late Saturday night by Michigan assistant coach Toyelle Wilson who posted on Twitter a photograph of coach Kim Barnes Arico her staff and team in the plane about 15 minutes after it had landed in Evansville. The oxygen masks are clearly visible dangling from compartment above their seats.

“Just went through the worst flying experience” Wilson wrote on Twitter. “We are flying back to MI & hit a storm-lost pressurization- the oxygen masks dropped from the compartments. Told bc we dropped at a certain feet & had to use them.” She asked for prayers after they landed.

This is not the first time a Michigan basketball team has had flight issues. In 2017 the Michigan's men's basketball team was preparing to fly to Washington D.C. to play in the Big Ten tournament when its charter skidded off the runway at Willow Run in Ypsilanti still going 115 mph. Players coaches and other members of the traveling party had to exit the plane which suffered extensive damage via inflatable chutes. An investigation found a jammed part was the reason for the accident.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYnkuY29tL2hvbWVwYWdlLXNob3djYXNlL2NpdHktb2YtbW9ycm8tYmF5LXNsby1jb3VudHktcGxhbnMtdG8tcHJlc2VydmUtcHVibGljLWFjY2Vzcy10by1kb2ctYmVhY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City of Morro Bay SLO County plans to preserve public access to Dog Beach,"The Morro Bay Dog Beach is one of San Luis Obispo County’s beloved hidden gems and is currently in the process of becoming public land.

Morro Bay city and San Luis Obispo County officials said they will purchase parts of it from the current owner Chevron and share responsibility.

Since the stretch of beach belongs to the energy corporation beachgoers could be penalized for trespassing but that will dissolve when the city and county own it.

The Morro Bay Dog Beach is one of the few places where neighbors can let their dogs run off leash.

“Chevron stopped using the tanker loading facility more than 20 years ago and with the current non-use of the area their decision was to sell that property to unload it from their portfolio"" San Luis Obispo County District 2 Supervisor Bruce Gibson said.

Last Tuesday the city of Morro Bay agreed to the terms of sale but are hammering out details with Chevron before signing the final agreement within the next month or two.

Last year San Luis Obispo County bought the north end of the dog beach.

“From the viewpoint of a resident they won’t notice a difference most likely. The parking lots would be in the city the dog beach extends beyond the city boundary"" Morro Bay City Manager Scott Collins said. ""We have a really good relationship with the county. It’s not going to lead to any inter-jurisdictional issues or warfare if you will we’re all working together.”

However some parts of the area will need to be rehabilitated because of the environmental damage.

Chevron officials said it will continue to own those parts until they are resolved.

Jeff Moore the Corporate Affairs Adviser for Chevron Corporation said in a statement:

“Chevron Land and Development Company is pleased to collaborate with The Trust for Public Land City of Morro Bay and Cayucos Sanitary District to work toward conserving the beach as open space for the enjoyment of the community. This creative collaboration will also incorporate the Panorama Lots into the City of Morro Bay’s sphere of influence and allow for their possible annexation. If annexed the city and its residents would have increased influence over any future development of the Panorama Lots.” Jeff Moore the Corporate Affairs Advisor for Chevron Corporate

“One really exciting aspect about having the land west of the highway owned by the city and the county is now we have secured the right of way for a trail that will connect the north end of Morro Bay to the community of Cayucos"" Supervisor Gibson said.

According to the city and county land that remains affected by Chevron’s previous activity will be under the corporation’s responsibility to restore.

“Over the years various amounts of oil and chemicals have been spilled on the ground and have seeped into the water and Chevron has to identify and remove and treat all of those areas where there is contamination by the petrochemicals that were their stock and trade"" Supervisor Gibson said.

After fixing that Chevron has an option to sell more of the property to the public.

So far the city and county spent about $380000 for the land.

Chipotle Mexican Grill doesn't quite have a reputation for being the cheapest meal in town (yes we know the guac is extra) so it should come as no surprise that the chain's CEO Brian Niccol rakes in a massive paycheck every year. According to Salary.com Niccol who also serves as Chipotle's Chairman of the Board has regularly earned eight figures in total compensation since taking over as the company's head honcho in 2018.

However it wouldn't be wrong to say that Niccol has earned his pay. Per Chipotle's website the Miami University grad was CEO of Taco Bell directly prior to taking over at the fast-casual Mexican restaurant and has also held several other management positions within Yum! Brands and Procter & Gamble during his career. He has earned considerable praise and numerous accolades during his first few years at the helm of Chipotle as well. In 2019 Niccol was ranked third on the list for ""Businessperson of the Year"" by Fortune which was followed up with the title of ""Restaurant Leader of the Year"" by Restaurant Business.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Europe’s biggest insurer is discussing its options with potential advisers said the people asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. While Allianz views Hartford as one of the remaining property and casualty insurance targets with scale in the U.S. it’s also reluctant to enter into a pricey bidding war with Chubb because of a lack of synergies between the two the people said.

Deliberations are in an early stage and Allianz could likely decide against pursuing a deal which would be transformational for the German financial giant that has mostly stayed away from mega transactions the people said.

Representatives for Allianz and Hartford declined to comment on the story.

In spite of its dominance in Europe Allianz has a relatively small footprint compared with Chubb or other peers in the world’s largest economy. A combination of Chubb and Hartford could further marginalize the German insurer in the U.S. which like other insurance companies is battling low interest rates slowing growth and Covid-related business costs.

Among other European insurers Zurich Insurance Group AG isn’t currently considering such a deal according to a person familiar with the matter. The Swiss insurer agreed in December to buy MetLife Inc.’s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion. A spokesperson for Zurich declined to comment.

Hartford rejected Chubb’s proposal earlier in the week putting pressure on Evan Greenberg to sweeten the offer. A post-bid jump in its stock has pushed Hartford’s market value to $24 billion as of Friday’s close. Chubb has a market cap of $71.9 billion while Allianz is worth 87.9 billion euros ($103.7 billion).

Mergers and acquisitions among property and casualty insurers have been active in recent years. It’s the biggest sector within insurance and life coverage has fallen out of favor with many groups due to low interest rates and higher capital requirements.

Allianz’s Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has largely avoided major acquisitions since taking the helm. Still he’s been seeking new avenues of growth including a 2.5 billion euro deal in the past week to acquire Aviva Plc’s Polish life insurance business.

The German company did pursue a takeover of property and casualty insurer XL Group Ltd. in 2018 before losing out to France’s Axa SA which paid over $15 billion for the asset.

U.S. Footprint

Allianz has a life-insurance business in the U.S. and is mainly serving large companies in the country in the property and casualty space. It also owns U.S. bond asset manager Pacific Investment Management Co. or Pimco. Buying Hartford could help expand the business with smaller corporations and any deal could also help make consolidation easier in the future through synergies.

Among the financing options for such a deal include a capital increase raising debt and offering stock. The insurer also has excess cash and could lower the amount of its annual dividend or buyback. In November Allianz canceled a share buyback program that it had suspended earlier in the year as the hit from the Covid-19 pandemic continued to mount.

There’s also history with Hartford. The U.S. company turned to Allianz for capital in 2008 agreeing to pay 10% on $1.75 billion of debt as capital markets froze.

City sources said Chubb Fire & Safety was being prepared for sale by its US owner Carrier Global Corporation.

Financiers from Bank of America are said to be working with Carrier whose market capitalisation stands at $35billion (£25billion) on a possible sale of Chubb.

The firm was set up by Charles and Jeremiah Chubb in 1818 when the brothers patented the 'detector lock' which jams shut if someone tries to pick it.

The lock's popularity grew rapidly as the Industrial Revolution saw huge growth in cities but also a rise in crime.

Chubb opened a factory in Wolverhampton and started making wrought iron doors and burglar resistant safes too.

It continued to perform well amid growing demand for security and in 1964 expanded into fire safety by acquiring Read & Campbell the inventor of pressurised fire extinguishers.

Since then the company has grown further and now has operations across the world including Australia Thailand and India.

Chubb is expected to draw interest from some of Europe's largest private equity firms.

Two years ago Carrier's former parent United Technologies Corporation tried to sell Chubb. Reports suggested buyout firms including Apax PAI Partners and Eurazeo showed an interest. But United Technologies opted against a sale after failing to get offers at a high enough price.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Pengakuan Sumarno

Saat diinterogasi Angga Sumarno awalnya tak mengetahui sosok Andin.

Sumarno pura-pura lupa pernah bertemu Andin di luar rumah untuk mengantarkan makanan.

Namun Angga terus mendesak. Angga sebenarnya menginginkan kesaksian lebih dari itu untuk menguatkan bukti.

Angga juga bingung kenapa Sumarno harus kabur saat ditemui Rendy.

Sayangnya Sumarno sebelumnya telah diultimatum Elsa untuk tidak menyebut namanya.

Jika tidak Elsa akan meminta kembali uang Rp 500 juta yang telah diberikan.

Apakah Sumarno akan memberitahu Angga dan Aldebaran bahwa ia disuruh Elsa?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL21hdGFyYW0udHJpYnVubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9wZXJqYWxhbmFuLWNpbnRhLWRlc2lyZWUtdGFyaWdhbi1jZXJhaS1kYXJpLWF5YWgtYmFtcy1kaW5pa2FoaS1ob3RtYS1zaXRvbXB1bC03LXRhaHVuLWtlbXVkaWFu0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbWF0YXJhbS50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9wZXJqYWxhbmFuLWNpbnRhLWRlc2lyZWUtdGFyaWdhbi1jZXJhaS1kYXJpLWF5YWgtYmFtcy1kaW5pa2FoaS1ob3RtYS1zaXRvbXB1bC03LXRhaHVuLWtlbXVkaWFu?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perjalanan Cinta Desiree Tarigan: Cerai dari Ayah Bams Dinikahi Hotma Sitompul 7 Tahun Kemudian,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://mataram.tribunnews.com/2021/03/28/perjalanan-cinta-desiree-tarigan-cerai-dari-ayah-bams-dinikahi-hotma-sitompul-7-tahun-kemudian on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL21hdGFyYW0udHJpYnVubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9wZXJqYWxhbmFuLWNpbnRhLWRlc2lyZWUtdGFyaWdhbi1jZXJhaS1kYXJpLWF5YWgtYmFtcy1kaW5pa2FoaS1ob3RtYS1zaXRvbXB1bC03LXRhaHVuLWtlbXVkaWFu0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vbWF0YXJhbS50cmlidW5uZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9wZXJqYWxhbmFuLWNpbnRhLWRlc2lyZWUtdGFyaWdhbi1jZXJhaS1kYXJpLWF5YWgtYmFtcy1kaW5pa2FoaS1ob3RtYS1zaXRvbXB1bC03LXRhaHVuLWtlbXVkaWFu?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhcy5pZC9iYWNhL2NlcnBlbi1oaWJ1cmFuLzIwMjEvMDMvMjgvY2VycGVuLXBlcmloYWwtbWVueWVkZXJoYW5ha2FuLWNpbnRh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perihal Menyederhanakan Cinta,"Kami sedang menikmati bulan purnama yang indah di taman belakang rumahku. Bumi menceritakan cerita orang-orang bijak. Kadang aku lelah mendengarnya karena nyatanya ia tak sebijak yang ia ceritakan.

Pagi yang basah oleh embun dan burung-burung berlarian di langit bersorak bahagia aku masih duduk dengan kantong mata tebal meratapi kegilaanku pada lelaki yang mungkin sedang tidur lelap dalam pelukan istrinya. Orang-orang berpikir apakah aku dapat menanggung kebodohan ini selama sisa hidupku? Aku pun berpikir demikian. Bumi nama lelaki itu. Lelaki yang jika dalam sehari ada delapan puluh enam ribu empat ratus detik maka namanya mengisi sepertiga dari detik dalam sehari dalam pikiranku sisanya mungkin aku sedang tidur. Namanya mengambang antara kebencian dan kecintaanku. Begitu tipiskah beda di antara keduanya?

Percayakah kau bahwa suatu hari hujan turun karena alasan sederhana awan-awan mencair karena panas oleh hati seorang perempuan yang diselubungi cemburu? Orang-orang percaya cemburu itu perlu cemburu itu bagian paling nyata dalam cinta. Aku lebih percaya pada cinta yang baik yang tidak ingin ada luka. Adakah cinta dalam hati seseorang jika ia bersikeras untuk lebih menyakitimu ketimbang membuatmu merasa bahagia? Tapi benarkah bahwa cinta selalu menanggung segalanya? Ya segala-galanya. Hati yang luka tubuh yang luka kebersamaan yang luka kenangan yang luka.

Aku menyesap rokokku dalam-dalam mungkin ini sudah puluhan batang sekian. Aku duduk mengamati jendela dengan tirai yang masih tertutup di dalam ruangan gelap tanpa cahaya. Aku sedang mengamati kehampaan pikirku. Pernahkah kau bertemu seseorang dan seketika saja hidupmu seolah hanya berkisar tentangnya. Jika ada laki-laki lain dalam pikiranmu itu hanya ilusi yang kau ciptakan di balik segala penolakannya terhadap dirimu.

Aku tidak pernah berpikir bahwa Bumi tidak mencintaiku. Tapi jelas ia tidak pernah memilihku. Pernah sebuah drama Korea menyebutkan kurang lebih begini dalam satu kalimatnya yang selalu kuingat. ”Apakah karena aku menginginkan tas milik perempuan lain karena itu aku dalam penderitaan ini?” Seingatku kalimatnya demikian. Menusuk tepat hatiku yang naif. Aku sedang menginginkan suami milik perempuan lain.

Sebenarnya tepatnya ia yang lebih dulu menginginkanku. Akan kuceritakan secara singkat pertemuan kami yang kemudian membuat kami sendiri babak belur dihajar keinginan kami.

Aku pikir sebagai perempuan aku cukup lovable. Aku memiliki kulit putih dengan porsi tubuh ideal dan wajah yang mungkin akan dilirik satu dua laki-laki ketika aku berpapasan dengan mereka. Aku memiliki kehidupan yang cukup menarik secara materi. Aku mandiri dan pekerja keras. Aku pintar dalam beberapa hal terutama menulis dan memasak. Aku kecanduan pada hal-hal yang mungkin buruk untuk kesehatan merokok dan begadang. Aku lebih menyukai kota ketimbang desa. Lebih menyukai puisi ketimbang apa pun di muka bumi ini. Aku bukan perempuan matre ini satu hal yang banyak diidamkan laki-laki. Aku lebih percaya bahwa uang datang dari Tuhan bukan dari sosok seorang laki-laki yang harus terus aku peloroti. Dalam urusan ranjang aku mungkin tidak perlu diragukan.

Bukankah segala yang aku tawarkan itu cukup menarik bagi seorang Bumi yang bosan dengan hiruk-pikuk rumah tanggannya yang sudah belasan tahun ia jalani. Aku jelas lebih menarik daripada istrinya. Tapi yang lebih penting adalah aku memberikan tantangan baru bagi hidupnya yang datar.

Kami memutuskan berpacaran tepat pada ciuman pertama kami. Tidak satu hari pun dilewatkan Bumi untuk tidak mencium aroma tubuhku. Sampai detik-detik di mana ia begitu gilanya padaku. ”Istriku aku akan menceraikannya.” Tanpa ragu Bumi mengatakan karena ia sedang dilanda kegilaannya padaku.

Kami pergi ke semua tempat yang bisa kami datangi tanpa takut hubungan kami ketahuan. Kami pergi ke pantai mendengar ombak dan melihat pasangan yang lebih romantis dari kami ternyata orang-orang juga sedang jatuh cinta pikirku. Tapi apakah mereka juga menjalani hubungan rumit seperti yang kami jalani? Setiap akhir pekan kami pergi ke bioskop dan setelahnya di sebuah kafé yang ramai kami menertawakan dan memuji hebatnya film yang kami tonton. Kami pergi ke toko buku Bumi akan langsung menuju rak non-fiksinya. Aku menemaninya sebentar tapi selalu singgah untuk melirik buku-buku sastra. Aku mencintai puisi Bumi pun sama tertariknya. Kami pergi ke danau melihat keindahannya menikmati anginnya berpelukan dan pergi.

Kami berdiskusi banyak hal. Politik agama musik film buku dan hal yang terabsurd sekalipun hidup. Kebanyakan dari hasil diskusi kami adalah Bumi yang akhirnya ngambek. Dia selalu menyatakan bahwa dirinya adalah orang yang berpikiran terbuka senang Amerika dan kritik. Tapi lebih baik jangan percaya kata-katanya. Jika berdebat aku selalu kalah karena akhirnya aku harus terbawa drama ngambek-nya. Dia orang yang konvensional pada dasarnya membenci kebebasan menghina kemodernan dan yang paling parah adalah menganut itu secara berlebihan.

Bumi adalah orang yang akan terus menasehatiku untuk tidak merokok. Dia mengatakan itu jutaan kali mungkin tanpa bosan. Dia akan mengajakku jalan-jalan kemana pun kapan pun jika memang dia sedang di sampingku. Dia akan menceritakan kisah lucu tapi lebih banyak kisah bijak sebelum aku tidur atau ketika aku sedang sedih dan mengutuki kehidupanku. Dia terus menceramahiku perihal agama dan moral. Dia akan memijat kakiku ketika aku terlihat stres.

Aku memasak makanan enak untuk Bumi jika aku sedang rajin tapi aku lebih banyak mengajaknya makan di luar. Aku membuatkan kopi terenak saat ia sedang bekerja. Aku selalu memakai pakaian terbaikku ketika aku bertemu dengannya aku ingin selalu terlihat cantik untuknya aku ingin dia selalu mengagumiku tanpa pernah menjadikan kekuranganku alasan untuk meninggalkanku. Aku akan memijatnya kapan pun ia terlihat lelah. Aku tidak akan merepotkannya masalah uang karena aku ingin berusaha terus membuatnya nyaman. Aku akan berusaha terus mempercayainya walaupun aku tahu dia pembohong. Saat aku terus melakukan ini aku sadar aku sendiri telah berusaha membuatnya nyaman tapi aku sendiri tidak. Saat kau mulai memutuskan mencintai seseorang saat itulah kupikir kau akan kehilangan sebagian dirimu.

Aku terus berusaha berpikir bahwa cinta berjalan sedemikian wajar pada kami berdua. Kami bahagia terlepas seberapa konservatif Bumi dan seberapa modern aku. Kami tahu kapan kami harus menyesuaikan satu sama lain. Tapi masalah terbesar bagi kami bukanlah apakah kami cocok atau tidak. Tapi ini mengenai tas milik orang lain.

”Apa kau bahagia dengan keadaan ini?” Bumi menanyaiku ketika kami sedang joging di taman. Aku terengah. Tepat demikian itulah juga hatiku. ”Aku tahu kau tidak. Sampai sekarang aku belum bisa menceraikan istriku. Maaf.”

Kata terakhir itu yang sebenarnya tidak pernah bisa aku maafkan. Apakah kau harus menunggu untuk laki-laki yang mulai ragu-ragu? Aku menanyai diriku. Aku putuskan ya aku menunggu. Terlepas apa yang menanti di ujung sana.

Malam itu aku rasakan angin lebih dingin dari biasanya. Bumi duduk dan membacakanku cerita Seribu Kunang-kunang di Manhattan. Aku pikir ia sedang tidak membaca buku tapi mengisahkan ulang kisah kami sama menderitanya aku dan perempuan dalam kisah itu. Berbulan sejak kisah itu aku masih percaya Bumi akan menepati janjinya ia hanya perlu waktu sedikit lagi.

Kami sedang menikmati bulan purnama yang indah di taman belakang rumahku. Bumi menceritakan cerita orang-orang bijak. Kadang aku lelah mendengarnya karena nyatanya ia tak sebijak yang ia ceritakan. Ia tak sebijak pengetahuannya tentang kebijaksanaan. Saat Bumi sibuk dengan kisahnya sebuah pesan masuk Bumi melirik handphone-nya.

”Maaf aku harus pulang anakku sakit.” Bumi menutup pintu rumahku. Air mataku berbisik ”Jangan.” Yang tersisa saat itu hanya aku dan kesunyian.

Aku pikir aku mulai kelelahan menunggu Bumi yang tidak juga bercerai. Aku kehilangan harga diriku sebagai seorang perempuan. Aku menunggu laki-laki yang bisa saja datang atau tidak karena alasan perempuan lain. Aku lelah menunggu Bumi bekerja untuk menafkahi hidup perempuan lain. Aku lelah melihatnya kadang terluka dan bahagia sekaligus karena memiliki dua perempuan di sisinya. Aku cemburu pada banyak hal yang kadang terasa tidak masuk akal.

Kadang kau harus sadar seseorang datang dalam hidupmu hanya karena mereka penasaran dan ingin mencoba. Kamu perempuan yang tidak bisa dilewatkan begitu saja dalam kebosanan hidup yang sudah terlampau jauh menyiksa kebahagiaan laki-laki akan menjadi egois. Jika ada yang harus tersakiti itulah konsekuensi dari kata ”mau” ”ayo” ”coba dulu” ”percaya aku” ”sabar” ”bertahan sedikit lagi”. Pada titik akhirnya mereka hanya akan menjadi dua pilihan bagi diri mereka sendiri pengecut atau penjahat!

Aku ingat sore itu senja sudah hampir menggantung di langit. Bumi datang membawa secangkir teh hangat untukku dan kopi susu untuknya. Kami duduk di beranda mengawasi angin yang lalu-lalang dalam napas kami.

”Aku ingin bicara.” Bumi membuka kalimatnya dan aku tahu pertanda buruk sedang menggantung di atas kepala Bumi. ”Istriku hamil.” Hanya ada dua pilihan ”Jika ingin bertahan dengan hubungan ini aku akan menikahimu tapi tidak menceraikan istriku.” Bumi menyesap udara sedangkan aku seperti kehabisan udara di tenggorakanku. ”Atau pilihan yang lebih baik kau akan mendapatkan laki-laki yang jauh lebih baik dariku kau akan bahagia.”

Kita sadar agama menjanjikan surga bagi perempuan yang ikhlas berpoligami bukankah surga tidak melalui jalan yang benar-benar mudah? Surga mungkin tidak akan didapatkan hanya dengan berpangku tangan dan bahagia kau perlu usaha lebih. Setidaknya bersabar dalam penderitaan. Tapi mampukah aku ikhlas dalam keserakahan seorang lelaki?

Aku berpikir keras tentang hal yang setiap detiknya aku pikirkan semenjak hubungan kami. Betapa bodohnya aku memikirkan hal yang sama setahun belakangan padahal aku tahu hari ini memang akan datang. Aku percaya laki-laki yang mengatakan rumah tangganya berantakan dan ingin berpisah dan menginginkan aku. Aku telah percaya pada laki-laki yang setelah ia berhasil menaklukkanku ia katakan ia lebih mencintai keluarganya yang tadinya berantakan. Aku membiarkan pertanyaan Bumi menggantung seperti senja yang saat ini menggantung di depan kami. Betapa sulitnya menyederhanakan cinta pikirku.

Ketika itu banyak teman-teman saya mengatakan gaya logat bicara orang Aceh mirip dengan orang Malaysia. Di tahun berikutnya saya liburan ke Pulau Penang Malaysia.

Ternyata memang benar logat orang Aceh berbicara sangat mirip dengan Malaysia. Tak heran mengapa ketika berbicara saya tak begitu kesusahan. Jarak Aceh dengan Malaysia pun hanya kurang lebih dua jam naik pesawat karena alasan tersebut lebih banyak orang Aceh yang berobat ke Malaysia dibandingkan ke Pulau Jawa.

Ternyata Logat Aceh yang Mirip Malaysia Berhubungan dengan Sejarah Masa Lalu

Kerajaan Aceh di masa lalu sangat masyhur dan terkenal. Luas wilayahnya bahkan mencakup semenanjung Malaya termasuk Johor Malaka Pahang Kedah Perak sampai Patani (Thailand bagian selatan). Tentu saja masa ini digapai di era Sultan Iskandar Muda berkuasa.

Tak hanya taktik perang dan gaya kepemimpinan Sultan Iskandar Muda memiliki kisah Cinta yang Romantis

Ketika memerintah kerajaan Aceh Sultan Iskandar Muda jatuh hatinya pada seorang gadis putri asal dari Pahang Malaysia. Putri tersebut menikah dan masyarakat Aceh memanggilnya Putroe Phang ( Putroe artinya putri sedangkan Phang artinya Pahang hanya saja disingkat jadi Phang).

Layaknya istri ikutlah sang putri untuk tinggal di Banda Aceh. Sebagai seorang pemimpin tentu saja Sultan Iskandar Muda memiliki kesibukan yang padat. Dikarenakan alasan tersebut Putroe Phang sering merasa kesepian dan rindu dengan kampung halamannya di Pahang.

Gunongan sumber : https://instagram.com/mughniemuhammad

Sultan Iskandar Muda pun paham akan kesedihan istrinya. Untuk mengobati rasa rindu istrinya dibangunlah gunung kecil seperti di Pahang yang diberi nama gunongan. Serta taman yang mengelilingi istana yang sekarang disebut dengan taman Putroe Phang.

Dibangunnya taman dan gunongan ini membuat sang istri senang. Di taman ini terdapat sungai yang biasa digunakan sang Putri untuk mandi bersama dayang-dayang.

Tak hanya itu di taman ini terdapat pintu khop yang digunakan sang putri untuk beristirahat setelah mandi dan sang dayang-dayang pun membasuh rambut sang putri ketika sedang beristirahat. Gunongan sendiri berbentuk seperti gunung. Dahulu taman Putroe Phang dan Gunongan menyatu namun sejak kedatangan Belanda bangunan tersebut dipisah dan dibangun jalan diantaranya.

It certainly wasn’t as dramatic as that but it turns out there is a logical explanation for what occurred: Dog vomit.

Because this involved an NFL Insider Yates’s fellow ESPN NFL Insider broke the news.

Breaking: @FieldYates’ golden retriever Cisco puked three feet from his father as Yates was mid answer on ESPN’s NFL Live Yates confirmed. It is why Yates’ live shot suddenly shook. “Still a very good boy” Yates texted. pic.twitter.com/XqBnHPkM1P — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 26 2021

Yates corroborated the report with a follow-up tweet that also showcased his ability to have a laugh at his own expense.

Credit to host Laura Rutledge for noticing something was askance with Yates at that moment even though there wasn’t much to be done about it. At least not until the cameras were off and the clean-up began.

By Stephen Wilson

In a virtual environment exploring careers in distant cities has never been easier.

That’s what 260 students did thanks to 47 employer hosts. Over the course of December and January participants learned about media and communications in New York City; life science and finance in Boston and New York City; government communications and research in Washington D.C.; and technology and innovation in New York City Boston and the West Coast.

“The virtual nature of Career Tracks this year opened doors that regulations and restrictions can often keep closed when the program operates physically” says Mike Summers associate vice president of Gateway Career Center. “This afforded us opportunities that were broader and more distinct.”

This valuable behind-the-scenes look at specific industries helped students better understand their futures and build connections with alumni parents and friends of the College.

“I have found our hosts to be incredibly open about sharing their career experience as well as giving great advice around interviewing individual educational investment and work etiquette” says Holly Akers associate director of employer relations and outreach at Gateway Career Center.

“The virtual environment allowed us to invite alumni and hosts from across the country and globe to participate” says Josh Walker associate director of employer relations and outreach at Gateway Career Center. “Based on the feedback from students the impact this global perspective had on them was profound.”

Here are some highlights.

Finance

Tracks in New York City and Boston focused on a range of topics including bulge bracket boutique banks private banks financial consultants and wealth managers. Students had the opportunity to hear from successful alumni about what their career and daily work experience looks like. Students were introduced to industry organizations as trusted resources related to industry trends continuing education and career development beyond the classroom.

“Lafayette’s true differentiator is the alumni network and their willingness to help out another Pard. I hadn’t participated in Career Tracks in the past because I live in Los Angeles so having it virtual was great. One of Morgan Stanley’s core values is ‘giving back.’ It’s nice to work for a firm that encourages their employees to do so. Career Tracks is a terrific value-add for students providing an opportunity to hear from successful alumni and parents who can offer an authentic lens into a career path they may have an interest in pursuing. Having the opportunity to connect and ask questions that they may not feel comfortable asking in an interview is a definite advantage of participating.”

John Tully ’07 director Equities Advisory Sales Bank of America Securities

“Career Tracks have been a pivotal aspect to Bank of America’s recruiting program. As an alumni I take great pride in facilitating Lafayette alumnus from across various business units inside the organization to participate in this now annual event. We have taken the opportunity to present career paths for traditional sales and trading/investment banking as well as for wealth management careers under the Merrill/Bank of America private bank division. I feel that my career success is a result of my time at Lafayette College and I am happy to help my fellow Pards with their career development and aspirations.”

Sebastian Crapanzano ’97 head of institutional sales and trading counterparty risk Morgan Stanley

“I have had the great pleasure of being part of Lafayette Career Tracks since its inception. It has been an incredible experience and I’ve watched the program grow in importance and relevance to Lafayette students. Additional alumni and I have always appreciated the opportunity to present Morgan Stanley as a possible career path for students. Career Tracks has consistently brought about positive connections with students making for lasting impressions and many successful hires over the years.”

Michael Higdon ’99 principal and founder A1.9 Strategies

“As a first-time alumni host my experience was extremely positive as I had the opportunity to virtually meet and engage a group of wildly talented students who are considering a career in public policy advocacy politics and government. To no surprise the Lafayette students were genuinely interested full of poise and asked great questions from how to start on Capitol Hill to navigating graduate school. The overall depth of interest encouraged me to facilitate a springtime alumni panel featuring a dozen successful alumni at various stages of their careers and across a broad spectrum of congressional offices government organizations and private business employers. Between Career Tracks and the alumni panel these student-alumni interactive events proved meaningful and rewarding.”

Pamela Passman ’83 corporate and philanthropic leader Washington D.C.

“I was excited when the Gateway Career Center approached me to be a part of their first-ever D.C.-focused Career Tracks. I appreciated the opportunity to share my experience and the various career paths I have seen available to students as they contemplate a first job or graduate school in Washington D.C. The students were curious and engaged and very interested in legal and policy careers that could take them to a government agency Capitol Hill think tanks or research organizations law firms public interest organizations or businesses. Their thoughtful and rapid-fire questions kept the discussion lively and we learned from one another. It was a pleasure to help students see paths to achieving a meaningful career in D.C.”

Lauren Johnson ’19 health systems clinical consultant ImmunoDiagnostics ThermoFisher Scientific

“This year’s virtual approach allowed for more interactions than ever. Career Services did a phenomenal job at getting panelists who have different backgrounds within the same field. The panel was an open discussion so students had an opportunity to ask us whatever they wanted in a relaxed and friendly environment. About three or four students expressed interest in my company after the event. I experienced firsthand how making these connections is so important for students. I attended the Boston Career Tracks my senior year and met another alumni Tara Mayo ’10 who introduced me to ThermoFisher and the new grad programs they had.”

Mark Murawski ’93 director Contract Services Bayer U.S. LLC

“It’s important for me personally to give back to Lafayette. I’ve worked for three companies since I graduated and each time I moved companies there was a Lafayette alum on the interview panel who ultimately had a large stake in the hiring process. Networking is key. An undergraduate experience is about discovering who you are and making positive connections in the world. I’m more interested in hiring someone who is well rounded has great communication skills willing to work hard and is an avid learner over someone with a 4.0 that can’t hold a conversation.

Timothy R. Hylan ’88 lead Internal Medicine FMD Group and chair Pfizer

“There has never been a more exciting time for a career in biopharmaceuticals. We are all living in a world where we want science to win (and fast!) and bring breakthroughs that change patients’ lives to everyone sooner. We need to inspire the next generation of scientists and leaders to help chart the next innovation. I didn’t realize how much interest there would be in terms of follow-up following our session but within 24 hours after the session I got more than 10 email inquiries from students asking for further advice networking and questions about my career.”

Timothy Skinski ’83 global director Information Technology in Chromatography Services Boehringer Ingelheim

“After providing an overview of a IT laboratory systems group in a pharmaceutical company we had a very interactive discussion which covered many different topic areas (technical cultural international collaboration etc.). The virtual Zoom session enabled an international cross section of my team to participate. This would not have been possible in a traditional setting.”

Abigail Williams ’15 L&D program manager II: Onboarding Suvoda LLC

“One of the students who attended graduated in December 2020 and was immediately able to interview for an associate project manager position. That candidate connected with a few of us after the event and before submitting an application. We’ve had at least one Lafayette alumnus/a join each year since 2015. That puts us at 11 Lafayette co-workers including co-founders Rob Hummel ’06 and Marc Lisi ’08.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3RlcGhhbmllc2Fya2lzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvcmVtb3RlLXdvcmstdGhlLWJsdXJyaW5nLW9mLWJ1c2luZXNzLWFuZC1wZXJzb25hbC1saWZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remote Work: The Blurring Of Business And Personal Life,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniesarkis/2021/03/27/remote-work-the-blurring-of-business-and-personal-life/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3RlcGhhbmllc2Fya2lzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvcmVtb3RlLXdvcmstdGhlLWJsdXJyaW5nLW9mLWJ1c2luZXNzLWFuZC1wZXJzb25hbC1saWZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L255Y3MtbWF5b3JhbC1yYWNlLWZlYXR1cmVzLWEtY2FuZGlkYXRlLWZvci1ldmVyeS10eXBlLW9mLXZvdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NYC's mayoral race features a candidate for every type of voter,"It’s fashionable to say the New York mayoral race is a dud: No one is paying attention the field is weak. False: The Democratic primary fewer than three months away is an embarrassment of riches. Whatever candidate you might conjure up — in policies or background — you can find. The choice is yours.

The contrast to the last two open elections couldn’t be sharper. In 2013 when then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg couldn’t run again voters had their pick of four Democratic candidates. All had come up through Gotham’s establishment politics: Bill de Blasio public advocate and previously a councilman; John Liu comptroller and ex-councilman; Christine Quinn yet another city councilwoman (and speaker); Bill Thompson a former comptroller; and Anthony Wiener Brooklyn congressman and former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer.

Twelve years before that the Democratic field was even less ­“diverse.” Mark Green Freddy Ferrer Peter Vallone Sr. and Alan Hevesi — all party creatures. None could bring a fresh eye. Voters picked the newcomer in the general election: Bloomberg.

This time no one can complain for lack of choice.

You want someone who resembles the prototype Democratic candidate like most of the above? Scott Stringer comptroller has spent his whole life in Big Apple politics and is the only candidate to have won a citywide election.

You want someone who knows how Gotham politics work knows how to build a coalition for whatever he wants to do and knows what New York can and can’t do in Albany? Stringer’s your guy. He also favors massive tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy.

6 City Comptroller Scott Stringer is the only candidate to have won a citywide election. Robert Miller

The runner-up in having mastered the political machine is Eric Adams Brooklyn borough president. Adams grew up in poverty to become an NYPD captain. On taxes he is more circumspect: He wants the wealthy to pay a little more no different than the pro-business candidate Ray McGuire.

McGuire too has an intriguing biography having risen from as he puts it “the wrong side of the tracks” to the top of Citigroup’s ­investment bank.

He doesn’t like it when people compare him to Bloomberg but he is the closest the electorate will come to a neo-Bloomberg if that’s what they want. He will try to get New York out of its mess by pushing private-economy growth.

What if you want an apolitical manager someone who has run not a team of millionaires like McGuire but run a huge city department? Someone who knows how to get the trash picked up and will know how to make sure city departments achieve her priorities?

That would be Kathryn Garcia former Sanitation Department head. She also warns that if we raise taxes on Wall Street it could leave and she thinks that police have a role in policing small crimes like open-air drug use.

You want someone with less hands-on management of a huge public workforce but who is used to dealing with a Washington ­bureaucracy? That would be Shaun Donovan former city housing chief and former DC housing and budget director.

How about something completely different? Dianne Morales is a former public-school teacher and at a nonprofit spent years working with homeless kids. Maya Wiley was Mayor de Blasio’s legal counsel and she wants to transfer many policing jobs — such as cutting crime — to nonpolice both social workers and “violence interrupters.” If you’re ready for a radically different approach to public safety relative to the past 30 years Wiley is your candidate.

Andrew Yang another former nonprofit executive (and Democratic gadfly) has thought about what it takes for entrepreneurs to succeed. He also proposes giving cash to the poorest New Yorkers no strings attached. He wants more policing in the subways and he isn’t big on tax hikes.

Personality? You have to decide who you want to listen to on a screen for the next four years. Stringer and Yang are low-key; Garcia is direct; Adams is the opposite of low-key; Wiley is professionally crisp; Morales is empathetic; McGuire is a sophisticated cosmopolitan right down to his background Zoom library; Donovan is technocratic.

If you are picky and none of these people suits your fancy you can wait until the general election in November and vote Republican. But no one can complain that the race lacks choice.

Fixed income looks set to be increasingly not-so-fixed. BNP Paribas SA Citigroup Inc Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co are teaming up to create a centralised platform that allows investors to change some features of bonds into almost anything they like.

The service to be launched early next year will offer repackaged notes known as repacks that will be issued through a special purpose vehicle according to interviews with the banks involved.

The structured securities allow buyers to alter parts of the profiles of underlying bonds such as turn coupon payments into floating from fixed or switch returns into other currencies.

Low interest rates and tight credit spreads have boosted demand for tailored debt offerings as investors seek more innovative ways of chasing yield.

Most buyers currently have to approach banks for pricing and review lengthy legal documents individually. Stricter global banking regulations means it’s more beneficial to standardise simpler products and trade them via a single entity from one location according to Credit Suisse Group AG.

“Structured product issuance has become more onerous for banks as a result of their balance sheet and funding constraints and as such less attractive to investors” said Paul Bajer director in global credit products at Credit Suisse in London.

“Regulations both local and global have also impacted investors for example requiring them to demonstrate best execution. This is easier to achieve when all banks quote on the same terms via a single platform.”

The lenders will initially introduce the platform in Europe where most requests for the service are coming from as well as Asia where the repack market is significant said Paul Smith head of rates solutions structuring at Citigroup. Annual sales could be as much as $2 billion the banks estimate.

Global investment banks collaborating on a “one-stop-shop” multi-dealer platform isn’t entirely new. In January this year JPMorgan BNP Paribas Goldman Sachs Group Inc Barclays Plc HSBC Holdings Plc and Societe Generale SA teamed up on an equity-linked structured products platform targeting private banks and wealth management firms in Asia.

The ability to issue standardized products from the same special purpose vehicle is a key attraction of the repack platform according to Alistair Bloch executive director in global credit markets & syndicate at JPMorgan in London. In the event of a default there is a potential for the participating banks to step in as new counterparties and avoid terminating the security.

“One of the big issues for investors is that when they ask different counterparties for a price on the same product they never know if it’s really the same product” said Enrico Ballarini director in solutions structuring at BNP Paribas.

“Here the investors will know for a fact that the price will be comparable. There’s much more certainty on getting the best pricing on the same terms.”

Investors such as insurance companies and asset managers are the main buyers of repacks as they offer alternatives to buying over-the-counter derivatives that some institutions may not have the capacity to manage said Credit Suisse’s Bajer. The notes are among the largest and fastest-growing structured product markets Bajer said. Most deals are privately placed."

“There was a meeting two weeks ago between Central Bank and FCB and they said then that they will send in their documents for us to undertake due diligence analyze and process” Central Bank Governor Dr Gobind Ganga told the Sunday Stabroek when contacted for an update.

“No not just documents pertaining to the proposed acquisition but the paperwork needed for a banking licence” he added.

The Bank of Guyana Governor explain-ed that he could not go into detail about the ongoing discussions but when a decision was made it would be made public.

Int’l repute

And as the BoG awaits FCB’s information local and foreign analysts weighed in not only on the deal and what it would mean for Guyana but whether it would be better if the country aggressively pursued a bank of international repute.

Guyana’s Minister with responsibility for Finance Dr Ashni Singh has said that both Government and the Central Bank remain firmly committed to ensuring the maintenance of a stable strong vibrant dynamic and growing financial sector especially during the current period as “it is important that the financial sector is adequately equipped to meet the needs of our evolving economy which as viewers would know is currently going through dramatic changes.”

Dr. Singh has said that Government’s primary objective remains the preservation of a strong and stable financial sector and one that is dynamic and competitive.

And as the Central Bank awaits documentation for processing by FCB before a decision sources told the Stabroek News that at least two local institutions and a Jamaica-based bank had expressed interest in acquiring Scotia’s operations but concerns had been raised about their ability to bring correspondent banking relationships and an international network.

Moreover questions have been raised about local banks’ ability to pay the over US$50 million that sources close to the transaction have said FCB offered without significantly affecting their balance sheet or their ability to operate the “back-office” which was handled by experts at Scotia’s Canada head office. It is for this reason that it was suggested by experts that it might be more strategic for government to work on attracting an international bank to acquire Scotia’s banking operations.

One government source informed that this country has seen interest from a European bank and another headquartered in the United Arab Emirates. But the COVID-19 pandemic had seen communication with those institutions slowed down.

While major international banks can easily acquire Scotia’s business here if they wanted or even start up a new operation banking experts have explained that they see a Guyana investment as a “highly risky” environment. And with recent major international drug busts linked to Guyana many do not see the risk as a feasible venture. The de-risking movement over the last decade has seen an exodus of international banks from the Caribbean over fears that drug trafficking money laundering and a host of other financial crimes could make them run afoul of regulators and tougher accountability legislation in their home jurisdictions.

Analysts say that it would be a financial blunder for any local bank to pay tens of millions of United States dollars to acquire any other bank’s operations here. One analyst who did not want to be named reasoned that it would be more prudent for a local bank to invest that money in upgrading its own operations to attract customers of other banks and an international clientele.

“To have that at your bank’s disposal means you can invest it in yourself to upgrade. For example buying Scotia is just collecting their customers. You are not getting the Scotia or any of their operations because it is not a partnership. It would be better to lower your interest on lending and upgrade to meet the current banking demands” the analyst said.

Foreign control

Some analysts have warned that a sale of Scotia to a foreign bank would mean that in excess of 50% of the banking sector here would be under foreign control and it was not a good sign for the future financial stability of this country. “For Guyana to truly benefit holistically where all of its economy is to benefit then at least 60% of the banking sector should be locally controlled and 40% by foreign entities” another advised.

Government was also advised to take caution with a bank that has another country’s government as part of its control. The government of Trinidad and Tobago has significant shares in FCB.

“The government should not allow the purchase of a local entity to a company that another government has control or significant control over as it opens the sector to political and country risk. That is unfair to the citizens. They should only be sold to private sector companies” an analyst posited.

“In the region most countries have objected to the sale of these international instructions to foreign controlled entities as can be seen in Antigua OECS Barbados (sale of First Caribbean CIBC).”

Foreign entities a financial analyst reasoned will have a conflict of interest operating here where they will favour their own and not facilitate the local businesses. With oil and gas expected to be Guyana’s largest revenue earner in the coming years government has also expressed concerns over local content commitments by foreign companies.

Already a large number of Trinidad and Tobago companies have established businesses here with some offering services such as transportation which Guyanese should easily qualify for. “FCB’s supply chain and vendor management will favour home country providers and may not support local content and providers” the analyst said.

Repatriate

Noted too is that foreign entities would repatriate a significant amount of their income. One analyst estimated that on an annual basis Scotiabank repatriated in excess of US$4 million to its parent company as management fees and expenses.

But a foreign analyst explained that foreign entities repatriating their incomes is nothing new as those company’s shareholders are not local and as such the bank would have to remit their dividends. “All foreign companies do. Do you think ExxonMobil spends the bulk of their income in Guyana? You remit where your shareholders are” the analyst said.

In a case for locally-owned banks one analyst posited that foreign-owned banks have had little exposure to key developmental sectors such as agriculture here in Guyana. “A local buyer allows for a stronger local banking presence the expanded bank will have the girth to lead government initiatives” the analyst said.

Another would argue that for indigenous loans such as in the agriculture sector it would be more beneficial to all stakeholders if government created the environment for the establishment of a development bank or assist in backing the loans in the sector given by other banks.

“Agriculture is a risky area and we all would have seen what happened to GBTI. They are still reeling from unrepaid loans in this area” the analyst said. “Government has to look at how they can create a development bank for persons who would not otherwise qualify for a loan or a system when it stands in for them. Banks will give loans if government takes the risk” the economist said.

Noted too was that small and start-up businesses account for the large percentage of complaints about non-access to banking financing. However the analyst was quick to point out that in Guyana it is because most of those businesses could not provide banks with the requisite documentation to carry out due diligence practices.

“Most of the small businesses do not have yearly audited financial statements. And what you find also and some may be quick to dispute this is that there seems to be a culture of cooking the books. If you look across the spectrum show me 20 legitimate businesses that cannot get a loan. Businesses in Guyana just do not keep proper financial records. You must have audited financial statements” the financial expert said.

Sources say that for the PPP/C government the exit of a major international bank at this stage of the development of the oil and gas industry would be an adverse sign to investors about the climate here hence the need to convince Scotiabank to stay or to have a big name international bank enter the market.

Obligation

As it highlighted that the agreement was subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions Scotiabank earlier this month announced that it had reached an agreement for the sale of its banking operations here to First Citizens Bank Limited of Trinidad and Tobago.

This newspaper understands that Scotiabank had a legal obligation as a publicly traded company to announce the pending sale agreement.

With the announcement appearing to have caught the government off guard Dr Singh was swift to label the announcement as “premature and inappropriate”.

“It has been just been brought to my notice that a press release was issued … announcing a sale of the operations of Scotiabank Guyana to a Regional Bank -a Trinidadian Bank in particular. I wish to say that the Government of Guyana considers it extremely unfortunate that this transaction was announced – bearing in mind that any such transaction is subject to a specified regulatory process. In particular Section 12 of the Financial Institutions Act stipulates that no financial institution may transfer a whole or a substantial part of its operations in Guyana without the prior approval of the Bank of Guyana” the Minister said.

“Considering that the Laws of Guyana require this process we consider it premature to announce a transaction of this nature” Singh also noted. He added that it is the intention of the government and Guyana’s financial sector’s regulatory supervisor the Bank of Guyana to ensure that the Laws of Guyana are complied with in the fullest and to ensure that appropriate processes of due diligence required are initiated and concluded before any such transaction can be proceeded with.

The club optioned outfielder LaMonte Wade Jr. to minor league camp Sunday in a move that suggests the team is confident first baseman Brandon Belt will be ready to go by Thursday’s season-opener in Seattle. With Wade now in minor league camp the Giants have 13 position players including Belt left on their major league spring training roster.

The Giants also reassigned pitchers Scott Kazmir and Shun Yamaguchi to minor league camp leaving San Francisco with 18 pitchers on its spring roster. Kazmir does not have an opt-out clause in his contract and is expected to open the year at the Giants’ alternate site while Yamaguchi who was released by the Blue Jays in February does have an opt-out clause.

It is unclear if Yamaguchi will exercise the clause and pursue an opportunity elsewhere or remain in the Giants organization but manager Gabe Kapler has said in recent weeks the team will need several reinforcements to aid the pitching staff throughout the season.

Last week Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said he anticipates the club will carry 13 position players and 13 pitchers on its initial 26-man roster.

Belt who has been rehabbing from October heel surgery and recovering from bouts with COVID-19 and mononucleosis has only registered four Cactus League at-bats but has taken at least 20 in simulated games in recent weeks.

Wade who bats left-handed plays first base and all three outfield positions was viewed as the primary candidate to replace Belt if he opened the season on the injured list but the Giants have been encouraged by the first baseman’s progress in recent days.

Sunday’s moves leave the Giants with two catchers six infielders and five outfielders a group that features all of the position players the team expects to bring to Seattle. The Giants list utility men Mauricio Dubón and Darin Ruf as outfielders although Dubón is the team’s primary backup shortstop behind Brandon Crawford and Ruf is expected to provide depth at first base behind Belt Wilmer Flores and Tommy La Stella.

Of the 18 pitchers left in Giants camp 14 are members of the 40-man roster while four –Trevor Gott Zack Littell Dominic Leone and Nick Tropeano– are non-roster invitees. Gott was a member of the 40-man roster until the beginning of spring when he was designated for assignment to clear space for right-handed pitcher Aaron Sanchez.

Of the non-roster invitees Leone and Tropeano appear to have the best odds of securing spots in the Opening Day bullpen as the Giants like Leone’s fastball-slider combination while Tropeano is a leading candidate to open the season as a long reliever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdGl6ZW4uY28udHovdGFuemFuaWEvbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9jaXRpYmFuay1vcGVucy1uZXctdGFuemFuaWEtaGVhZC1vZmZpY2VzLTI2MTI0NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citibank opens new Tanzania head offices | The Citizen,"Dar es Salaam.

By Chris Cave - Local Democracy Reporter

The outgoing director of Manx National Heritage has rejected criticism over failing to return a famous schooner to ‘its rightful home.’

The 1792 Peggy was moved out of Castletown Nautical Museum to the Isle of Man Business Park for conservation purposes more than five years ago.

Some campaigners want to see it returned where it can then become a tourist attraction in the south of the Island.

Edmund Southworth who retires next month says the decision to keep the boat in Braddan is justified.

The armed yacht was built for prominent MHK and banker George Quayle in the 18th century and is often billed as the world’s oldest schooner.

Campaigner Richard Bedford has hit out at MNH for not restoring the Peggy to where he feels it belongs.

“Nearly six years after the unique world famous 1792 Manx schooner the Peggy was taken away by MNH from her hiding place in her Castletown harbour side cellar for conservation to an industrial building in

Braddan they still have not arranged a display facility ready for her return to Castletown’s Nautical Museum” he said.

Mr Bedford added: “The result being that she is having to remain locked away out of sight in Braddan instead of benefiting Castletown as a tourist attraction.

“[The Castletown Nautical Museum] is the only museum in the world without a boat.”

However Mr Southworth claims it was a risk keeping the Peggy in the south of the Island as it was being damaged.

He said: “I’d regard it as a success that we took the Peggy out of a basement which was getting washed by the tide.

“It was soul-destroying to see a museum exhibit at such a risk.

“The water was lapping up against it salt water causing corrosion in an 18th century boat.

“How appalling to keep a boat in those conditions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL3Bvd2VyLXRhcmlmZi1pbi1vZGlzaGEtdG8taW5jcmVhc2UtYnktMzAtcGFpc2UtcGVyLXVuaXQtZnJvbS1hcHJpbC00L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxNzMxMDk2LmNtc9IBkwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL3Bvd2VyLXRhcmlmZi1pbi1vZGlzaGEtdG8taW5jcmVhc2UtYnktMzAtcGFpc2UtcGVyLXVuaXQtZnJvbS1hcHJpbC00L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTczMTA5Ni5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power tariff in Odisha to increase by 30 paise per unit from April 4,"

The Activists’ Demands: Leaders of the AME Sixth Episcopal District which encompasses more than 500 predominantly Black churches in Georgia have criticized the Atlanta-based company for not aggressively voicing its opposition to the changes in the state’s election laws. The new measures include additional identification requirements for absentee ballots and restrictions on drop boxes for collecting absentee ballots. Critics of the law have argued it represents a new effort at voter suppression with President Joe Biden referring to it as “Jim Crow in the 21st century.”

Bishop Reginald Jackson presiding prelate of the AME Sixth Episcopal District told a rally in Atlanta “If Coca-Cola wants Black and brown people to drink their product then they must speak up when our rights our lives and our very democracy as we know it is under attack.

“Boycotting is not something we really want to do. Coca-Cola is a fine company. But at the same time we think all of these major companies have responsibilities on issues of social justice.”

The Coca-Cola Experience: On March 26 Coca-Cola issued a statement that said “We believe voting is a foundational right in America and access should be broad-based and inclusive.”

The company added it was “active with the Metro Atlanta Chamber in expressing our concerns and advocating for positive change in voting legislation ... We will continue to identify opportunities for engagement and strive for improvements aimed at promoting and protecting the rights to vote in our home state and elsewhere.”

Coca-Cola has a history of supporting the cause of racial equality. During the 1950s the company was among the first to prominently feature Black entertainers and athletes in its advertising. In 1964 when Atlanta’s corporate leaders initially refused to participate in a special event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s winning of the Nobel Peace Prize Coca-Cola’s then-CEO J. Paul Austin stepped forward first by securing a corporate presence at the event. The city’s other corporate leaders then followed his lead. The company exited the South African market in 1986 in protest of the apartheid policies selling its business interests to a multiracial investors group.

However in 2000 Coca-Cola was ordered to pay $156 million to settle a federal lawsuit brought by a group of Black employees accusing the company of racial discrimination. CEO James Quincey has referred to the circumstances leading up to the lawsuit as a “grave” error stating “As the judge said our biggest issue was not that we made mistakes and that there were individual cases but that when we knew we didn’t act to remedy and improve.”

Story continues

What Happens Next: Other activist groups have been seeking to move Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game from Atlanta and the PGA of America’s Masters tournament out of Augusta in protest of the new legislation.

Biden told reporters on Friday that the Justice Department was ""taking a look"" at the new Georgia measures but admitted he was uncertain if the federal government could have it nullified.

""We don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point"" he said.

Stacey Abrams a Georgia Democratic power broker said they would disproportionately affect historically marginalized voters including young people the disabled community and other minority groups.

Civil rights and voter advocacy groups believe Black voters who account for 30% of Georgia's electorate would be particularly affected by the proposals especially regarding 'souls to the polls' events used heavily by Black churches to encourage Sunday voting.

Black voters and voters of color were key to helping Joe Biden win the presidential election in November and two Democratic senators in the state's January run-offs Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.

As part of its latest investigation Marketplace reached out to the Coca-Cola Company General Mills and Campbell Canada asking how much added sugar is in some of their popular products: Coca-Cola's Vitaminwater calcium orange General Mills' Liberté organic vanilla 0% yogurt and Campbell's condensed tomato soup.

The labels do not have to specify how much sugar the manufacturer has added to the product often just for taste.

Canadian food labels lacking

In an email Health Canada said ""the Food and Drugs Act and its regulations do not permit the declaration of added sugars information in the nutrition facts table.""

However Health Canada told Marketplace that ""Consumers are free to contact manufacturers directly to seek additional information about foods or ingredients that are not on the list of priority allergens or about added sugars in a product. While many manufacturers will provide such information there is no obligation on the part of the manufacturer to do so.""

Dietitians recommend limiting daily added sugar intake and the World Health Organization (WHO) and Heart & Stroke Canada  among others offer guidelines.

The WHO recommends limiting daily ""free sugars"" to 25 grams or six teaspoons for maximum health benefits. ""Free sugars"" include not only added sugars but also the sugars naturally present in fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Heart & Stroke Canada recommends Canadians ideally consume less than five per cent or six teaspoons of added sugars a day.

Back in 2015 Hammond researched the presence of added sugar in over 40000 packaged food and beverage products available on Canadian store shelves by analyzing the ingredient list. He found added sugar in two-thirds of products and he doesn't believe anything has changed in the years since the study was published.

""It's not just cookies and cakes. Most Canadians would be surprised to learn that some of the leading sources of added sugars are things like yogurt bread"" said Hammond.

Amount of added sugar tough to uncover

Marketplace bought the Vitaminwater yogurt and soup products and tried to determine how much added sugar was in each.

With only total sugar required on a Canadian food label Marketplace worked with registered dietitian Stefania Palmeri to work out the nutrition math.

Liberté’s organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Liberté's organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving.

In contrast there is just five grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving in Liberté's organic plain 0% unsweetened yogurt.

Palmeri's best guess is that compared to the plain version the vanilla yogurt has a whopping 14 grams of added sugar per ¾-cup serving or about three teaspoons. Four grams of sugar is equivalent to about one teaspoon.

""We're not sure how much of this is added but we're still not doing well if this is the first thing we start with in the morning"" Palmeri said.

When Marketplace asked General Mills how much added sugar is in the yogurt the company said it follows Health Canada labelling regulations which include the labelling of total sugars in the product.

U.S. does disclose added sugar on food labels

Campbell's tomato soup was an interesting case.

Unlike in Canada added sugar is now listed on all nutrition facts labels in the United States — including the label for Campbell's tomato soup. That's because it's now required in the U.S. under new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On its U.S. website  the American Campbell's tomato soup is listed as having eight grams of added sugar per 240-millilitre serving.

WATCH | Here's how much added sugar is in this tomato soup:

Added sugar in your soup? The label won’t tell you how much Duration 2:38 This tomato soup has added sugar. But you won’t find how much on Canadian nutrition labels.

When Marketplace called Campbell's Canadian consumer line no information about added sugar was provided for the product sold in Canada. However later in emails Campbell's said it is ""prohibited"" by the Food and Drugs Act from including added sugar on the label but did explain that the tomato soup it sells in Canada has 11 grams of added sugar in one 250-millilitre (one-cup) serving.

Despite the slightly larger serving size that is still more sugar than the U.S. product.

Campbell’s condensed tomato soup has 16 grams of total sugar per one-cup serving. Campbell’s says 11 grams of it are added. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

""I don't think most people have an awareness of how many places added sugars can be hidden"" said Palmeri.

""When you're looking at a tomato soup thinking 'I'm trying to eat more vegetables' you wouldn't expect one of the ingredients to be glucose-fructose.""

Coca-Cola the owner of Vitaminwater products refused to tell Marketplace how many of the 32 grams of total sugar in its product are added sugar.

However it did say ""too much sugar isn't good for anyone"" and noted that it offers many low- or zero-sugar drinks including zero-sugar Vitaminwater.

Palmeri suspects all of it is added considering the second ingredient in the water is cane sugar. In the U.S. the label for Vitaminwater orange lists 27 grams of sugar all of it added.

Time for change

Hammond says consumers deserve to know about added sugar in their food.

""We need to do something because the status quo certainly isn't helping consumers at all"" he said.

Canadian consumers were consulted about new food labels back in 2013 and 2014. In the ""Consulting Canadians to Modernize and Improve Food Labels "" report Canadian consumers requested that new food labels include a daily maximum value for sugar as well as the breakdown of ""naturally occurring"" and ""added"" sugars.

But industry stakeholders pushed back  questioning the scientific basis of requiring that added sugars be on nutrition labels ""given that the body metabolizes naturally occurring and added sugars in the same way.""

Industry stakeholders also expressed other concerns including the cost of declaring added sugar information on labels and cited U.S. research that found consumers had a ""limited understanding"" of what added sugar means.

It's not clear which companies or manufacturers participated in the pushback.

In emails Marketplace asked Health Canada why added sugar will not be on the new nutrition labels  which are currently rolling out across the country.

Health Canada replied that feedback in 2014 indicated that Canadians found the information about added sugars ""confusing.""

Health Canada also said it determined that having an added sugars declaration would be inconsistent with the WHO guideline on sugars  which recommends that people reduce their consumption of free sugars and not just of added sugars. Health Canada also told Marketplace it believes that information on the new labels — including the ""% daily value"" (DV) and a new footnote indicating ""5% or less is a little 15% or more is a lot"" — will help educate consumers.

(Health Canada)

Health Canada also introduced the requirement to group sugars-based ingredients together within the list of ingredients following the term ""sugars."" The agency says that ""Together these new requirements will support reduction in Canadians' sugars intake.""

Hammond strongly disagrees and says research shows more Canadians were able to identify the presence of added sugar in a product when information for added sugar was clearly indicated on the nutrition label.

""Canadians are trying to make healthier choices … and one of the things they care about is how much added sugar is in there"" he said.

""This should not be rocket science.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdmVyZ2VtYWdhemluZS5jby51ay93aGF0LXRvLWRyaW5rLW5vdy1jb2NhLWNvbGEtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,what to drink now: COCA-COLA,"Coca-Cola fans across the nation have shared that the experience of drinking a Coca-Cola is something that’s almost impossible to put into words and for the first time ever the brand has captured the beyond words experience via a photo series captured by Anaïs Gallagher.

A drink that’s been uplifting the world for generations there’s nothing quite like an ice-cold can of Coke and the brand commissioned Anaïs to capture the first sip reactions of some of the UK’s most expressive stars. From radio host and presenter Roman Kemp rapper Lady Leshurr social media sensation Saffron Barker the inimitable Tayce model Rina Lipa and actor Nathaniel Hall the photo series captures the amazing reactions of the famous faces.

Anaïs whose work focuses on candid intimate real life moments was the perfect choice for the campaign and said; “Working with Coca-Cola on this shoot was such a fun challenge. I got to use my artistic outlet to bring to life a sensation that’s impossibly hard to put into words. So instead we captured it in images!”

Tayce said: “Everyone knows me as that queen that’s bubbly unique and hard to describe – just like the taste of a Coca-Cola! Honey that first sip is enough to make you say ‘OOOH!’”

Roman Kemp said “I used to genuinely believe that going AAAAHH! after a sip of Coca-Cola makes it taste better and now I can’t help but do it!”

Lady Leshurr said: “The best thing about drinking a Coke is the bubbles. I can’t explain it it’s like a bubble party on my tastebuds!”

Saffron Barker commented “Everyone knows what Coca-Cola tastes like but it’s basically impossible to describe– there’s nothing else like it! A cold can of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is my go-to.”

Rina Lipa added “Describing drinking a Coke is hard but it makes me think of good times making memories and of summer”.

Nathaniel Hall said “Communicating the feeling of drinking a Coke through facial expressions has been so much fun. And no acting required!”

Date 27.03.2021 Read time 3 Min Fans have always collected memorabilia. In the United States for example baseball cards have been bought and traded for more than a century with the rarest and most prized specimens trading hands for millions of dollars.

There’s something about a collectible piece its uniqueness its rarity its closeness to its original owner or creator that makes it extra special.

In the digital space it’s harder to create truly collectible memorabilia. That democratises the market but it also offers the opportunity for creators to make new forms of unique digital content.

A unique or limited piece of digital content is called a non-fungible token (NFT) a unit of data stored on a blockchain effectively a record of data. Purchasing an NFT enables you to own display or resell that piece of digital content.

Although NFTs are not new technology and have been around since 2015 they have recently emerged as an effective and powerful new medium for artists celebrities athletes and teams to connect with fans and collectors.

Global Partner Explore Crypto.com Our first NFTs will be available exclusively via sign-up at Crypto.com arriving on Saturday 27th March. Find out more and explore the first drop at the link below. Discover Crypto.com

The Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is the first Formula One organisation to enter into NFTs working with our partner Crypto.com to create a series of limited collectible assets commemorating Aston Martin’s return to Grand Prix racing after more than 60 years.

The series proof-of-stake NFTs which are more energy-efficient than traditional proof-of-work pieces features dynamic video content of the reveal of the AMR21 Sebastian and Lance’s historic first runs in the new car and a stunning slow-motion pit-stop feature.

Jefferson Slack Managing Director — Commercial & Marketing Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One Team said: ""The collection of NFTs we’re making available capture the very first moments of our return to F1 after more than six decades.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vY29sYS51bmguZWR1L3Nwb3RsaWdodC9lcmlubi12aXR0dW0tMTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erinn Vittum '17 | College of Liberal Arts,"Why did you major in philosophy?

As a first-generation undergrad at UNH I had limited insight regarding my career path. I wanted to “help people” but didn’t particularly know who or how to do so. Choosing first semester freshman year classes was intimidating and my strategy was fairly random. “Existentialism” with Professor Willem DeVries piqued my interest. I loved talking about theories concepts ideas that made my brain stretch in ways it previously hadn’t. The first semester I also took “Social and Political Philosophy” with Professor Matt Dowd. I remember him being so passionate about the material. Philosophy classes tackled and delved into deep sometimes uncomfortable topics. I decided initially to elect philosophy as my second major purely based on my passion for the material but became cognizant that the skills and knowledge I was acquiring would be very helpful to my career in Social Work.

Interesting stuff you did as a UNH undergrad?

During undergrad I was so genuinely excited to have access to all of the resources at UNH so I tried to say yes to any opportunity that interested me. I double-majored in psychology and philosophy participated in the University Honors Program to delve deeper into material across disciplines conducted honors level research presented my thesis titled ""Proactive Behaviors in Middle School Youth to Prevent Sexual and Dating Violence: A Descriptive Study"" at undergraduate research conferences studied abroad for four months in Ireland and traveled to 14 different countries. I also volunteered for multiple student organizations including Alternative Spring Break Challenge which allowed me to road trip throughout the United States and provide volunteer services to populations in need. My philosophy advisor Paul McNamara helped me immensely so that I was able to accomplish all of these goals together.

What are you doing now?

After graduation from UNH I worked for two years as a child and family social worker for the Department of Health and Human Services and also for a non-profit organization providing a wide array of preventative strength-based services for at-risk children and youth in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire. In the fall of 2018 I applied and was accepted to the MSW program at the University of Michigan School of Social Work. My concentration here is management of human services with a specific focus on children and youth. Upon graduation I will move into a leadership role within a non-profit organization serving marginalized children and youth.

How has philosophy been valuable in your personal and professional life?

Many of the courses I took within the philosophy department inspired me to think critically about my own values. Philosophy was the basis for my commitment to social justice. Philosophy courses entailed lots of reading logic critical thinking analysis writing; all of these skills have proven to be very valuable in my work and in graduate school.

Any advice for students considering a philosophy major or graduating with a philosophy major?

I encourage my peers to go after what truly inspires them to their core whatever that may be. And if you haven’t found what motivates you yet that’s ok; careers take time and passions evolve. Use the resources around you to explore and expand. I started UNH with hardly a clue what I wanted and majoring in philosophy (as well as the multitude of other opportunities through UNH) solidified my passions and prepared me to thrive at a top graduate school in my field. Being apart of the philosophy department was such a privilege; small classes passionate professors colleagues students and people who truly care. There’s no environment better than that.

FRESNO Calif. (KFSN) -- Saint Rest Baptist Church Pastor DJ Criner says the southwest Fresno community is in a connection crisis.

He and others from the community are claiming there is a lack of infrastructure that prevents the community from having adequate access to reliable internet.

""That's not the kids' problem that's a bigger issue and we are trying to fix it"" Pastor Criner says. ""We started seeing kids sitting in front of Taco Bell or sitting in front of a Burger King to access the internet so they can have their laptops up to be able to go to school. That's too dangerous. That's ridiculous.""

On Thursday evening Fresno City Councilmember Miguel Arias Former Lt Governor Cruz Bustamente Pastor Criner Comcast officials and hundreds of others joined in a virtual Digital Divide Forum.

Misty Franklin lives in southwest Fresno. She was also on that Zoom call.

Franklin tells Action News internet issues impact her family and many others. ""We need those resources we need that internet in order for our children to be successful in addition to the working parents that reside in Southwest Fresno"" Franklin says.

Franklin has two children who are students in the Fresno Unified School District. She says remote learning has been a major challenge but she's stuck with the current service because other providers are too expensive.

""As we are logging on I'm constantly calling the school letting them know that we can't get in or we are logging on but we are having internet issues"" Franklin says. ""When my daughter gets her report card she's been marked tardy 16 times - to me that's absurd.""

Action News reached out to Comcast about some of the connection problems. In response a Comcast spokesperson said there's ""no specific data to support the claims"" but they've engaged construction and engineering crews to do a thorough analysis.

Angela Hiyama is the Director of Government Affairs South Valley for Comcast. On the Zoom call she said ""I do want to share that our infrastructure model does not discriminate against neighborhoods.""

In a release in December Comcast announced they will invest $1 billion over the next 10 years to help further close the digital divide. In addition Comcast announced its initial plans to equip ten Fresno Housing and Boys & Girls Clubs of Fresno County locations throughout the Central Valley with WiFi-connected ""Lift Zones"" over the coming months.

In the meantime a community member gifted the church a WiFi extender antenna to help with the internet problems.

The church has also established a community learning center on its property that serves 30 to 40 students who aren't able to access internet at home.

Plus the local internet provider CVIN has stepped up to offer the church and the surrounding area an alternative option for free-high speed internet.

Jeremy Miller is the co-director of Saint Rest's Learning Center. He says ""It brings a sense of hope and we refuse to allow our children to fail.""

On that Zoom meeting Hiyama concluded they have scheduled a walkout where their construction teams go back to assess the fiber line for next steps.

The victory is Memphis’ 13th in its last 16 games. The Tigers went 8-for-9 at the free-throw line committed only 11 turnovers and registered the second-most assists (24) in a game this season.

“I mean what more could you ask for?” Tigers coach Penny Hardaway said. “Our most complete game all year was today. Multiple guys to get hot on the same night I’ve been asking for that all year. Really proud of the guys.”

Here are five takeaways from Saturday’s game:

The 3-headed monster

The trifecta of Nolley Williams and Quinones propelled the Tigers.

It started early for Williams and Quinones who scored 11 and 13 respectively in the first half. Nolley emerged in the second half dropping 24 points on 8-for-11 from the field. He hit seven 3-pointers six in the second half.

The group combined to go 25-for-41 from the field. They also combined for 19 rebounds and 10 assists. Williams also had four steals.

Williams said the key to the Tigers' success in the NIT has been their mindset.

""Not being in the (NCAA) Tournament we didn't let our heads down"" he said. ""We still was grateful we got invited to the NIT. And we want to show the world we can play with the best of 'em. We want to win a championship. We came out with a lot of fire and a lot of heart and we just want to win.""

Off and running

Runs are part of basketball. But seldom do teams rattle off the type of dominant run the Tigers did in the first half. Memphis dug itself out of an early hole with a 15-0 run matching a season-best and extending it to a 22-2 run over a 6:18 span.

The run put the Tigers ahead 37-23 with 3:40 left in the first half. Memphis was 6-for-9 from the field on offense and defensively stifled the Rams who were 0-of-10 with three turnovers. The only points Colorado State mustered during that stretch came from two free throws from Kendle Moore.

""(The 22-2 run) was big because our pressure wasn't really bothering them as much and they were getting what they wanted. They were kind of hanging around"" Hardaway said. ""Then we switched up the pressure and we got the run we wanted.

""When we went on that run there was nothing they could do. We were all over the place. We were scrambling for each other covering for each other we had high hands we had good close-outs made them take tough shots got the rebound and then pushing it.""

Memphis also put together a 12-0 run early in the second half that gave it a 56-41 lead with 15:22 remaining.

Supporting cast

While Williams Nolley and Quinones headlined the Tigers’ win there was a strong supporting cast.

D.J. Jeffries filled up the stat sheet with nine points seven rebounds and six assists. Damion Baugh had six points and six assists.

""(The key) in the second half was Damion Baugh taking (Colorado State's leading scorer Isaiah) Stevens out of the game"" Hardaway said. ""He understands what's at stake with Alex Lomax being out for a number of games. He and DeAndre Williams those guys really sparked the defensive side of the ball (in the second half) and we pushed out.""

Limiting CSU on the boards

The Tigers came into play Saturday ranked 21st in the country in rebounding margin outrebounding opponents by 7.1 on average.

That type of dominance was exacerbated by Memphis’ ability to limit the Rams’ glass opportunities. Colorado State managed only 24 rebounds the second-fewest the Tigers have allowed all season.

Memphis’ size advantage not only showed up from a rebounding standpoint the team also flexed its scoring muscle inside. The Tigers outscored the Rams 34-16 in the paint.

Deep heat

Coming off a 5-for-20 performance from the 3-point line Memphis needed a bounce-back showing.

And the Tigers got it in a resounding way finishing 14-of-27 from deep the most 3-point makes of the season.

The NIT in 2021 will see more than a few changes as the NCAA — not to mention local and state health agencies — try to navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While not ideal changes to the NIT are preferable to NIT at all.

The 2021 participants likely would have preferred their respective seasons to end with a dose of March Madness — that is true for several notable NCAA Tournament snubs — but the National Invitational Tournament could serve as a jumping-off point for teams looking to make the next step in 2021-22. Conversely it could be a final chance at glory as players graduate or take their talents to the next level.

Owner Louie Petrozza with his mother who he ran the business with for 50 years until her recent passing

One of the shows that I have binged watched over the past year of COVID is Barstool Pizza a pizza review show from Dave Portnoy better known for his Barstool Sports company and his sports website barstooolsports.com. As I was surfing through YouTube one night a fell upon Portnoy’s reviews of some of New York City’s Pizza spots and thus began my journey down the rabbit hole of hundreds of Pizza reviews from his Pizza reviews called one bite from all over the country.

Portnoy who sold a stake in Barstoolsports.com for $163 Million but still runs the website also created the Barstool fund for small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus. The fund TheBarstoolFund.com has raised over $37 Million and has helped 332 small businesses. If you are a small business owner in need of help due to the impacts of COVID you can submit your application at: TheBarstoolFund.com/apply. One Yonkers restaurant that has already benefitted from TheBarstoolFund is San Martino Ristorante on Young Avenue. off Central Park Ave.

But on a recent visit to Yonkers Portnoy visited Raceway Pizza located on 775 Yonkers Avenue. The owner Luigi Petrozza. has been in business for 50 years. But like many small businesses he has fallen on tough times making it difficult for him to stay afloat.

“I lost my mom a few months ago she was my partner here for 50 years I’m struggling now because we close early there is nobody around. We have regulars from the neighborhood for years but because of the pandemic nothing has been the same. I’m a big believer in Chirst and God sometimes things are meant to be. We opened in 1971 since I was a kid. The past year i’m behind in my rent and Con Edison I’m trying to struggle and keep going” said Petrozza.

Portnoy said “I’m glad we are here. We will help you with our fund and help you get caught up. I’m glad we got to meet.”

But according to Portnoy himself people most associate him as being the guy that reviews pizza restaurants on YouTube and Twitter. “That’s probably the one number one thing people know me by” Portnoy said adding that his popular catchprase of the show is “one bit everyone knows the rules.” Portnoy has celebrities on some of his review shows.

Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano took notice of the video and the vist posting on Facebook “The aftermath of the pandemic has left many brick-and-mortar businesses across the country including here in Yonkers in need of some much-needed support. In addition to the city’s efforts to provide relief to small businesses David Portnoy at Barstool Sports visited Raceway Pizza in Yonkers and has committed to providing them with financial assistance. Your investment in some of our city’s local businesses has not gone unnoticed and Yonkers thanks you.”

Portnoy gave Raceway Pizza a “good basic football pizza and that’s a compliment. you know what you are getting.” He gave the pizza a 7.4 Rating which is on the high end of his ratings (nobody gets a 10). Portnoy asked everyone to help this business.

We will be paying a visit to Raceway Pizza and buying a pie to try it out and to help Louie.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This will give projects that build on Constellation and list on our DeFi Platform Lattice assurance that their token has a path to being freely traded and supported from centralized exchanges like LCX.

“This one means a lot to me” said Corning. “I have had a tough couple contests that haven’t really gone my way. I have landed runs but haven’t gotten the results I wanted. I’m stoked I was able to make it happen at the last contest of the season. My goal was to make finals and anything that came after was a bonus so I’m really grateful.”

Corning stomped his first run that included a solid and controlled rail section a cab 1620 a backside flat spin 1440 a backside triple cork 1440 and a beautiful 50/50 backside rodeo out. Corning would have likely improved on his second run if it wasn't for a minor mistake on the last fail feature.

Corning’s podium marks his first top-three finish in only two World Cup starts this season. Despite a limited competition season the result carries significant weight as it relates to the U.S. Snowboard Olympic Team selection criteria tacking on critical points towards the rankings pathway (World Snowboard Points List) one of two routes to secure an Olympic team nomination. The other route being podium performances at designated U.S. Olympic tryout events.

Corning didn’t sugarcoat the fact he was looking forward to the off-season. Anyone that follows him knows he loves his summer activities.

“I’m ready to relax” he said. “I’m stoked to ride dirt bikes wakeboard attend the Mammoth Camp in May with my teammates and really just unwind ahead of what will be another crazy season.”

U.S. Snowboard Teammate Dusty Henricksen put down his first run to finish fifth. His run included a bit of successful improvisation in the rail section taking him into the jump section where he landed a switch backside 1080 switch backside 1260 as well as a casual backside triple cork on the final jump. Teammate Brock Crouch finished just behind Henricksen in sixth place landing his second run where he showcased his creative approach to the course as one of the few riders to utilize the final quarterpipe feature.

Norway’s Markus Kleveand continued his dominance winning the event and securing the FIS Slopestyle and Overall Crystal Globes. Kleveland won two of three slopestyle World Cups this season in addition to claiming the FIS World Championships slopestyle title. Canada’s Liam Brearley was second.

For the women Japan’s Reira Iwabuchi and Kokomo Murase went one-two followed by Australia’s Tess Coady in third.

Four U.S. Men finished in the top-10 of the FIS World Cup slopestyle standings including Dusty Henricksen in fifth Red Gerard in sixth Chris Corning in seventh and Brock Crouch in ninth. For the women Jamie Anderson finished fourth and Hailey Langland sixth.

A legacy event on the FIS Freeski World Cup circuit Silvaplana has proven itself time and time again over the past decade to be one of the most unique and creative slopestyle venues in the world. After a successful event to close out the 2020-21 season riders will be fiending to return in the future.

Production is slated to increase 10-fold by the end of this year.

Kurz never expected to be at the forefront of a pandemic — who does? — but his participation in the MIT Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program positioned him well. He joined LGO (known at the time as Leaders for Manufacturing) as an operations professional at Kodak in 1993 receiving his SM from the Department of Mechanical Engineering as well as an SM from the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“I was really drawn to the MIT LGO program because it covered three main areas: engineering and technology — there's no better school in the world for that — but also business management and leadership. Understanding people and how you lead them is so important and that really drew me to this MIT program. It’s been the cornerstone of my career” Kurz says.

Today MIT LGO students earn an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management and a master’s degree from one of eight participating departments in the School of Engineering while participating in an immersive six-month research fellowship at partner organizations ranging from Amazon to Corning.

Kurz says that Corning was the perfect place to bring his operations skills with its 170-year history in glass production. (In the early days it helped to develop encasements for Edison’s light bulb.) Kurz became part of a team exploring ways to make stronger pharmaceutical glass packaging a process that hadn’t changed in a century — making glass that was more efficient to fill crack-resistant and more durable for vials.

Valor Glass offers multiple improvements over conventional borosilicate vials by chemically strengthening the glass with molten salt. Not only does Valor Glass provide safety benefits with reduced surface delamination and fewer particles but it is also more efficient for pharmaceutical filling operations by enabling higher production speeds. Corning also found that it was less prone to breaking during standard lyophilization a freeze-drying process used with some pharmaceutical products. Cold temperature performance is a critical attribute for some vaccines. Valor Glass addresses expensive pain points for partners like Pfizer and Merck.

“When the Covid demand materialized we had already laid the groundwork. It’s this lasting investment [with our partners] that positioned us to be able to go fast. We’d been positioning ourselves for expansion” Kurz says. “We had some capacity that was ready to come up if we had the demand. We knew what needed to be done. It turned from planning to execution.”

Corning joined Operation Warp Speed to supply the vials shifting to 24/7 production delivering in weeks instead of months streamlining the product line to a standard-sized vial and focusing on quality and volume. In June 2020 Corning received $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to ramp up manufacturing capacity.

“It came back to the fundamentals I learned in the MIT LGO program — really challenging technical problems understanding the business environment you're operating in and leading people. I've used my MIT background in every job I've ever been in. And this challenge required all three” he says.

One particularly important task? Rapidly spotting defects with a relatively new product. Kurz implemented a machine-vision system to examine every vial for flaws. The stakes were high.

“In early manufacturing there are bugs. We didn’t want to throw out good vials. We also didn’t want to pass bad products along. So we put a lot of effort into that and actually were able to improve our output by more than 10 percent. If you look at it as doses of the vaccine getting to people it's inspiring” he says.

Kurz has subsequently shifted roles to focus on global health services implementing protective measures in Corning factories worldwide. Meanwhile he’s confident that Valor glass will have pharmaceutical uses long after the pandemic fades such as for cancer treatments. On that note he’s eager to tell the MIT community what a valuable partner Corning is and what a forward-thinking company it continues to be.

“It’s easy to think ‘Well it's just glass right?’ Yet we keep innovating 170 years after the company was formed. We keep investing nearly a billion dollars a year in R&D and finding new ways to take glass into places that it’s never been before” he says from Edison’s original light bulbs to ultra-durable anti-microbial Gorilla Glass for wearable devices.

For Kurz his pride in glass manufacturing is clear.

“People want a noble cause to work for. From a leadership standpoint there can’t be a more noble goal than to try to help people overcome Covid” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9yZWRibHVmZmRhaWx5bmV3cy9uYW1lL2FudGhvbnktZnVydGFkby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02NTk2NTAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anthony Furtado Obituary (1947 - 2021) - Hanford CA - Daily News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/redbluffdailynews/name/anthony-furtado-obituary?id=6596500 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9yZWRibHVmZmRhaWx5bmV3cy9uYW1lL2FudGhvbnktZnVydGFkby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD02NTk2NTAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpYy5jYS8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L2xpYW0tYnJlYXJsZXktc25vd2JvYXJkcy10by1zbG9wZXN0eWxlLXNpbHZlci1pbi1zd2l0emVybGFuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liam Brearley snowboards to slopestyle silver in Switzerland - Team Canada - Official Olympic Team Website,"THE CANADIAN PRESS/Dave Chidley

Brearley first captured the attention of many Canadians when he baceme the first Canadian to ever win three medals at the Youth Olympic Games. The 18-year old snowboarder won his first career medal in slopestyle on Canadian snow at the Calgary World Cup in 2020 where he captured a bronze medal.

Competition in Silvaplana is the final stop of the FIS Slopestyle World Cup circuit. Finishing off the season on a high Silvaplana is known to be one of the best slopestyle venues in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2F0aG9saWNjb3VyaWVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9yb2NoZXN0ZXItZGlvY2VzZS1ob25vcnMtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtc2VuaW9ycy1hcy1oYW5kcy1vZi1jaHJpc3QtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rochester Diocese honors high-school seniors as Hands of Christ,"GREECE — After a year’s worth of limited opportunities for public gatherings Molly Wescott found the sight of so many fellow high-school seniors in one place to be a very welcome one.

“I think it’s amazing that we can get together to celebrate the teens and their churches” Molly said just before the start of a diocesan Hands of Christ ceremony March 24 at St. Lawrence Church.

Molly 17 a parishioner of St. Theodore in Gates was among more than 300 young honorees from across the Rochester Diocese to receive Hands of Christ recognition for 2021. There were three get-togethers in all: recipients also were honored at services on March 22 at St. Mary Church in Corning and March 23 at St. Lawrence with Bishop Salvatore R. Matano presiding at all three ceremonies.

The award is presented annually by the diocese to recognize high-school seniors who have exhibited outstanding service in their parishes homes schools and/or communities demonstrating Christian attitude through their word and example. Approximately 320 high-school seniors received Hands of Christ recognition this year according to Mark Capellazzi diocesan project coordinator for youth and young-adult ministry. Each honoree was awarded with a plaque.

Although Hands of Christ has paid tribute to young diocesan Catholics for many years the gatherings in March were unique in that they occurred almost exactly a year after the coronavirus pandemic began drastically altering daily life across the diocese.

“To say times have been difficult is an understatement” Shannon Ervay a parishioner of St. Mary of the Lake in Watkins Glen remarked during her witness talk March 22. However Shannon echoed Molly’s sentiment by saying that being able to unite for the Hands of Christ event was “a blessing as well as an honor.”

Meanwhile Bishop Matano commended all the recipients on staying true to their faith amid many COVID-19-related challenges expressing confidence that they will represent the Catholic Church proudly in future years.

Joining Shannon in the honor of being selected as Hands of Christ witness speakers were Mackenzie Yaddaw of St. Agnes Parish in Avon who spoke at the March 23 ceremony; and Jon LeFrois of St. Theodore who was due to address the March 24 recipients but was unable to attend. His prepared witness talk was instead given by his twin brother Alan Michael also a Hands of Christ recipient.

The witness speakers noted that they’ve endeavored to be Hands of Christ through such activities as community volunteerism and youth-group involvement. They also stressed the deeper meaning of their award through such Christ-like actions as being loving and compassionate toward all kinds of people especially those who are vulnerable and struggling. Another point they emphasized was the importance of embracing their Catholic faith from an early age.

“It goes without saying that none of us would be the people we are today without our Catholic upbringing” Mackenzie stated.

“Throughout my life my faith has been key in keeping me going encouraging me to improve as a person” Jon added.

As for Molly she recalled leaning on her faith at the young age of 7 when she faced a potentially life-threatening situation: She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One of Molly’s few enduring memories from that time period she said is having prayed with her family that her surgery would go well and she would get better.

“Luckily the doctors were able to get the whole tumor out in time (before it spread)” she said adding that she’s been cancer-free ever since.

Molly noted that she and her family have maintained devotion to their faith throughout her childhood attending Mass every Sunday and praying the rosary frequently. As she’s grown older Molly has increased her involvement at St. Theodore with such activities as altar serving music ministry youth group and serving as a youth representative on the parish pastoral council.

Molly is now looking ahead to graduating in June from Gates Chili High School and beginning studies next fall at SUNY Fredonia where she plans to major in music education. Despite the challenges she’s faced — earlier in life with her health and more recently with a forced decrease in activity due to the pandemic — Molly acknowledged being happy and hopeful for the future.

“Yeah definitely” she said."

In the larger deal LaSalle Investment Management acquired a Beverly Hills property owned by UBS Realty Investors for $74.4 million.



The five-story office building is located at 9033 Wilshire Blvd. It has nearly 50000 square feet and counts USC’s Keck Medical Center as an anchor tenant.



Newmark Group Inc.’s Kevin Shannon Rob Hannan Ken White and Laura Stumm represented the seller. Newmark’s Steven Salas also helped with the sale which the brokerage announced March 25.



“The medical sector is a high-conviction product for investment capital post-pandemic because of the typical predictability and durability of their tenants” Shannon said in a statement.



The property was renovated in 2011. It was designed by SIM & Associates and contains a surgery center a full-service pharmacy and valet parking.



Beverly Hills continues to see high demand for medical office space with direct vacancy in the single digits since 2002 according to Newmark data.



The property “is one of the elite medical office buildings in Beverly Hills. Its elevated status has attracted leading physicians in their practices who have patients travelling from all around the world for care” Hannan said in a statement.



In the second sale Brentwood-based GPI Cos. purchased a nearly 30000-square-foot medical office building in Santa Monica for $22.5 million.



The property located at 1450 10th St. was sold by Lexham. It was renovated in 2008 and is leased to Kaiser Permanente as well as medical specialists.



The building was 95% leased at the time of the sale according to CoStar Group Inc.



Medical office space has fared better than conventional offices during the Covid-19

pandemic. Market experts say patients prefer to go to office buildings near their homes instead of crowded hospitals during the pandemic while doctors favor offices spaces over hospitals for similar reasons.



Because of the high costs for a tenant to build out medical office space the buildings tend to have much lower turnover than conventional office properties.



Earlier in March Newmark announced the sale of an 8409-square-foot medical office building in Carson for $5.1 million. The building sits on more than an acre at 21501 Avalon Blvd. and is 100% leased to Providence Health & Services.



And in February CBRE Group Inc. announced the sale of a 28295-square-foot mixed-use retail and medical office property in Koreatown. MCDG Holding purchased the site for $15.3 million from EJS Properties. The three-story property is located at 2970 W.

Sure there’s an underdog hero — this one is named Mark aka Invincible (voiced by The Walking Dead‘s Steven Yeun) — but he’s unique. Half Korean American and half superhero Mark is a teenager who inherits his powers from his dad Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons) the most dominant caped crusader or Viltrumite in their world. But the more strength and ability Mark gains the more he begins to see that his father is more flawed than he could have ever imagined.

Zazie Beetz who is best known for her roles in FX’s Atlanta and the Joker film voices Amber Mark’s high school classmate. Mark quietly crushes on Amber until grabbing her attention by attempting to defend her against a handsy bully. Amber eventually develops feelings for Mark and unintentionally lands herself in a love triangle with him and Eve aka Atom Eve (Weird City‘s Gillian Jacobs).

Beetz says she was drawn to Invincible which The Walking Dead’s Robert Kirkman adapted from his comic book series of the same name and made its Amazon premiere this past Friday because of the show’s impressive and inclusive cast.

“I had an opportunity to read the pilot and then to also look into the comic and the group of people that were already attached” Beetz tells TVLine. “Steven Yeun and J.K. Sandra Oh (who plays Mark’s mom Debbie) and Gilly…. It was just a really great team that I wanted to work with and be a part of. Also I loved that Robert Kirkman was involved with the series and I really trusted that the spirit of the comic was going to be in the television show which I think is really important. I like being part of that world.”

Read on as the German-born Beetz teases the eight-episode Season 1 and talks about the show’s indirect connection to Atlanta costar and creator Donald Glover.

TVLINE | Did working with Kirkman attract you to Invincible?

He was super involved. He was in all of the recording sessions and was very involved in shaping the show. I was really drawn to that and Amber’s character is a part of that larger world.

TVLINE | Amber has got some fighting skills. She’s not Domino and she doesn’t have superpowers but she doesn’t suffer bullies.

Yeah she holds her own and I think that is something that sort of shifted from her comic book persona as well. She leads with confidence and leads with a sense of knowing who she is and who she wants to be and what she wants to do in the world. I think that’s actually a really interesting juxtaposition in a way to Mark who is trying to figure it all out still. I liked the idea that a lot of people who watch a superhero thing are like “Oh man I wish I was like Superman or Wonder Woman” or whoever. But really you don’t have to be that to be exceptional or to be inciting change in the world and doing what you think is good. So her role in that way is really important.

TVLINE | What was it like working on this during a pandemic? Were you all doing this from home virtually?

We did this before the pandemic during like the spring of 2019 so it was a normal recording where you went into the studio — but we didn’t record at the same time. I think Steven got to work with J.K. Simmons but I did it alone and I think Gillian was alone for all of hers. Obviously Kirkman was involved when we were recording and our director and some of the producers. But I didn’t work with the other actors directly.

TVLINE | Oh I imagined you and Gillian swapping Donald Glover stories because you have both worked with him. Is it like “Six Degrees of Donald Glover?”

Yeah I was thinking about that. I was like “Oh yeah like she knows him because of her time on Community.” We were just doing a bunch of our interviews together which is really how we are getting to know each other.

TVLINE | Have you started working on Atlanta Season 3 yet?

We’re actually just about to start shooting. So we’re doing it. I’m leaving in like two weeks to go shoot in Europe so we have to start the whole process of that with the PPE and everything. And you can never really get used it. I have worked during the pandemic and I have to say I’m really grateful to be working frankly. In this business it’s interesting because it’s all about connecting with and communicating with people and that whole element is harder to do. Sets are very strict about keeping everybody safe which is good but it doesn’t make the ability to really communicate effectively easy. You have to kind of get used to doing everything a bit differently yet you never really get used to it because it’s a little anxiety inducing.

TVLINE | What can we expect from Amber in Season 1 of Invincible?

Mark and Amber kind of have a romantic thing. But as Mark is coming into his own and sort of working on their relationship he struggles with the pressure of trying to balance these responsibilities of being a super person and just trying to live a normal life. So yeah I don’t know what I can really tell you beyond that. But get ready for more tension between him and Amber and Eve.",,,,,,

Matt Lewallen said he was packing his groceries into his car in the parking lot of an Anchorage Costco when ravens swooped in to steal a short rib from his cart the Anchorage Daily News reported Friday.

“I literally took 10 steps away and turned around two ravens came down and instantly grabbed one out of the package ripped it off and flew off with it” Lewallen said.

Lewallen said the piece of meat was about 4-by-7 inches (10-by-18 centimeters) large — a sizable meal for a sizable bird.

“They know what they’re doing; it’s not their first time” Lewallen said. “They’re very fat so I think they’ve got a whole system there.”

And once he got back home he noticed that one of the ravens had taken a poke at another rib but did not rob it.

“I cut that meat out and started marinating it and my wife said ‘That’s gross we should take it back’ ” Lewallen said. “Costco actually took it back even after we had started marinating them and gave us a full refund.”

Additional raven thief sightings have emerged on social media.

“My parents were minding their business after a shop and made it home with one less steak!” Kimberly Waller wrote on Facebook. “The bird snatched it right out of the pack in the parking lot.”

Anchorage resident Tamara Josey replied to Waller’s post and referred to the ravens as “calculating.” She said ravens hovered her in an attempt to steal her groceries.

“I had two ravens one that was on the car next to me and he kept squawking really loud” Josey said. “He would sit on the car and stare at me then hop next to the bed of the truck on the other side and he kept going back and forth. The other raven was on the ground. He kept trying to pull — I had those little mini-melons you have in the mesh baggies — he kept trying to grab the netting and pull my melons off the cart.”

A raven started to fly in a circle around Josey until she got them to scram.

“He was waiting for another opportunity to grab the melons off the cart but they never were deterred” she said. “They just stayed posted waiting for their next opportunity to steal something out of my cart.”

“They are very dedicated to their mission” she added.

A manager at an Anchorage Costco declined to comment to the newspaper about the raven thieves.

The Anchorage Audubon Society tallies the raven population every December. The group reported 923 common ravens in 2018 621 in 2019 and 750 birds in 2020.

Rick Sinnott a former wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game said hundreds of ravens fly to Anchorage in the winter for food. After winter turns to spring most of the ravens leave Sinnott said.

But before they do the ravens stick around to pluck assorted meats fruits and vegetables.

“For years decades they’ve watched people in parking lots of grocery stores with all this food” Sinnott said. “They know what a piece of fruit looks like in a grocery cart because they’ve seen it on the ground or seen it in a garbage can.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9jb3N0Y28tZm91bmRlci1raWxsLWhvdGRvZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Costco Founder Say 'I Will Kill You' to CEO Who Wanted To Raise Hot Dog Prices?,"Claim: The founder of Costco told a CEO who wanted to raise the prices on Costco's hot dogs: ""If you raise the effing hot dog I will kill you. Figure it out."" Rating: About this rating True

An exchange between Costco founder Jim Sinegal and Costco CEO Craig Jelinek over the cost of their hot dog and soda combination — a staple of the brand that has not changed since 1985 — frequently goes viral on social media. As the story goes Jelinek wanted to raise the price of the hot dog combo and Sinegal did not take it well:

The exchange based on the testimony of Jelinek — the CEO who wanted to raise the price — is factual. He discussed it in an April 12 2018 speech to a local chamber of commerce. His remarks which were part of a broader message about problem solving were summarized in several places including the website 425 Business:

“I came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said ‘Jim we can’t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.’ And he said ‘If you raise the effing hot dog I will kill you. Figure it out.’ That’s all I really needed. By the way if you raised (the price) to $1.75 it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it’s the mindset that when you think of Costco you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda). “What we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs. Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we’ve opened up another plant in Chicago. “By having the discipline to say ‘You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out’ we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.”

Because the story comes from Jelinek himself the claim is true.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29zdGNvLWJha2VyeS1mYXZvcml0ZXMtZ29uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 Costco Bakery Favorites That Have Vanished From Shelves,"Costco's die-hard fans may keep coming back thanks to how convenient and affordable it can be to shop there. But the icing on the cake for many can sometimes be the warehouse retailer's wildly popular bakery department which rolls out fresh bread and sweet treats that tend to fill shoppers' carts. Unfortunately product changes are a part of every business—and in this warehouse's case some popular baked goods wind up dropped from the Costco lineup and are gone for what seems like an eternity.

Whether it's a seasonal change or a permanent drop some beloved baked goods aren't always available at Costco. These are some of the most popular items that have vanished from shelves.

And while you may or may not be able to get these items below there are some available that shouldn't make their way to your home. Here are Costco Foods You Should Always Avoid According to Nutritionists.

Apple Pie

When baked goods come to mind there's almost nothing as comforting as the thought of a warm slice of pie. But as Costco customers found out in 2020 some of their comfort desserts were suddenly absent from the bakery's tables including the store's famous apple pie.

According to customers on the Costco subreddit certain stores temporarily discontinued the popular pie during changes to the bakery schedule due to COVID-19 policies. Fortunately most locations expected to bring the classic American dessert back by mid-November for Thanksgiving and holiday celebrations.

Half-Sheet Cake

Customers may mourn the dropping of their favorite products from shelves but it's not every day the furor over a discontinued product makes national news. Costco created headlines when the company announced that their incredibly popular half-sheet cakes were being dropped and replaced with 10-inch round cakes.

""We are currently not selling our 1/2 sheet cakes at any US locations and as of right now we have no immediate plans to bring them back. We are focusing on our smaller 10"" White & 10"" Chocolate Cakes that seem to be resonating with our members"" a company spokesperson told the Today Show.

Customers eulogized he beloved product on social media and message boards. But the realities of workplace safety in the pandemic seem to be at least partly to blame: the company replied in a social media post that they had decided to drop the cake to ""help limit personal contact and create more space for social distancing.""

Dinner Rolls

COVID-19 forced many changes to everyday life but it also took a toll on Costco's baked offerings. It turns out that dinner rolls also felt the pandemic pinch: Customers took to the Costco subreddit when they noticed that the beloved baked goods were no longer available with many pointing out they had gone missing after May.

Replies from bakery employees seem to confirm that Costco discontinued the festive feast staple as a year-round product. Fortunately other responses mentioned that most locations would bring back the item during Thanksgiving and the holiday season similar to apple pie and other temporarily halted offerings.

Seasonal and One-Off Cookies

For true fans of the Costco bakery there's nothing like being able to add a package of your favorite cookies to your cart at the end of a shopping run. But company changes to inventory have left a few customers missing some of their favorite sweet treats which have ended up as seasonal products or dropped without any signs of coming back.

Customers on the Costco subreddit grieved the sudden loss of the warehouse retailer's popular chocolate chip walnut cookies years ago. Since then others have complained that there appear to have been recipe changes to other popular types during the pandemic.

But when it comes to major disruptions most customers seem to mourn the temporary loss of raspberry crumble cookies (which actually made a reappearance recently). Fans of the product claim that it's so popular there were hopes the baked goods would become a consistent year-round item. Instead many have since resorted to buying in bulk and freezing the coveted cookies. In the meantime they're swapping recipes for potential homemade dupes.

All American Chocolate Cake

Last year wasn't a good year for many things but 2020 was undoubtedly a terrible year for popular cakes. On top of dropping their beloved half-sheet cake from their lineup customers began to notice that the bakery stopped stocking its wildly popular All-American chocolate cake. The four-layer dessert's absence had spurred its fans to action starting a Change.org petition—which has received over 5000 signatures—to revive the baked good and taking to message boards in search of recipes in the hopes that a homemade dupe can fill its place.

Torta Rolls

It's not just sweet treats that roll out of Costco's bakery as beloved staples: The department's bread products have also won a top spot on customer's shopping lists too. So when it became clear to shoppers that the warehouse chain had stopped supplying their wildly popular torta rolls a few years ago customers started a minor uproar on message boards and social media.

According to replies from store employees on the Costco subreddit the beloved sandwich bread was discontinued in 2019 due to flagging sales and replaced in many locations with pre-sliced ""artisan rolls."" However the change appears to be regional with some stores selling the same product as ""ciabatta.""

Half-Iced Shortbread Cookies

While the pandemic put some Costco bakery items on hiatus others were permanently discontinued amid inventory changes. This includes the once-seasonal half-iced shortbread cookies which one customer on the store's subreddit describes as being heart-shaped or round and being ""half-dipped in chocolate or white icing.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

After one customer pointed out that the popular cookies typically rolled out for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day a store employee on the thread appeared to confirm that Costco had made a decision and the cookies are gone from the bakery for good. Instead many stores now offer red and pink sugar cookies in their place.

Muffin Varieties

Costco may have no shortage of breakfast staples available to customers. But a significant inventory change saw the bakery take a big hit in the offerings of at least one morning must-have: Muffins. Customers on the Costco subreddit confirmed that many locations were sizing down the number of styles available dropping popular flavors such as poppyseed and apple strudel as part of a corporate decision to winnow down SKUs. As a result most store locations now only carry three typical types of the breakfast-friendly baked good—even if the consensus from customers on which ones were the best is still starkly divided.

Cinnamon Pull-a-Part

Devoted fans of Costco's cinnamon rolls were disappointed years ago when an apparent recipe change altered the outcome of their beloved sweet treat. But since then Costco appears to have shuffled other takes on the baked good to offer it as an iced ""Pull-A-Part"" pastry occasionally. While customers remain divided on how it holds up against the original rolls this sometimes-available-sometimes-not item has whipped customers into a frenzy by sometimes appearing on shelves in certain areas (like it did in late February).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY29zdGNvLXNlbGxpbmctY2hlc3QtZnJlZXplci1rZWVwLTE5MDAzNDExOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco is Selling a Chest Freezer to Keep Your Items Cold All Summer Long,"We love grocers like Costco and Trader Joe’s and their notoriously delicious frozen goods so it’s always a shame when we know we’ll soon have to make another trip to stock up on more food due to lack of space in our freezer.

Sixteen cars of a CSX Transportation train derailed early this morning in Nashville Tenn. leading to a brief shelter-in-place order from authorities until it was determined there was no hazardous-material threat. A statement from CSX reports the derailment occurred about 3:07 a.m. CDT near West Due Avenue and no injuries leaks or spills resulted. Ten of the cars involved were empty; five carried wood and paper products. The remaining car was carrying ethanol and CSX says it will secure and remove the contents of his car as safely and swiftly as possible. Photographs from the scene show at least one locomotive also derailed. The cause is under investigation. The Nashville Fire Department which initially responded and issued the shelter-in-place order released the scene to CSX shortly before 6 a.m.

Contractor on Sound Transit light rail project ordered to pay more than $800000 in wages fines

A contractor on a Seattle-area light rail project has been ordered to pay more than $800000 in unpaid wages fines and interest by a Washington state agency. The state Department of Labor & Industries has cited Penhall Co. for failing to pay appropriate wages and overtime to 37 workers on Sound Transit’s East Link Extension light rail project. The workers are owed almost $650000 with one work alone owed nearly $100000 according to an agency press release. The remainder more than $150000 includes fines for failing to pay the prevailing wage and filing falsified certified payment reports. The agency says it is the largest citation it has issued in recent years under its prevailing wage program and that Penhall is appealing.

This market’s strength is impressive considering that of the top 5 stocks by market cap none are at all-time highs. Only two of them Google and Microsoft hit that mark over the last two months. Apple the biggest stock in the world is 16% below its peak in January.

If you break the S&P 500 into deciles by market cap you can see complete randomness into how far the median stock is from its 52-week high. This is a 180 from early in the pandemic where the only thing you needed to know about the condition of stock was its relative size. Small worst big best. It’s not that simple anymore.

The strongest stocks in today’s market are the ones most levered to the economic recovery. The median industrial stock for example is just 2.5% below its 52-week high. 36% of the members in this group closed at a 52-week high on Friday.

If you did nothing but look at a chart of every stock in the S&P 500 you would conclude that the economy was booming. Pull up a chart of Lennar or CSX or CAT or AA. Yes that Alcoa.

None of the aforementioned companies are considered glamour stocks. You wouldn’t find them trading with valuations sported by some of the high-flying tech companies.

If you sorted the market on a price-to-sales ratio you wouldn’t find any pattern. At least not until you got to the most expensive bucket. Those are where you’ll find the weakest names. But other than that the distance from a 52-week high seems to be completely random as far as valuation goes.

Another way of looking at a similar concept is to sort the buckets by their dividend yield. Again no pattern develops until you get to the stocks with low or no dividends. This is where you’ll find Twitter Tesla and Take-Two Interactive.

The stock market is in a very healthy place right now. 93% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average right now. The last time you saw a reading this high was 2013.

I continue to be impressed at the way sector rotation has kept this market afloat. If you told me 6 months ago that the momentum names would pause while industrial and materials lead us to a new phase of the bull market I wouldn’t have believed you.

The only reason to be concerned right now is that things might look too good. Not exactly a persuasive argument but I can understand this mentality. If you get nervous at all-time highs when the leadership is narrow and when it’s broad-based you’re going to have a difficult time making money."

While the speedster has been leading India's pace attack for the past few years he has also been a cornerstone of five-time Indian Premier League (IPL) champions Mumbai Indians. Be it taking wickets with the new ball or restricting the run flow in the death overs Bumrah has delivered every time MI skipper Rohit Sharma threw the ball at him. The talismanic pacer has been with MI ever since making his IPL debut in 2013 and the Nita Ambani-owned franchise isn't likely to release him in the years to come.

With Bumrah being one of the best in the business one would expect him to be among the tournament's top earners. However the 27-year-old is not even near the highest-paid players in IPL. While his Indian teammates Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya earn over INR 15 crore every season the speedster's IPL salary is INR 7 crore. Now that's shocking! Many other speedsters like Chris Morris (INR 16.25 crore) Pat Cummins (INR 15.5 Crore) Jofra Archer (INR 7.2 Crore) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (INR 8.5 Crore) also earn more than the Mumbai Indians star.

While the names mentioned above are proven IPL stars some yet-to-be IPL debutants also have a bigger contract than the right-arm pacer. Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) bought New Zealand pacer Kyle Jamieson for INR 15 crore in this year's (IPL 2021) auction. The event also saw Punjab Kings buying Australian pace duo Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith for INR 14 crore and INR 8 crore respectively.

In case you are wondering Bumrah's paycheck isn't that enormous because Mumbai Indians never let go of him after bagging his services in IPL 2013 auction. With IPL 2014 witnessing mega auctions MI had to release Bumrah and buy him back for INR 1.2 crore in the bidding event. He had the same contract before another mega auction took place in 2017. By this time Bumrah had become a big name in world cricket and hence MI retained him for INR 7 crore and the contract is still in effect.

Notably IPL 2022 will see a mega auction and Mumbai Indians might have to offer Bumrah a bigger paycheck to continue with his services. Meanwhile IPL 2021 gets underway on April 9 and Bumrah will be expected to guide Mumbai to their sixth title.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0LmNvLnphL3Vzcy1maXJzdC12ZWhpY2xlLXRvLWdyaWQtc2Nob29sLWJ1cy1nZXRzLXRoZS1ncmVlbi1saWdodC_SAVVodHRwczovL2dhZGdldC5jby56YS91c3MtZmlyc3QtdmVoaWNsZS10by1ncmlkLXNjaG9vbC1idXMtZ2V0cy10aGUtZ3JlZW4tbGlnaHQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US’s first vehicle-to-grid school bus gets the green light,"The new electric school buses in Illinois can drive students to school and provide excess power back to the grid at the end of its trips.

At a press event held at the Pekin Transportation Department in Illinois in the US this week school bus industry leader Blue Bird Corporation delivered the first operational DC fast charge V2G (vehicle-to-grid)-capable school bus. It’s powered by the Cummins PowerDrive EV system which utilises technology from Nuvve Holding Corp. This bus is one of two Blue Bird Type C electric buses delivered to Illinois’ Pekin Public School District and Hollis Consolidated School District #328 in Peoria.

“Not only are we improving the health of our students drivers and communities by reducing emissions but our V2G capabilities allow us to store clean electrical energy and to generate revenue by reselling unused energy back to the grid during peak demand” says Daniel Jost fleet manager for the City of Pekin. “We’re proud to lead our community state and the country toward a future based on clean energy.”

Nuvve’s V2G platform allows the school bus batteries to store energy including renewable energy generated from sources like wind and solar when the grid doesn’t have immediate need for it. This allows fleets to sell stored energy from the school bus batteries to the grid when demand calls for it. The Nuvve V2G system can also be used to supply energy back to the school and intelligently charge the buses during non-peak hours to reduce peak-consumption energy costs. Nuvve is installing their high-powered V2G DC charging stations at each site.

“Our system allows electric school buses to perform to their fullest potential by providing grid services when plugged in and charging” says Gregory Poilasne chairman and CEO of Nuvve. “This reduces load on the grid and will make emergency back-up power from buses a reality in the near future. With our partners at Blue Bird we’re on a mission to make the electrification of school buses more affordable and efficient and our V2G platform positions us to do that.”

Both school districts are members of the Bus-2-Grid Initiative a membership service of the Future Green Energy Consortium which helps school districts leverage V2G revenue opportunities and secure grant funding to electrify their fleets.

“With more than 400 Blue Bird electric school buses already delivered or on order districts across the U.S. are quickly learning how easy and affordable it is to adopt this cleaner safer solution for students” says Trevor Rudderham senior vice president of electrification and product planning at ‎Blue Bird. “As the leader in this market we’ve been able to learn adjust and implement rapidly to improve on what is already a great performance by our electric buses.”

“Cummins is excited to leap into the next era of connectivity and distributed energy resource management” added Amy Davis vice president and president of New Power at Cummins. “With this new advancement we’re helping school districts leverage their investment by making our technology smarter and more efficient.”

Hollis Consolidated School District’s electric school bus purchase makes the district’s fleet 100% electric powered. “The benefits are far and wide with our Blue Bird electric bus” says Chad Jones superintendent and principal of Hollis Consolidated School District #328. “Compared with diesel service requirements are significantly reduced and we are providing 100% green transportation for our students.”

“By eliminating the expensive maintenance often associated with school buses district fleet managers are simplifying their team’s day-to-day operation and putting money back in their budget” says Jeff Reitz president and CEO of Central States Bus Sales. “And when it comes time to service an issue our well-trained Blue Bird team is available at five locations across the Midwest.”

The districts are currently adding infrastructure and chargers to support their new zero-emissions buses which were paid for by an electric bus grant from the Edwards Coal-Fired Plant Settlement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzIwMjEvTWFyLzI4L2RlYXRoLWJvd2xpbmctc2hvdWxkLW5vdC1iZS1vdXItY29uY2Vybi1hbnltb3JlLXNheXMtcGFjZXItc2hhbWktYWhlYWQtb2YtaXBsLTIyODI3NTkuaHRtbNIBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC8yMDIxL01hci8yOC9kZWF0aC1ib3dsaW5nLXNob3VsZC1ub3QtYmUtb3VyLWNvbmNlcm4tYW55bW9yZS1zYXlzLXBhY2VyLXNoYW1pLWFoZWFkLW9mLWlwbC0yMjgyNzU5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Death bowling should not be our concern anymore says Pacer Shami ahead of IPL,"Cricket

Hess will bring his significant digital health and population health management services experience to the growing North Texas insurer.

Hess was most recently the managing director and founder of strategy consulting firm OnDigitalHealth Consulting LLC. He also founded population health management company Kalico Partners and was also the CEO. He began his career as a life sciences researcher.

Texas Health Aetna is a joint venture between Texas Health Resources and Aetna. It looks to take advantage of a national insurer and local health system to serve employers and consumers in the region. Hess moved back to Dallas four years ago and is excited about working with the two companies that represent the venture. Despite being a part of healthcare behemoth CVS Health Aetna Hess says that Texas Health Aetna is still small enough to be agile.

“We have the opportunity to move a little more quickly in terms of innovation” he says. “We are able to develop new programs and services and identify the best partners for the implementation of new capabilities.”

He appreciates the family atmosphere and emphasis on members’ health and well-being at THA. The care management strategies diabetes management and behavioral health are all focus areas for the organization as well. “We’re beginning an expansion of some combined community health program referrals some virtual care services acute care education and interventions to improve outcomes” he says.

While hospital systems and insurance companies are often at odds over reimbursement values Texas Health and Aetna combining forces allow the company to leverage more resources Hess says. “There are conversations about how we can leverage all of those assets whether it’s in-person or virtual into providing the best opportunity for members patients and consumers to get the best care at the lowest price and the highest quality.”

“Karl’s longtime focus on innovation and improving healthcare access and population health align with Texas Health Aetna’s mission to make health care simpler for everyone” said Barclay Berdan chief executive officer Texas Health Resources via release. “Identifying and implementing new technology that integrates provider and payor services to create a seamless experience for the consumer is more important than ever.”

Hess hopes to continue the brand recognition for THA in the region. Hess says THA is looking to create its individual health plan on the healthcare exchange through the Affordable Care Act. “That’s going to be a real opportunity to help differentiate us further in terms of being innovative and competing with some of the new entrants and healthcare” Hess says.

Leveraging big data expanding virtual care automating care and extending more care into the home are all things Hess hopes to develop moving forward. He hopes to leverage the company’s agility and continue the high customer satisfaction scores which are higher than Aetna proper. “Meeting the consumer where they’re at has become a very popular phrase during the pandemic” he says. “We’re able to be a little more responsive we’re able to move more quickly and we’re able to solve some of those education awareness and communication experience issues.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLWRlcG90LXN0b2NrLWJlbGlldmVkLWZhaXJseS0wMTEyMTE2NDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Home Depot Stock Is Believed To Be Fairly Valued,"- By GF Value

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of The Home Depot is 12.9% which ranks better than 82% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 10.8% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders.

For the past four decades Tri County has been serving the Thumb Area with full lines of agricultural commercial residential and turf care products. With a massive line of those familiar green and yellow John Deere products Tri County has become the go-to source for agricultural residential landscaping and construction equipment.

As one of the most trusted and recognized suppliers in the region Tri County Equipment has firmly cemented its reputation as the Thumb’s premier farm equipment dealer with 10 convenient locations located throughout the Thumb.

Sales Manager Scotty Wadsworth whose family has owned and operated Tri County Equipment since founding the business in Sandusky in 1985. The company has grown exponentially over the past 36 years and now employs approximately 175 team members.

“The pandemic and the lockdown definitely impacted business for us in the last year” explained Wadsworth. “But it hasn’t stopped us from doing what we’ve always done which is taking care of our customers. We’ve had to adapt and we have a lot more virtual services we offer now because obviously foot traffic was seriously limited last year.”

Among the new virtual services are Tri County’s online parts counter online financing options and remote diagnostic services for select equipment. Although Tri County’s main focus or most prominent commodity is agricultural equipment including tractors combines sprayers shredders and more the well-known company also offers residential and landscaping equipment for homeowners including mowers side-by-side vehicles and home and workshop products.

Though Tri County Equipment has become home to countless reliable brands and products it was ultimately the John Deere farm equipment on the Wadsworths’ farm that inspired it all. The original Sandusky location was an official John Deere dealer and within three years the family opened another location to serve a growing customer base which spread into Lapeer Tuscola St. Clair and even as far south as Northern Detroit.

The family-run operation continued its relentless expansion with the 2007 addition of new locations in Caro Burton and Bad Axe. Soon after in 2008 Tri County added Lapeer to their growing network of successful businesses followed by further expansion into Reese Birch Run and Saginaw just two years later.

“The size and scale of our operation not only allows us to be more competitive with our pricing but this year it also proved to help maintain stability and steady sales through the pandemic” explained Wadsworth. “We buy the best possible equipment at the best possible prices and we pass on the savings to our customers which is why we have such loyalty among the families and individuals that we’ve been working with for all these years.”

And it’s not only their pricing and reliable service that keep people coming back. It’s the fact that Tri County goes above and beyond to ensure that they support the communities that support them. Along with providing substantial support to local programs like 4-H Future Farmers of America (FFA) and county fairs in the surrounding area Tri County also makes it a point to give back as much and as often as they can.

Dahmen edged fellow American Sam Ryder and Puerto Rican player Rafael Campos by a stroke. He shot a 2-under 70 in the final round to finish at 12-under 276 pressed all the way to the final putt. He received a first-place check for $540000.

At a gusty Corales Puntacana Resort Dahmen joined former Huskies C.T. Pan (2019 RBC Heritage) and Nick Taylor (2020 Pebble Beach Pro-Am) as recent PGA Tour champions.

Dahmen originally from Clarkston Washington played a single season for the UW in 2007 before turning professional.

He hadn't won as a pro golfer since 2014 when he finished first in a pair of Mackenzie Tour events in Canada. His best PGA Tour finish had been runner-up at the 2018 John Deere Classic and the 2019 Wells Fargo Championship.

For that matter Dahmen entered this event after missing cuts in six of his seven events this year. Victory couldn't have come at a better time.

""It has been a tough start to the year"" Dahmen said. ""To turn around those missed cuts to this is pretty incredible. This is unbelievable. This is awesome.""

The event was held opposite the WGC Dell Technologies Match Play in Austin Texas.

In the final round Dahmen birdied four of the first seven holes to build a significant lead but he bogeyed the par-3 11th and par-5 14th to enable others to push him to the end.

""It's so fricking hard to win a golf tournament"" he said. ""I knew it was hard but I can't believe how hard it actually is.""

Dahmen 33 is one of the tour's endearing personalities traveling to all of his golf events accompanied by his wife of a year and a half Lona. He mentioned how she's supported him emotionally and financially working multiple jobs when he was playing mini-tours and had no money.

""It’s never as bad as you think it is and it’s never as good as you think it is but Lona’s been great for me"" he said. ""She still gives me a hug and a kiss and tells me to go kick butt so it’s been good.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvbG9ubmllLWdhZ2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzAxNjk5NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lonnie Gage Obituary (1966 - 2021) - Waterloo IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/wcfcourier/name/lonnie-gage-obituary?id=7016996 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvbG9ubmllLWdhZ2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzAxNjk5NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvbGFyaXMtcnpyLXNpZGUtYnktc2lkZS1tb25zdGVyLXRydWNrLWJ1aWxkLXNob3dzLXdoeS10aGV5LWRvbnQtY29tZS10aGlzLXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polaris RZR Side by Side Monster Truck Build Shows Why They Don't Come This Way,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BvbGFyaXMtcnpyLXNpZGUtYnktc2lkZS1tb25zdGVyLXRydWNrLWJ1aWxkLXNob3dzLXdoeS10aGV5LWRvbnQtY29tZS10aGlzLXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Christina Ramos' Torrance Superior Court lawsuit alleges sexual harassment sex discrimination and failure to prevent discrimination harassment or retaliation. She seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages in the suit filed Tuesday.

A Delta representative could not be immediately reached for comment.

Ramos was hired by Delta in June 2016 as a reserve ramp agent and about 90% of her co-workers were males the suit states.

""Throughout plaintiff's employment ... (she) was subjected to discrimination based on her sex as well as humiliating sexual harassment at the hands of various co-workers and individuals in management"" the suit states.

Ramos frequently heard sexually oriented comments about her appearance and parts of her body the suit states. She often reported the ""unsettling and discomforting behavior"" but her complaints were ignored the suit states.

""Despite (Ramos') repeated requests to her co-workers to stop the inappropriate remarks continued"" the suit states.

Ramos' colleagues also allegedly stared at her and touched her without her permission causing her to feel ""vulnerable stressed uncomfortable and anxious.""

After Ramos brought one of her complaints her manager instructed her to make a written statement about the incident according to the suit.

Loyalty has its perks even during a pandemic.

I earned elite status on Delta Air Lines in late 2019 just a few months before the pandemic grounded even the most frequent flyers. My first experiment flying with status in February 2020 earned me hundreds of dollars in free extras like upgrades to first class and more legroom seats.

Enjoying the perks of the status during the pandemic however has been harder as Delta is blocking middle seats and adjacent seats in first class. It's an easy trade-off to make when it comes to safety but means fewer upgrades to the premium cabins.

Delta to serve new canned cocktails mini-sodas snacks and more starting April 14

Delta passengers will once again be able to sip and snack in-flight as well as before boarding in Delta Sky Lounges with new additions to the airline's menus.

The airline announced Wednesday that starting April 14 domestic and select short-haul international flights will offer personal sized Coca-Cola products Tip Top Proper canned cocktails and wellness-focused snacks.

Complimentary in-flight drinks for main cabin and comfort-plus seating include Coca-Cola mini-cans that offer personal 7.5-ounce servings of fan favorites like Coca-Cola Diet Coke Sprite and Seagram's Ginger Ale.

The airline will also roll out a rejuvenated snack lineup with wellness-focused treats like almonds and Clif Bars but won't leave out their classics like Goldfish crackers and signature Biscoff cookies.

For customers 21 and over two new premium pre-prepared canned drinks from Atlanta-based Tip Top Proper Cocktails are being offered: a canned old-fashioned and margarita.

Allison Ausband SVP of in-flight service for the airline said: ""These single-serve options are the first step in bringing back food and beverages even better as more customers return to Delta and we've worked with our trusted partners at Mayo Clinic to ensure we safely serve these items as we continue to deliver on our promise of safer travel.""

Beginning in early June Delta One and first-class passengers on select domestic coast-to-coast flights will once again have hot food options and fresh boxed meals will be available to First Class customers on other key U.S. routes in early July.

Pre-poured beverages and Flight Fuel snack boxes will be served to first-class customers starting April 1. One box features ""better-for-you favorites"" with protein bars nuts and dark chocolate and the other includes more indulgent treats like cookies potato chips and gummy bears.

Starbucks coffee and tea service as well as juices and mixers will return to all cabins. Alcohol sales in the main cabin will also resume with new contactless payment technology and digital receipts.

The company announced that starting May 1 it will once again offer middle seat tickets after it held the spot for slightly more distance between customers throughout the pandemic.

""While Delta's decision to block middle seats has given many customers a reason to choose Delta over the past year the signature hospitality of our employees and the experiences they deliver to customers every day have also deepened their trust in our airline"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement.

Delta worked with the Mayo Clinic on multiple rounds of testing and onboard simulations to redesign its in-flight service procedures for safe delivery.

Delta will resume in-flight services with new snack and beverage options. Delta

Some of the redesigned features include contactless payment technology to minimize touchpoints swapping poured beverages for single-serve cans and new guidelines to help crews and customers maintain distance during boarding meal snack and beverage service.

Also starting in May Delta will gradually and safely evolve food and beverage menus at its Sky Clubs throughout the spring and summer.

""Clubs that can accommodate assisted service will return to our full complement of hot and cold fresh food stations"" the airline said in a press release. ""Other select locations will reintroduce Chef's Tables featuring a hot seasonal feature of the day in addition to an enhanced grab-and-go selection of fresh foods hot breakfast sandwiches and soups.""

Delta has partnered with the state of Georgia and Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport to offer free COVID-19 vaccinations sites inside and near the airport.

Additionally Delta is partnering with Lyft on the “Fund a Ride” program to provide rides to vaccination sites to those in need.

These partnerships will help speed up a return to normalcy for the state and country which in turn will help with demand for air travel. The aviation industry took a massive hit during the pandemic.

Delta Offering Free Covid-19 Vaccinations at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Delta Air Lines has joined efforts with the state of Georgia and Hartsfield-Jackson Airport to create free COVID-19 vaccination sites at the Delta Flight Museum and Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) airport one of the busiest in the United States.

These vaccination sites are open to both Delta employees and the general public.

Delta has already given more than 39000 vaccinations and says they will be administering 3000 doses per day starting March 29th. These new vaccination sites will continue to operate for at least the next 13 weeks and may be extended depending on what the governor and chief health officers say.

“I think we’re ready to reclaim our lives as well as to reclaim our joy” said Delta’s Chief Health Officer Dr. Henry Ting. “We’ll get there by ending this pandemic with vaccinations.”

Eligible Georgia residents can register for the COVID-19 vaccinations here.

Delta Joins Forces with Lyft

In addition to the new vaccination sites Delta has partnered with ride-share carrier Lyft on the “Fund a Ride” program to provide rides to vaccination sites to those in need. The program is open to low-income uninsured and at-risk individuals.

Delta is asking SkyMiles members to donate at least $5 to Lyft through the app to help fund the program. The first 15000 members to donate will be awarded a one-time bonus of 250 SkyMiles through May 31st.

“I am energized by the continued rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and while millions are already vaccinated we must ensure that those most at risk are not left behind” said Lyft Co-Founder and President John Zimmer.

“That's why I am proud to expand our Vaccine Access program bringing together longstanding Lyft partners and their members to help provide transportation access so that our parents grandparents and loved ones won't need to worry about how they'll make their vaccine appointment.”

Delta Adds New Flight Route to Iceland for Vaccinated Travelers

Delta has also announced that it will begin operating three routes from the U.S. to Iceland for vaccinated travelers:

Resumptions of daily service from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Keflavík International Airport (KEF) on May 1 2021.

New daily service from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) to Keflavík International Airport (KEF) on May 20th 2021.

Resumption of daily service from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) to Keflavík International Airport (KEF) on May 27 2021.

Iceland recently announced that it will be accepting vaccinated tourists without testing and quarantines making it one of the first destinations in Europe easily accessible to American travelers since the pandemic began.

“We know our customers are eager to safely get back out into the world including exploring one of the globe’s most beautiful outdoor destinations” said Joe Esposito Delta’s senior vice president of network planning.

“As confidence in travel rises we hope more countries continue reopening to vaccinated travelers which mean more opportunities to reconnect customers to the people and places that matter most.”

These new routes come in addition to the other new routes Delta announced earlier this month amidst increasing travel demand.

DVN,Devon Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L29rbGFob21hLWNpdHktZWNvbm9teS1zaG93cy1zaWducy1yZWNvdmVyeS1mcm9tLWNvdmlkLTE5LWNvbGxhcHNlLzQ3NDg4NDcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oklahoma City's economy shows signs of recovery from COVID-19 collapse,"In the old town of Britton a long blighted stretch of storefronts is coming to life. Where there were once seedy bars passersby now see Zero Tolerance Coffee Hooligan's Barbershop and Hideout Art. On the same stretch construction is underway for Venn Pizza and Madhopper Brewing.

Down the street the newly renovated Depression-era Owl Courts motel is filled with a barbershop salon and Brew Brother Coffee.

After a deadly winter Oklahoma City is in the midst of an economic rebound defying the pandemic that has wreaked havoc on economies worldwide.

And while the hospitality and energy industries are still struggling the optimism for a return to normalcy and economic recovery has some wondering if Oklahoma is about to experience a second “roaring '20s.”

Happy days certainly appear to be here again for the Britton corridor which was once a part of Route 66 that went through the heart of the Town of Britton before it was annexed into Oklahoma City.

The recovery started shortly before the pandemic and tackled decades of decline reflected by the boarded-up storefronts and crumbling sidewalks along Britton Road between Western Avenue and Classen Boulevard.

Similar indications of life are popping up throughout the city.

The city’s unemployment rate is at 4.7% seventh-lowest among the country’s largest cities and far lower than the 14.8% recorded in April. The city’s latest sales tax check for February was 4.4% higher than the same pre-pandemic period a year ago.

One of the major investors in the Britton revival Steve Goetzinger is among those optimistic good times are to come after a year of shutdowns and economic hardships.

“I think people are so ready and there is a pent-up demand for a return to normalcy” Goetzinger said. “History teaches us that after 1918 the roaring '20s came. It will be like the end of the 1918 pandemic; people will be ready to get out dine and have fun.”

Back to a different future

When Goetzinger and several other developers took on the challenge of reviving Britton the local economy was humming though hundreds of job cuts already were happening at oil and gas companies including giants like Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy.

Chesapeake Energy is a shadow of its former self leaving the nearby Britton District and upscale Classen Curve deprived of thousands of well-paid workers that once filled the Chesapeake office buildings now for sale.

A recent forecast by economists Russell Evans and Eric Long for the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber reports the city’s energy industry was “hit hard” with more than 8000 workers losing their jobs as travel ground to a halt.

Some of those jobs might come back in 2022 if the global economy starts growing but even then Evans and Long say local energy employment is unlikely to return to the levels seen in the early 2000s.

In the meantime the energy jobs keep disappearing. About 500 cuts are expected with Enable Midstream which was headquartered at BOK Park Plaza being acquired last month by Dallas-based Energy Transfer.

“The pandemic didn’t help” said Roy Williams chamber president. “But there were so many factors driving it beyond the pandemic. I don’t think we’re through with acquisitions and mergers in the energy industry. If you don’t have the corporate headquarters buying you’re going to lose. There is still going to be a shakeout in the industry.”

Offsetting energy-related job losses are new aviation and technology jobs taking their place. Evens and Long are looking at an optimistic job forecast scenario of 3.2% growth or about 20500 jobs by the end of 2021. This growth they said parallels expectations for the nation.

An alternative model shows a more pessimistic start to 2021 with the Oklahoma City area job growth at 1.5% or just under 10000 jobs added by the end of the fourth quarter. That would leave Oklahoma City with employment still below pre-pandemic levels in 2019.

Eager entrepreneur

Elijah Vick owner of Brew Brother Coffee Shop is hoping for the more optimistic scenario as he struggles to overcome challenges he has faced since opening at the one truly preserved Owl Court office one of Britton’s authentic Route 66 landmarks.

When he first started planning the coffee shop for the 225-square-foot building his vision was to create a mix of delivery coffee for nearby office workers and create hub for coffee and hip-hop lovers.

“I was originally going to make this a tasting room (with) this thing called open-source coffee where baristas from all over the state come in and showcase their drinks” Vick said. “But of course the plague just changed all that. So our niche is that like we take hip-hop lyrics and turn it into food and beverage.”

For now the hip-hop lyrics and dreams are limited to branding of his coffees and breakfast items. But with springtime weather returning and the continued decline in COVID-19 cases Vick is hoping to host a hip-hop event and transition back to at least part of his original vision.

“We switched our business model from being a day-to-day coffee place to how are we going to support the health care workers?” Vick said.

Vick also is hoping to see an increase in coffee delivery business generated by hundreds of insurance and medical support workers whose offices are nearby at Britton and Broadway but were allowed to work from home during the pandemic.

A March survey by the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber indicates many of those workers will return as long as COVID-19 numbers continue to decline. Of 237 businesses surveyed 39% responded all or most of their workers will be returning to their offices while only 5% said their remote operations are not going to change.

The remaining respondents indicated they will be using work from home options as a means to retaining and recruiting employees. The survey also shows 71% of employees of those firms wanting to get out of the house and back in the office.

“We were heading in this direction anyway” Williams said. “The pandemic just sped it up. More companies were and are looking at remote working and giving their employees more flexibility.”

Dreams delayed dreams realized

Britton didn’t stop moving forward when stay-in-place orders were issued early on and limits were placed on public gatherings. Zero Tolerance which is part coffee part artisan chocolates saw its business grow and is planning to expand its production space in a warehouse across the street.

Lisa Lampton Allen who owns Hideout Art next door to Zero Tolerance is seeing brisk business with sold-out classes.

In addition to the pizzeria being built out and construction starting on the brewery Goetzinger said he is once again in discussion with potential tenants for the Ritz Theater. Before the pandemic hit he was hopeful to sign a lease with an operator for an event venue.

Todd O’Daniel and Isaac Hines saw their plans to build a small craft brewery delayed for months because of slowdowns caused by the pandemic.

“We’ve been in planning for this for a couple of years” O’Daniel said. “We started out home brewing in the kitchen out of a 5-gallon stock pot. We took our product to market at the brewer’s union for a year. And then the pandemic hit.”

The pair didn’t give up and with support from Goetzinger construction is starting this month in what was once home to the Britton Theater. In about five months they expect to open their tap room which will have a capacity of 16 to 20 taps and an outdoor patio. Madhopper Brewing has four brands and taps will be dedicated to eight to 10 experimental beers the pair will be featuring.

“We are a craft brewery a small craft brewery” O’Daniel said. ‘We believe there is place for the big guys and little guys. We are one of the small craft places. We like the area of Britton we like where it’s going and we want to be the neighborhood brewery. We want to be a family friendly brewery and part of a story.”

Planning during the shutdown

The pandemic kick-started Hooligans which owner Kaylee Wiseman admits might not have become a reality but for a closing of barbershops and salons at the start of the pandemic that left her not working but able to pursue a business plan.

“I never thought I would own my own business” Wiseman said. “I started planning it during the shutdown. That's when I started thinking about doing my own place.”

Spending time at home with her family Wiseman began to contemplate a future where she could routinely spend weekends with them instead of at work.

She also saw the chance to provide a hybrid draw that would fit well in a working-class neighborhood like Britton.

“I liked the catering aspect of Knockouts and the pampering they offer” Wiseman said. “From there I went to Tom’s Barbershop. I learned a lot there — it’s a hole in the wall classic barbershop.”

Hooligans which opened in September combines the two approaches. Guests are offered free drinks including beer and cocktails (limit of two) waters sodas and juices. A pool table is offered as a distraction instead of televisions during waits.

Sometimes strangers get acquainted at the table while other times a father and son might take a turn with the pool cues.

“It’s a pretty big open space not crammed and pool is a game where you can keep a distance from each other” Wiseman said. “Everywhere I’ve been there is a wait so we have a pool table. We can interact with each other again.”

Business is good Wiseman said but she admits she was scared of another shutdown. But she didn’t want to miss an opportunity that will give her barbershop a future brewery and pizzeria as neighbors.

“I just liked this building” Wiseman said. “With the pizza place and brewery going it looks like it might end up being like the Plaza District.”

O’Daniel shares that hope.

“The pandemic put a hold on everything” O’Daniel said. “You're starting to see a start on local places opening up. This could be another arts district. I think people are realizing local is where it’s at and people don’t need the big box stores.”

Cautious recovery

As the first Oklahoma City mayor in a century to deal with a pandemic David Holt has walked a fine line between being a cautionary voice on keeping the infection rate down and yet remaining a booster for local arts dining shopping and entertainment.

After a brutal winter that saw hundreds of Oklahomans die from the virus including some prominent civic leaders the daily positive test cases have dropped from thousands to under a few hundred. Once strained hospitals are almost back to normal operations.

Vaccinations soon will be available to all in Oklahoma City and current predictions suggest a return to some normalcy by summer. But variants of the COVID-19 virus remain a concern and some states are once again seeing spikes in positive testing.

Crowds are once again seen in Midtown Bricktown and other popular area destinations. It’s not a total surprise to Holt that an economic rebound might be coming together so quickly.

“I feel we need to characterize the pandemic as a pause not a setback” Holt said. “It stopped us in our tracks but we can pick up on a number of fronts when this is over. When this is over is still a question but we’re pretty close. We’re pretty close to people who want a vaccination being able to get a vaccination.”

Recovery not certain

Congressional response to the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is seen as having softened the blow even before the latest $1.9 trillion relief bill signed into law earlier this month.

The federal flow of income support through the expanded unemployment insurance program was more than $4000 per worker. Direct economic impact payments and Paycheck Protection loans contributed nearly $8000 and $2000 per worker respectively. The combined effect was a 47% spike in personal income amid the recession.

In the forecast prepared for the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber Evans and Long caution their forecast is not guaranteed. They warn the local economy remains vulnerable to national and global uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 that may cause a delay in improved economic conditions.

Holt acknowledges the new normal will include challenges faced before March 2020.

“We tend to focus on the good things paused that will return” Holt said. “But there were some challenges we might have forgotten about. The shift in oil and gas and what that means for Oklahoma City moving forward hasn’t gone away. That's not any longer the predominant driver of everything that happens in Oklahoma City.”

The work at diversifying the local economy and transforming the city continues. In Britton and throughout the city those trying to make that change kept going even as the pandemic was at its worst.

“Britton is a symbol of another neighborhood district coming online during this time in a city that is becoming known for its districts” Holt said. “There are lots of things the First Americans Museum First National that were in the pipeline and that work didn’t stop. The champions of those projects were toiling away in the background and kept going.”

The Oaktree Real Estate Opportunities Fund VIII is the company’s largest real estate fund raise to date. It exceeded the group’s target of $3.5 billion.



The fund has already invested or committed around $1.7 billion with the money being used on a combination of assets.



At the start of the pandemic it was used on distressed real estate-related securities.

More recently financing has been given to public and private real estate lenders and owners experiencing issues with their leverage.



“The Covid-19 pandemic has created a compelling set of credit-focused investment opportunities for our fund” John Brady portfolio manager and head of the global real estate group at Oaktree Capital Management said in a statement. “We’re very thankful for the support and confidence we’ve received for our opportunistic yet risk-controlled approach to investing.”



The real estate strategies portion of Oaktree Capital’s business has more than $11 billion in assets under management and nearly 60 employees.



In 2019 major real estate player Brookfield Asset Management acquired a majority interest in Oaktree which continues to operate as an independent business. Prior to the Brookfield deal Oaktree was a public company for six years.



In December Denver-based oil and gas investment company BKV Corp. announced Oaktree had invested $100 million in the company. The funds will be used to support BKV’s acquisition of Devon Energy Corp.’s assets in the Barnett Shale in North Texas.



Oaktree also agreed to make a future $600 million investment in unspecified natural gas opportunities. The deal was first announced a year earlier with slightly different terms.



Also last year Oaktree became the first foreign distressed debt company to set up a wholly owned unit in China. The subsidiary is known as Oaktree (Beijing) Investment Management Co.



It had $5.4 million in registered capital to start. The company had already invested $6.5 billion in China’s distressed debt market according to Beijing’s financial regulatory department.",,,,,,,,,

The cutest thief was rewarded after he continued to steal a purple unicorn from a Dollar General.

The business in Kenansville North Carolina called animal control on Sisu a large male stray dog because of his repeated thievery. He had come to the store five times to steal the same stuffed unicorn.

However instead of being left empty-handed the Duplin County Animal Control officer who went to pick him up ended up buying the toy for Sisu instead.

The department posted pictures on social media Monday of him cuddling his coveted treasure at the county animal shelter and his story quickly went viral.

“This is what happens when you break into the dollar general consistently to steal the purple unicorn that you laid claim to but then get animal control called to lock you up for your B & E and larceny but the officer purchases your item for you and brings it in with you” the Facebook post says.

The cutest thief was rewarded after he continued to steal a purple unicorn from a Dollar General.

The long-awaited Great Canadian Dollar Store opened in Chemainus Wednesday.

“It has been a while” said assistant manager Christa Howard a Chemainus resident. “I guess it’s been two years in the making. Everything kind of got put on hold.”

As much as it’s been a long time coming the doors of the store opened suddenly.

“We kind of just opened” noted Howard. “We got the OK from the municipality and we just turned everything on. It was smokin’ busy (Wednesday). It was fantastic.”

There are seven people on staff at the store including Howard with Jon Smith as the manager.

The Chemainus Village Square store is owned by Cindi and Dave Key who have owned the Great Canadian Dollar Store in Ladysmith’s Coronation Square for 25 years. They are the longest-serving original owners and were the seventh into the Great Canadian franchise at its outset.

After a previous dollar store in Chemainus closed “we’ve been approached by several people to open one in Chemainus” said Cindi Key.

In 2019 they decided to move forward but several factors delayed the plans with COVID only compounding the issue.

“Chemainus has just been great” said Key. “Unfortunately we were later opening than we hoped. We ran across a few stumbling blocks.

“We started actually a couple of years ago. The liquor store had to be moved so we would have a back door.”

Now that the time has finally arrived Key is as relieved as anyone. “It’s been really great” she confided. “Chemainus has been waiting for it for a while.”

There’s always a certain misconception about dollar stores for many people. For one every item in the store doesn’t sell for a dollar.

“We’re not the typical dollar store” Key explained. “We bring in items that are better quality than just a dollar and still at at great price.”

The Chemainus store is actually much larger than Ladysmith’s with about 4500 square feet of retail space compared to 2700.

“We left room in it for growth” Key indicated. “You tend to fill it up quickly. We want to keep it a clean open store.”

A wide variety of items is available.

“We’ve got a great craft section in this one” Key noted. “It’s quite large. Being bigger than the Ladysmith store we can carry more.”

Howard had previously worked as manager of a hair salon in Nanaimo a business especially affected by COVID.

“I had been looking for something” she said. “With COVID my other job was part-time. This happened to pop up and it worked out nicely.

“I will be managing the people and helping with ordering and inventory.”

With COVID a grand opening isn’t in the works but people can expect specials on a regular basis.

The store is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with closing on Sundays a half hour earlier at 5:30 p.m.

WASHINGTON — Very strong winds moving through the region Sunday evening into Monday morning caused damage to construction sites at buildings and homes plus damaged electric poles in Washington D.C's metro area.

D.C. Fire and EMS reported to multiple calls for structural issues Sunday evening that had occurred across the city while winds whipped through the city.

Downed trees in the District also played a factor in the number of calls the department saw Sunday evening according to D.C. Fire and EMS.

One of the first calls that D.C. Fire and EMS responded to was in the 3200 block of Prospect Street after a large section of scaffolding atop a four-story building in caused firefighters to respond to make sure it didn’t fall any further impacting pedestrian below.

At this time no injuries have been reported for damage that has been seen across D.C. according to information released by D.C. Fire and EMS.

As of 4:20 a.m. Monday Pepco was reporting only 354 customers in D.C. were still without power. BG&E reported 1237 outages. Dominion Energy reported that as of 4:20 a.m. a little more 1584 customers were without power in northern Virginia.

WUSA9 will continue to update this story as more information on damage and power outages comes into our newsroom.

Visions of empowerment can inspire nations to scale the heights of global hegemony. Similarly however illusions of omnipotence can send fading empires crashing into oblivion. So it was with Great Britain in the 1950s and so it may be with the United States today.

By 1956 Britain had exploited its global empire shamelessly for a decade in an effort to lift its domestic economy out of the rubble of World War II. It was looking forward to doing so for many decades to come. Then an obscure Egyptian army colonel named Gamal Abdel Nasser seized the Suez Canal and Britain's establishment erupted in a paroxysm of racist outrage. The prime minister of the day Sir Antony Eden forged an alliance with France and Israel to send six aircraft carriers to the Suez area smash Egypt's tank force in the Sinai desert and sweep its air force from the skies.

But Nasser grasped the deeper geopolitics of empire in a way that British leaders had long forgotten. The Suez Canal was the strategic hinge that tied Britain to its Asian empire — to British Petroleum's oil fields in the Persian Gulf and the sea lanes to Singapore and beyond. So in a geopolitical masterstroke he simply filled a few rusting freighters with rocks and sank them at the entrance to the canal snapping that hinge in a single gesture. After Eden was forced to withdraw British forces in a humiliating defeat the once-mighty British pound trembled at the precipice of collapse and overnight the sense of imperial power in England seemed to vanish like a desert mirage.

Two decades of delusions

In a similar manner Washington's hubris is finding its nemesis in China's President Xi Jinping and his grand strategy for uniting Eurasia into the world's largest economic bloc. For two decades as China climbed step by step toward global eminence Washington's inside-the-Beltway power elite was blinded by its overarching dreams of eternal military omnipotence. In the process from Bill Clinton's administration to Joe Biden's Washington's China policy has morphed from illusion directly into a state of bipartisan delusion.

Back in 2000 the Clinton administration believed that if admitted to the World Trade Organization Beijing would play the global game strictly by Washington's rules. When China started playing imperial hardball instead — stealing patents forcing companies to turn over trade secrets and manipulating its currency to increase its exports — the elite journal Foreign Affairs tut-tutted that such charges had ""little merit"" urging Washington to avoid ""an all-out trade war"" by learning to ""respect difference and look for common ground.""

Within just three years a flood of exports produced by China's low-wage workforce drawn from 20% of the world's population began shutting down factories across America. The AFL-CIO labor confederation then started accusing Beijing of illegally ""dumping"" its goods in the U.S. at below-market prices. The administration of George W. Bush however dismissed the charges for lack of ""conclusive evidence"" allowing Beijing's export juggernaut to grind on unimpeded.

For the most part the Bush-Cheney White House simply ignored China instead invading Iraq in 2003 launching a strategy that was supposed to give the U.S. lasting dominion over the Middle East's vast oil reserves. By the time Washington withdrew from Baghdad in 2011 having wasted up to $5.4 trillion on the misbegotten invasion and occupation of that country fracking had left America on the edge of energy independence while oil was joining cordwood and coal as a fuel whose days were numbered potentially rendering the future Middle East geopolitically irrelevant.

While Washington had been pouring blood and treasure into desert sands Beijing was making itself into the world's workshop. It had amassed $4 trillion in foreign exchange which it began investing in an ambitious scheme it called the Belt and Road Initiative to unify Eurasia via history's largest set of infrastructure projects. Hoping to counter that move with a bold geopolitical gambit President Barack Obama tried to check China with a new strategy that he called a ""pivot to Asia."" It was to entail a global military shift of U.S. forces to the Pacific and a drawing of Eurasia's commerce toward America through a new set of trade pacts. The scheme brilliant in the abstract soon crashed head-first into some harsh realities. As a start extricating the U.S. military from the mess it had made in the Greater Middle East proved far harder than imagined. Meanwhile getting big global trade treaties approved as anti-globalization populism surged across America — fueled by factory closures and stagnant wages — turned out in the end to be impossible.

Even President Obama underestimated the seriousness of China's sustained challenge to this country's global power. ""Across the ideological spectrum we in the U.S. foreign policy community"" two senior Obama officials would later write ""shared the underlying belief that U.S. power and hegemony could readily mold China to the United States' liking… All sides of the policy debate erred.""

Breaking with the Beltway consensus about China Donald Trump would spend two years of his presidency fighting a trade war thinking he could use America's economic power — in the end just a few tariffs — to bring Beijing to its knees. Despite his administration's incredibly erratic foreign policy its recognition of China's challenge would prove surprisingly consistent. Trump's former national security adviser H.R. McMaster would for instance observe that Washington had empowered ""a nation whose leaders were determined not only to displace the United States in Asia but also to promote a rival economic and governance model globally."" Similarly Trump's State Department warned that Beijing harbored ""hegemonic ambitions"" aimed at ""displacing the United States as the world's foremost power.""

In the end however Trump would capitulate. By January 2020 his trade war would have devastated this country's agricultural exports while inflicting heavy losses on its commercial supply chain forcing the White House to rescind some of those punitive tariffs in exchange for Beijing's unenforceable promises to purchase more American goods. Despite a celebratory White House signing ceremony that deal represented little more than a surrender.

Joe Biden's imperial illusions

Even now after these 20 years of bipartisan failure Washington's imperial illusions persist. The Biden administration and its inside-the-Beltway foreign-policy experts seem to think that China is a problem like COVID-19 that can be managed simply by being the un-Trump. Last December a pair of professors writing in the establishment journal Foreign Affairs typically opined that ""America may one day look back on China the way they now view the Soviet Union"" that is ""as a dangerous rival whose evident strengths concealed stagnation and vulnerability.""

Sure China might be surpassing this country in multiple economic metrics and building up its military power said Ryan Hass the former China director in Obama's National Security Council but it is not 10 feet tall. China's population he pointed out is aging its debt ballooning and its politics ""increasingly sclerotic."" In the event of conflict China is geopolitically ""vulnerable when it comes to food and energy security"" since its navy is unable to prevent it ""from being cut off from vital supplies.""

In the months before the 2020 presidential election a former official in Obama's State Department Jake Sullivan began auditioning for appointment as Biden's national security adviser by staking out a similar position. In Foreign Affairs he argued that China might be ""more formidable economically … than the Soviet Union ever was"" but Washington could still achieve ""a steady state of … coexistence on terms favorable to U.S. interests and values."" Although China was clearly trying ""to establish itself as the world's leading power"" he added America ""still has the ability to more than hold its own in that competition"" just as long as it avoids Trump's ""trajectory of self-sabotage.""

As expected from such a skilled courtier Sullivan's views coincided carefully with those of his future boss Joe Biden. In his main foreign policy manifesto for the 2020 presidential campaign candidate Biden argued that ""to win the competition for the future against China"" the U.S. had to ""sharpen its innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world.""

All these men are veteran foreign policy professionals with a wealth of international experience. Yet they seem oblivious to the geopolitical foundations for global power that Xi Jinping like Nasser before him seemed to grasp so intuitively. Like the British establishment of the 1950s these American leaders have been on top of the world for so long that they've forgotten how they got there.

In the aftermath of World War II America's Cold War leaders had a clear understanding that their global power like Britain's before it would depend on control over Eurasia. For the previous 400 years every would-be global hegemon had struggled to dominate that vast land mass. In the 16th century Portugal had dotted continental coastlines with 50 fortified ports (feitorias) stretching from Lisbon to the Straits of Malacca (which connect the Indian Ocean to the Pacific) just as in the late 19th century Great Britain would rule the waves through naval bastions that stretched from Scapa Flow Scotland to Singapore.

While Portugal's strategy as recorded in royal decrees was focused on controlling maritime choke points Britain benefitted from the systematic study of geopolitics by the geographer Sir Halford Mackinder who argued that the key to global power was control over Eurasia and more broadly a tri-continental ""world island"" comprised of Asia Europe and Africa. As strong as those empires were in their day no imperial power fully perfected its global reach by capturing both axial ends of Eurasia — until America came on the scene.

The Cold War struggle for control over Eurasia

During its first decade as the globe's great hegemon at the close of World War II Washington quite self-consciously set out to build an apparatus of awesome military power that would allow it to dominate the sprawling Eurasian land mass. With each passing decade layer upon layer of weaponry and an ever-growing network of military bastions were combined to ""contain"" communism behind a 5000-mile Iron Curtain that arched across Eurasia from the Berlin Wall to the Demilitarized Zone near Seoul South Korea.

Through its post-World War II occupation of the defeated Axis powers Germany and Japan Washington seized military bases large and small at both ends of Eurasia. In Japan for example its military would occupy approximately 100 installations from Misawa air base in the far north to Sasebo naval base in the south.

Soon after as Washington reeled from the twin shocks of a communist victory in China and the start of the Korean war in June 1950 the National Security Council adopted NSC-68 a memorandum making it clear that control of Eurasia would be the key to its global power struggle against communism. ""Soviet efforts are now directed toward the domination of the Eurasian land mass"" read that foundational document. The U.S. it insisted must expand its military yet again ""to deter if possible Soviet expansion and to defeat if necessary aggressive Soviet or Soviet-directed actions.""

As the Pentagon's budget quadrupled from $13.5 billion to $48.2 billion in the early 1950s in pursuit of that strategic mission Washington quickly built a chain of 500 military installations ringing that landmass from the massive Ramstein air base in West Germany to vast sprawling naval bases at Subic Bay in the Philippines and Yokosuka Japan.

Such bases were the visible manifestation of a chain of mutual defense pacts organized across the breadth of Eurasia from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe to a security treaty ANZUS involving Australia New Zealand and the U.S. in the South Pacific. Along the strategic island chain facing Asia known as the Pacific littoral Washington quickly cemented its position through bilateral defense pacts with Japan South Korea the Philippines and Australia.

Along the Iron Curtain running through the heart of Europe 25 active-duty NATO divisions faced 150 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact divisions both backed by armadas of artillery tanks strategic bombers and nuclear-armed missiles. To patrol the Eurasian continent's sprawling coastline Washington mobilized massive naval armadas stiffened by nuclear-armed submarines and aircraft carriers — the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and the massive 7th Fleet in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.

For the next 40 years Washington's secret Cold War weapon the Central Intelligence Agency or CIA fought its largest and longest covert wars around the rim of Eurasia. Probing relentlessly for vulnerabilities of any sort in the Sino-Soviet bloc the CIA mounted a series of small invasions of Tibet and southwest China in the early 1950s; fought a secret war in Laos mobilizing a 30000-strong militia of local Hmong villagers during the 1960s; and launched a massive multibillion dollar covert war against the Red Army in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

During those same four decades America's only hot wars were similarly fought at the edge of Eurasia seeking to contain the expansion of Communist China. On the Korean Peninsula from 1950 to 1953 almost 40000 Americans (and untold numbers of Koreans) died in Washington's effort to block the advance of North Korean and Chinese forces across the 38th parallel. In Southeast Asia from 1962 to 1975 some 58000 American troops (and millions of Vietnamese Laotians and Cambodians) died in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the expansion of communists south of the 17th parallel that divided North and South Vietnam.

By the time the Soviet Union imploded in 1990 (just as China was turning into a Communist Party-run capitalist power) the U.S. military had become a global behemoth standing astride the Eurasian continent with more than 700 overseas bases an air force of 1763 jet fighters more than 1000 ballistic missiles and a navy of nearly 600 ships including 15 nuclear carrier battle groups — all linked together by a global system of satellites for communication navigation and espionage.

Despite its name the Global War on Terror after 2001 was actually fought like the Cold War before it at the edge of Eurasia. Apart from the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq the Air Force and CIA had within a decade ringed the southern rim of that landmass with a network of 60 bases for its growing arsenal of Reaper and Predator drones stretching all the way from the Sigonella Naval Air Station in Sicily to Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam. And yet in that series of failed never-ending conflicts the old military formula for ""containing"" constraining and dominating Eurasia was visibly failing. The Global War on Terror proved in some sense a long-drawn-out version of Britain's imperial Suez disaster.

China's Eurasian strategy

After all that it seems remarkable that Washington's current generation of foreign policy leaders like Britain's in the 1950s is so blindingly oblivious to the geopolitics of empire — in this case to Beijing's largely economic bid for global power on that same ""world island"" (Eurasia plus an adjoining Africa).

It's not as if China has been hiding some secret strategy. In a 2013 speech at Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev University President Xi typically urged the peoples of Central Asia to join with his country to ""forge closer economic ties deepen cooperation and expand development space in the Eurasian region."" Through trade and infrastructure ""connecting the Pacific and the Baltic Sea"" this vast landmass inhabited by close to three billion people could he said become ""the biggest market in the world with unparalleled potential.""

This development scheme soon to be dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative would become a massive effort to economically integrate that ""world island"" of Africa Asia and Europe by investing well more than a trillion dollars — a sum 10 times larger than the famed U.S. Marshall plan that rebuilt a ravaged Europe after World War II. Beijing also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with an impressive $100 billion in capital and 103 member nations. More recently China has formed the world's largest trade bloc with 14 Asia-Pacific partners and over Washington's strenuous objections signed an ambitious financial services agreement with the European Union.

Such investments almost none of a military nature quickly fostered the formation of a transcontinental grid of railroads and gas pipelines extending from East Asia to Europe the Pacific to the Atlantic all linked to Beijing. In a striking parallel with that sixteenth century chain of 50 fortified Portuguese ports Beijing has also acquired special access through loans and leases to more than 40 seaports encompassing its own latter-day ""world island"" — from the Straits of Malacca across the Indian Ocean around Africa and along Europe's extended coastline from Piraeus Greece to Zeebrugge Belgium.

With its growing wealth China also built a blue-water navy that by 2020 already had360 warships backed by land-based missiles jet fighters and the planet's second global system of military satellites. That growing force was meant to be the tip of China's spear aimed at puncturing Washington's encirclement of Asia. To cut the chain of American installations along the Pacific littoral Beijing has built eight military bases on tiny (often dredged) islands in the South China Sea and imposed an air defense zone over a portion of the East China Sea. It has also challenged the U.S. Navy's long-standing dominion over the Indian Ocean by opening its first foreign base at Djibouti in East Africa and building modern ports at Gwadar Pakistan and Hambantota Sri Lanka with potential military applications.

By now the inherent strength of Beijing's geopolitical strategy should be obvious to Washington foreign policy experts were their insights not clouded by imperial hubris. Ignoring the unbending geopolitics of global power centered as always on Eurasia those Washington insiders now coming to power in the Biden administration somehow imagine that there is still a fight to be fought a competition to be waged a race to be run. Yet as with the British in the 1950s that ship may well have sailed.

By grasping the geopolitical logic of unifying Eurasia's vast landmass — home to 70% of the world's population — through transcontinental infrastructures for commerce energy finance and transport Beijing has rendered Washington's encircling armadas of aircraft and warships redundant even irrelevant.

As Sir Halford Mackinder might have put it had he lived to celebrate his 160th birthday last month the U.S. dominated Eurasia and thereby the world for 70 years. Now China is taking control of that strategic continent and global power will surely follow.

However it will do so on anything but the recognizable planet of the last 400 years. Sooner or later Washington will undoubtedly have to accept the unbending geopolitical reality that undergirds the latest shift in global power and adapt its foreign policy and fiscal priorities accordingly.

This current version of the Suez syndrome is nonetheless anything but the usual. Thanks to longterm imperial development based on fossil fuels planet Earth itself is now changing in ways dangerous to any power no matter how imperial or ascendant. So sooner or later both Washington and Beijing will have to recognize that we are now in a distinctly dangerous new world where in the decades to come without some kind of coordination and global cooperation to curtail climate change old imperial truths of any sort are likely to be left in the attic of history in a house coming down around all our ears.

Domino's pizza is the world-leader in pizza delivery. Whether you love their pizza or hate it… or maybe you only order it when you're drunk you can't escape the ubiquitous red white and blue Domino's logo. There seems to be a Domino's franchise every few blocks in every American city and even abroad. That's actually not that far off. Domino's Pizza employs more than 290000 people in 73 countries (when you include franchises). You can get a pepperoni pizza in ""30 minutes or less"" in 5700 cities around the world. If you ever find yourself in Kosovo you can chow down on some 'za at one of FIVE locations. Today there are approximately 17000 Domino's locations with the bulk of them located in the U.S. U.K. and India. As of this writing Domino's has a market cap of $14.5 billion with annual revenue nearing $4 billion.

The Domino's Pizza empire was born in 1960. That's the year two brothers – Tom and James Monaghan – purchased a pizza restaurant in Michigan called DomiNick's.

Tom and James did not have an easy start in life. Their father died when they were both very young. They bounced around foster homes and orphanages when their mother could no longer support them on her own.

So where are the Monaghan brothers today? Are they sitting on private islands with yachts and mansions around the world? Not exactly. One brother could certainly afford these luxuries. The other brother ended up making a VERY BAD decision…

An Empire Is Born

Tom Monaghan famously wanted to join the Army but accidentally enlisted in the Marine Corps. He served from 1956 to 1959 receiving an honorable discharge. After leaving the Marine Corps Tom moved to Ann Arbor Michigan where he enrolled in the University of Michigan with the intention of studying architecture.

While Tom was a student he and James bought a small pizza store called DomiNick's in Ypsilanti Michigan near the campus of Eastern Michigan University. They picked up the joint for a total of $1400. They put $500 cash down and took out a bank loan for the remaining $900.

The brothers initially planned to split the work at the pizza shop evenly but James quickly found that didn't suit him. You see he had a full time job as a postman with a stable salary benefits and a pension. He couldn't reasonably give that up for a small pizza restaurant. More on this decision in a bit…

In 1965 Tom Monaghan purchased two more pizzerias in the same county. Around this time DomiNick's original owner asked Tom to stop using his name on the new stores. From this point on DomiNick's became Domino's. This same year the company was re-named Domino's Pizza Inc. Domino's would remain 100% privately-owned by Tom for the next 33 years.

Global Domination

The real innovation of Domino's was its focus on delivery. While it may seem obvious and ubiquitous today delivering pizzas was kind of rare in the mid-1960s. Tom developed an innovative pizza delivery box that allowed for more pizzas to be delivered at once. He proceeded to methodically expand to more college towns.

At the company's 10-year anniversary there were 200 Domino's Pizza locations. In 1983 the company expanded outside of the United States with the opening of a location in Winnipeg Canada.

In 1985 the company touched down in Japan with a location in Tokyo.

In the early 1990s the company moved into Haiti the Dominican Republic and all over India.

By 1995 there were 1000 Domino's locations worldwide.

Two years later there were 1500.

In 2012 the company shortened its name to simply ""Domino's"".

In 2014 not only did the company expand to the birth country of pizza with a location in Milan Italy it also crossed 6000 global pizza shops. By this point there were 1000 locations in India alone!

Earning A Fortune

Throughout most of this expansion Tom Monaghan operated Domino's on his own as a privately held business.

In 1998 Tom sold 93% of Domino's Pizza to private equity firm Bain Capital (which was co-founded by Mitt Romney) for $1 billion dollars.

In 2004 Domino's went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""DPZ"". Here's how DPZ has performed from 2004 to today:

What Happened To James Monaghan?

If you'll recall from earlier in our story when the brothers bought DomiNick's James had a secure job as a postman with a pension and benefits.

Considering that 99% of all restaurant ventures fail it's easy to understand James' hesitance to give up the sold security of a postal job to dive dive head-first into the world of pizza entrepreneurship.

So as they were approaching their first year of owning DomiNicks James went to Tom with a proposal.

James offered to sell his 50% stake in DomiNick's to Tom.

In return he requested to be compensated with the company's biggest non-pizza asset: A used car. Specifically a used 1959 VW Bug that the company had been using to deliver pizzas.

He worked as a security guard in the 1970s and then an electrician in the 1980s and 1990s for a local school district. He died in October 2020.

What Happened To Tom Monaghan?

Tom lived a fairly lavish life for many years.

He owned the Detroit Tigers from 1983 to 1992. He bought the team for $53 million. That's the same as around $140 million in today's dollars. He sold the team for $85 million in 1992 ironically to another pizza tycoon – Little Caesars Pizza founder Mike Ilitch.

Tom built a private resort on an island in Michigan that featured several buildings designed in a style that paid homage to architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Tom was such a fan of Wright's work that he once paid $1.6 million for a set of chairs and a dining table that had been used at some point by the famed architect. He soon became the biggest collector of Frank Lloyd Wright collections and accessories in the world.

He bought cars. A lot of cars. He paid $1 million for a Model J Duesenberg. In 1986 he paid $8.1 million for a Bugatti Royale – one of only six in the world. He sold the car a few years later for a slight loss. He would go on to build up a collection of nearly 300 rare and valuable automobiles.

He bought a Gulfstream private jet a Sirkorsky S-76 helicopter and a yacht.

And then Tom changed his life.

Philanthropy

Tom actually decided to put the company up for sale and radically change his life after reading a book called ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis. The section of the book that caused Tom to upend how he had been living was the chapter on pride. This chapter inspired Tom to give up many of the trappings of his formerly lavish life. He soon became one of America's biggest philanthropists.

At his absolute peak Tom's net worth was around $1 billion. He has committed to giving his entire fortune away.

A devout Catholic he has used his wealth to found several Catholic colleges. In 1998 he founded Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti Michigan and Ave Maria University near Naples Florida.

In 2001 he founded Ave Maria Mutual Funds an investment firm that focuses on Catholic-friendly and socially responsible investments.

To date he has donated more than $500 million to various charities.

Tom and his wife Marjorie met in the early days of Domino's. They met when he delivered her a pizza. They married and had four kids all daughters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3R2c2VyaWVzZmluYWxlLmNvbS90di1zaG93L2RvbWluby1tYXN0ZXJzLWZveC1vcmRlcnMtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tc2VyaWVzLWZvci0yMDIxLTIyLXNlYXNvbi13aXRoLWVyaWMtc3RvbmVzdHJlZXQtYXMtaG9zdC_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90dnNlcmllc2ZpbmFsZS5jb20vdHYtc2hvdy9kb21pbm8tbWFzdGVycy1mb3gtb3JkZXJzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLXNlcmllcy1mb3ItMjAyMS0yMi1zZWFzb24td2l0aC1lcmljLXN0b25lc3RyZWV0LWFzLWhvc3QvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino Masters: FOX Orders Competition Series for 2021-22 Season with Eric Stonestreet as Host,"Modern Family may be over but Eric Stonestreet is returning to network television.

Wargrave is a relatively unassuming riverside village but its inhabitants are anything but boring.

Over the years the village has been home to a number of notable stars from a singer signed by The Beatles to famous magicians and superstar songwriters.

The historic village has been named the seventh best place to live in Berkshire as voted for by its inhabitants in a poll by Muddy Stilettos. It was beaten by areas like Windsor Cookham and Caversham.

Wargrave is still home to Debbie McGee a radio and stage performer with quite a few accolades under her belt. She was a finalist on Strictly Come Dancing presents a radio show for BBC Radio Berkshire and can often be found on the panel of Loose Women.

McGee spent many years as an assistant to her magical husband Paul Daniels. Daniels died in Wargrave in 2016 from an incurable brain tumour. During his lifetime he was the first non-American to receive the Magician of the Year Award.

Daniels also took to the Strictly Come Dancing stage but wasn’t as successful as his classically-trained wife – he was voted off in the second week.

The pair who appeared on Wife Swap together in 2007 lived near the river in Wargrave for a number of years before Paul’s death.

But the magic couple aren’t the only stars that have lived in Wargrave. The village was also inhabited by a singer signed by The Beatles – Mary Hopkin.

Hopkin was one of The Beatles’ earliest signings and produced a number of records with Paul McCartney. She then went on to work with George Harrison for some of her later records.

She was signed under their label Apple Records in 1967.

Speaking of musicians Bobby Whitlock is another notable resident of the Berkshire village. The singer songwriter and musician lived in Wargrave for many years after he left Derek and the Dominos a band he was in with Eric Clapton.

In fact Whitlock speaks about his life in Berkshire in his autobiography saying: “As far I was concerned I was a resident. I had my house in Wargrave two Mercedes two dogs two children and a wife.”

In an interview he described Wagrave as ""a charming village on the Thames”.

These days the hamlet continues to be just as “charming” as Whitlock describes it with quaint English pubs and olden-day architecture.

The George and the Dragon pub offers a river view whilst you enjoy a pint in the sun and there's an annual regatta in August. You’re also just a hop skip and a jump from Henley-on-Thames and the relatively upmarket shops that it has on offer.

The Dow erased a 160-point loss and closed up 98 points at a fresh record of 33171. The S&P 500 fell 0.09% to 3971 after falling as much as 0.8% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6% to 13059.

Shares of ViacomCBS and Discovery swung between losses and gains after intense selling pressure last week. The two companies were believed to be hit by forced liquidation of positions held by the multibillion dollar family office Archegos Capital Management a source familiar with the situation told CNBC.

Discovery lost 1.6% while ViacomCBS dropped 6.7%. The two companies had lost 27% apiece during Friday's selloff.

Elsewhere Boeing gained 2.3% on news that Southwest Airlines had added 100 orders for the airliner's 737 Max jet. The first 30 jets are scheduled for delivery in 2022.

Credit Suisse shares tumbled 11.5% as the bank warned it would face a ""significant"" hit to its first-quarter results due to the bank having to exit hedge fund positions related to the forced selling. Nomura also warned that it could get hit sending its shares down 14%.

Bank stocks weighed on the Dow industrials with Morgan Stanley dropping 2.6% and JPMorgan Chase off 1.6%. The weakness came as government bond yields edged higher to start the week.

Though stocks were taking a hit from the Archegos stumble the situation is unlikely to have lasting impacts on the broader market according to Bespoke Investment Group.

""While other funds may be caught in the mess we fail to see how this specific car crash of a trade ends up propagating across the financial system via counterparty default"" Bespoke said in its morning note. However the firm did caution that investors should ""get used to the GMEs and Archegos of the world because they seem to be happening with more frequency even if their fall-out is contained.""

On Friday all three major benchmarks rallied to their session highs into the close with the blue-chip Dow closing about 450 points higher. The S&P 500 eventually climbed 1.7% to hit a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite wiped out a 0.8% loss and ended Friday 1.2% higher.

Traders are bracing for heightened volatility during this holiday-shortened week with quarter-end rebalancing among pension funds and other big investors. The recent swift advance in bond yields could set up money managers for big adjustments in their portfolios.

The Dow and the S&P 500 have risen 7.2% and 4.2% respectively so far in March. The tech-heavy Nasdaq however has dipped 1% this month as some investors jumped high-flying technology names amid rising yields.

Investors are awaiting updates from President Joe Biden about his infrastructure plan which could cost north of $3 trillion. The president is expected to unveil his plan when he travels to Pittsburgh on Wednesday and also detail how it would be paid for. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday Biden plans to roll out two packages in the coming months the first covering infrastructure and the second covering health and family care.

""The market isn't placing very high odds on this infrastructure/tax blueprint coming to fruition and while Biden probably won't get everything he's asking for Congressional Democrats and the White House are VERY intent on passing some substantial bills in the coming months"" Adam Crisafulli founder of Vital Knowledge said in a note.

“Saturday Night Live” didn’t open up with politics to kick off the latest episode of the NBC variety show but Maya Rudolph’s Kamala Harris still had her moment.

Rudolph the host of this week’s “SNL” who has played the vice president multiple times welcomed guests to a Passover meal.

She did so with her husband and second gentleman Doug Emhoff who was played by guest star Martin Short.

“What better night to celebrate a new beginning than Passover?” Rudolph’s Harris said. “That’s why it’s time for ‘A Kamala Harris Unity Seder.’”

She then said that tonight “we ask the four questions: ‘How’s school?’ ‘Did you eat?’ ‘When are you giving me grandchildren?’ and ‘What’s with the haircut?’”

Rudolph's Harris introduced Martin Short as Doug Emhoff the second gentleman. NBC

Rudolph’s Harris then invited out Short’s Emhoff who said he was shy as he was looking away from the camera.

So Rudolph’s Harris told him to act as if it was just them. Short’s Emhoff immediately embraced Rudolph’s Harris.

The two swayed back and forth in the dim light as Short’s Emhoff whispered in the ear of Rudolph’s Harris.

“Listen to me girl. I support you” he said. “You got this baby!”

The two stopped embracing to welcome their guests.

The first guest at Seder was Sen. Ted Cruz played Aidy Bryant. The fake senator was so happy to be there he brought cupcakes and pigs in a blanket to the meal.

“Well we can’t eat pork or bread… so thank you” Rudolph’s Harris said.

Then the biggest guest of the Seder showed up: President Joe Biden played by Alex Moffat. He was beaming from his press conference this week.

“Hey did you guys catch my press conference? It was so easy” Moffat’s Biden said. He then read some notes off index cards to communicate at the meal.

After a moment Moffat’s Biden reminded Kamala Harris that he was putting her in charge at the Mexican border.

“Thank you for the opportunity. Such a fun solvable problem” Rudolph’s Harris said. “And what are you in charge of?”

Moffat’s Biden smiled and said “giving out checks!”

“Who wants stimmys?!” Moffat’s Biden said pretending to make it rain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbC5jbGFzc2ljY2Fycy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yNy9sZWF2ZS1pdC10by1iZWF2ZXItYWN0b3JzLWZpcnN0LWNhci1jb21lcy1iYWNrLXRvLWhpbS01MC15ZWFycy1sYXRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Leave It to Beaver' actor's first car comes back to him 50 years later,"When they’re not at car shows many Baby Boomers are reliving their childhoods on Saturday mornings watching reruns of television Westerns such as Gunsmoke The Rifleman Bonanza and Have Gun Will Travel.

Recently while eating my morning bowl of Cheerios in front of the television set I discovered that at 8 a.m. every weekday one of my favorite family sitcoms is on. Leave It to Beaver ran from 1957 to 1963.

The storyline followed a curious and often naïve boy Theodore “The Beaver” Cleaver played by Jerry Mathers and his adventures at home school and around the neighborhood. Barbara Billingsley and Hugh Beaumont played his parents with Tony Dow as The Beaver’s older brother Wally.

Each episode ended with an important message that taught life lessons and not just to the kids but to parents as well and with a touch of humor.

Fast forward several decades and it turns out that while Tony Dow wasn’t the typical car guy he was involved with cars throughout his acting career.

He also has had a long friendship with Fireball Tim Lawrence a Hollywood concept artist responsible for designing more than 400 Hollywood movie cars including Batmobile 1989 (designed while Fireball was a student at The Art Center College of Design) as well as cars seen in The Avengers The Dukes of Hazzard Starsky and Hutch The Green Hornet and the Fast and the Furious.

One of Fireball’s current endeavors is publishing Kustom automotive (and sea life) coloring books and trading cards (www.fireballtim.com). Subjects of the coloring books include the likes of Gene Winfield Gary Wales Syd Mead and — Tony Dow.

The Tony Dow book written by Tony and his wife Lauren and illustrated by Fireball Tim covers everything from Leave It to Beaver to cars sailing and Dow’s work as a sculptor.

Boomers myself among them flocked to Autobooks-Aerobooks in Burbank California for a book signing session featuring the Dow still humble and with his shy smile.

Fans asked questions and Dow conversed naturally and happily.

Among things we discovered was that Dow was an accomplished swimmer and at age 14 held five national records and also was the top-rated junior diver on the West Coast.

As the story goes he landed the role of Wally pretty much by accident. The Beaver pilot has another teenager in the role but that actor was maturing too quickly for the TV show. So old-time Hollywood producer Harry Akerman had a casting call that drew thousands of hopefuls.

He wasn’t satisfied with any of them but knew Dow from another pilot project.

Dow got the “Wally” part almost by accident when the original pilot had cast some other kid as “Wally” but grew up too fast so an old-time Hollywood producer Harry Akerman knew Dow from a previous pilot and offered him the role.

“I had almost no acting experience” Dow said “which was probably the best thing about me and was not affected by that whole Hollywood scene.”

While Leave It to Beaver was not a car-orientated series there were many automotive experiences throughout the episodes and future drag racing star “TV Tommy” Ivo played a character named Duke in a few episodes. (Book plug: Ivo wrote the forward to my book Top Fuel Dragsters of the 1970s which is available on Amazon.)

Dow told how as a youngster “my buddy and I used to take the engine off his dad’s lawnmower and make these cool cars we’d drive around the neighborhood.”

“The writer of the show heard the story and wrote a script about it and even rented my car for the show” Dow recalled.

Over the years Dow owned a bunch of cars and in the show a 1958 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1957 Triumph TR3A made appearances as vehicles owned by members of The Barrons the school car club.

Wally spends $220 for a 1953 Chevrolet in one episode and in another he bases his father’s 1963 Plymouth Fury.

The first car Dow bought in real life was a 1962 Chevrolet Corvair Spyder.

“I had the Chevy factory in Van Nuys paint it Midnight Blue with a black interior.”

In 1965 Dow sold the car to a prop man Al at Universal Studios. Two decades later Al did a ground-up restoration of the car installing a turbocharge spider engine with alcohol injection that boosted its horsepower to 245.

Al became ill in 2015 and passed the car on to his friend Marty but with instructions that if they could find Tony Dow the car would go back to its original owner.

“So after 50 years my first car has returned to my garage” Dow said his eyes illuminated as he starred ahead. “It’s painted black now but the original plate is still on it with a frame that reads ‘“unsafe at any speed” — Ralph Nader’.”

After selling the car to Al in the ‘60s Dow bought a Sky Blue 1962 Corvette. He was going to buy a Mercedes-Benz 300SL — until he discovered a tune-up would cost him $300.

After Leave It to Beaver Dow appeared in other shows including The Love Boat Knight Rider Babylon Quincy ME and Mod Squad. He even stared in a West Side Story production in Cleveland.

Dow eventually became a director and a visual effects supervisor working on movies including The New Lassie Swamp Thing Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Babylon 5.

Dow was part of an artistic family and he and Lauren devote their time to creative projects including Tony’s sculpture with designs in burl wood and modern pieces in bronze.

Underscoring his artistic capabilities Dow received a call one day several years ago from a Beverly Hills gallery owner informing the former childhood actor that one of his bronzes had been accepted in the Salon 2008 Carrousel du Louvre Paris.

As it says in the subtitle to the Dow coloring book “From ‘Leave It to Beaver’ to cool cars sailing animals & Sculpture… This is Tony Dow!”"

She expected all power to be restored by Friday night.

The City of Hamilton Electric Department had about 3000 without power at times Friday morning said Patrick Moore systems engineer.

Thelen called the storm “pretty significant” and the hardest hit area in Butler County was Princeton Road in Fairfield Twp.

Replacing a pole is about an eight-hour job and requires the work of several crew members and trucks she said. Thelen said the job is more challenging because workers have to follow health guidelines related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Thelen said Duke workers constantly perform vegetation management when they remove tree limbs near power lines. Even when branches are cut away high winds can push them into power lines she said.

She said the wind storm showed the “critical nature” of clearing the right of ways.

Moore warned residents to treat every downed power line as if it’s energized.

He described the wind storm as “not our worst but still up there.”

It was produced in partnership with Georgia Health News which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Mark Berry raised his right hand pledging to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The bespectacled mechanical engineer took his seat inside the cherry-wood witness stand. He pulled his microphone close to his yellow bow tie and glanced left toward five of Georgia’s most influential elected officials. As one of Georgia Power’s top environmental lobbyists Berry had a clear mission on that rainy day in April 2019: Convince those five energy regulators that the company’s customers should foot the bill for one of the most expensive toxic waste cleanup efforts in state history.

When Berry became Georgia Power’s vice president of environmental affairs in 2015 he inherited responsibility for a dark corporate legacy dating back to before he was born. For many decades power companies had burnt billions of tons of coal dumping the leftover ash — loaded with toxic contaminants — into human-made “ponds” larger than many lakes. But after a pair of coal-ash pond disasters in Tennessee and North Carolina exposed the environmental and health risks of those largely unregulated dumps the Obama administration required power companies to stop using the aging disposal sites.

Berry had spent nearly two decades climbing the ranks of Southern Company America’s second-largest energy provider and the owner of Georgia Power. By the time he was under oath that day company execs had vowed to store newly burnt coal ash in landfills designed for safely disposing of such waste. But an unprecedented challenge remained: Figuring out what to do with 90 million tons of coal ash — enough to fill more than 50 Major League Baseball stadiums to the brim — that had accumulated over the better part of a century in ash ponds that were now leaking.

Georgia Power would have to shut down roughly 30 ponds from the Appalachian foothills to the wetlands near the Georgia coast. After draining all the ponds the company would have two options for disposing of the highly contaminated dry ash left behind: It could either move the ash into a landfill fitted with a protective liner or pack the dry ash into a smaller footprint and place a cover on top — leaving a gaping hole in the ground that in some places would be larger than Disneyland. The former would cost more but vastly reduce the possibility of toxic leakage; the latter lowered expenses but would perpetually risk contaminating drinking water in neighboring communities.

As scientists had grown more aware of the threat posed by coal ash Southern states like Virginia and North Carolina had forced utilities to move ash into lined landfills. But Georgia was something of an outlier. The state historically was known as a coal ash capital a place where lawmakers touted their pro-business bona fides by denouncing regulations and Georgia Power had a track record of delaying or blocking efforts to regulate pollution. The company was lobbying hard for the cheaper option.

Of course the $7.3 billion price tag wasn’t all that cheap. Sitting on the Georgia Public Service Commission’s witness stand Berry and his top deputy spent hours arguing that the whopping costs of cleaning up Georgia Power’s coal-ash ponds should be passed along to its customers. If Berry could persuade the regulators that the costs were both “reasonable” and “prudent” the company could tack a monthly fee onto the bills of 2.2 million residential customers for decades to come which would work out to each customer footing $3300 of the bill to clean up the company’s mess. If he failed the commissioners could effectively force Georgia Power to eat those costs — a major blow to investors in a publicly traded company that has annual operating revenues of over $8 billion.

During Berry’s testimony PSC commissioner Tim Echols said he has concerns about putting ratepayers on the hook for the costs of cleaning up the ash ponds — and whether Georgia Power is spending more than it has to. “This is enormously expensive” he said.

Berry didn’t mention that the cleanup costs could increase by billions of dollars if Georgia’s environmental officials adopted the safer standards used by neighboring states. Anticipating Echols’ next question Berry said that Georgia Power’s $7.3 billion plan was the “most cost-effective way” to comply with coal-ash regulations.

“If we were to do something less” Berry added state environmental officials “would force us to go back and redo what we did not do right the first time.”

Had those five energy regulators swiveling in their chairs asked more pointed questions about Georgia Power’s waste-disposal practices Berry would have been pressured to tell a long-hidden story about ash and avarice. In the second half of the 20th century Georgia Power had saved money by building some of America’s largest coal-ash ponds without a protective liner underneath despite knowing some of the risks of contaminating residents’ drinking water. It had also sought to do as little as possible to protect drinking water that’s now believed to be tainted by coal-ash toxins.

This map refers to the testing of well water for contaminants found in coal ash including hexavalent chromium. In 2016 the same year the testing began Georgia Power went on a buying spree acquiring properties near Plant Scherer and sealing those wells. The company denies coal ash sickened local residents saying hexavalent chromium is “naturally occurring.” Andrea Suozzo/ProPublica

A yearlong investigation by Georgia Health News and ProPublica has revealed that Georgia Power and its parent company have spent millions of dollars on lobbying tactics to dodge billions in environmental costs. Thousands of pages of previously unpublished documents obtained by the news organizations shed new light on how Georgia Power leveraged political tensions to reduce a massive financial liability that could decimate its bottom line — and how it pushed disinformation to distance itself from patterns of sickness among people who lived near its coal-ash ponds.

Georgia Power spokesperson John Kraft declined to answer most of the news organizations’ questions and to make Berry available for an interview. Kraft said in a statement that Georgia Power has worked to “quickly and safely begin closing all of our ash ponds” in a manner that complies with federal and state coal-ash regulations.

But at the hearing in April 2019 none of the energy regulators pressed Berry on the topic of coal-ash contamination. Because they didn’t ask Berry remained mum. His silence would make it easier for the regulators to stomach the idea of passing the cost of the cleanup on to customers — and easier for Georgia Power to avoid responsibility for the much more expensive fix. And it allowed Georgia Power to continue its longstanding efforts to cover up the hazards of coal ash across the state most notably in a tiny town where the company operates the largest coal-fired plant in the Western Hemisphere.

In the spring of 1974 as Atlanta Braves slugger Hank Aaron shattered Babe Ruth’s home run record and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson first forged a friendship with Governor Jimmy Carter ahead of his presidential campaign a towering attorney named Tommy Malone set his sights on a white two-story house in the sleepy central Georgia town of Juliette.

Malone would years later become one of the state’s most successful medical malpractice attorneys. At the time though he ran a firm that had hit a financial rough patch. To cover payroll he’d landed a gig representing Georgia Power which sought to buy thousands of acres for a new coal-fired power plant. Georgia law allowed the utility to condemn nearly any property it wanted. But the actual use of eminent domain spurred negative headlines and local resentment — both of which could undermine Georgia Power’s carefully cultivated corporate reputation. So Georgia Power dispatched Malone to convince residents of Juliette to sell their land. He’d been scouting properties along Luther Smith Road a winding two-lane street hugged by Georgia pines. The white house belonged to a retired cowboy named Brack Goolsby. Malone hoped Goolsby might willingly sell more than 300 acres.

The Goolsby family home had stood long before Brack rode his first horse before his hometown was established in the 1880s and even before General William Tecumseh Sherman’s troops passed through it on the infamous March to the Sea. Brack’s family had such deep roots in Juliette that the road he lived on was named for his Uncle Luther.

When Luther Smith died in the early 1950s he left the family home to his nephew. Brack and his wife Betty raised two sons Mark and Bob who grew up exploring the family’s untamed forests. Two decades later when Georgia Power announced its plans to build a 12000-acre plant site abutting Luther Smith Road some neighbors balked. They fought the company’s use of eminent domain. One farmer’s wife mailed a desperate letter to Carter writing that their land tended by them through good times and bad is “not for sale at any price. … We hold precious its beauty the quiet and peace.”

A small-town peanut farmer who frequently rafted down Georgia rivers Carter raised concerns to his aides about the plant’s environmental impact. The aides peppered Georgia Power Executive Vice President Harold McKenzie with questions about how much energy — and pollution — the plant would generate. When the conversation turned to a waste-disposal site nearly the size of Central Park one Carter aide asked McKenzie: What do you do when the ash pond fills up?

Clean it up McKenzie promised according to the Carter administration’s notes from that meeting.

Carter’s hands were ultimately tied: Georgia lawmakers had previously granted the utility immense power for an investor-owned company. (A spokesperson for President Carter did not respond to an interview request.) Not only could Georgia Power use eminent domain to condemn property without public hearings it had the authority to build new plants nearly wherever it wanted. Georgia Power quickly acquired the land for its new coal-fired plant site. The company would eventually name the plant after McKenzie’s boss CEO Bob Scherer who guided Georgia Power through a tumultuous period marked by the oil embargo of the 1970s.

In the midst of Georgia Power’s land-buying spree Brack Goolsby took Malone’s offer and sold 312 acres of land for $207524. Goolsby kept roughly 30 acres and his house which was on the other side of Luther Smith Road from the Plant Scherer site. Goolsby was relieved that the home would remain there for his kids and grandkids. For several years whenever he turned right out of his driveway Brack watched as the company felled trees and dug deep into the red Georgia clay to build a pit for all the ash left over from burning mountains of coal.

In late 1976 two years after Georgia Power bought the Goolsbys’ land Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act granting the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the disposal of waste including everything from household garbage to some radioactive materials. The EPA considered whether coal ash should be classified as a hazardous waste. The designation would have required electric utilities to install a protective liner under every existing or proposed ash pond to prevent contaminants from seeping into underground aquifers.

Roughly four out of five Americans get their household water from their city or county. That water is typically sourced from lakes and rivers tested for toxins treated and piped directly to homes. But 43 million people largely in rural areas rely on a private drinking well that pumps up groundwater from an underground aquifer.

By the time the act was passed scientists knew coal ash contained trace metals such as arsenic chromium lead and other chemicals recognizable from the periodic table all of which could slowly infiltrate groundwater. In 1979 Tennessee ecologist Robert Van Hook wrote in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health Perspectives that the trace metals in coal ash “may constitute human health problems” including increased risk of cancer. With utilities burning record levels of coal each year and thus producing more ash Van Hook called for an evaluation of the “potential for contamination of drinking water supplies by trace elements in leachates from settling ponds.”

Most ash ponds at that time had not been built with protective liners and America’s power company execs feared that retrofitting them would collectively cost more than $20 billion — $72 billion in today’s dollars. Coal ash’s designation as “hazardous” would not only impact Georgia Power but also Alabama Power Gulf Power and other utilities in the Southern Company system. Southern Company soon found an ally in Congressman Tom Bevill then a seven-term Alabama Democrat whose father had mined coal on the northwest outskirts of Birmingham where coal had burned at one of the system’s oldest plants since World War I.

During a speech in 1980 as lawmakers debated a bill to strengthen the EPA’s ability to enforce waste regulations Bevill told his colleagues he knew of no evidence that coal ash “has ever presented a substantial hazard to human health or the environment.” He proposed to exempt coal ash from hazardous waste regulations until the EPA conducted more studies. His amendment passed with minimal attention.

The Bevill Amendment ushered in an era during which Georgia Power and other utilities could keep dumping coal ash into unlined ponds — despite emerging evidence of contamination. That same year an EPA study described how trace metals in coal-ash ponds could seep deep enough into the ground to come into contact with groundwater. Recognizing the threat some utilities changed their coal-ash practices absent any federal mandates including the Northern Indiana Public Service Company which installed a $2.3 million liner under an ash pond that was leaking wastewater. And while some states like Maryland and Louisiana created tougher regulations for coal-ash disposal other states such as Georgia and Ohio did not.

By the early 1980s Southern Company execs knew that storing coal ash in ponds without a protective liner could contaminate groundwater. Internal corporate filings obtained by Georgia Health News and ProPublica from multiple state archives show that an in-house research and development company called Southern Company Services Inc. was established to design plant sites for utilities in the Southern Company system. In the 1970s Florida environmental regulators denied an SCSI-designed ash pond proposal for Plant Crist in Pensacola which was owned by Southern Company’s Gulf Power because the plans lacked a “suitable liner … constructed to prevent leaching” according to the records. In response from 1977 to 1982 SCSI developed a $20 million waste-disposal system to hold dry coal ash with a liner underneath.

Simultaneously SCSI designed Plant Scherer in Juliette where it could have included a liner like it did at Plant Crist. However Georgia Power claimed in filings that a protective liner at Plant Scherer was “not economically feasible.” Indeed the installation of a liner at Plant Scherer’s ash pond could have cost as much as $95 million according to industry estimates from the time.

When Georgia Power fired up Plant Scherer’s first unit in late 1982 water and ash flowed into a giant hole buttressed by an earthen berm that stood 100 feet tall. Engineers had designed the pond to be large enough to accept waste into the next century. With each week that passed tiny contaminants in the ash pond seeped through soil under the pond and into an underground aquifer according to company filings. And as weeks turned to years water in the aquifer slowly carried those contaminants closer to Luther Smith Road.

Water is part of Andrea Goolsby’s earliest memories of her grandparents’ home. She watered her father’s tomatoes sipped from her grandfather’s garden hose and ate fresh strawberries washed by her grandmother. The idea that Brack and Betty Goolsby’s water might be contaminated by the nearby power plant never figured into family conversations back then. It hadn’t crossed the minds of Andrea’s grandparents parents or sisters nor those of her aunts uncles or cousins who also lived near Plant Scherer.

“I’d see the ash pond” Andrea later recalled. “It just looked like a big lake.”

Bevill had indicated back in 1980 that two years of EPA research would definitively rule out the possibility that coal ash could be harmful to human health. But the agency didn’t issue a report for another eight years informing Congress in 1988 that while coal ash had caused some cases of groundwater contamination the agency had insufficient evidence to reclassify coal ash as a hazardous waste. That same year investigators with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division collected groundwater samples from several older Georgia Power plant sites that revealed evidence of contamination. Groundwater at Plant McManus in Brunswick contained chromium at levels 16 times higher than Georgia deemed safe for drinking. And at Plant Mitchell in Albany groundwater contained levels of lead that exceeded federal drinking water standards. The investigators who estimated that thousands of residents near the plants relied on private wells for drinking water recommended further examination of groundwater contamination. (Current EPD spokesperson Kevin Chambers said the division has no records indicating that officials followed up with subsequent investigations; Georgia Power declined to elaborate on the findings of the reports.)

Georgians who lived near coal-ash ponds including ones at newer plant sites like Scherer told GHN and ProPublica they were never informed by the EPD or Georgia Power that their drinking water might be contaminated. As a child Andrea had played at Plant Scherer cookouts held for hundreds of employees including her father and uncle. As a teenager she benefited from Georgia Power’s tax dollars that helped fund one of the state’s best public school systems. Many of Andrea’s neighbors believed that Georgia Power had revived Juliette a place that after serving as the backdrop for the 1991 Kathy Bates film “Fried Green Tomatoes” became a quaint symbol of small-town America.

Andrea loved her small town. Juliette felt safe a place untouched by tragedy. She had experienced little in the way of loss until one windy Thursday in November 2002. Andrea then a 15-year-old high school student watched her grandfather writhe in pain on the living room couch. Earlier that week Brack had been diagnosed with late-stage cancer in his bile duct a tube that connects the liver to the small intestine. She hugged him tight worried it might be the last time. Indeed it was. Brack died the next day.

Three days later Andrea stayed home from school to say goodbye to her grandfather who was buried at the Juliette United Methodist Church cemetery two miles north of Plant Scherer’s front gates. His death would be first in a string of nine cancers among her extended family members who lived near the plant. At first no one suspected that the sicknesses that came next — a great aunt diagnosed with breast cancer two distant relatives who died from leukemia — were anything but coincidental.

But then Andrea’s family noticed changes around the family’s land: Their plants and animals were dying more often than usual. The Goolsby family began to wonder why after years of good health a wave of sickness and death had descended on Luther Smith Road.

In December 2008 four months after Andrea’s second relative died of leukemia more than a billion gallons of coal ash slurry broke through a dike at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston Fossil Plant. A wave of dark gray sludge spread over 300 acres as deep as 6 feet downing power lines pushing a home off its foundation and filling a nearby river with toxins. As the hidden dangers of coal ash flooded into plain sight and workers began cleaning up the waste environmentalists swiftly called for stricter regulations including a liner mandate to prevent toxins from seeping out of unlined ash ponds.

Until the Kingston spill devastated the 6300-person town of Harriman located 250 miles north of Juliette air pollution from coal-fired power plants had long overshadowed the peril of groundwater contamination caused by coal ash. Around the turn of the millennium U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno had filed an epic lawsuit against Southern Company and other utility giants for allegedly violating the Clean Air Act. Plant Scherer was one of more than two dozen coal-fired plants that according to the EPA had “illegally released massive amounts of air pollutants.” (Southern Company wrote in an annual report that “the action against Georgia Power has been administratively closed.”) As Reno’s lawsuit grabbed headlines Southern Company quietly partnered with its allies to quash a stricter coal-ash regulation.

In the late 1990s nearly two decades after the Bevill amendment exempted coal ash from being classified as a hazardous waste (and after Bevill promised that a definitive analysis of coal ash’s danger would be available in two years) the EPA finally wrapped up its coal-ash studies which determined that coal ash posed “significant risks to human health and the environment when not properly managed.” The agency cited 11 cases where coal ash contaminants were found in ground or surface water at levels that exceeded health standards as well as dozens of other newly reported cases of water contamination. Communities from Faulkner Maryland to Velva North Dakota were grappling with the consequences of coal ash. Regulators forced utilities in Wisconsin and Virginia to pay to hook homes up to a public water supply after contaminating their private drinking wells. Beyond these cases the EPA determined that utilities had installed well networks to monitor groundwater quality at only 38 percent of the nation’s ash ponds and installed protective liners at just 26 percent of them. Given those low percentages and the limited oversight by states EPA officials recommended tougher coal ash regulations — ones that stopped short of reclassifying coal ash as a hazardous waste.

Medical experts say that over a dozen trace metals in coal ash can lead to health ailments ranging from mild (nausea) to serious (organ damage). The type and extent of health problems can vary greatly depending on the amount of contaminants entering the body the duration of the consumption and even where the coal was originally mined. Of those dozen toxins several — including arsenic and hexavalent chromium — are considered to be carcinogenic if consumed even in small amounts over a long period of time. The list of cancers linked to coal ash contaminants include ones in the liver and lungs prostate and bladder and stomach and skin.

In 2000 as the EPA proposed tougher coal-ash regulations Southern Company fought those efforts. Georgia Power Alabama Power and Gulf Power were all dues-paying members of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group an industry association of over 100 utilities. Led by a lobbyist named Jim Roewer USWAG had previously recruited power company employees to testify against the hazardous waste designation and attack environmental studies that were being considered by the EPA. (Roewer did not respond to multiple interview requests.) On behalf of Southern Company and other utilities USWAG lobbyists aggressively pressured the Clinton administration to stop the EPA proposal citing the billions of dollars it would take to clean up toxins from the ash ponds. They argued against the regulation in letters and in-person meetings. Ultimately the Clinton administration backed off from the tougher coal ash regulations.

But the risks the EPA tracked remained hidden from the public. During the George W. Bush administration EPA officials had produced internal reports that showed people who lived close to unlined coal-ash ponds were more susceptible to cancer. The EPA report found that nearby residents had as much as a 1 in 50 lifetime risk of developing cancer from drinking water with high levels of arsenic one of the most common coal-ash contaminants. That’s 200 times higher than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s recommended risk level for limiting worker exposure to any carcinogen. When environmental advocates tried to obtain those records officials delayed their release for years; they were made public by the Obama administration only after the Kingston spill.

Georgians rarely heard about problems with Georgia Power’s ash ponds. In 2002 local journalists covered the story of a 4-acre sinkhole at northwest Georgia’s Plant Bowen which released over 2 million gallons of arsenic-laced ash and water into a nearby creek. From 1988 to 2008 GHN and ProPublica found that Georgia Power had disclosed to state regulators dozens of other unpermitted discharges at its coal plants. The vast majority which were logged by state environmental officials were not publicized by those officials or the media.

After chilling images of toxic Tennessee ash circulated in 2008 Obama’s EPA administrator Lisa Jackson vowed that environmental disasters like the one in Kingston “should never happen anywhere.” When EPA officials sought further information from the records of coal-ash pond safety inspections after the Kingston spill Georgia Power initially moved to prevent the release of that information claiming those records contained trade secrets. The EPA rejected that argument. Ultimately the EPA found that over a quarter of the country’s 559 coal-ash ponds were rated “poor” in a safety assessment and required remedial action to correct their flaws. (One of Georgia Power’s ash ponds at Plant Hammond was rated poor; most were deemed “satisfactory.”)

During a 2009 meeting with EPA officials Southern Company CEO David Ratcliffe and other utility execs urged then-EPA Administrator Jackson not to impose liner mandates for coal-ash ponds. Jackson told the utility execs that she “understands all sides of the argument” regarding coal-ash regulations but did not comment specifically on the issue of liners according to an EPA readout. (Jackson who is no longer with the EPA did not respond to a request for comment.) Southern Company’s top environmental affairs executive Chris Hobson followed that 2009 meeting with a letter that claimed its unlined ash ponds were “safe and functioning.”

Five years passed without new regulations. Then in February 2014 a pipe ruptured at a Duke Energy coal-fired plant flooding North Carolina’s Dan River with 39000 tons of ash. The Dan River spill finally pushed the EPA to enact America’s first-ever federal coal-ash regulations in 2015. The rule sought to lower the risk of catastrophic failures protect groundwater and outline best practices for shuttering ash ponds. Under those regulations Georgia Power would be required to publicly disclose the results of groundwater monitoring tests near its ash ponds.

But the industry’s fierce lobbying campaign defanged stronger protections originally proposed by the EPA. Once again utilities escaped the hazardous waste label for coal ash. Georgia Power could still dump the ash into unlined ponds so long as the utility proved that large amounts of contaminants were not leaking beyond a pond’s edges. Environmentalists criticized the rule for squandering a historic opportunity to pass strict regulations including mandated liners.

“The coal-ash rule was a compromise” said Avner Vengosh professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University who is one of the nation’s leading experts on coal ash. “Instead of declaring it as a hazardous waste they were reluctant to do so for political reasons.”

In 2011 nine years after Brack’s death (and three years before the EPA finalized the coal-ash rule) Andrea noticed that her grandmother had stopped drinking water from the kitchen tap. She’d started to worry after word had spread that something might be wrong with the groundwater that supplied her drinking well. Suspicions grew that summer after Georgia Power purchased the 2-acre lot next to the family’s property for $218750 a stunning price considering the average acre in the area sold for four figures. The property belonged to Gloria Dorsett Andrea’s great-aunt the one diagnosed with breast cancer. Georgia Power required that Dorsett sign a nondisparagement agreement razed her home and sealed off the drinking well preventing future testing of its groundwater. (State law requires the utility to seal unused wells within three years to protect against accidents and illegal dumping.)

Andrea couldn’t help but think about all those summer days in her childhood drinking from the garden hose. After switching to bottled water herself she searched for news articles that mentioned groundwater contamination near coal plants. She then turned to scientific studies to better understand the effects of coal ash on human health.

From 2014 to 2018 Monroe County had one of Georgia’s highest rates of cancer incidence at 522 cases per 100000 people which was 12 percent higher than the statewide average and 17 percent higher than the national one. Juliette with 3000 residents accounted for about a tenth of Monroe County’s population. Andrea wondered if Juliette’s cancer rate was even higher than Monroe County’s — it would take just 16 new cancer incidences in an average year for Juliette to exceed the county rate. But no formal cancer-cluster study had been conducted to determine if coal-ash toxins had contributed to their sicknesses.

Dr. Alan Lockwood a neurologist who wrote “The Silent Epidemic: Coal and the Hidden Threat to Health” says that it’s “really difficult” to establish a link between the health outcomes reported by an individual — or even a single family like the Goolsbys who’ve had numerous cancer incidences — and trace metals found in groundwater. To establish that link epidemiologists must study data collected from private wells in an entire community over time and review the medical histories of residents to determine if a place is a cancer hotspot. Because of the costs time and expertise needed Lockwood said “the deck is stacked in favor of the company because of how difficult it is to show a cause-and-effect relationship.”

To prove such a thing in court residents must rely on deep-pocketed lawyers to fund class-action suits. If all the stars align a company will be pressured into a settlement. More often than not big corporations with seemingly endless resources can evade responsibility. Despite the long-shot odds of holding Georgia Power accountable Andrea felt there was no other choice but to seek answers about the water. To her the pursuit was not just a question of sickness or health contaminated or not: It might reveal a greater unsettling truth about the unintended consequences of a tightknit town placing its faith in the hands of a corporation that pledged to do right by its residents.

In 2013 three of Andrea’s relatives were among more than 100 current and former Monroe County residents who sued Georgia Power claiming the utility had knowingly released toxins contained in coal ash into the air and groundwater. The lawsuit contended that contaminants from Plant Scherer caused a “loss of potable water supply and increased risk of diseases.” In court filings Georgia Power denied the claims. But before the case proceeded to discovery one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs abruptly dropped out prompting the suit to be dismissed without prejudice in 2014 — a disposition that allowed for the filing of future claims. In a moment of despair Andrea looked up the email of Erin Brockovich the environmental activist who had uncovered evidence that Pacific Gas and Electric Company had contaminated drinking wells with hexavalent chromium in Hinkley California a tiny town more than 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Hundreds of Hinkley residents alleged that tainted drinking water had caused miscarriages cancers and a scourge of chronic illnesses. After a three-year legal battle PG&E agreed to pay a record-setting $333 million settlement in private arbitration. Andrea pasted into the email a news article about Juliette residents’ fears over contamination followed by a brief urgent message.

“What can we do about this?” Goolsby wrote.

Brockovich promised to look into the matter. But when Goolsby didn’t immediately hear back her family looked for help closer to home. (Brockovich did not respond to a request for comment.) In the summer of 2016 Andrea’s father Mark — who’d left Georgia Power the mid-’90s to become a funeral home director — learned of an environmental nonprofit called the Altamaha Riverkeeper that had called for his former employer to safely close its ash ponds. During a conversation with the organization’s executive director Jen Hilburn Mark Goolsby explained his concerns about potential groundwater contamination along Luther Smith Road. In response Hilburn told a story about nearby Lake Sinclair in Milledgeville. Earlier that year heavy rains had threatened to send water pouring over the top of an ash pond’s berm at Plant Branch which could have caused a major breach. Hilburn received an anonymous tip that the plant had pumped wastewater into the lake avoiding a violation of its permit but polluting that 24-square-mile body of water. She flew a camera drone overhead sent her photos to state officials and publicized the risks. Residents and lawmakers successfully pressured Georgia Power to move the ash out of the plant’s pond and into a lined landfill. (Georgia Power said in a statement that the decision was about “more than compliance” and reflected its commitment to “protecting water quality every step of the way.”)

One afternoon that August Hilburn traveled up Luther Smith Road to the Goolsby family home. Mark showed her the dying trees and the surface water on his property that had a sheen of oil. After walking over to a small roofed structure that housed the well that supplied water to Goolsby’s taps Hilburn pulled on gloves broke the seal of a sterile plastic bottle and filled it with water. She collected several bottles and shipped them to a lab in North Carolina. The lab would determine if the contaminants found in Goolsby’s well were the same ones found in coal ash — and whether they were present at high enough levels to be harmful.

When the results came back a couple weeks later Hilburn called Goolsby to explain that the well water sample confirmed the presence of several heavy metals such as boron considered one of the DNA fingerprints of coal ash and cobalt a trace metal confirmed to be leaking out of Scherer’s ash pond at levels that exceeded federal groundwater-protection standards. She also said that the samples contained worrisome levels of hexavalent chromium: 2.3 parts per billion 33 times higher than what North Carolina public health guidelines deem safe and 115 times higher than what California ones do. (California and North Carolina are the only two states to establish public health guidelines for hexavalent chromium in water.)

Georgia does not regulate hexavalent chromium specifically in water — only the broader category of “chromium” which includes both chromium III a naturally occurring trace metal and hexavalent chromium which can be naturally occurring or produced by industrial processes. But while relatively high levels of chromium III is considered safe in drinking water experts say hexavalent chromium can be dangerous at much lower levels. Some scientists warn that hexavalent chromium not chromium III can lead to a higher risk of cancer. Georgia’s local public health departments offer a $122 well test that can detect a limited number of toxins but not hexavalent chromium. If someone can’t afford to pay more for a private lab to test for that toxin former EPA official Betsy Southerland says they’re “totally unprotected.”

In the fall of 2016 weeks after Mark Goolsby received the test results from his well water Georgia Power purchased a string of properties along Luther Smith Road part of a quiet buying spree in which the company ultimately paid more than $15 million for nearly 1900 acres of land near five of its 12 coal-fired power plant sites according to a previous investigation by Georgia Health News and ProPublica. A year later in 2017 Andrea’s grandmother passed away after a stroke and Andrea noticed the company had erected “no trespassing” signs along Luther Smith Road and knocked down more homes. More than four decades after attorney Tommy Malone pressed Brack Goolsby to sell most of his family’s land Georgia Power returned with another offer — this time for the last of their property and the home that had belonged to the Goolsbys for more than 150 years. The company which still wielded the power of eminent domain said in a statement that its purchases of land near Plant Scherer would reduce the “short- and long-term inconvenience for our neighbors” during the process of shutting down the nearby ash pond.

On a windy day in March 2019 Andrea Goolsby then 31 pulled down a gravel driveway toward the white two-story house on Luther Smith Road. Her father and uncle were just days away from handing it over. The terms of the sale prevented them from speaking publicly about the well tests that found hexavalent chromium in their drinking water. (Citing a nondisparagement agreement Mark Goolsby declined to speak for this story. A spokesman for Georgia Power noted that confidentiality clauses are routinely inserted in its contracts but declined to comment regarding any purchases of individual properties off Luther Smith Road.)

As she walked inside memories flooded back: the taste of her grandmother’s biscuit dough the smell of fresh-tilled dirt in the garden the sound of the blues playing from her daddy’s truck. She had recently helped her father clear out the house sorting through her late grandmother’s old letters church bulletins and photographs. She’d even stripped century-old wood off the walls of a bedroom in hopes of repurposing it someday. Tears fell past her straight blonde hair as she stepped into each room one final time. She felt like her grandparents had died once again.

“I had to say goodbye to a place where my son nieces and nephews won’t be able to experience” Andrea wrote in her journal that day. “I had to say goodbye to a piece of my heart.”

Two weeks after Andrea’s final visit to her family home Mark Berry faced one of his toughest challenges as Georgia Power’s top environmental lobbyist: persuading five fiscally conservative energy regulators to allow his employer to offload more than $7 billion in coal-ash cleanup costs onto its customers.

Georgia Power along with the Public Service Commission has fought GHN and ProPublica’s attempts to obtain information about how much money the company is saving by not adopting the more protective measure of moving all of its coal ash into lined disposal sites. Last year at a town hall meeting in Monroe County PSC commissioner Tim Echols said that at Plant Scherer alone moving millions of tons of ash out of its current pond and into a disposal site with a protective liner would cost $1 billion. (Georgia Power did not dispute Echols’ estimate when asked if it’s accurate.) Industry cost estimates obtained by GHN and ProPublica indicate that Georgia Power could have originally installed a liner at Scherer back in the early 1980s for $95 million or less — $270 million in 2020 dollars far cheaper than the $1 billion it would take to fully fix the problem today.

The Georgia Public Service Commission does not allow the public to see the projected costs of shutting down ash ponds at each of Georgia Power’s plants because the company claims those figures are a “trade secret.” Georgia Public Service Commission

Getting approval for the cheaper plan from the five energy regulators on the state’s Public Service Commission would not be Georgia Power’s final hurdle. Even with the PSC’s rubber stamp state environmental officials could reject the company’s plans to keep dry ash in unlined ponds at Scherer and five other plants. That would mean that Georgia Power’s $7.3 billion price tag could skyrocket to over $10 billion potentially lowering the chances that the company would be able to get its customers to pick up the full bill. (A year after Berry took the stand Georgia Power would disclose in a filing that its ash pond cleanup cost estimates increased by 11 percent to $8.1 billion.) PSC Commissioner Tricia Pridemore said the agency recently hired a consultant to review Georgia Power’s future coal-ash expenses. The other four commissioners declined to comment.

In the spring of 2019 the EPA’s administrator former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler authorized Georgia to become one of America’s only states to take over the process of approving how utilities could clean up their ash ponds. Left to work with the state’s cash-strapped environmental agency (the EPD) Georgia Power pressured regulators to narrowly interpret the coal-ash rule in a way that would increase the chances of leaving its waste in unlined ponds according to records obtained by GHN and ProPublica. Georgia Power did not respond to questions about lobbying tactics. But in his 2019 PSC testimony Berry said Georgia Power is “actively involved in both federal and state rulemaking.” EPD spokesperson Kevin Chambers who did not make any agency officials available for an interview said in a statement that the EPD “does not provide deferential treatment” to Georgia Power.

In a closed-door meeting in early 2020 EPD Land Branch Chief Chuck Mueller met with a small group of Juliette residents including Andrea and several members of the Goolsby family. Mueller explained that if the company could show its contaminants had not migrated beyond its property lines the company would satisfy the state’s environmental requirements according to a recording of the meeting obtained by GHN and ProPublica.

One Juliette resident John Dupree asked Mueller why the EPD hadn’t independently tested nearby Juliette residents’ wells for the presence of contaminants. Dupree recently tested his drinking well finding levels of hexavalent chromium above the health standards set by California and North Carolina. He was concerned that coal ash would move off-site for years to come perpetually jeopardizing his family’s drinking water.

“What I’ve got to determine is is it coming from the ash pond or is it naturally occurring or is it from another source?” Mueller told the residents. “I don’t know.”

Berry assured residents that Georgia Power is “working hard to make things better.” But what he left unsaid was that Georgia Power’s recent purchase of over 1000 acres of land near Scherer’s coal-ash pond would extend its property lines and limit its liability. Simply reducing the number of private wells in operation near the ash pond is far cheaper than installing a liner that would prevent further spread of contaminants.

After the conversation meandered into technical jargon one of Andrea’s neighbors Karl Cass — whose son and niece had survived two different kinds of childhood cancer — directed the conversation back toward Berry.

“I appreciate your commitment based on what you’ve shared that you want to do the right thing — did I hear that correctly?” Cass asked Berry.

“Yes sir you did hear that correctly” Berry said.

“I appreciate your commitment” Cass continued. “Why the resistance on the liners?”

Berry said the company had “really studied” this site and concluded that burying the waste in an unlined pond was a viable option to comply with state regulations. The company’s groundwater modeling predicted that contaminants wouldn’t move out enough to warrant a liner. Because of that he said the residents didn’t need to worry. Georgia Power declined to comment on Berry’s remarks.

“If something is happening EPD is going to ask us to fix it and we’re going to fix it” Berry said.

In the months after Georgia Power purchased the Goolsby home more family members got sick or died. One of Andrea’s cousins Gloria Hammond believed the prostate cancer that recently had killed her husband Cason was linked to toxins in the water. Two of Andrea’s other relatives a retired grocery store owner named Tony Bowdoin and car bumper repairman named Mike Pless were diagnosed shortly thereafter with colon and throat cancer respectively. Few of the cancer-stricken family members were related by blood to the Goolsbys — some had married into the family — which to Andrea ruled out the possibility that the cancers were caused by a genetic predisposition. All three of her recently diagnosed family members lived close to Plant Scherer’s ash pond. The Altamaha Riverkeeper now overseen by a former paratrooper named Fletcher Sams had recently tested all three of their homes’ wells. Each one contained hexavalent chromium levels between 30 and 140 times higher than drinking-water guidelines in North Carolina and between 100 and 490 times higher than those in California.

In early 2020 residents’ concerns about Plant Scherer’s coal-ash pond prompted a bill from Democratic state lawmakers that would force all of Georgia’s coal ash to be moved into lined disposal sites. One night in February 2020 the same month as the closed-door meeting with Berry Andrea joined Hammond Bowdoin Pless and dozens of other Juliette residents inside a tiny Presbyterian church with stained-glass windows. They’d gathered to learn more about the ongoing groundwater test campaign conducted by the Altamaha Riverkeeper. For months Sams had steered his red pickup truck down driveways near Plant Scherer and to homes farther away from the plant collecting water samples from anyone who’d asked for their well to be tested. Now he was finally revealing the full results of what he’d found so far.

Standing before the crowd Sams explained that almost all of the more than 30 wells he’d tested so far at homes near Plant Scherer had contained worrisome contaminants often present in coal ash that could be harmful to humans if consumed at high enough levels. The wells closer to Scherer’s ash ponds — including along Luther Smith Road — generally had levels of hexavalent chromium higher than those farther away. Pointing to a projector screen near the altar Sams showed a Georgia Power filing certifying that parts of the ash pond are so deep that they’re below the water table which meant those contaminants are in constant contact with the groundwater in the aquifer. He then pulled up an aerial image of Scherer’s ash pond circled by red dots signifying locations of Georgia Power’s own groundwater monitoring wells where tests had exceeded federal protection standards for cobalt a trace metal leaking out of Scherer’s ash pond.

Sams then rattled off other coal-ash contaminants that the tests had found words most residents had only ever heard while studying the periodic table during chemistry class.

Residents had grown visibly uncomfortable by the end of Sams’ presentation. Afterward some people suggested that Georgia Power should pay for county water lines to be built to their homes so they wouldn’t have to drink from the wells anymore. Hammond one of the few Luther Smith Road homeowners who refused to sell to the company said she doubted that would happen; doing so might signify an admission of guilt.

Incredulous Andrea doubled down on the call for Georgia Power to fix the problem. She said the company was already “purchasing property and paying people hush money” so they would not discuss contamination. (Georgia Power did not respond when asked about Goolsby’s comment.)

At one point Andrea noticed a man in a suit near the front of the church. When someone shouted a question his way he walked toward the altar to grab the microphone from Sams. The man PSC Commissioner Echols explained that he and his colleagues had approved Georgia Power’s request to pass $7.3 billion in ash pond cleanup costs on to customers adding that “we authorized a lot of money — billions of dollars.”

Listening closely Andrea grew outraged as Echols — who had voted two months earlier to allow Georgia Power to start collecting money from its customers — shifted the responsibility for reining in Georgia Power to EPD inaccurately claiming that the environmental agency had the sole authority to stop the company’s unlined pond proposal. (The Sierra Club’s Georgia chapter would later sue the PSC for unlawfully granting the bill surcharge; the company is approved to recoup a first round of $525 million though it is expected to return to PSC for permission to recover the remainder of the cleanup costs in future rounds. The case could soon go before the Georgia Court of Appeals. Echols declined to answer GHN and ProPublica’s questions but said in a brief statement “I am confident we are on the right track.”)

“I wasn’t even born when the problem started but I have to pay for this mess?” Andrea later said. “It’s hypocritical. They’re the ones doing this but we have to pay for it when it would have cost a lot less to do it right the first time or fix it when they knew it was a problem.”

As COVID-19 spread across Georgia Berry’s team submitted more than 25000 pages of filings to the EPD to prove how its plan to bury 48 million tons of coal ash in ponds without a protective liner was in fact legal and safe. But in corporate filings dated as recently as 2020 Georgia Power acknowledged that Plant Scherer’s ash pond was susceptible to a catastrophic dam failure that could mirror the Kingston spill potentially sending a wave of ash toward homes injuring or killing Juliette residents and contaminating a span of at least 15 miles of the nearby Ocmulgee River. Parts of the ash pond had grown unstable enough that in 2017 one contractor nearly died after a sinkhole larger than a basketball court suddenly opened up in the pond causing part of the shoreline to collapse according to photos of the incident and eyewitness accounts. (Georgia Power did not respond when asked about the sinkhole.)

On top of that the company faced a growing number of hurdles related to coal-ash contaminants. Georgia Power had to notify a homeowner near Plant McManus in Brunswick of its discovery of levels of arsenic in groundwater that exceed federal and state safety limits. During a recent legislative hearing state Rep. Mary Frances Williams told one of Berry’s deputies that she was “concerned” to discover contaminants had migrated off-site from Plant McDonough’s ash pond over to property owned by Cobb County in suburban Atlanta. “I’m not clear how you can prevent that from happening without liners” she told the Georgia Power lobbyist.

Plant Scherer however posed the biggest challenge for Georgia Power. EPD scientists said last year that they would need more information before the agency could allow the company to move ahead with leaving dry ash in Scherer’s unlined pond. Georgia Power had disclosed to EPD the data from several dozen groundwater monitoring wells near Scherer some of which detected the presence of contaminants often found in ash ponds at levels higher than groundwater-protection standards. The data also showed that contaminants were migrating toward the properties the company had purchased on Luther Smith Road. The EPD is now seeking to determine the speed at which groundwater flowed through and under Scherer’s ash pond and to what degree the contaminants posed a threat to remaining neighbors. (Chambers the EPD spokesperson said permits to leave coal ash in unlined ponds will not be issued to Georgia Power if its plans fail to comply with the coal-ash rule.)

The company downplayed the concerns from outside experts. Back in 2019 Berry testified that “advanced engineering methods” would allow Georgia Power to clean up its ash pond at Scherer in a way that complies with environmental regulations but he has refused to disclose the methods because the company claims they are confidential. In January Georgia Power submitted filings that claimed further risk evaluations of groundwater were no longer warranted because the ash pond’s contaminants “are not expected to pose a risk to human health or the environment.”

In another recent filing Georgia Power claimed that contaminants such as hexavalent chromium at Plant Scherer come from “naturally occurring” sources instead of its operations. Researchers in North Carolina led by Vengosh of Duke University have found that high levels of hexavalent chromium found in drinking wells in the central part of that state are in fact naturally occurring. (A similar study has not been conducted to determine the source of the hexavalent chromium in Juliette’s drinking water wells.) On the other hand Vengosh also has conducted research showing that ash from Wyoming-sourced Powder River Basin coal — the coal that Georgia Power uses at Plant Scherer — contains high levels of hexavalent chromium. Last year Vengosh wrote in an email to Monroe County officials that “even if the hexavalent chromium found in drinking water wells is not derived from coal ash contamination” other coal ash metals could pose a “constant risk” to homeowners’ drinking water.

Residents’ fear of that constant risk has revived a legal battle against Georgia Power. Brian Adams the Macon attorney behind the lawsuit that fizzled in 2014 found a powerful new partner in Atlanta attorney Stacey Evans. A state lawmaker who once ran for governor Evans was looking for her next big case after winning a $495 million whistleblower settlement against DaVita an international dialysis chain. Last July Evans and Adams filed a new lawsuit on behalf of 45 residents who alleged that Plant Scherer is “poisoning” their community’s water. Their claims extend beyond those of the previous case: The lawsuit alleges that Georgia Power not only constructed and operated Plant Scherer in a way that led to contaminated drinking water but also that the company built a network of monitoring wells at an elevation so high that their groundwater testing “evades representative results.” Georgia Power has denied those allegations in court filings.

One of the plaintiffs Andrea’s cousin Tony Bowdoin said last summer that he’s seeking damages to offset the six-figure costs of treatment for Stage IV colon cancer. Another plaintiff Karl Cass whose son is a survivor of childhood cancer hopes a jury trial might deliver clarity in a saga that so far has offered no clear answers.

“I don’t want to see my kids have to fight this fight against Georgia Power” Cass said. “And I hope their children won’t have to live in fear about what’s happening to their health.”

Asked what would make things right Andrea explained that the answer is both simple and complicated. Driving around Juliette in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election Andrea saw one type of yard sign more than any others. It wasn’t in support of President Donald Trump as one would have expected in deep-red Monroe County where 70 percent of voters cast ballots for him last year. It was one with a clear call to action: Georgia Power: Clean up your trASH.

At a hearing expected to be held in late 2021 Andrea intends to urge the EPD to reject Georgia Power’s plans to bury coal-ash waste in unlined ponds. If she and other Georgians get their way state officials would force the company to submit a new plan to either retrofit the ponds with a liner or move the ash to a lined disposal site and begin the yearslong process of reducing the immediate threat to the groundwater.

Andrea said Georgia Power should also cover the costs of Monroe County’s $16 million project to extend water lines to the homes of about 850 Juliette residents who currently rely on drinking wells. (Those residents still would need to pay — as much as thousands of dollars — to have the line connected to their homes; Andrea says Georgia Power should pay for that too.) Georgia Power has instead mailed residents packets touting the company’s environmental track record and accusing the Altamaha Riverkeeper of making “false claims” about contamination. To find the truth Andrea said there should finally be a cancer-cluster study to figure out whether coal-ash contaminants are linked to more than 40 cancer cases compiled by her and others in the community.

The more complicated solution as Andrea explained is compensating Juliette residents for “what they lost.” She’s thinking of her cousin Hammond who rejected recent offers by the company to buy her land on Luther Smith Road in part because her well may hold answers to the question of why her husband died. Then there’s Mike Pless another of her relatives who after surgery and two rounds of radiation therapy has reckoned with his uncertain future and what that might mean for his family. “No easy choices no guarantees” he wrote on Facebook. “Welcome to the crucible.”

In late February Andrea was once again reminded of all she has lost. A mile north of Luther Smith Road she walked up a gravel path in a black funeral dress past her grandparents’ tombstones to find a sunflower-topped wooden casket holding her cousin Tony Bowdoin who had just died from colon cancer at age 58. In front of more than 100 mourners Reverend Mark Goolsby Andrea’s father gave a moving eulogy honoring his nephew as an avid hunter and hardworking storekeeper a serial gift-giver and a morbid joke-teller. Andrea thought of all the death since her grandfather Brack had passed nearly two decades earlier. How much more would her family lose? she wondered. What would Georgia Power’s ultimate cost be?

“They took things families can’t get back” Andrea said. “There’s no amount of money that can ever give those things back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbG9jYWwxMi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kZW1vbGl0aW9uLW9uLWZvcm1lci1taWxsZW5uaXVtLWhvdGVsLXRvLWNhdXNlLXJvYWQtY2xvc3VyZXPSAV9odHRwczovL2xvY2FsMTIuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2RlbW9saXRpb24tb24tZm9ybWVyLW1pbGxlbm5pdW0taG90ZWwtdG8tY2F1c2Utcm9hZC1jbG9zdXJlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demolition on former Millennium Hotel to cause road closures,"CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Prepare for more closures Downtown.

CARMEL Ind. — On Sunday tree service companies were hard at work cleaning up dozens of downed trees throughout the Northwood Hills neighborhood on Carmel’s east side.

“It’s pretty bad. It doesn’t rival Pendleton but it’s a pretty good storm” said Eric Rector who owns Earthworks Outdoor.

The area is full of mature trees. Many of them were uprooted by the high winds Saturday night.

Several homes were also damaged. Hamilton County’s Emergency Management officials were out surveying the damage.

“I probably saw a good 10 or 15 houses with trees on the roof. We were able to get one off earlier. I am sure we will do more tomorrow” Rector said.

Saturday night’s storm also resulted in one fatality.

According to Carmel Police 40-year-old Elias Smith from New York was killed after a tree fell on him. Witnesses say he was trying to escape the storm when he was struck.

Neighbors say the storm came through quickly.

“We heard debris come through our second-story window and it woke both of us up” Tom Wittmen said. “It was surreal. The sound was like a helicopter landing in our backyard for maybe 15 seconds and then nothing.”

Three trees came down around Wittmen’s house.

“Literally within 10 seconds three trees blew over and we were so fortunate compared to a lot of the other homes” he said. “Whatever took these trees down snapped them in a circular motion and one was a walnut so that had to be a lot of force.”

Neighbors say they didn’t receive an alert or hear sirens.

“There was no warning. We both had our cell phones with us and usually we would get an alert but nothing at all. It happened so fast” Wittmen said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9oaXN0b3JpYy1idXJudC1taWxsLWJyaWRnZS1sb3N0LXRvLWZsb29kLXJvYWQtY2xvc2VkLWluZGVmaW5pdGVseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic Burnt Mill Bridge lost to flood; road closed indefinitely,"What’s pictured in this photo isn’t as significant as what isn’t pictured after flood waters swept away the eastern half of the historic Burnt Mill Bridge over Clear Fork River near Robbins | Photo: Nancy Chambers

ROBBINS — For more than 100 years the historic Burnt Mill Bridge over the Clear Fork River withstood floods and the tests of time — including the historic flood of 1929 and other major floods including one in 1973.

That changed Sunday morning when half of the 110-year-old bridge was swept away by flood waters after numerous thunderstorms combined to dump as much as eight inches of rain over the region.

Adding insult to injury Honey Creek Road remained closed indefinitely on Sunday evening as the new Burnt Mill Bridge awaited a visit from state bridge inspectors to determine the extent of damage done when the steel and wood from the old bridge was sent smashing into it by the rushing flood waters.

Kelvin King Scott County’s road superintendent told the Independent Herald Sunday evening that after a preliminary inspection he would need to call in engineers from the TN Dept. of Transportation to more thoroughly inspect the damage.

In the meantime the road — which was closed by the National Park Service at about lunch time on Sunday — remains closed.

“They’re usually pretty quick about responding” King said of TDOT’s bridge inspectors. “The main thing is they’ll have to wait for the water to go back down before they can check it out.”

This was likely the final photo taken of the historic Burnt Mill Bridge before the eastern half of the bridge was swept away by flood waters Sunday morning. It is a still frame from a video taken by Marcus Posey when he visited the bridge at 11:30 p.m. Saturday evening. The bridge was illuminated in the frame by a lightning strike from one of the thunderstorms that would drive the river to near its all-time highest streamflow overnight.

Built in 1911 Burnt Mill Bridge was used for more than 90 years as a single-lane steel-structure bridge with wood plank flooring before the state deemed it unsafe for vehicular traffic in the early 2000s. Potter Southeast completed construction on a modern concrete bridge just downstream in 2006 and earthen berms were placed on either side of the old bridge to prevent vehicles from crossing it.

The bridge was built using a Pratt through-truss span on the east side and a half-hip Pratt pony truss on the west side connected by a concrete abutment in the middle of the river. The section of the bridge that washed away was the Pratt through-truss span on the east side.

Pratt truss bridges became commonplace in the United States in the late 19th century. They were designed by the American engineer Thomas Willis Pratt and his father Caleb Pratt and were preferred for their ability to span long distances with simple steel construction. The Pratts revolutionized bridge building when they figured out a design using triangular trusses that allowed the diagonal pieces to feel tension and the vertical pieces to feel suspension. The use of Pratt trusses became less common after World War II.

After the old bridge was condemned for vehicular use by the state in 2003 Scott County reached a deal with the National Park Service allowing the old bridge to remain for pedestrian use given its historic value and significant interest from the public in saving it.

However the bridge slowly became an eyesore and its rotting timbers caused it to become a danger for pedestrians. In 2019 Scott County teamed up with the Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area to re-plank the bridge making it suitable for pedestrian traffic once more.

The bridge renewal project followed years of contemplation about the bridge’s future. Scott County even reached out to a non-profit organization that repurposes old bridges for its rails-to-trails program but the outfit determined it would be too costly to remove and reuse the bridge because the only way to get the steel beams out of the river gorge intact would be to use helicopters.

In 2017 Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area administrators expressed concern that a flood might cause the old bridge — the concrete base of which was determined to be crumbling — to be swept away. If that happened they warned significant damage might be caused to the newer bridge downstream.

The streamflow on Clear Fork at the USGS water gauge just downstream from the bridge peaked at 36000 cubic feet per second at 1:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon. The norm for this time of year is less than 1000 cfs.

The river crested at 20.61 feet at 11 a.m. It is the second-highest crest on record at Burnt Mill trailing only the March 23 1929 flood when the river crested at 22.1 feet. In 1973 the river crested at 18.92 feet. Other Top 5 crests include 18.5 feet on Feb. 3 1939 and 17.96 feet on Dec. 30 1969."

Karl Walsh 45 of Eaton Green Road punched and then struck a convenience store member of staff over the head with the bottle last June causing severe injuries to the victim.

After his arrest police investigators also linked him to another theft at a building materials store in the same month through CCTV footage.

He was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) and two counts of theft and was imprisoned for nine years yesterday (March 26) at Luton Crown Court.

The latest crime statistics for your area:

At around 9.30am on June 21 Walsh entered a convenience store in Kimpton Road and asked for a bottle of vodka which he grabbed and attempted to run away without paying.

He then assaulted a member of staff who stopped him at the store door but another staff member and a passer-by managed to detain him until police arrived.

Detective Constable Michael Wallis from the Crime Investigation Team said: “Walsh is a violent and unpredictable individual who was willing to severely injure an innocent person to avoid paying for a bottle of vodka.

“He acted with no consideration for anyone’s wellbeing but his own and lashed out aggressively when confronted for his criminal actions.

“We are satisfied with the lengthy sentence which reflects the severity of his actions. He belongs in prison where he will now spend a long time reflecting on his behaviour.

“I would also like to recognise the bravery of the members of the public and store staff who confronted and detained him. Their public-spirited actions led to his arrest and allowed us to bring this individual to justice.”

Walsh entered a building materials store in Gypsy Lane Luton on an electric scooter at 10.10am on June 4.

He attempted to leave through a fire exit wit a rucksack loaded with gardening materials and a strimmer which he laid across the scooter handlebars.

His exit triggering an alarm and a member of the public managed to stop him but Walsh swung the scooter and hit him on the chin before running off. A staff member retrieved the stolen items.",,,

To this day I still think a panoramic digital camera could be a game-changing device. With that said many of you have probably heard of the Hasselblad XPan. It’s a panoramic 35mm film camera that’s a thing of beauty. However the lesser-known variant is the Fujifilm TX-1. If you weren’t aware the XPan and the TX-1 are very similar cameras. The whole thing was a joint project done between the two manufacturers. Hasselblad has been known to do this for years. They’ve done it with Motorolla DJI Sony etc. But in this one case they created something truly unique. In fact the Hasselblad XPan is an incredibly lusted for camera. But the Fujifilm TX-1 isn’t spoken of nearly enough. But we found a truly gorgeous one.

True Love: The Fujifilm TX-1

In an eBay listing for a stunning Fujifilm TX-1 in Champagne with a matching 45mm f4 lens we’re taken aback. First there’s the price of $6834.30. That’s quite steep. But if you couple that with a really unique film emulsion that can’t be duplicated digitally it starts to make more sense. The camera has some signs of use. But it can’t truly be all that much. The shutter has apparently only been fired 122 times. That’s insane!

About This Camera

You’d think that this is only a few rolls of 35mm film. And if it shot 36 images per roll you’d be right. But these panoramic cameras like the Fujifilm TX-1 really eat film if they’re used in the panoramic function. Of course the Fujifilm TX-1 can also shoot as a film camera normally would.

So what else makes this camera so special? The Fujifilm TX-1 can be broke down in the following way:

Rangefinder camera

Back LCD screen to display critical information

Working light meter

Meter is auto set with DX Coded film. This can surely annoy someone.

1/125th flash sync

8 second to 1/1000th shutter speed.

Aperture priority and manual mode

Focal plane shutter

Photographer Jonas Rask basically wrote a love letter to the camera. In his post he states:

“So far this entire tsunami of words have acted like a long intro to what I’m about to write next. The entire raison d’être for the TX-1. The wide panoramic 65:24 aspect ratio. You might think that shooting these wide frames is easy because it will automatically seem very cinematic to the viewer and hence tell a story per association. But if that’s your line of thought then you couldn’t be more wrong! – Shooting the 65:24 format is some of the most challenging stuff I’ve thrown myself at photographically.”

Jonas did it right too! He shot with CineStill. CineStill is one of the few films that I’d probably consider shooting with today. Loads of film simulations can be emulated digitally. And let’s be honest if all you care about is image quality then all you need are the presets. To that end you need to shoot with a film that can give you a unique look. CineStill can do that. So too can film from the Brooklyn Instant Film Initiative. They work with a pre-exposed film that works almost like a double exposure. SilberSalz35 is another who does what CineStill does but without removing the Remjet layer. So you’re basically just shooting on cinema film.

A magnificent athlete at the peak of their powers can be several metres ahead of the rest … yet fail at the final hurdle and finish last. The delayed Tokyo Olympics will hopefully take place later this year and I’ll be following the exploits of the great Spanish 110-meter hurdler Orlando Ortega with both excitement and trepidation. I’ll know that however much hard work and sacrifice he has put in over years any one of those devious ten hurdles might take him out and keep him off the podium.

Ensuring patient access to medicines often feels like the 110m hurdles. While their final stretch is a lot longer than the roughly 13 seconds Ortega has at his disposal patients in Europe also face 10 major hurdles before they can get access to new medicines and treatments.

The first hurdle is the actual science involved in developing the medicine. Only 1 in 10000 of molecules initially tested in a lab eventually become a medicine. That’s just 0.01% that actually make it past the starting blocks!

But we are just getting started. The second hurdle is central marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in which safety and efficacy are assessed. That can take as long as 210-days the EMA authorisation deadline plus the 67 days it takes the European Commission on average to formally grant marketing authorisation.

Next up we get to the HTA (Health Technology Assessment) hurdles where new medicines and other health technologies are evaluated based on their added value compared to existing ones. Hurdle number three—EU HTA—is still under construction and we had hoped it would lower the next hurdle: national HTAs. But it looks like EU HTA may become simply an additional hurdle that adds complexity and duplication.

At hurdle number four the track then widens out into a wider race as most countries have their own HTAs which vary greatly in complexity.

The fifth hurdle involves national pricing and reimbursement. In theory this should take a maximum of 180 days but the Transparency Directive rule is seldom enforced by the European Commission and we see huge discrepancies between countries: for example on average from 53 days in Germany to 684 in Portugal and 749 days in Poland. 1

Some countries like Italy and Spain then have a sixth hurdle as there is a delay between the moment pricing and reimbursement are agreed upon and the moment these are formalised through publication in an official gazette.

Other countries then add a seventh hurdle. In Romania for instance medicines will only be approved if they are on the market in 12 other EU countries and even then reimbursement must be set at the lowest of those prices. This so-called External Reference Pricing helps explain the 775-day median delay in Romania for patients to access new medicines.

The race is not over yet! In a number of countries including again Italy and Spain once national authorities agree on pricing and reimbursement the process passes on to relevant regional authorities. The amount of time this hurdle takes varies enormously depending on the region in question.

National level and regional level pricing and reimbursement decisions are NOT the end of the journey. Next we have health system readiness which assesses whether adequate budgets and the necessary registry diagnostic or other supporting healthcare infrastructure are in place.

Last but not least the final hurdle is patient population. This is usually deemed to be quite broad at the stage of EMA marketing authorisation but by the time the previous hurdles have been confronted actual availability of a medicine or treatment may be very limited indeed: only on a 'named patient' basis or unavailable in a number of localities.

These hurdles frustrate everyone but most of all the patients who could benefit from earlier access to healthcare innovations. But fixing access is of course immensely challenging. There are so many deeply ingrained duplicative processes in place which need to be streamlined. Where does one start? For one by evaluating how we can learn from the speed observed in our collective reaction to the pandemic to make it stick even in normal days (e.g. Commission approval in 24 hours vs. 67 days parallel HTA assessments). And second by working together more effectively across markets and across stakeholder groups. The right of all Europeans to timely access to affordable preventive and curative care of good quality is one of the key principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. We need practical solutions fast to ensure we respect it.

Predictions are made skeptics respond and the vision reboots. The future offers few guarantees. But it also tends to develop over time rather than spring up shockingly new overnight.

In brief After making gradual inroads in drug and materials discovery in recent years artificial intelligence is suddenly appearing in a new light. Autonomous labs that link AI-based data analysis to robotic synthesis and validation are being demonstrated in both academia and industry. These labs prefigure a new work environment in which machines perform many of the traditional functions of researchers. Proponents argue that this self-driven R&D environment will enhance the efforts of multidisciplinary scientists who will maintain ultimate control. Chemical and drug firms are taking a serious look at what may be the lab of the future.

The lab of the future Platonic ideal that it remains has always had a foot in the door. But some say it crossed the threshold to reality entirely last year.

High-tech labs unveiled by academic researchers a computing giant and a major drug company all blend artificial intelligence computing and robotics in ways that may herald a new world of research. They suggest a kind of Renaissance lab for multidisciplinary scientists steeped in chemistry biology and data science.

Alán Aspuru-Guzik a professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto and colleagues reported in Science Advances the discovery of thin-film materials in a “self-driving laboratory” in which AI controls automated synthesis and validation in a cycle of machine-learning data analysis. Andrew I. Cooper director of the Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool and colleagues published results from an AI-directed robotics lab that optimized a photocatalytic process for generating hydrogen from water after running about 700 experiments in 8 days (Nature 2020 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2442-2).

Meanwhile IBM launched a self-driving—or autonomous—lab combining AI with robotics at its research facility in Zurich. And Eli Lilly and Company rang in 2020 with the debut of a self-driving lab at its biotechnology center in San Diego.

“My lab has already been able to close the loop” Aspuru-Guzik says describing a circuit of continuous learning in which AI algorithms guide data analysis and automation toward the identification synthesis and validation of novel molecules. The autonomous lab accesses produces and reprocesses data as it goes along.

You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time.



Alán Aspuru-Guzik professor of chemistry and computer science University of Toronto

These labs aren’t perfect yet and much work and convincing are needed before research managers in the drug and chemical industries embrace them. Observations vary on where the bottlenecks lie in the clocklike loops—some point to the data; others to the robots. But the innovators are unanimous regarding the importance of the third element in the loop: the human researcher.

“This idea of the clockwork laboratory is in the long term not the strongest approach” Cooper says of the notion of a self-sufficient research machine. “The strongest approach is to have the clockwork laboratory with a very permeable interface so that the human knowledge can be captured as well.”

The academics

AI most likely debuted in science fiction with Samuel Butler’s 1872 novel Erehwon or Over the Range. It made news in the real world a quarter century ago when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer took down Garry Kasparov the world chess champion. Kasparov came to terms with his defeat much as the research community has learned to stop worrying and love a machine that accelerates discovery.

“You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time” Aspuru-Guzik says. He points to rapid design techniques in industries such as automotive that rely on advanced materials and the urgency to confront climate change with new materials for storing sun and wind energy. “We have to enter the era of rapid prototyping in materials.”

Researchers say the challenge in accelerating discovery comes down to improving their data sets. That’s a primary function of machine learning in an autonomous lab as it cycles and directs data from synthesis and validation melding them with data from available published literature.

Assembling and fine-tuning a system in Toronto to demonstrate the power of closed-loop autonomous discovery took about a year and a half Aspuru-Guzik says. Once operational the machine was able to produce about 40 molecules in a production run he says “which is more than the number of published molecules in the field I am working on organic semiconductors for laser devices.”

But while the system is intended to support an around-the-clock process it is still operating in discrete runs each averaging a day and a half. “The biggest holdup is not AI” Aspuru-Guzik says. “Data bottlenecks? Zero. The area that is the challenge for getting the self-driving lab to work is the synthesis machinery. The robotics are a little finicky a little hard to control.”

Those robots are the source of the synthesis and validation data necessary for machine-learning algorithms to drive toward discovery. “The point is to generate data on the fly” he says. “That is what you’re getting a robot for.”

The University of Liverpool applied a twist to robotics in its autonomous lab. “It’s ironic that Alán calls his a self-driven laboratory” Cooper quips. “Our robots actually drive.” Indeed robotic agents scoot around a traditional-looking research space in a video released by Cooper’s group. “We decided to automate the chemist not the instrument” he says.

Cooper’s catalyst experiment operated nonstop for 8 days completing about 6500 manipulations in a complex workflow involving solid and liquid handling some under a nitrogen-sealed inert atmosphere and multiple measurements. The mobile robots scooted a total of 2.2 km in a room measuring 5 by 10 m. Cooper says the system can theoretically operate for much longer. “We used 8 different experimental stations” he says. “It could have been 18 or 80.”

As for bottlenecks Cooper also points to robot mechanics. “AI is most powerful when there are multiple choices a wide variety of measurements” he says. But the more involved the experiment the more complex the machinery “and every bit needs to be really reliable. Once you string 10 operations together even a failure point of 0.1% becomes quite significant.”

Regina Barzilay a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colead of the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium notes that AI can run into problems as it operates in new areas of chemical space. But the technology works to solve the problems partly through interaction with a researcher.

“You need to have a mechanism whereby the machine can tell you it needs to look in a particular part of chemical space where it needs to have more training” Barzilay says. “An essential component is to know when the machine is actually not confident in its own prediction which means it needs more help.”

Connor W. Coley assistant professor of chemical engineering at MIT and part of the consortium says advances made in pursuit of the autonomous laboratory reveal the critical importance of the human element. Even if the lab is a closed loop it intersects with an adjacent loop defined by researcher interaction with the machine starting from the word “Go.”

“Humans are always going to set the design objective and specify something that an algorithm can reduce to a numerical optimization” Coley says. “Humans will always be setting the big-picture goal” through rounds of interrogation.

“The big questions include which experiments are accessible to the platform compared to which are needed to prove or disprove the kinds of hypotheses we’re after” he continues. “Another big question is which are the workflows that we can physically automate as steps in the process.”

And there are considerations beyond academic labs like Coley’s. “The interesting question is whether industry is actually going to bite on this or whether it’s some academic bullshit” Cooper says. His laboratory is exploring this question directly: Mobotics a company spun off from Cooper’s lab is pursuing business with materials companies.

Similarly Aspuru-Guzik colaunched Kebotix an AI services firm working with robotics in 2017 when he was at Harvard University. He is also coordinating the launch of a consortium called Acceleration Consortium focused on autonomous technology in materials discovery. Members include industrial and academic researchers.

The start-ups

IBM followed up its chess win with a second popular showcase for AI by introducing Watson a question-answering computer as a contestant on the quiz show Jeopardy! In 2011 Watson defeated champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings winning $1 million.

IBM went on to launch Watson as a commercial product; its first application was in decision management for lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The firm also customized Watson for industrial research markets including chemicals in which companies including the big German firm Evonik Industries have deployed it.

In 2019 IBM announced that it would shift development in its Watson Health division from drug discovery in which the tool struggled to gain traction to clinical development. And the company is working on a new AI architecture to support autonomous chemical discovery in both materials and drug applications.

IBM’s RoboRXN for Chemistry combines AI algorithms commercially available robotics and cloud computing. The firm debuted RoboRXN in a fully autonomous lab last year at its Zurich research laboratory with experiments involving photoacid generator molecules carbon-capture materials and pharmaceutical compounds.

IBM began working on the system in 2017 with a project to apply natural language programming to predictive chemical synthesis problems. Philippe Schwaller a PhD student at IBM who studied reaction prediction at the Zurich lab says the AI component of RoboRXN digitizes chemistry through language to promote machine learning.

“Our models are trained on molecular representations where atoms are like characters molecules are like words and chemical reactions are like sentences” Schwaller says. Thus programmed the model can learn in a fashion that mimics human learning.

The model is also generating data says Teodoro Laino a research scientist and leader of the RoboRXN project. “AI is generating instructions” he says. “The net effect of AI is to add software that is writing software for the robot.”

IBM is working with industrial and institutional partners to implement the technology in research Laino says. For example XChem an experimental facility at Diamond Light Source the UK’s national synchrotron facility is testing whether RoboRXN can discover compounds from data the group generates on how small molecules bind to proteins.

IBM has competition in offering AI research services: start-ups like Insilico Medicine Exscientia and Citrine Informatics are landing contracts with big chemical and pharmaceutical firms. Some of them are also teaming up with lab robotics providers.

Insilico for example announced a partnership last July with Arctoris a supplier of automated drug discovery technology. Insilico CEO Alex Zhavoronkov says the company is looking for an optimum fit between AI and robotics in a closed-loop laboratory. “We are trying to get high-quality data from a controlled robotics environment” he says.

For Zhavoronkov as for Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto robots are the crux. “Synthesis is the main bottleneck. Currently we outsource synthesis” to a contract research organization (CRO) he says. Insilico used AI to discover an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis drug candidate earlier this year then signed on the CRO WuXi AppTec to synthesize it for testing.

‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists. Paul Collier research fellow Johnson Matthey

Exscientia launched in 2012 with a vision of automated drug design CEO Andrew Hopkins says. The firm is continually searching for elements of the process in which AI can increase productivity he says.

“Drug discovery is both a big data and a small data problem” Hopkins says. Databases patents and pertinent literature create a huge amount of data from which to build models he says. “But whenever we look at first-in-class drug targets chances are we know very little about them.” AI allows researchers to design algorithms that explore chemical space beyond the parameters of the original experimental model. “We think of drug discovery as a learning problem not a screening problem” he says.

The company which counts GlaxoSmithKline as a client is preparing to bring robots into the fold. “We are building labs in this space and hiring a director of automation” Hopkins says.

Citrine targets the materials industry and boasts the chemical giant BASF as a client. The company is keeping its focus on AI joining where needed with partners for robotics and other components of a closed-loop discovery system. CEO Greg Mulholland describes the role of AI in an autonomous lab as a central guidance system working hand in hand with the researcher. Other elements of the loop will vary from company to company as will the closedness of the loop Mulholland says.

The real-world users

“Artificial intelligence is very much on our agenda” says Henrik Hahn Evonik’s chief digital officer. The German chemical company has been working for several years to understand the implications of AI in materials discovery as part of a digitization program that has introduced AI at various stages of research. The firm is moving toward closed-loop AI and robotics but Hahn questions whether such an environment will ever fully evolve.

“The autonomous laboratory in materials discovery appears to be some kind of holy grail as computer programs and algorithms surpass the creativity of our materials science experts” he says. “But this is really rather a vision and a vision means it will never come true.”

Evonik is using IBM’s Watson AI technology in its labs and programing its own algorithms Hahn says. And it is beginning to explore automation looking for example into IBM’s RoboRXN technology.

Hahn emphasizes that the autonomous lab poses a steep management challenge. “Wherever we can automate we will try to do so” he says though costs can be an issue. And the people who work in the lab now are no small consideration. Lab automation “is clearly disrupting classic lab work” Hahn says. “This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings.”

Dow is similarly pacing itself toward achieving autonomy in the lab. “My vision of the lab of the future has been practiced at Dow for a while” says A. N. Sreeram the firm’s chief technology officer. He notes that Dow built and programmed its own supercomputers since late in the first decade of this century and is among the industry pioneers in automated research.

These days Sreeram adds the firm is working with robotics big data high-performance computing and now AI and machine learning. And the company has been accessing technology through partnerships. They include a 2017 pact with 1QBit to develop quantum computing applications and a deal announced last year with Microsoft to develop AI for polyurethane research.

The British chemical maker Johnson Matthey is working with Mobotics the company launched by Cooper at the University of Liverpool on robotics for data-driven discovery. The firm says the work builds on a tradition of enabling scientists in materials discovery through technology that supports synthesis characterization and measurement.

“The self-driving or self-guided laboratory is another practical capability which our scientists will use to speed up the innovation process” Paul Collier a research fellow at the company says in an email. “ ‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists.” AI-directed automation provides a tool “that complements human scientists rather than replacing them” he says.

Another chemical maker DSM recently announced a partnership with Delft University of Technology aimed at linking AI with automation. Marcus Remmers DSM’s chief technology officer says the project aims to supercharge aspects of industrial biotech research—automation modeling data management and AI—that are already in place.

This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings. Henrik Hahn chief digital officer Evonik Industries

A major focus will be on the researcher Remmers says. “In the early stages of our digital transformation in R&D we were focused on pilots and tools trying to work things out in small environments” he says. “As we mature we realize the tools are not the limiting factor any more. More so it is the mindset of the people. The scientist will have to reinvent what they are and how they see themselves and the value that they bring to this new world. If you see yourself as just somebody setting up a machine you may well end up missing the big picture.”

In drug discovery AI has gained traction managing data complexity. “Huge progress has been made over the last few years in comprehensively cleaning unlocking and harnessing the diverse and large volumes of discovery data accumulated over decades of research” Hugo Ceulemans scientific director of discovery data sciences at Janssen Research & Development says in an email.

Drug companies are investing in data generation and acquisition for traditional data types such as assays and chemical reactions as well as for new types such as high-content microscopy images. As a result Ceulemans says pharmaceutical research is building up an AI and automation infrastructure.

“The large data volumes flowing from automated pipelines boost AI impact on the portfolio” he says. AI-created insights are also beginning to direct the data that scientists collect he adds.

Biotech companies have the luxury of implementing AI from the ground up. Moderna’s success in arriving at a vaccine with 95% efficacy against COVID-19 in less than a year is partly attributed to AI algorithms according to an article in Digital Initiative published by Harvard Business School.

For established drug companies the adoption of AI can be a more protracted journey. Some major companies however are making a determined effort to close the research technology loop.

Eli Lilly and Company opened a robotics center in San Diego early last year in partnership with Strateos a developer of research-scheduling software. The Lilly Life Sciences Studio is a 1100 m2 facility that includes an autonomous lab with over 100 instruments and storage of over 5 million compounds. It is the culmination of a 6-year project says James P. Beck the head of medicinal chemistry at the center.

Like most drug companies Lilly has been doing automated biology for decades and automated chemistry for more than 10 years Beck says. The Life Sciences Studio puts the company’s expertise in chemistry in vitro biology sample management and analytical data acquisition in a closed loop. AI controls robots that Lilly researchers can access via the cloud he says.

The lab which is operated by Strateos is also accessible to outside researchers who can bring their own data compounds and experiments to the system.

Christos A. Nicolaou head of chemical informatics at Lilly says AI algorithms have evolved to the level where they can orchestrate automated operations in a lab. “AI is mature enough nowadays and we have enough good data to come down to earth and design with action in mind” he says. Lilly worked with software developers Nicolaou says but designed the AI architecture in-house.

“The lab of the future is here today” Beck says. But closing the loop requires heavy lifting. “It is a multifactorial challenge involving science hardware software and engineering” he says. “It is far more than a science story.”

In fact proponents of the autonomous lab suggest it is a human evolution story—one in which a technological environment rises around the enlightened scientist posing little threat to the human. “Imagination and creativity will remain human for the foreseeable future” the University of Liverpool’s Cooper says.

Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto takes that idea one step further quoting Jorge Luis Borges’s poem “Chess”:

God moves the player as he the pieces

But what god behind God plots the advent

In recent years he has turned to philanthropy becoming the largest single donor to City of Hope’s research programs in its 100-plus year history.



But few people had heard of Arthur Riggs until he came forward last month with a $100 million gift to Duarte-based City of Hope .



“City of Hope convinced me that if my donations were made public I could encourage others to follow suit” Riggs told the Business Journal in a rare interview.



That gift followed roughly $210 million worth of previous donations by the modest Riggs to City of Hope which last month renamed its Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute in his honor.



Riggs 81 has spent almost his entire career at City of Hope joining in 1969 and retiring only in October as director of the institute.



Besides the landmark research that led to commercialization of the first artificial insulin Riggs also developed tools to produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies in host cells. If that sounds familiar that’s because monoclonal antibodies are now being used to treat Covid-19 patients.



In addition Riggs’ collaboration with a scientist at a then-fledgling South San Francisco company called Genentech Inc. helped catapult that company to the forefront of the West Coast biotech industry in the 1980s.



“He was right there at one of the starting points of the modern biotech industry — his team at the City of Hope was the first to make a gene that worked to treat a disease” said Peter Dervan Bren professor of chemistry at Caltech who recently wrote a forward to a book compiling Riggs’ research notes. “Yet even though his work has improved the lives of millions of diabetics worldwide he is relatively undiscovered and certainly underappreciated.”



Early work



Riggs grew up in post-war San Bernardino attended San Bernardino High School and then UC Riverside.



“I found I had a real talent for chemistry. I loved performing chemistry experiments and I was good at it” Riggs said. “I decided to combine my talent in chemistry and use that to improve treatments for disease.”



His graduate work at Caltech and post-doctoral work at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla focused on the mechanisms that turn genes on and off.



When he then joined City of Hope at age 29 research in this field had reached a critical early phase. The structure of DNA had been laid out just 20 years earlier by several researchers — including famed scientists James Watson and Francis Crick.

Throughout the 1960s techniques were developed to analyze and snip DNA segments. In the early 1970s Riggs and his research team at City of Hope started working on the next step: using DNA fragments to make genes that could then be applied as therapies to treat diseases.



“We were trying to develop technology to chemically synthesize genes” Riggs said.

To help in that effort Riggs recruited Keiichi Itakura who as a researcher in Canada had developed a technique to make DNA using chemical synthesis.



At City of Hope the pair worked with about 10 other researchers to develop a small synthetic gene with 14 amino acid components known as somatostatin. But according to Itakura a problem cropped up.



“The artificial somatostatin was proving not to be very stable when injected inside a bacterium” Itakura said. “Dr. Riggs had the idea of combining the small somatostatin gene with a larger protein to give it more stability. That was a critical development. Without it the artificial gene would not have been of much use.”



Artificial insulin



With that problem solved the researchers moved on to their real goal: making a bacterial gene that commanded bacteria to create human insulin.



“We chose insulin because it looked doable and there was a need” Riggs said. “At the time diabetics were being treated with cow insulin because there was no source of human insulin. And cow insulin resulted in a high rate of allergic reactions.”



Around this time the team added another key researcher Herb Boyer who was working for Genentech.



In 1979 the team applied for a patent for its synthetic gene used to make human insulin. Meanwhile Genentech was using its private lab to begin scaling up the process to make enough insulin to be commercially viable.



Five years later the Food and Drug Administration approved the synthetic insulin which Genentech began marketing as Humulin. It was the first instance of a synthetic gene being used to create a drug that could treat a disease.



After Genentech inked a deal with Indianapolis-based pharma giant Eli Lilly and Co. the synthetic insulin drug Riggs helped develop put Genentech on the map.

“Genentech was the first rock star of the biotech industry on the West Coast” Caltech’s Dervan said.



By 1986 Riggs had started receiving royalties from the sale of Humulin. As of 2019 according to Eli Lilly’s annual report sales of Humulin were $1.3 billion; global sales of the drug have topped $1 billion a year for at least the last decade.





Antibody research



Riggs could have left City of Hope for more lucrative and high-profile positions at Genentech now part of Basel Switzerland-based pharma giant Hoffmann-La Roche or another pharmaceutical company. Instead he chose to remain as a researcher at City of Hope.



“It turned out to be a very good place to do research” he said. “I was mostly focused on basic research trying to understand how things work. And City of Hope is also a hospital so I could see both the need and that practical applications of the research in curing or treating very serious diseases.”



Riggs next turned his attention to improving antibodies which are at the center of the body’s immune response to diseases. His team’s work in synthesizing antibodies by converting mouse antibodies into human antibodies led to more patents and ultimately to treatments for cancer and various autoimmune diseases.



Riggs said several companies including Genentech negotiated licensing deals with City of Hope for this new technology. Genetech in turn licensed the technology out to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies.



According to Dervan the monoclonal antibody technology developed by Riggs and his research team has formed the basis for at least 70 drugs to treat a diverse range of diseases from the popular breast cancer treatment Herceptin to rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.



After that work Riggs was chosen to lead City of Hope’s Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute. He has spent much of the last 20 years in an administrative role developing City of Hope’s diabetes research program.

And yet it took nearly halfway through the show to get it.

After opening the show by hosting an MTV Spring Break game show called “Snatched Vaxed or Waxed” and breaking out her classic Beyoncé impression on a parody of Hot Ones Rudolph finally delivered a special Passover unity message as the vice president—joined by the one and only Martin Short as her husband “Semitic smoke show” Doug Emhoff.

“I can’t do this. I’m too shy” he said bashfully. “I’m just a shy entertainment lawyer.” With a little encouragement from his wife and some sexy lighting and music Emhoff told her “Listen to me girl I support you.” But anytime he’s not there he added “That’s just me telling you you got this baby.”

Martin Short Talks Turning 70 SNL Steve Martin and Performing for ‘Pure Joy’

From there the pair received a series of bipartisan guests including Aidy Bryant’s Ted Cruz—who brought pork and bread—Kenan Thompson’s Raphael Warnock and Cecily Strong’s Marjorie Taylor Greene.

“By the way somebody scraped the crap out of a Prius in your driveway” Cruz told them. “No idea who did it. Probably my daughters. It definitely wasn’t me. My only crime is loving too much… and sedition.”

But the most momentous section featured the long-awaited return of SNL’s new Joe Biden Alex Moffat who popped in to boast about his big press conference and check in to see how Harris was doing with her gig overseeing the border crisis.

“Wow thank you for the opportunity” Harris deadpanned. “Such a fun solvable problem.”

The sketch ended with Biden’s German shepherd dog attacking Martin Short’s Emhoff who relayed the Passover saying “Dayenu” or “It would have been enough” to his wife.

But if she only gets to be vice president she told him “That won’t be enough.”

Warren Buffett is widely considered the greatest investor of all time. And rightfully so. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.03%) (BRK.B -0.01%) has handily outperformed the market since its inception. However Berkshire has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years -- largely because Buffett didn't own many of the growth stocks that drove the market's return.

Out of the 48 companies Berkshire Hathaway owns none of them are renewable energy stocks. Let's break down the reasons why Buffett has steered clear of renewables and why now might be the best time to alter his course.

Explaining Berkshire Hathaway Energy

It's important to first understand Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) and how it fits into Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway owns 91.1% of BHE. Buffett considers BHE part of his ""big four"" along with insurance companies 100% ownership of the largest U.S. railroad by freight volume (BNSF) and 5.4% ownership of Apple (AAPL 0.20%).

BHE is a leading U.S. energy operator meaning it's in a similar business as other utilities and energy infrastructure companies. BHE is huge owning over $100 billion in assets and generating $3.4 billion in 2020 net income. The vast majority of its holdings are regulated electric and natural gas utilities transmission and distribution businesses dealing mainly with fossil fuels. BHE Renewables is the primary exception.

As of 2020 year-end BHE Renewables has interests in 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power projects and has invested over $6 billion in 32 third-party wind energy projects. In 2020 BHE Renewables generated $936 million in revenue and $521 million in net income. For comparison Brookfield Renewable Corporation -- which is valued at $7.7 billion and owns and operates similar renewable assets to BHE -- has 18.8 GW of renewable capacity and generated $3.09 billion in 2020 revenue. So yes Buffett likes energy. But BHE doesn't own that many renewable energy assets for its size.

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio

Now that we have a better handle of how BHE fits into Berkshire Hathaway as a whole the remainder of our discussion will focus on Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies (not its subsidiaries).

Berkshire's portfolio has changed a lot over the last five years most notably with the purchase of Apple in 2016. Since then Apple has ballooned to become Berkshire's largest holding. Worth over $108 billion Apple stock comprises a staggering 38% of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies. Buffett has also added Snowflake and StoneCo two hyper-growth stocks that go against his traditional value investing bent. Since Buffett owns so much Apple his portfolio is actually double the tech concentration of the S&P 500. Buffett is also overweight financials and consumer staples and underweight every other sector. In fact Buffett's portfolio looks nothing like the S&P 500. The following charts compare the two.

Buffett has had a concentrated portfolio for decades -- so Berkshire's starkly contrasting allocation compared to the market isn't all too surprising. However what is surprising is that he hasn't added any renewables stocks given his openness to growth industries.

Why Buffett has avoided renewable energy stocks

The most likely reason Buffett has avoided renewables is profitability and valuation. Despite the growth trajectory the industry tends to be cyclical and can even be unprofitable. It seems like a distant memory now but 2016 was a downturn in the solar industry. The average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF lost 45% of its value in just one year. Fast forward to 2020 and the average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF went up over 230% and the average stock in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF gained 59%.

The narrative has flipped in 2021 as renewables are heavily underperforming the market. Although there are valid reasons why renewables are selling off right now discounted prices could give Buffett a more attractive entry point into a new sector. Renewables remain cyclical but costs have come down and established players have shown they can better manage profits throughout market cycles.

Renewable energy stocks worth consideration

Renewable energy stocks would fit perfectly in Berkshire's portfolio. Despite the sell-off the long-term tailwinds for renewable energy are brighter than ever before.

There are plenty of different ways to invest in the sector. As a utility operator BHE is already investing in a big part of the renewable supply chain. However a well-run utility like NextEra Energy (NEE 0.67%) stands out as a good buy. NextEra Energy Resources the company's renewable division had over $5 billion in 2020 revenue and a renewable capacity of over 27 GW at 2020 year-end. NextEra's overall business has a track record for earnings and dividend growth and is the largest U.S. utility by market cap.

Buffett could also invest in an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) like General Electric or Siemens. These companies design specifications and manage renewable energy projects. GE in particular has been targeting some big-time renewable growth.

Finally Buffett could go for a more pure-play renewable energy stock. Market leaders like Enphase Energy that ran too far too fast in 2020 have since come down in price and could be a good fit. If Buffett was feeling particularly adventurous smaller companies like wind blade manufacturer TPI Composites could be worth a look.

Takeaways

BHE is a core part of Berkshire Hathaway but its renewable assets are minor given the size of Buffett's holdings. Aside from utility operators Buffett lacks significant exposure to other aspects of renewable energy. If Buffett is open to investing in Snowflake and StoneCo then he could stand to benefit from adding some growing renewable energy stocks as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR,Entergy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL21hci8yOC9kYXJyZW4tZGFtb24tcGV0ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HIGH PROFILE: Darren Damon Peters remembers childhood atmosphere of ‘it takes a village’,"Darren Peters holds a successful career as founder and managing partner of the Peter Damon Group in Washington. It's a public affairs company that specializes in advocacy lobbying at the federal and state levels business development and event management services.

But this role is the pinnacle of a Mount Everest of sorts that Peters -- described by those who know him as a man of quiet calm demeanor who never gets rattled -- has climbed via the number of moving-shaking wheeling-dealing roles he has had paid and unpaid throughout his adulthood: Chief of staff for the Office of Policy and International Affairs U.S. Department of Energy. Senior-level manager for Entergy Corp. Publisher of a Little Rock-based magazine that highlighted and celebrated diversity within the Black community. Campaign strategist for Hillary Rodham Clinton.

""Something I say and I've been saying for some time ... and that's just 'Keep it moving forward'"" Peters says. If someone comes to him and tells what they want to do his reply is ""OK let's figure out how best to go about getting it done. I'm not going to be discouraging. I'm going to be encouraging.""

A typical day for Peters involves getting to the office probably around 8 a.m. having his first meetings with the executive team then going into the staff or team meeting. There they discuss clients' needs. Then come the phone calls and virtual meetings during which Peters builds relationships.

""Those things are just ongoing. We're continuing to move forward to make sure we have those relationships taken care of. So I usually ... get finished [with] work on a good day maybe 7:30."" But he lives this way by choice.

""I think working doing the grind every day -- to most people it's hard work but not hard in a negative sense. It's just what it takes to get it done.""

HUMBLE BEGINNINGS

Peters 53 has come a long way from humble beginnings in Little Rock.

He grew up around the corner from Central High his alma mater the one boy in a single-parent household with an older sister and a younger one. (He also has a half-brother.) His father figure was his grandfather with whom he went to live after his grandmother died. ""A good portion of my formative years were with my grandfather ... probably from age 12 on up"" Peter says. Because his grandfather was God-fearing and churchgoing Peters himself was very active in church.

He fondly remembers growing up in an ""it takes a village"" atmosphere.

""That was very very much intact ... but not just from the parents in the neighborhood. It was really the people like my age and a little bit older who were very engaged in providing a different type of education.

""A lot of people think that getting educated in the streets [has] all these negative connotations to it."" But there are advantages he says. ""You learn confidence you learn teamwork you learn a lot of different aspects that you can utilize later in your life. ... We had some good folks in the neighborhood.""

As a youth Peters pondered being a lawyer. At the time of his upbringing it was ingrained in him that after attending college ""you're going to get a job somewhere and you're probably going to work there the rest of your life. ... You want a stable kind of environment.

""So like most folks I guess I was expecting to do the same. Inside of me [I knew] it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to do. But I was on that path.""

Peters' record as a good student landed him at Hendrix College in Conway after graduation from Central in 1986.

Peters cherishes his time at Hendrix.

""It was a great great experience in some instances and it was a tough experience"" he says. ""From a cultural perspective there [were] not a lot of African Americans on campus. The good thing about that is because there were so few we were a very very close-knit group of folks.""

Among those folks was one of Peters' closest friends and former college roommate -- Darrin Williams now chief executive officer of Southern Bancorp Inc.

Williams says his relationship with Peters goes back to them attending kindergarten together at Central High School when it had a kindergarten program. ""It was when we were both back at Central as high school students that [our] friendship cemented and now he is like a brother to me"" Williams says.

""He is a 'salt of the earth' kind of guy"" Williams adds describing Peters. ""I could not ask for a more loyal honest and supportive friend. ... He is also about the most honest person that I know. He is going to tell you the truth whether you want to hear it or not.""

It was also while at Hendrix that Peters met his wife Vivian. She was a student at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. The two have been married 28 years and have two children Brandon who works with his father at Peter Damon Group; and Sydney a student at the University of Nebraska.

INTRO TO POLITICS

After graduating from Hendrix in 1990 with a political science degree Peters got a job at the former Metropolitan National Bank then he applied to law school. During his first year of law school he left to join the campaign of former President Bill Clinton.

Peters was sent out on the campaign trail -- ""a young Black political operative traveling around the country ... ahead of these primaries going into the Black communities telling them about Bill Clinton.

""It made a huge difference for them to see people that looked like them already working with this governor from Arkansas that they [didn't] really know a whole lot about.""

Working with the Clinton campaign Peters says ""was one of the greatest experiences I've had in my life. ... I learned so much.""

Once that successful campaign ended Peters went to Washington and began working at the Department of Commerce and the Minority Business Development Agency before joining Clinton's re-election campaign. After that he went to the White House and the Department of Energy.

At the White House Peters served in the Presidential personnel arena helping to review candidates who were looking for jobs within the administration. From there he went to the U.S. Department of Energy in the Office of Policy and International Affairs. He went as a special assistant in that office but after some time the assistant secretary made him the chief of staff.

In 2000 Peters returned to Little Rock to become manager of system government affairs for Entergy Corp. He also became involved in community work serving on the boards of the Single Parent Scholarship Fund of Pulaski County and Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families; helping bring City Year here; helping begin the local chapter of 100 Black Men and chairing the Central Arkansas Transit Authority Board.

PLAYING UP THE POWER

Then came PowerPlay magazine.

When he was in Washington Peters was selected to be a part of a group the American Council of Young Political Leaders. The group was made of four Republicans and four Democrats. Peters became friends with a city councilman from Phoenix. ""He was telling me about this publication that they were doing that was highlighting Black folks"" with a strict focus on Black-owned businesses.

Peters concluded that a similar magazine would be good for Arkansans. He wanted ""to be able to expose African Americans who are doing positive things to show that we're not a monolithic type of people. I mean we have diversity within [our ranks]. We're not just Democrats; we're Democrats Republicans Independents.

""So we assembled a team"" of key community members for a meeting.

He didn't know anything about magazine publishing. Someone suggested he reach out to Sericia Rouse now Sericia Nelson who went on to serve as the magazine's editor.

Nelson recalls being ""intrigued"" by Peters' vision.

"" [I] thought he must have been a pretty smart and cool guy to have assembled such an impressive group of folks who were willing to be a part of his idea.""

She praises Peters as a hard savvy worker. ""I daresay that you are not likely to outwork him. He's also astute enough to surround himself with people who balance him out.""

The magazine had a successful run of some eight years eventually spinning off into the PowerPlay Awards. Peters even added PowerPlay TV. Everybody involved with PowerPlay including Peters worked on a volunteer basis.

Peters tried to pick PowerPlay back up after returning to Washington. It lasted a couple of issues there.

""We still talk about every now and then just doing a special edition.""

CLIMBING THE CAREER LADDER

Peters had returned to Little Rock after being approached by Entergy executive Kay Arnold while still at the Department of Energy. She'd asked if he was thinking about coming back home; there could be an opportunity in Arkansas for him and she wanted to talk to him about it if he was interested she told him. That led to the Entergy job.

""Kay Arnold became a great mentor to me"" Peters says. ""I'd never been in a corporate world not like that. And she helped guide me through that Entergy corporate maze. It's a great company but just like anything you kind of [have to] learn how to do business.""

Peters was allowed to take a leave of absence from Entergy to do advance campaign work for then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton who had decided to enter the 2008 presidential race. Clinton wanted him to travel with her and help with some of the political activities. He and Clinton's team traveled every day ""sunup to sundown"" and got to know one another well.

Traci Otey Blunt now senior vice president for communications for the National Football League was a member of that team.

""Darren is one of the most consistent people I know"" Blunt says. ""He treats everyone with the same respect -- you can be the person cleaning the building or the President of the United States and he treats you [with] the same respect and kindness.""

After Clinton lost the primary Peters returned to Entergy. The powers-that-be asked if he would go to Washington and work at the company's offices there. He did so serving as the director for federal government affairs until Clinton reached out again. She wanted his help with her 2016 presidential campaign.

So Peters went back on the campaign trail. ""Unfortunately we didn't have the results we wanted.""

He did return to Entergy after Clinton's loss. But the desire to begin his own company burned within him. In 2017 he took the plunge and did so using the experience and relational capital he'd amassed from his past jobs.

Once word got out about what Peters was doing he began hearing from people who sought his expertise. ""I would say 99% of our business has come from somebody who just recommended us.""

That doesn't surprise another good friend of Peters' -- Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin a fellow Hendrix alumnus who saw Peters as ""someone others wanted to be around and befriend.""

In 1995 Griffin moved to Washington to work as a federal prosecutor and needed a place to stay.

""Darren was married with a young family"" Griffin says. ""He asked if I wanted to stay with him in his Maryland home. ... Of course I took him up on it"" and crashed in Peters' basement.

""He showed me around and helped me get settled in. ... We had lots of good conversations talking about life and the future.""

PAYING IT FORWARD

Peters who credits several organizations with helping to shape him as a youth continues to pay it forward as a success coach for The Cypher a Washington-based group of Black male professionals providing guidance and support to other black males and he continues to support charitable organizations in Arkansas.

He gets back to the Natural State fairly often and attends an annual ""Boyz' Weekend"" that he and five of his friends including Williams have been attending for nearly 20 years. With the exception of last year they usually get together in Hot Springs in June.

Peters enjoys playing golf. He's also a foodie enjoying sampling different types of food from different restaurants and likes to travel.

Maturity he says has taught him that ""the older you get [the more that] you just want to be happy.""

""You realize that it's certain things that you think make you happy but [they don't]. Along the way you should be able to find out what really makes you happy and then just go for that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of property pricing over the past 30 years revealed housing values quadrupled across the Harbour City and grew at close to double the rate of incomes.

Sydney’s median price based on sales of units houses and townhouses was $180000 in 1990 and was $870000 at the end of 2020 the Aussie Home Loans and CoreLogic research revealed.

The rise represented growth of 384 per cent – or average annual growth of about 5.4 per cent.

Where to buy Sydney’s cheapest houses

There were even bigger rises in exclusive Harbour enclaves. Only two suburbs had median house prices above $1m in 1990 but 30 years later the 10 most expensive suburbs all had medians above $4.4m.

The average house in Point Piper Sydney’s most expensive suburb was $1.32m in 1990 and is now about $8.74m.

There was a similar increase in other wealthy pockets like Darling Point Rose Bay and Vaucluse with values increasing six-fold.

Aussie Home Loans chief executive James Symond said the incredible growth across Sydney showed real estate remained a prudent investment.

“Families who have hung along for the ride will certainly have a lot of equity” Mr Symond said adding housing was the pillar of most families’ wealth.

“A lot of that equity is getting passed down to the younger generations through the bank of mum and dad. Families didn’t have that kind of equity in the late 1980s and early 1990s.”

CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said first homebuyers have been a casualty of the surging prices and incomes have not been able to keep pace with the incredible rises.

The average salary was about $27000 in 1990 and is nearly $88000 today an increase of about 225 per cent according to ABS figures.

“An issue for the market is that incomes haven’t kept pace and the midterm outlook for income growth is fairly mild” Mr Lawless said.

He added that “right or wrongly” home ownership had become a major determinant of whether a household was well off or not.

“It is clear that those who go into retirement owning their homes are in a considerably better position than those who don’t due to all the equity they will have.”

Upsizer Emilio Mrakas said price rises had made it difficult to find his next home but were also a relief considering they were selling.

His modern house on Wilson Ave in Belmore will go to auction today at 12pm with Ray White-Earlwood agent Dean Vasil.

“We bought in a hot market in 2017 and built a new home but then the market went to rock bottom. We’re just glad it’s now a good time to sell” he said.

Sydney Sothebys director Michael Pallier who was behind the priciest house sale last year at $95m — a Point Piper waterfront mansion — said affluent suburbs outperformed the rest of the market because “the rich got richer”.

“There are a limited number of houses along the Harbour and buyers with virtually unlimited money to spend. Something has to give. The path of least resistance is the prices go up” he said.

Mr Pallier added that the internet had created more high-net worth people than ever before and the rise of China and its love for Sydney real estate meant more wealthy people competing for houses.",,,,,,

This means couples will need to find some other creative ways to keep their guests safely entertained and engaged.

Looking for some inspiration? Here are nine fun games and activities you can incorporate into a socially distanced wedding reception.

WINE TASTINGS

Love vino? Jennifer Cress the digital content director at Martha Stewart Weddings suggests letting guests sample several of your favorite wines during cocktail hour. And if you want to spice things up make the tasting blindfolded and have participants guess whether the wine is red or white its country of origin what year the wine was produced and the variety of grape.

TALENT SHOWS

Let friends and family showcase their hidden skills in an old-school talent show. To encourage guests to participate let them know ahead of time -- on your wedding invitations for example -- so they can prepare. Ana Bowens and Benjamin Schenk both 30 hosted a talent show at their wedding in Brooklyn in November. About half of their guests participated including the groom's sisters who tap-danced and ""two friends who sang snippets from songs that chronicled different phases of our relationship"" Bowens said. ""We gave an award to the most impressive personal protective equipment ensemble which went to a friend who wore a bedazzled mask and helmet.""

TAROT CARD READINGS

Hiring someone to perform tarot card readings is a fun activity that allows for social distancing. Expect to pay around $150 to $300 an hour. You can find a tarot card reader in your area on Yelp.

GUEST LIBS

A throwback to the party game Mad Libs this activity gives guests the opportunity to offer you marriage advice in a clever format. You can order a customized Guest Libs design through Hello Rose Paperie on Etsy ($3.75) and then print copies yourself. Brenda Garcia the Etsy shop's owner said Guest Libs also ""serve as a funny keepsake for the newlyweds.""

WEDDING SPEECH BINGO

Despite every best man and maid of honor's intentions wedding speeches can be a bore. One way to keep guests engaged is by playing speech bingo. When guests hear a specific phrase in a speech (""looks stunning"" ""raise a glass"" ""on a serious note"") they mark it off on their card and the first person to fill the bingo board and shout ""Bingo!"" wins. ""It's definitely not just for grandpa"" said Alex Dulac founder of the Plunge a wedding website for grooms. ""It can get pretty competitive. It's social and everybody knows the rules."" You can order downloadable bingo cards with 10 different layouts through OhHappy Printables on Etsy ($6.92).

TRIVIA QUIZZES

Test your guests' knowledge of wedding trivia with this tableside game. You can buy a downloadable quiz from Print GoGo on Etsy ($8.37). Round 1 poses questions such as ""'Get Me to the Church on Time' is a song composed and written for what musical?"" and ""Name the Greek equivalent of the Roman God Cupid?"" Give the winner a cute prize like a bag of Hershey's Kisses.

HE SAID SHE SAID

How well do your friends and family know you? You'll find out during a game of He Said She Said designed by ShowerThatBrideShop on Etsy ($4). The game asks guests to match quotations such as ""I met the in-laws first"" and ""I take longer to get ready"" to the bride or groom.

SHOE GAMES

This is a popular game at wedding receptions and for good reason -- it is a lot of laughs. The newly wedded couple sits on chairs that are back to back so they can't see each other. Both remove their shoes and hand one to the partner. Then an MC asks a series of questions and each spouse raises his or her shoe or the spouse's shoe depending on whose tendencies are being described. Some examples: ""Who snores the loudest?"" ""Who takes up more than half of the bed?"" ""Who is more romantic?""

CARICATURES

Send guests home with a special party favor by hiring a caricature artist to draw funny sketches of them. Some artists like Julia Kelly of San Diego allow couples to create and print a personalized wedding logo that would appear on each caricature. Caricaturists charge on average $100 to $200 an hour for events.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBydWRlbnRwZW5ueXBpbmNoZXIuY29tL3RpZXJlZC10cmF5LXN1bW1lci1kZWNvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40 Tiered Tray Summer Decor Ideas,"Get some inspiration for decorating your summer tiered tray.

The new adult superhero show out March 26 on Amazon Prime Video is the third of Kirkman’s iconic comic book series to be adapted for the small screen but it’s the first time he’s strayed from live-action.

“The Walking Dead and Outcast are very good examples of very producible shows” Kirkman tells The Daily Beast in a phone interview. Although the two previous series grapple with a zombie apocalypse and demonic possession they’re still fundamentally straightforward in production.

“For the most part it’s just people in plainclothes in dark rooms talking to other people who are acting weird” he says. “Invincible is very much not like that. Invincible is a cast of thousands. Invincible is a massive world. Invincible has insane scope and scale.”

The series follows 17-year-old Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) whose dad just happens to be Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons) the greatest superhero on Earth. Mark is elated when he finally develops his own powers but also begins to notice inconsistencies in his father’s actions. When he’s not fighting bullies in school or talking to his mom (Sandra Oh) at home Mark can be found fighting supervillains at the bottom of the ocean or on another planet.

In addition to the intense interplanetary action sequences animation also allowed for Kirkman to dig into some of the idiosyncrasies of everyday superhero life. In the first episode Mark and his dad play catch outside. Instead of tossing the baseball back and forth in their backyard they play back-to-back thousands of feet in the air throwing the ball to one another across the globe. Kirkman is particularly fond of a conversation that Mark and his dad have over Mount Everest.

“They're just having this casual conversation that just happens to be in this very exotic insane crazy locale” Kirkman explains. “If we were shooting this in live-action a line producer would say ‘Hey you know can’t this be on the porch?’”

“This is a superhero show” he adds. “We want to show [that] this is how superheroes live. A superhero would have this conversation on the top of Mount Everest because that requires no effort.”

Animation also helps set Invincible apart from the onslaught of other superhero productions which Kirkman calls “a hugely crowded landscape.”

While Marvel and Disney+’s WandaVision The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and forthcoming Loki series have dominated the 2021 television scene DC and The CW have been on the live-action superhero series beat for years. Since the premiere of Arrow nine years ago The CW has developed The Flash Supergirl DC’s Legends of Tomorrow Black Lightning Batwoman and Superman & Lois.

Even Amazon Prime Video got in on the trend with The Boys the dark and satirical live-action take on superheroes that began filming its third season last month. Kirkman calls The Boys “super amazing and creative and fantastic” but says that he didn’t want to go head-to-head with the show.

“I think that one way that we're able to stand apart is by being animated” he explains. “I think that when people see the elements of violence and gore that are incorporated that kind of stuff works really well in animation.”

Invincible first printed in 2002 with illustrations by Cory Walker rivals Kirkman’s other comics in terms of bloodshed. The screen adaptation is no exception. The comic which ran for 15 years with contributions from Ryan Ottley is the first of Kirkman’s TV adaptations to be based on a story that is already finished. Kirkman said that working on two different versions of the stories which were years apart in the timeline often created a hectic process.

“It was nice to be able to just kind of go ‘OK well Invincible now lives in this form in my brain’” Kirkman says. “I didn't have to keep two forms of Invincible going concurrently.”

Working from a completed storyline also gave Kirkman and writer Simon Racioppa a blueprint when they started mapping the series which Kirkman enjoyed and likened to “assembling a puzzle.” Mark and his family have a precise trajectory for the series so every choice the writers made in an episode was about getting the three Graysons closer to their inevitable developmental conclusion.

“ For the most part it’s just people in plainclothes in dark rooms talking to other people who are acting weird. ” — Robert Kirkman on ‘The Walking Dead’

“Mark is a character that over the course of this series will evolve more than I think any character I've ever created” Kirkman says. “I think that he goes through so much and learns and changes so much over time that by the end of the series he’s a completely different person.”

Kirkman was looking for someone with the range who could play both a naive kid and a fully mature adult and Yeun was the ideal fit. Kirkman has watched him evolve since his early days on The Walking Dead as fan-favorite Glenn into the Oscar-nominated actor he is today.

“You've seen him grow as an actor into somebody that is absolutely at the top of everyone's list” he says. “He’s head and shoulders grown more than almost anyone and I felt that he would be perfect to portray Mark.”

One of the most challenging characters in the series is also the most human Debbie Grayson.

“She is an everyday normal powerless human being that’s in this world surrounded by Titans and she has to hold her own” Kirkman says. “She has to be in a sense the strongest character in this show because her strength comes from her personality and comes from her will. And that's something that we needed somebody to be able to portray with their voice which is extremely difficult to do. And Sandra is someone that just [comes] in and does what she does almost effortlessly. Every recording session with her was an absolute masterclass in voice acting.”

Kirkman notes that animated productions provide a bit of a reprieve for actors since their contributions can be done from within a sound booth. It’s especially alluring now as many live-action productions continue to face pandemic-related setbacks. Animation provided some of the only network productions that were able to maintain regularly scheduled programming for the 2020-2021 TV season and a few of the most enticing films to come out of Sundance this year.

“As it becomes more prevalent and more accepted by mainstream audiences as people see more and more that these [shows] aren't just material produced for kids and you can actually do some really cool groundbreaking things with it you will see more and more of it” Kirkman says. “And I couldn't be more excited about that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di9pbnZpbmNpYmxlLXMwMWUwNC1wcmV2aWV3LWEtZnJpZW5kbHktZmF0aGVyLXNvbi1mbGlnaHQtdG8tbXQtZXZlcmVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invincible S01E04 Preview: A Friendly Father/Son Flight to Mt.

Hartford Courant (TNS)

Eversource Energy boosted its chief executive officer’s pay by 4% last year to $1.37 million but the Boston-based utility froze his and other executives’ 2020 salaries “in recognition of the hardships” faced by customers and communities due to COVID-19 and Tropical Storm Isaias according to a regulatory filing Friday.

Eversource cut the cash bonus for CEO James Judge to $2.75 million from $3 million in 2019 but said it reflected his performance that was still far above targets used to determine compensation.

Including stock awards of $6.7 million and $3.7 million in calculated pension value Judge’s total compensation in 2020 was $14.6 million. Eversource cited his “superior leadership” of a high-performing company including his “continued emphasis on the importance of both protecting the planet and pushing for racial and social justice while ensuring a focus on the safety of our employees and the public from the very beginning of the pandemic which he continues to do to this day.” Eversource also cited its “excellent financial operational and strategic results in 2020\u2033 in awarding incentive grants and awards.

The utility posted a nearly one-third increase in profit in 2020 despite a significant number of storms. Net income of $1.2 billion was up from $909 million in 2019. Revenue climbed 4.4% to $8.9 billion.

Despite the company’s strong performance Eversource said it would freeze base salaries of senior executives at 2020 levels “in recognition of the hardships experienced by our customers and communities resulting from COVID-19 and the effects of Storm Isaias.”

Judge told state lawmakers last August he expected his compensation to be “dramatically less” because the utility’s “performance hasn’t been as stellar” anxiety is high among customers due to the coronavirus pandemic and the “outrage we’re hearing in Connecticut” about the higher electricity rates and storm restoration.

Judge was criticized by some Connecticut lawmakers and others for not being visible after the storm. Craig Hallstrom president of regional electric operations was the public face of Eversource in the aftermath of the storm.

Connecticut regulators faulted Eversource’s handling of Tropical Storm Isaias. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said in a report released March 19 the utility did not adequately prepare for the Aug. 4 storm that knocked out power to about 800000 customers for days.

The agency also criticized Eversource for “communications systems failures” and said it fell short in coordination and communications with the towns. Eversource said in its filing that “as a result of Tropical Storm Isaias which caused extensive catastrophic damage to our Connecticut distribution system and many prolonged outages our customers and our government leaders felt that our performance fell short of their expectations.”

Recognizing “this sentiment” Eversource said it did not attribute any performance percentage value to the customer goals in its overall assessment because the goal was assessed at “zero percent.”

Among its accomplishments Eversource said it restored service “following a substantial number of storms in a safe and effective manner” established a voluntary moratorium on customer shutoffs for nonpayment during the coronavirus pandemic and “offered broad payment and arrearage forgiveness plans to provide assistance” to relieve economic pressure felt by customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0NULXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtZHJvcC1hcy13aW5kcy1zdWJzaWRlLTE2MDU3ODQxLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CT power outages drop as winds subside,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/CT-power-outages-drop-as-winds-subside-16057841.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL0NULXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtZHJvcC1hcy13aW5kcy1zdWJzaWRlLTE2MDU3ODQxLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L2J1c2luZXNzL3Bob25lLXNjYW1zLWtlZXAtY29taW5nLWhlcmUtYXJlLXRpcHMtaG93LWF2b2lkLXRoZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The phone scams keep on coming — here are tips on how to avoid them,"“Are you really from Eversource?” my colleague asked more a statement than a question.

He received the first call a couple of weeks ago from someone who said he was from Eversource (spoiler alert: he wasn’t) and that the electricity to his house would be turned off in “40 to 45 minutes” because his account was overdue.

A Globe colleague recently got two unsettling calls on his mobile phone from the same “888″ number.

The caller quickly hung up.

Then last week he got an almost identical call from “Eversource” including the same threat to disconnect the electricity in “40 to 45 minutes.”

“I know this is a scam” my colleague said and hung up.

Imposter scams — in which perpetrators try to swindle consumers by saying they are calling from a utility government agency or other entity — are the most common type of scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission. Last year the FTC logged almost half a million complaints totaling $1.2 billion in losses to consumers.

Last year’s consumer loss in imposter scams was almost twice as much as the previous year’s according to the FTC.

The scam artists who pose as a representative of a utility typically demand quick payment of hundreds of dollars to prevent the shutoff of electricity gas or water and convince victims to pay with a prepaid debit card or by giving the scammer bank account information over the phone.

“Utilities deal with this all the time” said Reid Lamberty an Eversource spokesman. “Our customers are inundated with it.”

Eversource is one of about 140 utilities that have banded together in a national consortium to fight scams. A representative of that group told me its members have seen a tremendous surge in imposter scams since the pandemic began. Last year he said the consortium helped to shut down almost 4000 phony toll-free numbers used by scammers compared to about 1500 a year prior to the pandemic.

Here’s the takeaway: Never pay money under the threat of an imminent shutoff coming from a voice on the phone.

Utilities do occasionally turn off service due to nonpayment. But you will get multiple notices in the mail over weeks before that happens. It’s a deliberate process not a sudden call with less than an hour’s notice.

(In Massachusetts a state-ordered moratorium on shutoffs of utilities has been in effect since the pandemic began and is scheduled to remain in effect until at least July 1; in Rhode Island a moratorium is in effect until at least June 25.)

“We never threaten to disconnect service by phone and we never demand instant payment” Lamberty said. “Anyone who hears the word ‘disconnect’ should hang up the phone.”

That’s what Attorney General Maura Healey recently did.

“I just got a call from a scammer posing as Eversource claiming I was behind on my payments and threatening to cut off my service” Healey tweeted on March 18. “Needless to say he called the wrong attorney general.”

The FTC provides these tips:

“If you get a call out of the blue and the caller claims you have to pay a past due bill or your services will be shut off never give banking information over the phone. To pay your bill over the phone always place the call to a number you know is legitimate.

“Utility companies don’t demand payment information by e-mail text or phone. And they won’t force you to pay by phone as your only option.

“If the caller tells you to pay by gift card cash reload card money transfer or cryptocurrency it’s a scam. Every time. No matter what they say.”

And scammers are increasingly sending text messages. Last year the number of unsolicited text messages sent to consumers tripled compared to the previous year the FTC says.

Last week I received a text saying “Sean you still have $130 Amazon Rewards credit. See what you can buy before it expires.”

A few hours later I got this text: “Amazon: Congratulations GARY you came in 1st in March’s Amazon pods raffle!”

A Globe reporter received a message from a scammer posing as Amazon. Courtesy of Sean P. Murphy

Both texts included a hyperlink. But I did not click on either of them. (And neither should you click on links that come unsolicited.) Instead I checked my Amazon account for any evidence of a “credit” or a “raffle.” There was none.

After I sent screenshots of the text messages to Amazon a company representative assured me they were scams.

If I had clicked on one of the links it would have taken me to a Web page designed to look like Amazon’s and asking me to type in personal information like username password credit card number and bank information the Amazon rep said. That’s the kind of information scammers use to steal your identity order products at your expense and make withdrawals from your bank account.

“We don’t communicate this way” the Amazon rep said. “And we never ask for personal information from customers.”

Anyone who receives a questionable e-mail call or text from a person impersonating an Amazon employee can report them to customer service. “Amazon investigates these complaints and will take action if warranted” the Amazon rep said.

But even with all that work the Evergreen Ever Given wouldn't be able to dock at the South Boston facility now that it's been freed - it's just too big.

A $350-million dredging project paid for by Massport the US Army Corps of Engineers and the state the bulk of which finished in December deepened the main shipping channel through the harbor into the Reserved Channel from 40 to 47 feet (the project was delayed when the Corps and Massport sued the MWRA and Eversource over the cross-harbor conduit that powers the Deer Island sewage treatment plant which a Boston Edison contractor had failed to bury deep enough under the harbor bottom).

But fully loaded the Ever Given has a draft of 47 feet 7 inches.

The three new cranes Massport will be installing - so big Massport had to build a new berth for them away from the current berths because otherwise they might have caused a potential problem for planes landing at Logan - are designed to handle ships with a maximum capacity of 14000 TEU - with one TEU being roughly equivalent to one 20-foot-long shipping container.

That's good enough for ships coming through the Panama Canal these days and a significant increase over the roughly 8000-TEU vessels the terminal can now unload but the Ever Given has a capacity of 20124 TEU.

Also the new berth is 1250 feet long - while the Ever Given is 1312 ft 2 inches long.

Still even if the Ever Given can't dock here its owner Evergreen has smaller ships that already dock at the Conley.",,,

This hotel is considered a Disney Value Resort meaning that it is priced in a more “budget-friendly” range. It is one of three All-Star Resorts at Disney World and is currently the only one that has reopened to guests since initial closures began last year. And they’re rolling out the red carpet (literally!) to welcome guests back. So today we’re stopping by and giving you a look INSIDE one of the standard rooms!

When you’re staying at Disney’s All-Star Movies you’re transported directly into the middle of some classic Disney movies. There are five themed areas that feature larger-than-life decorations from Disney’s Fantasia 101 Dalmatians Herbie: The Love Bug The Mighty Ducks and Toy Story.

We stayed in The Mighty Ducks section in a Standard Room with a Courtyard View. The Courtyard Views tend to be the middle-of-the-road option in terms of price. If you want a pool view expect to pay a little bit more or you can select a parking lot view for a little bit less. So let’s take a look around!

The Standard Rooms at All-Star Movies come with either a king bed or a queen bed and a queen-size table bed. We opted for the queen bed for our stay. Note that no matter which one you choose the regular bed will be closest to the bathroom.

And above the bed you’ll find Mickey Minnie and Donald ready for a starring role in their next cartoon! The decor adds a touch of character (see what we did there?) to the room and doubles as extra lighting.

The second queen bed doubles as a desk with seating for two. You can pull it down at night to sleep up to four people in the room.

When you pull the bed down it features Huey Duey and Louie Duck catching some zzz’s. And you can even see what they’re dreaming about all cuddled up on the couch.

The room is also has a TV and dresser with 3 drawers and some cabinet storage. In the corner you’ll also find additional shelving with a coffee maker and a mini-fridge.

You’ll have a coffee maker alongside a bucket for ice…

…and when you open the drawer you can find cups tea and other things you’ll need to whip up your morning brew before heading to the parks.

Here’s a look at the view of the room when you initially enter the door. The bathroom is located towards the back of the room and our room had a door that connects to the room next door. Not every room at All-Star Movies features adjoining rooms so you need to request that ahead of time if you’d like that.

Now let’s take a look at all the little details in the room! When you first enter you’ll find hooks by the adjoining door to hang your bags coats or ponchos out to dry.

There is also a closet that comes with hangers for your clothes and an ironing board.

And you don’t need to worry about bringing an iron or hairdryer. You’ll find that in the room on the shelving unit next to the mirror.

On top of the dresser you’ll find a display that shows you all of the touchpoints in the room that have been cleaned a little bit extra as part of Disney’s commitment to heightened safety procedures.

Our remote even came in a sanitized pouch that is changed out between guests.

Let’s head over to the bathroom shall we? The room features a large mirror above the sink as well as a smaller magnification mirror on the wall next to the bathroom door. There’s even some extra storage space next to…

…and below the sink so the whole family can keep their items out during your stay.

A door separates the toilet and shower from the sink area which enables multiple people to get ready at once. And you’ll find a few towel racks inside of the bathroom where housekeeping will place your towels.

There’s no need to bring your own shampoo conditioner or soap! Inside the shower you’ll find that Disney has it all in refillable and reusable bottles that are sanitized after each guest.

Earlier we mentioned that our room was a courtyard view so we’ll give you a peek at that too! We were on the first floor so you can see the bottom of the big hockey stick that was on the building.

Thanks for coming along on the tour of our room at Disney’s All-Star Music Resort! Keep in mind that these rooms recently underwent renovation so they are a bit nicer than the other All-Star Resort rooms. Disney is currently renovating All-Star Music and we anticipate that All-Star Sports won’t be too far behind. But for now that’s it for our tour!

The game was initially released in October 2019 for PC and Xbox on Steam. Now is a good time to see what the game is all about if you have recently heard of it.

'Secret Neighbor' gameplay

According to Gematsu ""Secret Neighbor"" is a multiplayer horror game based on the Hello Neighbor series. This is part of the game series of ""Hello Neighbor."" In the game a group of children attempts to sneak into the spooky Neighbor's home.

Six players sneak into a locked basement door to open it when they find that one of them is the Neighbor in disguise. The events in the game occur between Acts 1 and 2 of Hello Neighbor's original game.

You either play as two teams these being:

The Neighbor

As the Neighbor you choose from various classes and employ all available means to prevent intruders from succeeding. Initially you are in disguise and it is up to you to build trust with other players to tempt them away from the group and have them disappear.

Your tools of the trade include bear traps secret control rooms smoke bombs and so on. The best players in the game will convince large groups of people that someone else is the Neighbor.

The Intruders

Friends are searching for their missing friend. Everyone believes he is locked in the creepy basement of the Neighbor.

Intruders come equipped with different abilities and classes so the only logical thing to do is break into the Neighbor's house and basement.

Bagger will have extra storage space. Brave will boost everyone's speed. Detective knows where the keys are and more.

Players will be required to scavenge the house for basement keys and valuable loot to upgrade their skills and equipment.

'Secret Neighbor:' Where to find keys

According to Gamepressure you may need a little help getting started. Here are a few tips for the intruder's side to help you get started and where to find the keys.

Play by ear

""Secret Neighbor"" is best played while wearing headphones since you can often hear the Neighbor's attempts to conceal himself - thanks to this you can tell he is hidden in the next room. As well as having a good ear searching for keys necessitates a good sense of hearing because keys have distinctive sounds.

The color of the locks on the basement door should be remembered.

This is very important - to open the door you need not just any key but the key needs to match the color of the lock. Take note of the number of locks and the color of each lock.

If you do not mind the dark get rid of your flashlight.

When you can see well in the dark you can throw your flashlight away to help you save space in your inventory! For now you can keep two boxes in your inventory that protects you from the Neighbor until you locate a key.

The boxes are enough to paralyze a neighbor for a while - if you recover them quickly after they are thrown you can hinder the Neighbor!

These are some tips you can use while playing the game.

Number of pockets: 5 sealed plus open drinks pouch

Features: Fully waterproof anti-split stand system big pockets

Choosing the right golf bag is more important than you may think. Being comfortable on the course is vital if you are going to play your best and having the wrong bag can not only be an unwelcome distraction it can cause fatigue later in your round which will often result in wayward shots.

The best golf bags are ones you barely notice. If you are thinking about your bag you aren’t thinking about your game and if you are shattered from lugging it around for three hours then your swing is naturally going to be impaired by that.

There are several factors that go into determining which golf bag type is best but the first thing you need to decide is whether you plan on carrying your bag or if you are likely to you use a trolley (or even a buggy)?

If it’s the latter then you need a cart bag but for everyone else a stand bag is the best fit. Stand bags can be very basic or they can be packed with features. As you’d expect the more features the bag has the higher the price.

A good stand bag should be lightweight functional durable and in an ideal world fully waterproof. This is particularly important if you happen to play most of your golf in Britain when even the summers are usually dripping wet.

The amount of storage space required depends on the needs of the individual but there are some basic requirements such as a pocket for balls and room for refreshments and waterproofs. And of course if helps if it looks nice too. Vanity runs rampant in the golf world even at amateur level.

The FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag by TaylorMade ticks all of those boxes which should come as no surprise as TaylorMade make great looking top quality golf gear.

From Spider putters to the new SIM2 drivers TaylorMade products are not only high performing they just always look the part too. They even make some of the best golf balls. That’s why so many of the world’s top golfers are ‘Team TaylorMade’. The huge endorsement contracts help too obviously.

The FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag is in the mid-high price bracket but if you shop around you can find it for under £200. Is it worth it? We put it through its paces to find out.

TaylorMade FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag - Overview

(Image credit: TaylorMade Golf)

The first thing to note about this bag is that aesthetically it looks terrific. With stand bags generally there isn’t usually a great deal of difference between them. After all how could there be? For practicality reasons alone there are certain principles they all need to follow when it comes to shape and size.

The pockets are usually in the same places they all have legs that spring from the same location and it’s mostly just the colour schemes and overall look that set them apart.

This is where TaylorMade have excelled with the FlexTech. It just looks more expensive and classier than most of its competition even though price wise it compares quite favourably on the whole.

This is a bag that you’d be proud to show off to your friends. Visually it appears bigger than your typical stand bag it has curves in all the right places while the brighter coloured variations such as the royal blue / silver combo and the ‘driver’ design (so named because it uses the same colour scheme as the TaylorMade Sim2 driver head cover) look sensational.

TaylorMade FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag: Storage

(Image credit: Future)

This bag has plenty of storage space. It has five waterproof welded seam sealed pockets as well as an insulated open pocket to carry a drink. The pockets are larger than standard and as the above photo shows you can comfortably fit a pair of shoes in the apparel pocket and still have plenty of space for any other essentials such waterproofs or refreshments.

The ball pocket is also larger than you would normally find in a stand bag and unlike the Callaway Hyper Dry C stand bag which I also reviewed recently the valuables pocket was ample sized and I could easily fit my hand in there to retrieve any loose change or to check my phone during the round.

The Callaway bag does have a cool little clip which you can attach your keys to and it sits in the valuables pocket for easy retrieval and that would perhaps have been a nice little feature on this bag. Still TaylorMade could argue that the pocket on the FlexTech is large enough that the clip isn’t really needed.

The drinks pocket is a good size too and it’s conveniently located so that you can reach into it while carrying the bag on your back. The pouch is insulated so your refreshment will remain cool throughout your round.

All in all there is more than enough storage space to suit most golfers’ needs and if you need more than this then you really ought to be looking at a tour bag instead. While you’re at it though you might also need to think about hiring a full time caddie to carry it for you as those things are HEAVY.

TaylorMade FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag: Functionality

(Image credit: Future)

As you’d expect from the name the bag is totally waterproof and made from high quality lightweight materials. It comes with a PSI level of 2500mm so even in the most torrential of downpours your clubs will remain dry even if you don’t. It also comes with an easy to attach rain cover.

A five way top features two full length dividers to help keep your clubs in order. An added benefit to this is that if one of your clubs is wet when you put it back in the bag it won’t transfer the water onto the rest of the clubs in there only the ones which are in the same section.

The FlexTech is lightweight and very comfortable to carry. There are lighter bags out there but the difference in weight is barely noticeable particularly when you have a full set of clubs in there.

This bag just seems a lot bigger than most other stand bags even if the scales do not reflect it. For the record it weighs in at 2.1 kilos when empty which is probably just a fraction above average for a high end stand bag but still impressive considering the extra storage space it has.

The side pocket is deep and wide which probably makes the bag itself look wider than it actually is while the ball pocket is also much bigger than standard and almost gives this bag the look of a tour bag.

The double strap sits easily on the shoulders without the need for any adjustment but if you do decide you need to tinker with it then it’s a simple enough process of pulling the adjustable straps until it sits at the angle you want.

Just a quick point on the shoulder strap. Depending on which model of the FlexTech you buy the strap may be different. The 2021 model I tested for this review has a more standard fixed strap but earlier models have a sliding self adjusting strap which for whatever reason seems to have been ditched in the newer line.

A grab handle at the top and a nylon strap at the bottom makes lifting the bag in and out of the car very straightforward.

One of the most useful features on this bag is something so simple that you have to wonder why every stand bag doesn’t have it. Anyone who has ever had to use a stand bag on a trolley or a buggy will know awkward it can be getting into the pockets when the fastener strap from the buggy is wrapped around the bag.

The FlexTech does not have that problem because there is a handy little ‘tunnel’ that passes behind the side pocket allowing you to run the strap through while maintaining easy access to the contents of the bag. This combined with the ample storage space makes this bag very versatile. It isn’t a natural cart bag but it is perfectly functional.

One slight criticism I have is that if you want to stand the bag up without using the legs you can do so but it is not the most stable. Other stand bags I have used have been much steadier when standing without the legs.

Also personally I would have preferred the legs to come with non slip feet but despite this the anti-split stand system does what it says. You can put this bag down on a laminate floor in your house or the club shop and it won’t do the splits even though it does not have 'feet'.

There’s an umbrella holder as well as a towel ring which of course doubles up as a GPS / laser range finger clip and cushioned back pads for added comfort when carrying.

There is no velcro glove fastener on this bag though. This is only a small thing and will not matter to everyone but it is a handy feature I use all the time and I don’t understand why it isn’t a staple on every stand bag. Even if it does not get used it’s not as though it takes up any extra space or adds weight to the bag. Come on golf manufacturers add that little velcro glove holder. You know it makes sense.

TaylorMade FlexTech Waterproof Stand Bag: Verdict

(Image credit: Future)

Overall very impressed. This is an excellent bag and well worth the money. There are cheaper alternatives and there are more expensive ones but regardless of price very few look or perform better than the TaylorMade FlexTech.

Should you buy this over other similarly priced stand bags out there? Well it really depends on how much you are influenced by brand names and whether you like how this bag looks and that is very much a subjective thing. It looks fantastic to me but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

If you play TaylorMade clubs then absolutely you should go for this bag especially if you go with the ‘driver’ colour option that matches your clubs and head covers. The blue and silver combo is also a good match for SIM and SIM2 clubs while the black and white design will go with anything.

If you do not use TaylorMade clubs but you aren’t too choosy about keeping everything the same brand then sure you should seriously consider the TaylorMade FlexTech because it is the kind of bag that although not excessively priced will still earn admiringly glances from fellow golfers when you show up at the course.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5pY2tpc3dpZnQuY29tLzM2NzQ5My90aGUtdHJ1ZS12YWx1ZS1iZWhpbmQtdGhvc2UtZHJlYW0taG9tZS1tYWtlb3Zlci1ob3VzZXMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWFuLWV4cGVydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The True Value Behind Those Dream Home Makeover Houses According To An Expert,"The True Value Behind Those Dream Home Makeover Houses According To An Expert

Carbon capture looms large in many oil and chemical companies’ plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has to. Converting hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water frees the heat that drives most industrial chemical reactions and spins most electricity-generating turbines. And historically the way to do that conversion has been to set the hydrocarbons on fire.

But capturing the CO 2 vented from such combustion is difficult because it’s so dilute. The mixture of gases coming out of most combustion chambers is 8–15% CO 2 by volume. The CO 2 needs to be close to pure to work economically in storage or utilization schemes.

The most mature technology for capturing carbon during power generation passes flue gas through an amine solution that absorbs CO 2 . Heating the saturated solution releases the CO 2 at a workable concentration. But that approach comes with a heavy energy cost—around 17% of a power plant’s output.

FuelCell Energy (FCE) is offering an alternative. The Connecticut-based firm has developed a new type of fuel cell that uses molten carbonate electrolytes. This electrochemical cell can capture CO 2 from a power plant’s flue gas while generating additional electricity from natural gas coal or other fuels. The company has more than 100 US fuel-cell patents big-name partners and a soaring stock price. What it doesn’t have yet are profits or a marquee project that shows its technology pays off at commercial scale.

FCE has been around for 52 years. It spent many of its early days working on batteries before spinning that division off to focus on fuel cells in 1999. The firm and its customers operate 50 molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) power plants that provide on-site electricity and steam or hot water. Most of the installations are in the northeastern US and California along with several in South Korea and the European Union.

FCE’s fuel cells have always been able to capture their own carbon because the fuel doesn’t directly mix with air. Using MCFCs to capture other CO 2 is an idea that is getting increased interest from operators of power plants and boilers.

Not surprisingly FCE’s focus right now is on commercializing its carbon-capture technology CEO Jason Few says. It’s also working on a reversible solid-oxide fuel cell that can consume hydrogen to produce electricity or turn around and consume electricity to produce hydrogen.

Fuel cells of all types are attractive because they convert chemical energy into electrical power through controlled electrochemical reactions instead of messy combustion. Most commercial fuel cells run on hydrogen and emit water vapor not CO 2 . But most hydrogen is generated industrially from methane by energy-hogging steam reformation and water-gas shift reactions that release CO 2 .

FCE’s MCFC differs from conventional cells in two crucial ways.

First it can convert hydrocarbons to H 2 internally using the water and waste heat generated by the cell. Its nickel electrode can catalyze reformation and gas shift reactions at the 600 °C operating temperature inside. Because the H 2 is continuously consumed right there Le Chatelier’s principle pushes both reactions to completion. FCE’s chief technology officer Tony Leo says the cell can even consume alcohols as fuel though the power plants currently in place run on methane or biogas.

Second the cell pumps CO 2 through the electrolyte as part of its electrochemical cycle carrying it from the N 2 -diluted air stream to the concentrated fuel stream. Stand-alone MCFCs have to recycle some CO 2 back to the air inlet to keep that cycle going. However MCFCs attached to the end of a power plant can pull around 90% of the CO 2 out of the flue gas.

There are certain things you’re just not going to get done with wind and solar. Jason Few CEO FuelCell Energy

Crucially for carbon capture the gas flowing out of an MCFC is around 70% CO 2 along with H 2 O and some extra H 2 . And it’s much easier to separate CO 2 from water than from the nitrogen that makes up around 70% of industrial flue gas.

FCE engineers have optimized the system to work with coal-fired power plant flue gas Leo says and they’re working on the right parameters for natural gas power plants through a partnership with ExxonMobil. The firms have been working together on MCFCs and carbon capture since 2016 and signed a 2-year extension of that arrangement worth $60 million in November 2019.

The additional output of H 2 and water were key selling points for Toyota when it was looking to install a fueling station for hydrogen-powered cars in Long Beach California. An MCFC scheduled to come on line there later this year will provide fresh water 2.3 MW of electricity and 1200 kg of H 2 per day to fill Toyota’s fuel-cell engines. It will be FCE’s first commercial-scale plant with that configuration which the firm calls trigeneration.

If fuel cells are so great why does FCE promote adding them to polluting power plants instead of using them to replace the old technology outright? In some places fuel cells are in fact going in where conventional gas turbines might have otherwise. But tax credits cleantech mandates or other government incentives are usually needed to overcome the capital cost advantage that conventional plants enjoy according to a 2019 analysis published by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

And some industries including chemical manufacturing require steam and heat. “There are certain things you’re just not going to get done with wind and solar” Few says. “You’re going to still need other forms of energy.”

Carbon capture has the potential to maintain the productivity of the existing energy infrastructure even as consumers and regulators demand fewer greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of a 500 MW conventional power plant Leo says “We could just turn it off and replace it with a 500 MW carbonate fuel cell that captures its own CO 2 . But it’s probably cheaper to leave that equipment in place and add a 150 MW carbonate system.”

The IEA report modeled a 550 MW coal-fired power plant fitted with FCE’s carbon-capturing MCFC running on a separate stream of natural gas. The fuel cell in that model captured 90% of the coal plant’s CO 2 emissions while putting out 351 MW of additional power.

When you factor in the additional power FCE’s carbon-capture method would cost 60% less than an amine-based approach on the same flue gas in the IEA’s model. The cost of CO 2 captured would be $33.63 per metric ton according to the report lower than the US Department of Energy’s target of $40 per metric ton. Pilots run with ExxonMobil and the DOE got comparable results Few says.

Promising numbers from models and pilot installations along with what many hope to be a better political environment for carbon capture are generating investor interest in FCE. The firm’s stock rose from around $2.50 in November 2020 to a high of around $28 in February. It has slipped since then and has been hovering around $17 for most of March.

Stock analysts seem to think that at least some of the rise in stock price is merited. Jeffrey Osborne an analyst who covers FCE for Cowen set a price target for the stock of $15.50 in late January citing the partnerships with Toyota and ExxonMobil and good prospects for new installations in Europe North America and Asia.

In December Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote that “we see great potential but recognize the lumpiness in near to midterm results that is likely to increase volatility” as FCE commercializes its carbon-capture technology and its reversible hydrogen fuel cell. Canaccord’s price target for FCE was $8.80.

FCE has taken some lumps. In September it won bids to install four 2.8 MW MCFC power plants around its home state of Connecticut. Then in December the state reversed course pulling three of those awards and giving them to solar projects instead. Few the CEO has enlisted several state and local lawmakers in an effort to restore the projects. And in South Korea an agreement with Posco Energy to distribute FCE’s technology in the country fell apart in early 2020.

FCE posted a loss of $17.7 million in 2020 on $70.9 million in revenue. It was an improvement from a loss of $31.4 million in 2019 but a loss nonetheless.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy51cHN0cmVhbW9ubGluZS5jb20vc2FmZXR5L3BhbG1hLWF0dGFja3MtdG90YWwtc3RvcHMtd29yay1hdC1tb3phbWJpcXVlLWxuZy1hcy13b3JrZXJzLWFuZC1sb2NhbHMtZmxlZS1icnV0YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1ieS1pc2xhbWlzdC1pbnN1cmdlbnRzLzItMS05ODg3NDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palma attacks: Total stops work at Mozambique LNG as workers and locals flee brutal assault by Islamist insurgents,"Insurgency: tens of thousands of locals and refugees in the Palma area of Mozambique have fled to the coast and bush to escape the brutal insurgents.

There is high hope that Tanzania may raise its natural gas resource findings as exploration companies in the East Africa’s second biggest economy expect to drill 13 wells this year.

Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) said it was expecting a total of 13 natural gas wells the highest ever in one year to be drilled in 2014 alone including six wells which have already been pursued by both industry giants Statoil and BG Tanzania.

This raises hopes for possibility of the country to increase its natural gas resource although not guaranteed said James Andilile TPDC acting managing director.

“We cannot predict the size of amount of gas to be discovered due to the nature of the industry but there is hope. If our neighbours Mozambique have 200 trillion cubic feet (tcf) why not us?” said Mr Andilile during a one day workshop.

Tanzania has discovered 50.5 tcf by the end of July including 8tcf noticed onshore and 42.5tcf deep in the Indian Ocean.

However only 1.369 tcf is proven at Songo Songo Mnazi Bay Mkuranga and Kiliwani.

Statoil announced in June to have discovered an additional two to three tcf of natural gas in the Piri-1 well and bring the total of in-place volumes up to approximately 20 tcf in Block 2. The increased investment in the oil and gas industry in Tanzania is associated with new improved data which simplify and facilitate easy interpretation.

The government has also allowed TPDC to fully participate in the exploration development and production to optimize government participation in the industry."

Interested in ETFs? Visit our ETF Hub for investor news and education market updates and analysis and easy-to-use tools to help you select the right ETFs.

The surge in ETF investment is beginning to spark concerns that retail investors will not be able to differentiate between exchange traded funds that own securities which are easy to trade and those that have illiquid holdings.

The fear is that some funds particularly those that have narrow investment objectives can amass very large holdings in companies that are barely traded.

“If you hold an ETF that has illiquid securities then your selling price might be far lower than expected if you’re part of a wave of selling” said Elisabeth Kashner director of ETF research and analytics at FactSet which has developed a methodology that can flag ETFs that are a cause for concern.

The underlying illiquidity is not easy for an ordinary investor to spot because of the way that ETFs operate. When ETF shareholders place a sell order it is down to authorised participants the specialised trading companies or investment banks that create and redeem ETF shares to sell the underlying holdings. In other words ETF investors might never know if there had been problems being able to perform the trades.

FactSet measures how much trading in an ETF’s underlying stocks would be required if investors were to sell enough shares to prompt the redemption of 5 per cent of assets under management. For example if investors sold shares in iShares Global Clean Energy ETF that drove redemptions to 5 per cent of AUM the necessary portfolio trades would equal 36.44 per cent of their recent median trading volumes. A high underlying volume per unit figure indicates an adverse price impact is more likely particularly with funds that hold outsized positions in less liquid markets.

The data provider has identified potential problems with some ETFs tracking silver miners rare earths cannabis and renewable energy as well as pockets of problems in other sectors.

“Narrower funds especially those with relatively few constituents — such as the ones flagged in the metals and mining silver and nuclear and renewable energy sectors — may present larger challenges in finding willing buyers for their portfolio securities. Likewise APs may have fewer options for hedging these specialised portfolios” said Kashner.

The issue has also been picked up in a report published earlier this month by Goldman Sachs.

“Non-market cap weighted ETFs now comprise over 10 per cent of total equity ETFs” said Goldman in its report. “In our view this increases the need for investors to understand underlying exposures as there may be larger mismatches with underlying size and liquidity which can then lead to flow-driven distortions.”

Jessica Binder Graham co-head of European equity research at Goldman Sachs said the analysis was intended to highlight when ETFs had overweight positions in particular companies.

One example she said was Leggett & Platt which is one of the smallest 10 companies in the S&P 500 but the 20th largest holding of the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) an $18bn fund which is weighted by yield.

While institutional investors can rely on research such as FactSet’s to flag potential problems retail investors can be at a disadvantage in terms of information and might not understand potential risks.

The scarcity of buyers for the underlying constituents of some ETFs has already caused some problems in the market according to one industry executive who asked to remain anonymous. “It could put pressure on some APs — it’s definitely a lot more than you think” she said.

Experts agree that during a broad sell-off it is normal that investors should expect the value of their holdings to fall. The problem for some ETFs with concentrated positions in thinly traded markets is that a large redemption magnifies downward price pressure on its underlying stocks.

The solution is to do more homework said Anita Rausch head of capital markets at WisdomTree an ETF provider.

“What I think retail investors or any investor for that matter needs to understand is the price/value of what they are buying relative to the fundamental value of the underlying constituents” she said advising investors to do their homework on fundamentals such as price earnings valuations and price-to-book ratios.

That would be a start but would not compete with the level of scrutiny carried out by industry participants.

Dina Ting head of global index portfolio management at Franklin Templeton said the asset manager monitored the proportion of average daily volume of each underlying security an ETF would account for at different levels of assets under management as well as the percentage of free-float stock it would account for.

“Generally we would look for less than 15 per cent of the portfolio to have more than 5 per cent of average trading volume as a starting floor for capacity analysis” she added.

She said average daily volume data was available on retail brokerage order entry systems but she conceded that individual investors would not readily be able to access the additional data that companies such as Franklin Templeton rely on.

Given that some information is hard to come by it could be wise to simply take a step back and as Rausch said “learn how to spot bubbles”. Then it might be possible to avoid the crush at the exits should a wave of selling hit the market.

“Retail investors might think they’re going after a hot new area of the market but [with thematic ETFs] they are also taking a narrow view and with all due respect if there’s an ETF for it they are not the first ones there” said Peter Sleep senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management.

(NYSE: FDX) and one of the world’s largest express transportation companies is collaborating with Filipino furniture designer Trademark Kawpeng Designs (TMK) to breathe new life into discarded wooden pallets in support of an emerging circular economy and finding ways to reduce environmental impact.

A Manila-based furniture and home decor start-up known for its unique made-to-order pieces that embody Scandinavian minimalist functionality TMK works closely with clients in realizing their designs using various quality materials.

For this special project with FedEx TMK created sustainable furniture by repurposing and upcycling wooden pallets from FedEx which were used in the shipment of items across the globe.

“FedEx has long been committed and made significant progress to Reduce Replace Revolutionize[1] throughout our operations to create a more sustainable environment.” The use and demand of pallets used in supply chain operations is projected to reach 6.4 billion units in 2024 with the Asia Pacific region comprising about 40% of the entire pallet production” says John Peterson managing director of FedEx Express Philippines. “We believe that upcycling and repurposing are good ways to responsibly dispose of these pallets and at the same time contribute to our local communities by generating income for our sustainability collaborators.”

To transform the donated pallets they were first cleaned dried sanded and treated. TMK’s Matti Kawpeng then crafted them into a collection of functional furniture including a study desk an arm table a side table and a media console. The rest were turned into useful crates and were marketed to TMK clients. Proceeds were used to subsidize bicycles for TMK workers who were affected when public transport stopped during the coronavirus lockdown.

As a social enterprise TMK is committed to helping socially disadvantaged workers especially single and young parents. A portion of the sales generated from donated materials are used for employees’ needs such as their daily uniforms snacks coffee and maintenance of their bikes.

“We are constantly eager to support sustainable initiatives that also allow for design creativity and ingenuity. I am really pleased that the collaboration with FedEx Express enables us to uphold this cause. It is a delight to be able to transform what would have ended up as land-fill into beautiful and functional pieces” says Matti Kawpeng founder and furniture designer of TMK.

FedEx recently announced an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutral operations globally by 2040. To help reach this goal FedEx is committing more than $2 billion to support initiatives designed to make company operations more sustainable across its fleet of motorized vehicles and aircraft as well as its facilities. This includes a pledge of $100 million to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture in the United States and its applied research into methods of sequestration at a scale that will offset the impact of long-haul transportation.

AUSTIN Texas – Billy Horschel denied local crowd favorite Scottie Scheffler 2 and 1 in the final of the WGC Match Play on Sunday at Austin Country Club.

Horschel never trailed after the fifth hole and didn’t flinch in face of the overwhelming support for Scheffler a Dallas native who attended the nearby University of Texas (scorecard).

In doing so Horschel who finished tied for second in the first WGC event of the year four weeks earlier in his native Florida reminded fans and fellow players of the Gator chomp-waving flamboyant golfer who captured the 2014 FedEx Cup in dramatic fashion. He has struggled to return to that level of play.

“It’s a lot of hard work on the range and grinding out this match today” Horschel said. “I know I have that talent to win all the majors. I just haven’t shown it yet.”

While the victory will give him plenty of money ($1.82 million) and FedEx points (550) he’s hopeful that it also will provide a spark to improve his woeful major-championship record starting next week at the Masters.

Since his rookie season in 2013 he has had only one top-10 finish in golf’s four biggest events a tie for fourth in the 2013 U.S. Open. But with a week off to get ready for Augusta National Horschel said he is ready to rewrite his major script.

“My goal has been to play my best for Augusta” said Horschel 34 a six-time winner on the PGA Tour. “I wanted to play well here take what I need to work on at home and be ready for the Masters.”

The final match was far from a thing of beauty with each player taking turns spraying drives off the fairway and into the rough or missing birdie putts. Each player made only one birdie – both on the front nine – and Scheffler’s came when Horschel conceded a 34-foot putt on the second hole.

“I felt really sorry for the fans who had to watch that [final] match” Horschel said. “There wasn’t a lot of birdies today.”

Nonetheless Scheffler will take far more positives than negatives as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory.

“This is the first round of the last four I didn’t feel like I had my game this afternoon” Scheffler said. “I couldn’t get anything going but I take a lot of confidence out of this week. I got a ton of energy from the fans.”

While Horschel was thrilled with his first WGC title and his fourth top-10 finish in the wraparound 2020-21 season he was more excited for what his recent performance surge could mean in six months: his first berth at the Ryder Cup to be played at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin.

“The Ryder Cup has always been my No. 1 goal or at least in the top 5” he said. “I love playing for America. I’ve played in the Walker Cup and other events but never the Ryder Cup.

“I’ve always said I’d like to play the Ryder Cup when it’s in Europe because I love when people are pulling against me. I feed off of that.”

Horschel experienced some of that vibe here Sunday afternoon as the pro-Scheffler Texas crowd shouted “Chip it in the water Billy” and “roll it off the green.”

But after taking the lead with his only birdie on the par-4 fifth hole Horschel ran off six straight pars and held a 2-up lead. Scheffler never mounted a comeback much to the dismay of his vocal gallery.

Other than the Texas fans rooting him on every shot and the heckling of his Florida opponent Scheffler has plenty of experience in Austin professional golf.

The first came at age 11 at the Champions Tour's Kinkos Classic at the nearby Hills of Lakeway Course. Scheffler was randomly selected out of the crowd to hit a shot for D.A. Weibring’s group during a pro-am and knocked it closer than any professional or amateur in the crowd.

Scheffler a Dallas native and former U.S. Junior champion spent four stellar years at the University of Texas in Austin where he picked up multiple wins and All-America honors.

“Scottie is comfortable here. He knows the course and the people and his family is here. He is very comfortable among friends and family” said his dad Scott Scheffler who followed his son every hole this week along with his son’s wife Meredith.

No Texas alumnus has won the Match Play which has been played since 2015 in Austin though A&M fans will point out that Jeff Maggert won the inaugural 1999 edition at La Costa in southern California.

In the Sunday morning semifinals Horschel downed France’s Victor Perez 3 and 2 and Scheffler defeated two-time Match Play finalist Matt Kuchar 1 up.

Though Horschel was in control of his match for almost all 18 holes against Perez Scheffler survived back-to-back water balls on Nos. 12 and 13. He came to the 17th hole tied with Kuchar who had his own Texas connection with Dallas instructor Chris O’Connell following him.

Scheffler rolled in a 10-foot birdie putt on the 17th to take a one-hole lead and watched on 18 as Kuchar missed an 8½-foot putt which would have tied the match and sent it into extra holes.

In the third-place match Sunday afternoon Kuchar defeated Perez 2 and 1 after winning the first hole with a bogey and never trailing.

Former Florida Gators golfer Billy Horschel captured his first PGA Tour win since 2018 on Sunday winning the 2021 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play championship. In doing so Horschel boosted his resume significantly entering major season.

The victory the sixth of Horschel’s career on the PGA Tour netted him $1.8 million and shot him up 38 spots in the 2020-21 FedEx Cup standings to seventh behind defending Masters champion Dustin Johnson with just two weeks until the best golfers in the world take on Augusta National Golf Club.

“There was so much emotion so many turns of tides” Horschel said of his win Sunday in a conversation with Golf Channel. “I was just grinding it out. … It was a tough day.”

Horschel entered as the No. 32 player in the Dell Match Play but took down No. 53 Kevin Streelman No. 21 Tommy Fleetwood and No. 31 Victor Perez consecutively before winning 2&1 over No. 30 Scottie Scheffler on Sunday.

The win is Horschel’s first World Golf Championship and second straight top-two finish at a WGC event.

The 2014 FedEx Cup champion will now set his sights on the 2021 Masters beginning April 8. Horschel has never finished better than T17 at Augusta National. He placed T38 in the tournament this past November in a postponed event due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

In international circles and the energy industry there has been a consensus for a shift to solar energy as thermal and coal energies have not only proven to be costly but contribute to pollution.

Boateng’s solar factory Solar Power Solutions (SPS) was constructed in 2016 at the cost of $50 million and produces all manner of solar electronics. Offering solar-powered solutions it supplies and installs “off-grid and grid systems photovoltaic systems and PV street lights.” The Ghanaian business mogul says his solar company was born out of his vision to light up the country as the nation could no longer depend on hydro and other gas plants for energy.

Born to a paramount chief in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana Boateng said he saw his dreams and opportunity to make it in life right in Ghana.

For him traveling outside Ghana to seek greener pastures was not something he entertained. “I never thought of leaving Ghana it was something out of the equation for me” he said.

On why he decided to venture into solar energy he recalled traveling to his hometown in the Bono region and nearly hitting someone at a checkpoint because the place was dark due to lack of streetlight. “So I said to myself ‘why can’t we have lights around and then I remembered that the national grid cannot extend to those areas’” he told vlogger Wode Maya.

“So the concept of solar energy came to mind and that is how I started.” He added that he was also driven by his passion to ensure the rural areas of Ghana have light a basic social commodity in the 21st century.

Fortunately for Boateng the Ghana Cocoa Board also came up with a similar concept to start introducing solar street lights in cocoa-growing areas and shea nut catchment areas in the north of Ghana.

Initially Boateng imported his solar panels from China and other countries but with time he decided that it was time to have them produced locally and produced in such a way that it is suitable for Africa.

SPS is now managed by Boateng’s son Ofori who was raised in both Ghana and U.S. Ofori told Wode Maya that SPS’s solar panels are designed for Africa and made in Ghana. “We are trying to push [ourselves] into the arena of being one of the product developers within the electronics” he said adding that they seek to expand the factory to increase production capacity due to both local and international demands.

He indicated that the entire company’s capacity is 32 megawatts and will expand to hit 150 megawatts soon.

For young Africans outside the continent and other entrepreneurs Boateng has a message for you: “Don’t give up.” According to him hard work is a key ingredient to success in life. “And when you lay your hands on something you think you can do just go all out” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5NzE0MS9odW1ibGUtb25lLWVsZWN0cmljLXN1di1zb2xhci1yb29mL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5NzE0MS9odW1ibGUtb25lLWVsZWN0cmljLXN1di1zb2xhci1yb29mL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Humble Motors Unveils Electric Humble One SUV With Solar Roof,"Humble Motors a California-based startup founded in 2020 has announced an idea to introduce an electric SUV powered by sunlight - ""the world's first solar-powered SUVs"".

The company has released several images of a four-door five-seat crossover/SUV named Humble One which is expected to have a range of 500 miles (800 km). The press release says it will comfortably fit four people.

We assume that the range is mostly on battery power but according to Humble Motors thanks to the 82.35 square feet of highly efficient solar cells on the roof and windows the car will be able to replenish up to 60 miles (97 km) of range during the day.

Of course the standard AC and DC charging options will be available too.

Humble One Humble One

Replacing the glass roof with photovoltaic cells is not the only thing that is supposed to make the Humble One efficient. The others are lightweight and an aerodynamic shape.

According to the website the company accepts a fully refundable and non-binding reservation of $300 USD to secure a place in line. Production is expected to start in 2024 while customer deliveries might start in 2025.

The final price of the car will be $109000 (base version without options) excluding taxes. That's quite a lot - basically Tesla Lucid or Rivian price bracket (Compare EVs here).

An interesting thing is that the company said that has more than $20 million in reserved pre-orders:

""The Humble One has its fans -- it has more than $20 million in reserved pre-orders according to Alex Bogicevic Humble's engineering lead and a former executive for Ford. And its US reservations increased 426% last month at a time that other electric vehicle overall US sales only grew by 12%.""

Putting solar panels on the roof of an electric car might seem to make sense but in reality it may not be as efficient as you’d think.

As it turns out solar panels don’t generate power quite as quickly or easily as we might have hoped. YouTube’s The Tech of Tech put solar panels on the roof of his Tesla Model 3 to see exactly how much extra range he could get from the sun.

The system is a little janky and the host is the first to admit it. But it does give a rough idea of how much power a Model 3’s roof could gather if it were covered in solar panels something that Toyota has tested on the Prius Prime.

The host claims that panels are among the best on the market and although he needs some chunky equipment to trick the system into working it could be made much smaller if it were all integrated into the car.

After about an hour and a half of charging he gets 7 miles of extra charge. At the sun’s height Tech of Tech’s setup manages to recharge at the same rate as a standard wall socket. Others with different setups have found that it would take as many as 10 days to fully charge a Tesla.

That may not sound all that impressive but as power that’s just being generated passively it’s pretty cool. And seven miles could easily be the difference between calling a tow truck and getting to the nearest plug.

The host points out though his setup costs more than several tows so you probably aren’t going to run out to buy it any time soon. Moreover you’re constantly being forced to contend with shade from trees and buildings and clouds. In the end in something that uses as much power as a modern passenger car the power might be best spent on running auxiliaries.

The host does point out though that in something like the Aptera 3 a three-wheel EV which looks a bit like a solar racer it could generate as much as 40 miles a day. That could easily cover most of your daily commuting which makes solar panels look more interesting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL3NwYWNlL291bXVhbXVhLXBpZWNlLW9mLW5pdHJvZ2VuLWljZS1mcm9tLXBsdXRvLWxpa2UtZXhvcGxhbmV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is 'Oumuamua a frozen piece of an exoPluto? - Space,"?

The discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 ignited a firestorm of debate that continues today. From the shape of its orbit astronomers knew it was the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system. But the unusual object wasn’t like any asteroid or comet seen in our solar system. So … what was it? Numerous theories have been proposed to explain it. Its weirdness even prompted some to suggest it might be artificial a spacecraft or other piece of alien technology passing through our solar system. In mid-March 2021 two scientists said they’ve solved the mystery. They said ‘Oumuamua is a remnant of a Pluto-like planet – once part of another solar system – now drifting through space.

Steven Desch and Alan Jackson – both of Arizona State University – published their peer-reviewed findings in two new papers part I and part II in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets on March 16 2021.

From the first paper:

1I/‘Oumuamua is very strange and it is hard to explain where it came from. We looked at several different ices and the push they would give ‘Oumuamua as they evaporated. We found that the best ice is nitrogen (N2) which would explain many of the things we know about it. ‘Oumuamua was small about half as long as a city block and only as thick as a three-story building but it was very shiny. The shininess is about the same as the surfaces of Pluto and Triton which are also covered in nitrogen ice. We suggest ‘Oumuamua was probably thrown out of a young star system about half a billion years ago. Bodies like ‘Oumuamua may allow us to see what the surfaces of a so far unknown type of exoplanet ‘exo-Plutos’ are made of … We show that orbital instabilities in which giant planets move around as happened in our own outer solar system 4 billion years ago could make and throw out large numbers of small pieces of nitrogen ice like ‘Oumuamua. ‘Oumuamua may be the first piece of an exoplanet brought to us.

‘Oumuamua was similar to comets in some ways yet notably different in others. As Desch said in a statement:

In many ways ‘Oumuamua resembled a comet but it was peculiar enough in several ways that mystery surrounded its nature and speculation ran rampant about what it was.

The odd characteristics of the object such as entering the solar system slower than would be expected but exiting faster than a typical comet would do made it difficult to explain ‘Oumuamua as an ordinary comet. There was no tail of gas seen when the object was closest to the sun. Updated analysis of the data also seemed to indicate it was more pancake-shaped than cigar-like as had first been thought.

Desch and Jackson came up with a new proposal to explain the unusual features of ‘Oumuamua: it was an object composed of different ices. They calculated how fast those ices would sublimate when ‘Oumuamua was closest to the sun. Then they could estimate the mass shape speed and reflectivity of the object as it started to move out of the solar system again.

The researchers found that one type of ice in particular nitrogen ice could explain the anomalies observed. It’s already known that it can exist on rocky bodies since it is abundant on the surface of Pluto. Desch said:

That was an exciting moment for us. We realized that a chunk of ice would be much more reflective than people were assuming which meant it could be smaller. The same rocket effect would then give ‘Oumuamua a bigger push bigger than comets usually experience.

Jackson added:

We knew we had hit on the right idea when we completed the calculation for what albedo (how reflective the body is) would make the motion of ‘Oumuamua match the observations. That value came out as being the same as we observe on the surface of Pluto or Triton bodies covered in nitrogen ice.

So could ‘Oumuamua really be a leftover fragment of a world something like Pluto rich in nitrogen ice?

To help answer that the researchers calculated how quickly similar chunks might have been knocked off Pluto and similar bodies in the early solar system. They also needed to know what the chances were of similar chunks reaching us from other solar systems. Was it common or rare? They concluded that the object was most likely knocked off the original larger body about half a billion years ago and nitrogen ice would also explain its shape. According to Jackson:

It was likely knocked off the surface by an impact about half a billion years ago and thrown out of its parent system. Being made of frozen nitrogen also explains the unusual shape of ‘Oumuamua. As the outer layers of nitrogen ice evaporated the shape of the body would have become progressively more flattened just like a bar of soap does as the outer layers get rubbed off through use.

In this scenario ‘Oumuamua was like a comet in that it was icy with some of that ice sublimating near the sun but it was composed of ice not seen in comets in our solar system. As Desch commented:

This research is exciting in that we’ve probably resolved the mystery of what ‘Oumuamua is and we can reasonably identify it as a chunk of an ‘exo-Pluto’ a Pluto-like planet in another solar system. Until now we’ve had no way to know if other solar systems have Pluto-like planets but now we have seen a chunk of one pass by Earth.

Previous theories about ‘Oumuamua have included it being a fragment of a super-Earth exoplanet a cosmic dust bunny and of course the highly debated alien lightsail.

Like other scientists Desch and Jackson now hope that other similar objects will be found in the future as Jackson noted:

It’s hoped that in a decade or so we can acquire statistics on what sorts of objects pass through the solar system and if nitrogen ice chunks are rare or as common as we’ve calculated. Either way we should be able to learn a lot about other solar systems and whether they underwent the same sorts of collisional histories that ours did.

Unfortunately observations of ‘Oumuamua at the time were limited since it was already leaving the solar system when astronomers first spotted it. But scientists say that objects like ‘Oumuamua passing through our solar system should be fairly common so hopefully more objects like it will be found that can be studied in more detail.

Bottom line: A new theory about ‘Oumuamua says the weird object was a pancake-shaped chunk of nitrogen ice a remnant of a Pluto-like world from another solar system.

Coming off a strong comeback win against the Washington Wizards the New York Knicks (23-22) will visit the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee looking to prove themselves against one of the Eastern Conference’s elites.

The Bucks (29-15) currently have the ninth-ranked defense and sixth-best offense Cleaning the Glass but during the trade deadline they added P.J. Tucker giving an elite defense one of the best switching bigs in the league.

What’s even scarier is that Tucker has been the sole big-man defender with the Houston Rockets in their recent playoff runs. Now he can take a backseat next to Giannis Antetokounmpo or Brook Lopez and use his defensive intelligence elsewhere.

It’ll be a stark contrast to playing the Wizards one of the worst defensive teams in the league with little-to-no great individual defenders.

How will some of what worked for the Knicks’ last game go this time?

IMMANUEL QUICKLEY FOR THREE AND THE LEAD 🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/8pPqZYidww — The Knicks Wall (@TheKnicksWall) March 26 2021

Instead of Alex Len or Brook’s twin brother Robin Lopez hanging around the free throw line while Bradley Beal or Russell Westbrook gets caught up on a screen it’ll now be a Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton getting over the screen forcing the ball handler into a Tucker hedge or Brook Lopez as he waits for the defender to force his man to the rim.

But it could work in their favor. The Knicks take the seventh-most attempts from the mid-range 35.3% according to Cleaning the Glass understandable considering their personnel. The Bucks give up the third-highest amount of attempts from that area.

How will R.J. Barrett Julius Randle and any of the Knicks’ guards react when forced into a shot they’ve been happy to take this season? We’ll see.

Speaking of Barrett he’s been on a bit of a tear lately averaging 21 points on 49-34-74 shooting splits in March.

In his last matchup against the Bucks on March 11th he failed to make a meaningful impact as the team got blown out by 33 points.

Sprinkle in a healthy dose of confidence and a team rolling after the All-Star break there’s reason to believe Barrett can keep his hot streak going and even do it against some of the best in the league.

The big takeaway from the last game was the play of the bench with Alec Burks and Immanuel Quickley bombing some shots off the bench with a +17 and +14 respectively. It’ll be harder for them to get that done this game with the Bucks’ elite defense and individual personnel but hopefully we’ll still see the shots going up.

If New York wins it’ll be because their starters played well with Randle bouncing back from his 13-point performance last time and Barrett keeping on rolling. It’s usually a safe bet to pick Milwaukee and trust their defense but if they’re going to lose it’s after a loss on a back-to-back after falling to Boston last night. Perfect conditions to see New York jump two games ahead of .500.

The Board of Regents first approved plans for the $75 million building in September 2016. Engineering senior Ben Manley co-founder of Michigan Robotic Submarine told The Michigan Daily he is happy the University is investing in and showing a commitment to robotics especially as it becomes an increasingly important field.

“As a leader in a robotics-oriented student org it definitely makes me and probably other people in robotics pretty happy to know that the University is investing in robotics because obviously it’s an important part of engineering” Manley said. “It’s cool to see that some of the work that a lot of us think is so cool is becoming a focus of the college enough to the point that they literally made a building just for it.”

The building hosts new classrooms offices lab space and includes a three-story fly zone for autonomous aerial vehicles. Damen Provost managing director of the University’s Robotics Institute told The Daily the building was designed to encourage collaboration.

“The College of Engineering is really committed to breaking down these barriers for collaboration and the robotics building was designed for collaboration” Provost said. “The labs are all shared the people are all mixed in from different departments. So it’s a big long-term investment from the college to really break down the silos.”

Engineering senior David Baek president of the Michigan Mars Rover Team a student organization dedicated to building rovers for extraterrestrial land told The Daily the new facilities will give his organization a large advantage over other school teams they compete against.

“In previous years we would do a lot of rough filming (of our Mars rover) at the Baja (racecar) test track… It’s just kind of a rocky muddy terrain with hills that we used to drive on” Baek said. “I don’t believe any other school has a similar Mars yard that is this close to (their own) campus.”

The classrooms in the new building were designed to reach audiences outside the University by allowing classes to be taught both online and in person. Robotics 101 a class designed to make robotics more equitable was taught by U-M faculty both in person and online for U-M students in Fall 2020 and is also being virtually taught for students at Morehouse College and Spelman College two historically Black colleges in Atlanta.

Jessy Grizzle director of the Robotics Institute and professor in the College of Engineering told The Daily that Robotics 101 aims to reinvent how engineering is taught. The course is different from other engineering courses because it does not require students to know calculus which is not available in all high schools.

“Our fundamental premise when we built the course was that talent is uniformly distributed but opportunity is not” Grizzle said. “We are able to design projects to replace exams that were quite challenging but then make the mathematics grow out of one’s knowledge from high school algebra. In the end they were working at the same level as Math 214 with the computational skills that were higher than what they would be getting in Engineering 101 for example so the students got to see how real engineers use mathematics.”

Ford is leasing the building’s top floor to the University to perform robotics research in conjunction with U-M researchers. This is the first time Ford will have a research facility in an academic building or on a university campus. Grizzle said having Ford engineers working in the building will bring different aspects of robotics to the University.

“(We) are very used to working with our colleagues at Ford. They’re highly skilled engineers they’re a little bit more on the practical side maybe than the academics but that mixture is very empowering” Grizzle said. “It’s just going to add more diversity of thought to the broad range of research projects that we conduct in the institute — we’re very excited for that.”

Grizzle also said having Ford engineers working in the building will provide new opportunities for students. He said this will be particularly helpful for graduate students who are required to take a three-credit research experience to graduate.

“Students don’t have to have an internship at Ford to work with a Ford engineer now because we’re going to have them up on the fourth floor” Grizzle said. “Some of our PhD students… who want academia may want a more applied bent to the particular kinds of research and the fact that we can have a Ford member on a PhD committee will be just amazing.”

The new building is located in the northeast corner of North Campus near the Wilson Student Team Project Center about one mile from the bus stop that connects to Central Campus.

“North Campus is going to be growing” Manley said. “The bus routes better be growing with it.”

“I got very close in the initial search and soon after we published the first article I got a tip with a key piece of information that led me to find the truck minutes later” Holderith wrote in an email to FreightWaves. “It was months before we actually managed to get the owner to speak with us however.”

History of ‘Big Red’

Big Red was born from a turbine truck war between automotive giants Ford and General Motors in the late 1940s. Ford won the race after creating the massive red prototype.

According to The Drive the 13-foot-tall 96-foot-long vehicle had a gross weight of 180000 pounds. The company unveiled the beast at the 1964 World’s Fair next to the brand new Ford Mustang.

Youtube: PeriscopeFilms

With a 600-horsepower engine called the 705 the fully functional vehicle could haul double trailers at 70 miles per hour. But it never went into production — due to technological limitations — leaving the prototype as the only one ever built.

The investigation to find the owner

The hunt for this national treasure was not an easy task and Holderith used the power of the internet to find the anonymous owner of the vehicle.





Going into the investigation Holderith had documentation of Big Red’s whereabouts up to 1970 when the rig was bought by Holman Moody a race team sponsored by Ford. The team drove it from a Ford facility in Michigan to Charlotte where it was stored in a hangar at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport until 1978.

According to Holderith’s article the truck was then sold to an anonymous buyer in the late 1970s as Holman Moody ended its partnership with Ford and sold everything in the hanger in a giant inventory sale.

With this information Holderith turned to the internet for help. In a Youtube video comment section a man claimed to know a man named Mr. Richardson who owned the truck. The Youtube commenter who Holderith called Dan claimed that he delivered material to Richardson in the early 1980s which was used to build a storage facility for Big Red and the owner allowed him to drive the vehicle.

“I drove the tractor only — they never had the trailers — for a couple of miles around the neighborhood. At the time it was powered by a VT-903 Cummings [V8]” Dan told Holderith in an interview. “It was residential streets and there were no tags on the tractor. I drove very conservatively as he and I discussed what the gas turbine must have been like.”

Dan did not give Holderith any more information on the vehicle’s current owner forcing him to continue his search.

In January of 2020 he found an anonymous lead named Tim who posted on a Mack Truck forum that in 1985 he helped repaint Big Red with a new color scheme blue and white. Tim also let him know that the owner had moved and he was not sure of his whereabouts and did not release his name Holderith recounted.

Finally Holderith found a post on bigmacktrucks.com from 2013 from a man who claimed to be the current owner. The account name John Eugene Richardsons had not logged back on since February 2019. Holderith also found a man who claimed to be the owner’s brother in a 2014 Flickr comment. But he never heard back after sending an email to the address on the profile.

The discovery of the mystery owner





On Wednesday in an article on The Drive Holderith announced that he had found the owner and confirmed that the truck still exists and is still functional.

The original engine was replaced with a 707 engine and the rumor of the new paint scheme was false.

“I spent a lot of time and money getting the right color and paint process to match the original Ford color” the owner told Holderith. “The color is a dark red candied metallic. The silver is candied metallic also.”

Today the truck is in near-perfect condition but the whereabouts are still unknown. The owner is aware of the rarity and knows that releasing this information could lead to unwanted visitors at its location.

Holderith told FreightWaves that the search was not completely over.

“It was great to finally share my findings with the world but there is more to come” he said. “We’re still receiving more information and new pictures are a must for us. We hope to publish a follow-up soon.”

Ford plans to start making high-volume aluminum parts in the not-too-distant future using ExOne’s aluminum binder jet printing process.

Unfortunately Ford cannot tell us yet exactly what these first parts will be because the company considers this new capability a technical advantage that it doesn’t want to disclose to rivals too soon said Ford’s technical lead for additive manufacturing Harold Sears.

Sears describes the parts as “tissue box-sized” and says he’ll produce them in an initial volume of about 200000 parts per year. At this scale the ExOne printer can create numerous parts per batch which is one of the aspects that makes binder printing fast enough for production.

Identifying candidate parts involves a process of analyzing the parts Ford uses today said Sears. “It is taking a look at what is metal in a vehicle today. Does it fit the size criteria? What is special about that part? Is it part of a sub-assembly that we can cut down from 20 parts to two parts?”

At the same time Ford looks for small parts that it can nest among the primary part in the printer getting still more production at the same time. It is like a communications satellite carrying bundles of cube sats along for the ride to orbit.

“We still have empty space in the build box” Sears observed. “Are there other parts that can come along for free?”

The imminent arrival of volume production from a 3D printer may seem surprising to those familiar with the tediously slow processes commonly employed. The difference here is the use of binder jet printing which lends itself to higher-speed work.

“When we’re talking about binder jetting what we’re really talking about is the fastest most production-ready form of 3D printing in the world” touted ExOne Technical Fellow Dan Brunermer.

“The reason it is so fast the reason it is so production-ready is really simple” he continued. “Unlike those other forms of 3D printing where you’ve got a little tiny laser or a little tiny nozzle putting out small amounts of material we’ve got a big wide area print head depositing huge amounts of binder precisely where we need it according to the bit map we’ve generated. On a layer-by-layer basis there is absolutely nothing faster!”

The process works using a box of fine powder material precisely spraying the binder material where the material should stick together to create the part. In the case of the Ford part the material will be aluminum powder.

Once the part has been printed it needs to be sintered to make it a strong part rather than a pile of powder held together by binder glue. This process shrinks the part from the size that it emerged from the printer so designers have to take that into account ahead of time.

“The most important thing to know is that when you eventually sinter your part it is going to shrink” said Brunermer. “And you’re going to need to scale your parts up by about 20 percent to adjust for that.”

The precise correction factor is 19 percent in the X and Y axes and 21 percent in the Z axis. ExOne promises less than 1 percent dimensional tolerance of the final parts with tuning to the process.

“This is a breakthrough in making 3D printed and sintered parts for the auto industry” concluded Sears. “While the 3D-printing process is very different than stamping body panels we understand the behavior of aluminum better today as well as its value in light-weighting vehicles. High-speed aluminum 3D printing paves the way for other opportunities that we’re just now starting to take a look at because of the ability to do complex parts with aluminum that previously weren’t possible. It’s really opening doors for other opportunities.”

Ford bought its first ExOne 3D printers in the early 2000s for creating sand molds and cores for metal casting. Making the parts needed to make parts has been a common application for 3D printers in the manufacturing process but now Ford is starting to eliminate a step so it can directly print the final production part that goes on customers’ cars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZm9yZHMtdG9wLWV4ZWNzLWdhbWUtcGxhbi1mdXR1cmUtc3RyYXRlZ3ktZWxlY3RyaWMtYWdlLTIwMjEtM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Ford's Top Execs Plan to Compete in the Electric Age,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Jim Farley thinks the Ford Motor Company's best days are ahead of it. That may sound predictable but when you're dealing with a 117-year-old company founded by a man whose name is still on almost every building the carmaker owns and vehicle it produces it smacks of ambition.

When Farley became its chief executive late last year after the bumpy three-year reign of Jim Hackett he wasted no time in laying out his plan for the No. 2 US automaker's ongoing revival. That starts by continuing to guide an $11 billion effort entering its final stages.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The next marquee step is to unlock value in Ford's wide range of businesses which include everything from famed pickup-truck brands to new high-performance electric vehicles commercial vans luxury SUVs financing operations and big data.

Farley is Ford's fourth CEO since the financial crisis but anyone who thought he'd continue the upheaval by dismissing Hackett's management team would have been mistaken. Instead Farley has opted for continuity with a refocusing of roles.

Of Farley's top lieutenants only one chief marketing officer Suzy Deering is a newcomer having joined last fall. Other key members of the leadership team have spent decades at Ford. Kumar Galhotra president of the Americas and international markets group joined in 1988. Hau Thai-Tang chief product platform and operations officer came to the Blue Oval the same year. The president of Ford's luxury Lincoln brand Joy Falotico entered the Ford family in 1989.

Their collective task is daunting. After an initially robust recovery following the financial crisis the carmaker faltered under CEO Mark Fields and Hackett his successor. Its stock price lagged behind the broader markets and Ford missed profit predictions. Confronted by the pandemic the automaker saw its credit rating cut below investment grade and suspended its generous dividend.

Meanwhile Tesla roared past Ford in market capitalization despite selling a comparatively paltry number of cars. To Ford and the Ford family whose members continue to depend on the company's stock and influence leadership Tesla's breakout didn't make sense. The best-selling vehicles in the US since 1982 were the Ford F-Series pickup trucks. Ford had posted a nearly uninterrupted string of profitable quarters since 2010 and the company had over $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Every year it sold over 5 million vehicles worldwide while after two decades of ramping up Tesla was selling just 500000.

For Farley and his team the mission is to unlock the immense value trapped in Ford and its legacy businesses while using the substantial profits from those efforts to fund a shift to electrification and services built around the enormous amount of data that vehicles generate.

If they can pull it off the stock price might reverse a 10-year trend of being behind the markets — and even catch up with Tesla's sky-high valuation.

We talked to the key members of Farley's leadership team about how it's all going to come together.

Farley's fresh grounded perspective

Farley has deep roots in the company: His grandfather worked on the Model T assembly line.

Still ""he's not a lifelong Ford person"" operations head Thai-Tang said in an interview with Insider alluding to Farley's move from Toyota in 2007. Farley developed a reputation for being a hard charger at Toyota and later Lexus and when he arrived at Ford he practically declared war on crosstown Detroit rival General Motors.

Thai-Tang who at one point oversaw the pressure-cooker launch of a new Mustang lauded Farley for being a classic ""car guy"" who also has a thorough understanding of the business. (Farley is a racing enthusiast.) He also credited Farley for learning from Hackett a disciple of ""design thinking"" whom observers saw as the antithesis of a hard-charging cigar-chomping auto exec in the Lee Iacocca vein.

""[Hackett] forced us to lift our gaze and recognize the disruption that was happening"" Thai-Tang said. ""Jim Farley to his credit has kept those things and given us a compelling plan to rally around.""

From the day Farley was named as CEO in October it was clear he wasn't going to drag his feet. ""Jim is very biased toward action"" Thai-Tang said. ""And he's placing a strong emphasis on modernizing how we work.""

Noting that Ford's product pipeline is full of exciting new vehicles — ranging from an all-new F-150 pickup to the Bronco SUV the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and even the electric version of the company's market-leading Transit commercial van — Thai-Tang said that he was more optimistic than he's been at any time in his tenure at the company.

Success has to be bigger than the CEO too. ""Jim is set on creating the company's plan not Jim Farley's plan"" Thai-Tang added. ""We all have to own it and he's been clear about that.""

If Hackett wanted Ford to get smarter then Farley's goal is for a smarter Ford to move faster.

""The urgency has been triggered by our nontraditional competitors"" Thai-Tang said. ""They don't have legacy issues to hold them back and Jim is using that as a catalyst.""

Farley's motivational message for the entire company is to ""compete like a challenger"" and to do that Thai-Tang said the carmaker has to take more risks. ""We're making decisions based on knowing 80% rather than trying to get to 95%.""

Beyond that ""there's less organizational hubris"" he said. ""We can learn from everybody.""

Making Ford much much faster

Kumar Galhotra turned Lincoln around. Ford

The clear theme that emerged when discussing how Farley would finally get the company to the 10%-plus profits margins that Wall Street has been demanding for a decade but not getting is that the mission now has to be a faster Ford.

""We're moving very quickly and being extremely decisive"" Kumar Galhotra who oversees all global sales said in an interview with Insider. ""We need to do disruptive things and we need to turn around our business.""\

Galhotra is a turnaround specialist. He took Lincoln which the company had considered killing after the financial crisis and revived it putting it back on the luxury map with vehicles that could stand wheels to wheels against Mercedes BMW Audi and Lexus.

A big turnaround is made up of many smaller ones. For Ford the spectacular strength of the F-Series has led some analysts to value it more highly on its own than the entire parent company. That pays the bills but Ford now needs to push other products to the forefront. In 2021 it's committed far more decisively to an electrification strategy pledging to invest $30 billion more even than historic rival GM which is putting $27 billion into its effort.

Farley also wants Ford to realize the potential of the monumental amount of data generated by its vehicles especially on the commercial side. Here electrification also plays a critical role.

""There's tremendous value in commercial vehicles both in the US and globally"" Galhotra said echoing Farley's point of view on the topic. ""And with electrification and more importantly with connectivity we have the ability to offer broader services.""

In an interview with Insider Farley said that because Ford controls such a big chunk of the commercial business that it's a logical place to look for wins.

""There's so much we can do to transform the customer experience"" he said noting that analytics could predict when a vehicle might fail or provide coaching for drivers so that they could more efficiently manage their routes. Those tips could arrive in real time through the E-Transit's infotainment system.

Customers could monitor their E-Transit fleets around the clock managing recharging cycles and adjusting for example the cabin-climate controls to optimize battery performance. They could track vehicle locations using telematics and even figure out how to reimburse drivers who cover their own recharging costs.

""We're well positioned with the dominant market share we have"" Farley said. ""This is not an easy business to get into.""

According to Galhotra vehicles such as the Bronco designed around a wide variety of outdoor adventures also present opportunities for Ford to make money on accessories rather than leaving that business over to third-party providers. He said that the Bronco family — a two-door four-door and a sport crossover — had gone on sale with 150 accessories available.

Farley is also taking a page from crosstown rival GM's playbook which has CEO Mary Barra shedding underperforming operations. In 2021 Ford decided to end production in Brazil where it had been in business since 1919 and it scuppered a joint venture with India's Mahindra. Galhotra called these moves ""very decisive.""

Ford can now reallocate funds to attack 21st-century opportunities rather than bolstering 20th-century legacies.

""The plan has shifted significantly to invest more in battery electric vehicles and to invest in connectivity"" Galhotra said. ""The first step is having clarity on what we're going to build. Once you have that senior leadership has to be deeply engaged.""

Telling an ambitious new Ford story

Compared with her colleagues Suzy Deering Ford's chief marketing officer is a newbie. She joined the company just last year following stints at Verizon and eBay.

""Did I have doubts? Absolutely"" she told Insider.

But Farley and Ford's leadership which goes all the way up to chairman Bill Ford the great-grandson of Henry convinced her that the company was prepared to break with its past.

""If the CMO's role is just to put a story into the market to dust it off that's not me"" she said. ""I want to be really disruptive.""

She posed two questions to both Jim Hackett and Jim Farley when she was interviewing last year: Were they clear on what they wanted? And did they understand what it would take to get there?

Like other top Ford executives — including Farley — Deering credited Hackett with establishing a new tenor for the carmaker. ""He put structure and discipline into the organization and built a new way of thinking to enable Jim Farley to unleash his plan"" she said.

Deering sees her role as taking a redesigned faster-moving Ford to the public. To borrow a phrase from Hackett now that Ford has spent the better part of $11 billion getting fit it's time to enter the global competition for customers in a more aggressive but not arrogant way.

""Creating desire is very different from asking a customer what they want"" she said. She emphasized a careful consideration of what kinds of desire Ford hopes to engender in consumers stressing that it has to have a human element echoing a Hackett-esque preoccupation with vehicle designs that put actual human beings at the center of the experience.

""It's not an assembly line"" she said. ""We have to get to where customers have a desire for products they can't live without.""

The legend of CEO Alan Mulally saving Ford from disaster in 2009 continues to resonate but the company has been criticized as being behind rivals and leaning heavily on its pickup and SUV business in North America to make up for weakness in other markets and a take-it-slow approach to electrification and self-driving technology.

That's an incomplete story. Along with a $30 billion EV investment that was recently announced Ford has taken a stake in Rivian an electric startup also backed by Amazon partnered with Volkswagen on EV development and showcased an all-electric version of its F-150 pickup.

The pandemic brought a new urgency to the carmaker as it joined with General Electric to quickly manufacture ventilators and repurposed some production to make masks face shields and ventilators. And its alliance with Argo AI — Ford is both an investor in and customer of the self-driving startup — means that it has the talent to take on Alphabet's Waymo and GM's Cruise in autonomous vehicles. (Ford put $1 billion into Argo AI in 2017 with Volkswagen kicking in $2.6 billion in 2019.)

Through 2020 the carmaker also maintained a robust launch schedule rolling out the revamped F-Series the Bronco the Mach-E and the E-Transit with Bronco racking up well over 100000 deposits and the Mach-E posting strong initial sales closing in on 4000 units in February and giving Tesla something to think about.

Ford's full-year profit at $3.6 billion was its lowest in three years but given that it lost two months of global production last year and had to manage launch costs for numerous vehicles the figure was cause for celebration. Investors also began to see Ford's stock as a bargain bidding it up 45% in the first quarter of this year after hammering it in 2020. Phase one of Farley's game plan has put several points on the board but Wall Street continues to worry that Ford could lose momentum as it has in the past.

In the end of course Ford is a family business. And Farley and his leadership team have the family behind them — both the members whose name is on the buildings and the nearly 200000 employees worldwide who make up the extended clan.

""There's a ton of optimism at all levels of the company"" Galhotra said. ""Products like the Mach-E have really uplifted the mood. We can compete with anybody."""

This growth Redfin says may be a result of working from home which effectively allows a majority of homebuyers to prioritize factors such as affordability and living near family and friends rather than what's closer to their office.

The majority of users were looking to escape from expensive metro areas including New York San Francisco Los Angeles Washington D.C. and Seattle. However January and February had the biggest net outflows in those areas which is a measure of how many more Redfin.com home searchers looked to leave a metro than move in.

More specifically the net outflow of users from New York San Francisco and Los Angeles ""increased significantly"" compared to a year ago according to the report.

Meanwhile Redfin data show that net outflow more than doubled in Washington D.C. and Seattle.

Rather than footing the bill for these traditionally expensive locations users are looking for more affordable housing options close by.

For instance Philadelphia became the most popular destination for people leaving the New York metro according to the report. In February the average home sold in Philadelphia was about $238000 compared to $590000 in the New York metro.

Likewise people looking to leave San Francisco had their eye on home nearby Sacramento. The typical home in Sacramento sold for $490000 in February. Los Angeles residents on the other hand had their eye on San Diego where the typical home sold for $685000.

The numbers have increased despite vaccines being rolled out across the county and local governments begin to ease restrictions and reopen the economy.

The surge in ETF investment is beginning to spark concerns that retail investors will not be able to differentiate between exchange traded funds that own securities which are easy to trade and those that have illiquid holdings.

The fear is that some funds particularly those that have narrow investment objectives can amass very large holdings in companies that are barely traded.

“If you hold an ETF that has illiquid securities then your selling price might be far lower than expected if you’re part of a wave of selling” said Elisabeth Kashner director of ETF research and analytics at FactSet which has developed a methodology that can flag ETFs that are a cause for concern.

The underlying illiquidity is not easy for an ordinary investor to spot because of the way that ETFs operate. When ETF shareholders place a sell order it is down to authorised participants the specialised trading companies or investment banks that create and redeem ETF shares to sell the underlying holdings. In other words ETF investors might never know if there had been problems being able to perform the trades.

FactSet measures how much trading in an ETF’s underlying stocks would be required if investors were to sell enough shares to prompt the redemption of 5 per cent of assets under management. For example if investors sold shares in iShares Global Clean Energy ETF that drove redemptions to 5 per cent of AUM the necessary portfolio trades would equal 36.44 per cent of their recent median trading volumes. A high underlying volume per unit figure indicates an adverse price impact is more likely particularly with funds that hold outsized positions in less liquid markets.

The data provider has identified potential problems with some ETFs tracking silver miners rare earths cannabis and renewable energy as well as pockets of problems in other sectors.

“Narrower funds especially those with relatively few constituents — such as the ones flagged in the metals and mining silver and nuclear and renewable energy sectors — may present larger challenges in finding willing buyers for their portfolio securities. Likewise APs may have fewer options for hedging these specialised portfolios” said Kashner.

The issue has also been picked up in a report published earlier this month by Goldman Sachs.

“Non-market cap weighted ETFs now comprise over 10 per cent of total equity ETFs” said Goldman in its report. “In our view this increases the need for investors to understand underlying exposures as there may be larger mismatches with underlying size and liquidity which can then lead to flow-driven distortions.”

Jessica Binder Graham co-head of European equity research at Goldman Sachs said the analysis was intended to highlight when ETFs had overweight positions in particular companies.

One example she said was Leggett & Platt which is one of the smallest 10 companies in the S&P 500 but the 20th largest holding of the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) an $18bn fund which is weighted by yield.

While institutional investors can rely on research such as FactSet’s to flag potential problems retail investors can be at a disadvantage in terms of information and might not understand potential risks.

The scarcity of buyers for the underlying constituents of some ETFs has already caused some problems in the market according to one industry executive who asked to remain anonymous. “It could put pressure on some APs — it’s definitely a lot more than you think” she said.

Experts agree that during a broad sell-off it is normal that investors should expect the value of their holdings to fall. The problem for some ETFs with concentrated positions in thinly traded markets is that a large redemption magnifies downward price pressure on its underlying stocks.

The solution is to do more homework said Anita Rausch head of capital markets at WisdomTree an ETF provider.

“What I think retail investors or any investor for that matter needs to understand is the price/value of what they are buying relative to the fundamental value of the underlying constituents” she said advising investors to do their homework on fundamentals such as price earnings valuations and price-to-book ratios.

That would be a start but would not compete with the level of scrutiny carried out by industry participants.

Dina Ting head of global index portfolio management at Franklin Templeton said the asset manager monitored the proportion of average daily volume of each underlying security an ETF would account for at different levels of assets under management as well as the percentage of free-float stock it would account for.

“Generally we would look for less than 15 per cent of the portfolio to have more than 5 per cent of average trading volume as a starting floor for capacity analysis” she added.

She said average daily volume data was available on retail brokerage order entry systems but she conceded that individual investors would not readily be able to access the additional data that companies such as Franklin Templeton rely on.

Given that some information is hard to come by it could be wise to simply take a step back and as Rausch said “learn how to spot bubbles”. Then it might be possible to avoid the crush at the exits should a wave of selling hit the market.

“Retail investors might think they’re going after a hot new area of the market but [with thematic ETFs] they are also taking a narrow view and with all due respect if there’s an ETF for it they are not the first ones there” said Peter Sleep senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management.

Is it right that you were taught by your mum Christine as an 11-year-old?

JM: I don’t know if I would say taught. I would maybe say dragged up to the golf course to play with her because she had nobody else to play with (laughing). I eventually didn’t mind that and the first person who taught me was Bob Collinson who was the head pro at Windyhill.

So when did you think you could be destined for a career in the game?JM: You know it’s funny you should ask that as I remember the Coca-Cola Schools’ Tournament and I remember being on a bus with Andrew Coltart of all people. I was probably 15 or 16 at the time and it was the first adventure that made me think I could do this as a profession.

Before that happened though you worked in Greaves Sports in Glasgow and also a nightclub as well?

JM: Yes correct on both counts and I also worked at a Safeway all of which was at a time when I was trying to support my amateur golf addiction.

How difficult was it trying to make headway at that time as you combined practising and playing with those jobs?

JM: It was a different time back then. Now everybody is so focused on their mental coach their strength coach their nutritionist. We just played golf and just played as hard as you could to try and win. It wasn’t hard because it was what I wanted to do.

You were due to college then your mum had a brain aneurysm. How difficult was that at the time?

JM: You know it was difficult. It happened a year or year and a half before I actually went to college. I knew at the time my dad John was retired and I knew that he had everything taken care of. I eventually went to college and as a result of that was able to help out my family a different way by giving both my mum and dad experiences they wouldn’t have had if I hadn’t gone to the States.

Your biggest individual success as an amateur was probably in the 1992 Scottish Women’s Championship beating Elaine Farquharson at Royal Aberdeen. What do you remember about that?

JM: I was kind of the young upstart I guess and was up against Elaine on her come course. It was a spark for better things to come.

You made two Curtis Cup appearances and beat the legendary Carol Semple Thompson in the final singles in 1994 to retain the trophy for GB&I. How special was that?

JM: It was wonderful. I still get goosebumps just thinking about it. You beat somebody down the last in the last last match with everybody watching and you hit it into a foot and you are given the putt. Something like that can either make or break you and for me it created a lifelong friendship between Carol and myself.

You made quite an impression during your stint at San Jose State University winning 12 collegiate events?

JM: I wasn’t exactly very academic having left school when I was 16. But after getting in there I took on the academic side as though it was my job as I wasn’t used to having much personal time to myself through working and playing amateur golf in Scotland. My mindset was that ‘okay I am here for golf but studying is my job’ because if I didn’t get the grades I needed I could have found myself being thrown out.

Twelve wins at any level is pretty impressive though wouldn’t you say?

JM: Mark Gale my old coach there was a retired aviation guy. He was a leader and he helped us become good players. That was one of his qualities whereas now I think it can be a case of ‘hey you are on my team and this is how you are going to play golf’. He wasn’t in the robotic mould and was the perfect match for me.

On the back of that success was turning pro in 1997 a no-brainer?

JM: To be honest I was probably ready in 1995. I had a very good friend through Franklin Templeton who ended up being one of my main sponsors. He said that there are certain things people can’t take away from you and said that would be the case if I got a degree. That was one of the best pieces of advice I have ever received. Did I ever do anything in psychology? No. But you know what it gave me a very good stepping stone before hitting the tour at 24 rather than 22.

In your first season on the LPGA you recorded three top-10s and finished second to Se Ri Pak in the Rookie of the Year race. It looked as though you felt at home straight away?

JM: My first year was very challenging and people don’t really understand that. I didn’t have a full card. I was a conditional player. I had to play in Monday qualifiers for just two spots and luckily I came through two in a row and was able to leap ahead. The whole year the hardest part was getting myself into a frame of mind where I knew I was going to be able to tee it up every week versus having to be there for a Monday qualifier starting at 8am.

You landed your breakthrough in the 2000 Shoprite LPGA Classic becoming just the second Scot after Kathryn Imrie to win on the circuit. How did that feel?

JM: It was phenomenal. Luckily I think I had a four-shot lead going down the last (laughing) because my knees were knocking and I hit it left then right down this par 5 before having a couple of putts to win it. That was an unbelievable feeling.

How did it feel to make your Solheim Cup debut on home soil at Loch Lomond in 2000?

JM: That whole event was just amazing. From Carin Koch holing the final putt the atmosphere and even the rain and mud which was unbelievable. In fact I think there are probably still a few shoes buried under the soil. That week and Loch Lomond has a special place in my heart for sure. It was tough for my mum and dad with all the crowds but it was great for them to be there and I am sure they would have been enjoying a whisky and beer - on me as usual (laughing) - in a tent somewhere that Sunday.

You were then controversially overlooked by Dale Reid for the 2002 Solheim Cup despite adding a second LPGA win by seven shots in the Asahi Ryokuken International Championship. How disappointing was that?

JM: I think my philosophy on that is that when you leave yourself in a position where you need a pick you can’t really grumble if you miss out. Dale picked what she thought was her best team and I don’t blame Dale for not picking me. Even at the time I felt that way. She had to pick the players she felt could do a job for her. Take what Catriona Matthew did for the 2019 match at Gleneagles. She picked Suzann Pettersen and that turned out to be one of the best picks in the event’s history. If she hadn’t played well Catriona would have been criticised but both of them came out of that event sitting at the top of the mountain.

You then rewarded Catrin Nilsmark for a captain’s pick in 2003 by picking up three-and-a-points including two wins with Catriona and a singles success at the top of the order. That must rank pretty high in your career achievements?

JM: My Solheim Cup record is very good. It’s not something you actually think about at the time but I definitely think the amount of match-play golf I played as an amateur certainly helped.

You also partnered Catriona in the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 2005 in South Africa. Was that another special memory?

JM: Yeah that was great. I really enjoy her company and I think she enjoys my company. When we played together we were both out there to do a job. She is so confident and so relaxed. Nothing bothers her and her demeanour is something I tried to replicate especially in my amateur days.

What did it mean to be part of Catriona’s backroom team for the 2019 Solheim Cup success at Gleneagles?

JM: I was the banana person (laughing). I was the gofer and to be honest I had no problems about that. Anne Van Dam had been on my Junior Solheim Cup when I was captain in 2013 so I sort of looked after her that week. It was a wonderful week and both Catriona and Suzann were phenomenal. You couldn’t have scripted it any better.

You were inducted into the National Golf Coaches Association (NGCA) Hall of Fame in 2004. When did your switch to a coaching career kick in?

JM: I never got into coaching as much as I would have liked to. Three years ago I had back surgery and as well as it being hard to swing a golf club it was also hard to stand and give lessons. Also having two boys - Craig a 14-year-old and 10-year-old Matt - keeps me busy.

What are you up to these days on the golf front?

JM: Catriona has asked me to be a helper again at the Solheim Cup. Like a lot of people the last year has been mostly sitting in the house learning to cook putting on some weight and taking off some weight. All of last year we were doing home schooling and I became a teacher never mind a golfer. Seventh grade maths don’t even talk to me about it as I don’t have a clue.

How long have you been in Cleveland Ohio?

JM: When Craig turned six this became our main base and he’s now 14 so the last eight years at least. We used to switch between the hot in Florida and cold here before then. I am getting married in June to my fiancée Rich Porter. We are the perfect “Brady Bunch” with five kids between us.

And there’s still enough of a Scottish accent there to remind people where you are from?

JM: Oh just get a few beers in me and it all comes out (laughing).

Tell us about the Janice Moodie Trophy and is it still taking place at Windyhill?

JM: I think so. It was a great little thing and it did well for a while on the SLGA junior circuit. Hopefully when I finally get home again I can see what is happening with it now.

From being dragged up to Windyhill as a youngster you went on to enjoy a great career. What does that mean to you?

JM: As you get older and heading towards the half century you look back and I am really at the point where I love being the person giving back and that I have the means and wherewithal where I can give back. If somebody wants to reach out to me for advice I have no problems giving it as I feel there have been so many people along the way who have given me their time or their help to let me get to where I am at. Renowned golf writer Lewine Mair for instance helped me get to college in the US. Those are the little stepping stones I will never forget and I am grateful for.

Is there anyone in particular you feel you have helped carve out a career in the game?

JM: Iona Stephen who is now doing some commentary work for Sky Sports was somebody who got in touch with me when I was ending my career through Kevin Craggs who was teaching Catriona Matthew at the time to see if I needed a caddie. I said ‘absolutely’ and she came up to me a few years ago and said ‘I can’t thank you enough as I had such a good time and that empowered me to stick with golf and be where I’m at now’. I was like ‘wow I felt that I hadn’t done anything’. But that meant a lot to me as it’s about being who you are being genuine with people and helping inspire people.

Part of a winning break of 32 riders De Gendt splintered away from the move some 40 kilometres from the finishing line with Slovenian Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious) then dropped Mohoric on the steepest part of the circuit with five kilometres to go.

He soloed home for his fifth stage win in the Volta a Catalunya confirming that the Catalan event is his favoured hunting ground for breakaways given Paris-Nice and the Tour with two stage victories apiece are the only other races where the Belgian has taken more than one stage win.

For Lotto Soudal De Gendt’s win rounds off an excellent week for the Belgian squad. That was thanks to their young Danish rider Andreas Kron taking the opening honours and race lead on day one in Calella and De Gendt 12 years his senior making it a Lotto Soudal ‘stage win sandwich’ on the final day at Montjuic.

“I always want to be in this race every year I’ve got two King of the Mountain titles here as well as the stage victories and it’s really special to win again in the centenary year and in a big city finish” De Gendt said afterwards.

“It was a very different victory to 2013 when I only attacked with four laps to go. This time I was in the big break and I knew I’d have to go for it because I was alone and every other team had two or three riders in there but I was surprised only Mohoric came with me.”

De Gendt explained that he had attacked on the last climb dropping Mohoric because every time the duo went round the seven-kilometre circuit Mohoric had gapped him on the downhill towards the finish.

“I knew that would happen again if I stayed with him until then and then I’d just get a second place. So when we came to the climb the last time I could feel his speed dropping a little and that’s why I went for it.”

De Gendt said the addition of the tougher climb up to Montjuic Castle with ramps of up to 18 per cent to the traditional circuit for the Volta A Catalunya was definitely beneficial for the race.

“This climb is a little bit harder and little bit longer and it opens it up more for attacks and breakaways. We did it in the 2012 Vuelta too I think” when as it happens another top Belgian racer Philippe Gilbert won. “All in all it's a good addition.”

As so often happens in the Volta once the 2021 race left the Pyrenees mid-way through the main interest centered on the stage wins and this year thanks to Lennard Kämna (Bora-Hansgrohe) Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) and De Gendt made for a vintage series of battles for victory each day.

But whereas neither Kämna and Sagan have won before in the Volta a Catalunya De Gendt has racked up victories in 2013 2016 2018 and 2019 prior to this year.

“I really like the race routes here here and with the time trial” - a first since 2007 - “that made it more special this year. Also because it was the 100th edition I wanted to be here at the start too” De Gendt said. “But I definitely want to come back in 2022 as well.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond Singapore governments CIOs and other tech leaders in the ASEAN region are responding to the challenges of climate change and what kind of technologies can help in this fight.

While broad national policies and targets around sustainability are already in place in several countries such as Thailand and Malaysia their impact on IT strategies and investments still varies across the region Oostveen said. “At the moment having the right Infrastructure and talent still remain major concerns for businesses. However conversations have already begun and more enterprises are looking at adopting a greener digitalisation footprint as sustainability objectives become more aligned with business goals. For instance Indonesia and Vietnam have both ventured into building their first green data centres with more in the pipeline.”

For ASEAN manufacturers IDC’s 2020 supply chain survey revealed that sustainability is the No. 2 focus area for risk mitigation in ASEAN supply chains behind overall supply chain visibility. “This was further emphasized in our most recent COVID-19 impact survey which indicated that 53% of companies overall are spending between 10% and 30% on sustainable products and services related to IT” Krishnan said.

IDC believes two perspectives are driving this trend: efficient resource usage that reduces costs for the business and market pressure from suppliers customers and stakeholders.

Data and analytics could help organisations address the sustainability question. “The focus on sustainability across manufacturing businesses is based on having data across all processes. And when organizations have data they can manage the processes” Krishnan said. “This results in the ability to manage efficiency programmes that ensure effective resource usage and sustainable outcomes.”

She cited the example of IoT analytics and intelligence technologies coming to the fore both in energy use in the organization and driving supply chain efficiencies. “Market pressure from stakeholders is resulting in proactive programmes that address remanufacturing reconditioning and product recycling requiring sustainability to be built into product design. The visibility into supplier ecosystems is necessary to assure that environmental social and governance policies are enforced which is essential to ensure future business” Krishnan said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2Jyb29rZWNyb3RoZXJzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvdGhlLWNocm9tZWJvb2staXMtaG90LS0tYnV0LXRoZS1zd2l0Y2gtZnJvbS1tYWNib29rLXdpbmRvd3MtY29tZXMtd2l0aC1pc3N1ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Switch To A Chromebook Can Come With Issues Surprises,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2021/03/27/the-chromebook-is-hot---but-the-switch-from-macbook-windows-comes-with-issues/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2Jyb29rZWNyb3RoZXJzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvdGhlLWNocm9tZWJvb2staXMtaG90LS0tYnV0LXRoZS1zd2l0Y2gtZnJvbS1tYWNib29rLXdpbmRvd3MtY29tZXMtd2l0aC1pc3N1ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2luZHVzdHJ5LWNsb3Vkcy1jb3VsZC1iZS10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctdGhpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industry clouds could be the next big thing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/industry-clouds-could-be-the-next-big-thing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2luZHVzdHJ5LWNsb3Vkcy1jb3VsZC1iZS10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctdGhpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL2d1bGZuZXdzLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvY2hhdGJvdHMtaXMtdGhhdC1hLXJlYWwtcGVyc29uLWhlbHBpbmcteW91LWhvdy1yb2JvdHMtYXJlLXRha2luZy1vdmVyLXRoZS13b3JsZC1vbmUtY2hhdC1hdC1hLXRpbWUtMS4xNjE2OTQzMzY2NzIw0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvY2hhdGJvdHMtaXMtdGhhdC1hLXJlYWwtcGVyc29uLWhlbHBpbmcteW91LWhvdy1yb2JvdHMtYXJlLXRha2luZy1vdmVyLXRoZS13b3JsZC1vbmUtY2hhdC1hdC1hLXRpbWUtMS4xNjE2OTQzMzY2NzIw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chatbots: Is that a real person helping you? How robots are taking over the world one chat at a time,"Welcome to the world of chatbots

Now there are robots dispensing psychotherapy advice too known as virtual conversational assistants (or VCAs) and they’re taking the world by storm.

To be sure chatbots have changed our experience for good. For one simple reason: convenience. Responses come quick and easy. People are generally happy with that. It’s still not perfect but it works.

An oft-cited example AI use is of Canadian firm BlueDot’s early-warning system which alerted the company’s customers about Covid-19 at the end of December even before the WHO. The system uses AI including natural-language processing and machine learning to track over 100 infectious diseases by analysing about 100000 articles in 65 languages every day.

The result: the likes of WhatsApp and FB Messenger have become key drivers behind chatbots' rise and vice versa. Now more and more are embracing it across the world which demonstrates AI's flexibility cutting through language barriers.

What are chatbots?

Chatbots — chat robots — are personal virtual assistants. They execute instructions in seconds. Consumers like you and me have certain expectations: We don’t want to wait. This is where AI comes in.

""One of the most significant AI developments in the last century is the bots and virtual conversations” Gaurav Singh founder and CEO of Verloop.io told Gulf News. ""Today chatbots engage with users in an entirely different way from ELIZA (the first chatbot which first came out in the 1960s)” he added.

What are they used for?

Chatbots are considered as the “frontliners” of the digital era. They help and are present where human agents cannot be available 24/7. It’s a boon for industries — from banking law-enforcement back office logistics public services — any entity that deals with people (which is to say almost all).

They are also in travel services education utilities gaming hotels and even psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy app which acts like an always-on standby coach suggesting things you must do from clinically-validated menu of answers). ""Increasingly they also understand voice commands"" said Singh whose AI chat platform is based in India.

Custom functionality can be built with the AI engine. With superfast computer processing the system can do things in a flash — answer questions personalise communication carry out tasks for the user.

How big are chatbots?

Consider the numbers: One AI-driven chatbot platform (Pandorabot) claims over a quarter million developers and 60 billion messages sent. In 2018 there were 300000 chatbots on Facebook according to Venture Beat business and customers combined sent around 8 billion messages per day in 2020.

Amidst the pandemic chatbot usage increased by 80% (2020) according to Tidio a chatbot software company. Chatbots are pretty flexible too: They can support any language.

Can I use a chatbot for free?

Yes. If you’re a start-up some chatbots allow you to start for free with up to 1000 messages per month. Some developer platforms charge $0.0025 cents per message with up to 10 bots and 100000 messages per month.

How does it work?

A chatbot using a natural language processing (NLP) system usually keeps a database of common questions asked that can be referenced based on key words. So if you have a website and social media presence a chatbot can boost interactivity: Visitors can get answers to questions about your services or products — immediately — without requiring a human manning a “live chat” to reply.

What is natural language processing? NLP is language used by humans in everyday conversations. With AI it also comes with self-learning capabilities that can provide sustained conversational experiences. It does this by gathering huge volumes of customer data and “learning” from it in a sort of self-driving vehicle software.

Over time as the AI engine learns using artificial neural networks (ANN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) that can be “trained” chatbots can increase accuracy of response. This can then increase the effectiveness of organisations. By building a responsive set of answers to frequently-asked questions (this may be done without coding knowledge or the expense of hiring a coder/developer) this innovation is a booster for interactivity.

How did it start?

The so-called ""Turing Test"" theory was first devised in the 1950s. The first chatbot to be launched was ELIZA in the 1960s. And if you’ve used Siri or Alexa and their other siblings you’ve actually become part of the chatbot ecosystem.

The Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. The test is named after Alan Turing the founder of the Turing Test and an English computer scientist cryptanalyst mathematician and theoretical biologist.

What are the examples of chatbot usage in the UAE? 〣 In 2016 both Mashreq Bank and Emirates NBD introduced their chatbots UAE’s first ever banking chatbots in the Gulf.



〣 Companies like du and etisalat adopted the technology in its earlier years.



〣 The Dubai Roads and Transport Authority uses chatbot to deliver smart Salik services (road-toll system)

WhatsApp’s chatbot is among the top chatbots used for business according to Sprout Social. Many companies from travel to event organisers have implemented this chatbot to improve customer support. Already more than 80% of small businesses in India and Brazil say WhatsApp helps them improve customer service and grow business.

In the UAE integration of chatbots with WhatsApp has seen more and more adherents. Travel agents use it to send ticket confirmations as WhatsApp messages — by default. Bookmyshow an Indian online booking app does the same. Their users who book tickets are notified via WhatsApp along with the confirmation text or an M-ticket (mobile ticket) QR Code. This allows businesses to revive their approach boost branding and customer service.

What are the upsides of chatbot use?

In general consumers do like chatbots according to surveys. Up to 27% of adults — that’s almost 1 out of 3 grown-ups — has used chatbots (specifically for shopping) at least once in their life.

Chatbots help improve customer support save time and resources by automating services and information. And they free human agents to focus on solving more complex problems.

Latest data show that 46% of users would still prefer to communicate with a live person. But more and more consumers are buying basic goods like food or clothes via chatbots.

300000 Number of chatbots already on Facebook alone in 2018. WhatsApp’s chatbot is among the top used specifically for business purposes.

Do consumers really like chatbots?

Around 67% of customers used chatbots in 2018 and by the end of 2019 more than a quarter of the population was estimated to be using some kind of chatbot support. Already around 37% of customers use chatbots to get quick answers in case of an emergency according to Chatbots Magazine.

How easy or difficult is it to implement a chatbot system?

For first-timers there are many questions one needs to answer before and during the implementation process. Some of the challenges faced:

Figuring out what use cases the chatbot will fulfil

Building a bot that brings value to the end-user

Designing a bot personality that caters to your audience and matches your brand identity

Integrating the chatbot with tech CRMs and digital channels to provide a seamless and secure experience

Knowing at what stage a human needs to be involved.

Q: How do you humanise bots?

Siri (Apple) and Alexa (Amazon) are two examples of chatbots getting ""humanised"". Creating characters that represent a brand is not only a PR stunt. It's based on an understanding of how the mind works: we're wired to identify with each other.

Brands (or complex computer codes like chatbots) that put a face to a name makes people feel comfortable buying and talking. But there are heaps of ways to use chatbots — every brand from Pizza Hut to ride-hailing company Lyft and music app Spotify have plunged into the chatbots ecosystem.

“By giving your chatbot a character and personality” explains Singh “you eliminate the ‘cold connection’ users typically experience where each response feels computerised and robotic.”

Conversational commerce • A term coined by Uber's Chris Messina in a 2015 piece published on ""Medium"".



• It refers to the intersection of messaging apps and shopping. Meaning the trend toward interacting with businesses through messaging and chat apps like Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Talk and WeChat is more preferred as it encourages buyers to shop online with chatbots.

How do you train an AI chatbot (so awkward or irrelevant answers are avoided)?

The AI chatbot can be “trained” to understand the many ways people can shoot (or even misspell) their questions explained Singh. “Few ways include defining the use case where each intent contains many utterances — and so on.”

Artificial intelligence is seen as one of man's weapons against COVID-19. AI is transforming the way health care is delivered globally from the utilisation of big data and genetic information for providing precision medicine — which is a new line of treatment customised specifically to each individual- to including intelligent robotics in surgeries and rehabilitation.

Another is by ""deep-learning"" for example through the use of Keras a popular library for neural networks used in building chatbots. One way to start is by creating a yes/no-answering bot. As complexity increases a programming language like Python may be used to implement a ""recurrent neural network"" (RNN) structure. ""Training"" a chatbot can use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

What is machine learning? Machine learning a branch of artificial intelligence is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through ""experience"" and by the use of data. Self-driving technology is one example of machine learning as continuous application of data helps improves accuracy over time without being programmed to do so.

What languages are supported by chatbots?

Chatbots are pretty flexible able to support any language. The AI mechanisms behind most chatbots work well with almost every language. Verloop;says they offer support for 18+ languages — English Hindi Arabic Bahasa Konkani Tamil Telugu Kannada Hinglish etc.). They also claim to have a multiple-dialect AI chatbot.

This capability is seen in the spike in demand. Verloop.io reported a three-fold growth in revenue since February 2020. The company has 5000 brands globally — including Decathlon Nykaa Cleartrip Dar Al Arkan Fetchr DSP Mutual Fund Rentomojo Scripbox and others. Amidst the pandemic chatbot usage increased by 80% (2020) according to Tidio a chatbot software company.

The AI mechanisms behind most chatbots work well with almost every language. -

“Our team size has grown three times. The team is now 100+ from 30 members as of February 2020” said Singh who expects the company to exit 2021 with five-fold revenue growth. This 2021 the company has new locations launched in Abu Dhabi Singapore and in the US. Part of its growth plan this year is to hire and relocating tech people to different locations for an Indian global product.

SOME UAE-BASED CHATBOT DEVELOPERS: • TECHVED Consulting



• Skcript



• Verloop



• Dexlock Henote Technologies



• TechnoGroupOriginator



• Coders.Dev



• Q3 Technologies



• NeuralRays AI Solutions

Is there a FOMO (fear of missing out) syndrome with chatbots?

Singh explains: “It is vital to be familiar with critical new technologies to ensure that you don't get left behind is also an economic argument. Ultimately the reasons for using a chatbot are economic either in the short term or long term. Even the sense of being perceived as a ‘customer's brand’ for using advanced technology is an attempt to improve the brand — which should lead to more growth.” In many cases the ROI for chatbots is “exceptionally high” he said.

What are the industries touched by chatbots?

The real estate industry is the most profitable sector with more than 28% of real estate business now using chatbots according to Chatbots Magazine. The travel industry reaps huge benefits from chatbots too. Chatbots for example are useful in filtering and speeding up the process of booking rooms or flights.

It's also present in transport/logistics education medicine.

In education chatbots are increasingly used too. For one they help provide students with personalised feedback that helps improve the overall learning experience. -

In education chatbots are increasingly used too. For one they help provide students with personalised feedback that helps improve the overall learning experience. Moreover chatbots can recommend relevant online learning content by analysing their learning skills.

Chatbot apps also help teachers in reducing the burden of daily tasks such as checking assignments evaluating performance etc. More importantly chatbots help boost engagement among students all of whom had been hemmed into online modes of education.

$ 5 b money expected to be invested in chatbots this 2021 according to Chatbots Magazine

This is how chatbots have increasingly become part of our lives like the internet itself. At least $5 billion will be invested in chatbots this year according to the magazine.

And thanks to chatbots the cost reduction of customers across the retail banking and healthcare sectors is estimated to amount to $11 billion annually by 2023. More and more people have used channels like Alexa or Google Home chatbot for shopping.

Will chatbots replace mobile apps?

A Gartner report states many companies are prioritising chatbot projects over mobile apps. The reason is that chatbots have become more reliable and effective due to advances in tech and AI. Though this doesn’t mean chatbots will obligerate mobile apps it simply means when getting quick service people will look to chatbots first.

What does the future hold for chatbots?

In the future chatbots will be more conversational i.e. using natural human language. This is the Holy Grail of AI-driven conversation. When close to perfection with multiple language/accent support it will enable chatbots to move from simple user-based queries to more advanced predictive analytics based on real-time human-like conversations say experts.

Conversational chatbots are already used extensively in many industries and are increasing in popularity. By the end of 2021 almost a quarter of the global population will be using some kind of chatbot support on a daily basis. A Gartner report says that for businesses AI will be a ""mainstream customer experience"" in the next couple of years. It further predicts that 47% of organisations will use chatbots for customer care and 40% will deploy virtual assistants.

So what now?

Gartner predicts that 85% of customer interactions will be managed without humans this 2021. Is this good news? If you consider the upsides – consumers get answers instantly companies reduce costs human agents can spend their time solving more important issues –there’s no doubt chatbots have become one of the most useful tools of our time.

More and more chatbots are appearing. Forbes reported that while millennials use social media apps more than any other generation – they are also chatbot natives. However it’s the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) who are likely to expect benefits from chatbots than millennials say experts. This is because it’s actually the baby boomers who use chatbots to resolve problems more than the younger generations.

Chatbots have an inherent utility. No matter whether or not we prefer talking to agents in the future people will be forced to rely on chatbot support just like we rely on apps now. Chatbots will change the world one chat at a time. This is almost a certainty.

CHATBOTS TIMELINE:

1950: The Turing Test

Alan Turing theorised that virtually intelligent machine would be indistinguishable from human during a text-only conversation. This idea essentially laid the foundations for the chatbot revolution.

1966: Eliza

Eliza was created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI lab to simulate human conversation by matching questions with the scripted responses. It gave an illusion of understanding but had not been in framework for contextualising events.

1972: Parry

While Eliza was a tongue-in-cheek simulation of a therapist Parry simulated a person with paranoid schizophrenia. It used a conversational strategy and was much more serious than Eliza.

1984: Racter

Racter is an artificial intelligence computer application that generates English language prose at random. It was published in 1984 by Mindscape.

1988: Jabberwacky

Developed in the 1980s and released online in 1997 Jabberwacky chatbot was designed to simulate natural human chat in an “interesting and entertaining and humorous manner.”

1992: Dr Sbaitso

An AI speech synthesis program created for MS DOS based PCs. Dr Sbaitso assumed the role of a psychologist when interacting with others and was designed to showcase a digitised voice.

1995: Alice

The artificial linguistic Internet computer entity was a “natural language processing bot”. She could apparently follow matching rules based on input in order to have a conversation but was still unable to pass the Turing test.

2001: Smarterchild

An intelligent bot widely distributed across SMS networks and friend lists among AOL and MSN messenger users. It offered a personalised conversation and was considered a precursor to Apple’s Siri and Samsung's Voice.

2006: Watson

Watson was originally designed to compete on the TV show “Jeopardy” in which he beat two of the show’s former champions. Watson has since gone on to bigger and better things using natural language processing (NLP) in machine learning to reveal insights from large amount of data.

2010: Siri

Siri is an intelligent personal assistant. It is part of Apple’s IOS and uses a natural language user interface to answer questions and perform various requests. Siri did the groundwork for all later AI bots and personal assistants.

2012: Google Now

Developed by Google for a Google search mobile app it employs a natural language user interface to answer questions make recommendations and perform actions by passing on requests to a set of Web services.

2014: Slack Bot

Slackbot is a built-in personal assistant on Slack (a channel-based messaging platform launched in 2013). Slackbots are handy assistants: they wait for commands then find or create the thing you need. You can also add some character to your conversations by producing custom responses for Slackbot.

2015: Alexa Cortana

Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant that inhabits the Amazon ecosystem. It is capable of voice interaction using natural language processing algorithms to receive recognise and respond to voice commands.

Cortana is Microsoft's version of the Intelligent Assistant that can set reminders and answer questions using the Bing search engine. It recognises natural voice commands in a number of languages.

2016: Bots for Messenger Tay

In April 2016 Facebook launched a messenger platform which allows developers to create bots that can interact with Facebook users. At the end of that year 34000 bots were available covering a wide range of use cases.

Tay was the chat bot created by Microsoft to mimic the speech and habits of a teenage girl. It caused controversy when it began to post offensive tweets and became increasingly paranoid. It eventually had to be shut down 16 hours after launch.

2017: Woebot

It is an AI-powered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) chatbot that delivers a suite of clinically-validated therapy programs to address mental health challenges. Woebot functions as a coach who chats with you and offers insights and skills to help you grow into your best self. You can chat with Woebot as much or as little as you like — it’s always available when you need it."

As such they are subject to a licensing requirement for certain sensitive items that are described in US export control regulations.

But it has also been caught in the crossfire as relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated in recent years.

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is at the forefront of China’s plan to become more technologically self-reliant and a key supplier for a that Beijing is trying to bring to market.

The state-owned military aerospace contractor was also placed on the US Department of Defence’s list of civil entities with ties to the Chinese military in June 2020 meaning it is subject to a US investment ban.

Here’s a deeper look at the company and why it has found itself in Washington’s crosshairs.

01:07 Three more Chinese C919 passenger jets to start test flights by late 2019 Three more Chinese C919 passenger jets to start test flights by late 2019

What is Avic?

Headquartered in Beijing Avic is an aviation and defence company controlled by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Sasac) the powerful agency that oversees China’s state sector including some of the world’s biggest companies in industries such as steel energy shipping telecoms defence and aerospace.

Avic was established in 2008 after China consolidated and restructured the China Aviation Industry Corporation I (Avic Ι) and the China Aviation Industry Corporation ΙΙ (Avic ΙΙ). Avic 1 had specialised in making large planes such as bombers and fighter jets while Avic 2 was responsible for producing smaller aircraft and helicopters.

Avic has more than 100 subsidiaries 23 listed companies and over 450000 employees – more than America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus combined.

The firm makes products for military use as well as for the civil aviation market. And through its many subsidiaries it manufactures some of China’s leading fighter aircraft such as the J-10 J-11 and J-20.

The company is a major supplier of components for China’s small regional jet ARJ-21 and C919 a narrow body medium-haul aircraft. It also exports products abroad including its regional turboprop MA60 series Y12s and the AC series helicopters.

How important is Avic to China’s aviation industry?

Avic plays a dominant role in research and development operations manufacturing and financing in China’s aviation industry.

It has a monopoly on military aircraft manufacturing and maintenance and is the third-largest shareholder of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) the manufacturer of C919 jet  which is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Avic is “of high strategic importance to China’s national defence and acts as the backbone of the country’s military and civilian aviation manufacturing industry” according to Fitch Ratings which offers ratings for Avic International whose majority owner is Avic.

Scott Kennedy a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said while Avic only holds around 12.35 per cent share in Comac it has an “outsize influence on Comac’s operations”.

“Much of Comac’s original leadership employees facilities and technology came from Avic” said Kennedy who conducted a two-year study on the company that was published in December last year. “It has continued to draw on talent and technology from Avic and other organizations from within China’s aerospace sector.”

How is the US-China relationship affecting Avic?

For many years Avic and its subsidiaries have been buying overseas aviation-related assets and technology and the company has a number of joint ventures with foreign firms including with GE Aviation in avionics and Honeywell Aerospace in flight control systems.

However Avic’s overseas ventures have begun raising alarm bells in Washington in recent years as relations between the two countries have sharply deteriorated. There are a growing number of questions about whether Beijing’s strategy of “military-civil fusion” – a policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development – could compromise American global competitiveness result in technology transfers and be used by the Chinese military.

In 2017 the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission – which advises the US Congress – commissioned a report to look into how the Chinese government was growing its aviation manufacturing business and the resulting military implications.

“Avic … has undoubtedly been the most prolific investor in US aviation” said the report compiled by the Rand Corporation an American think tank.

Aerospace products are valuable exports for the US economy and integral to its national security. Many aviation products fall under US export-control restrictions. China’s investment in US aviation companies is also subject to review and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is an inter-agency group of the US government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American companies or operations.

What is the outlook for Avic?

China has been investing heavily to advance its aviation manufacturing capability and such investment is likely to continue. Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2018 urged the nation’s state firms to “strive to achieve the goal of building an aviation power” as the world’s second largest economy increasingly places more resources and investment in hi-tech industries.

Xi’s dual circulation strategy also promotes home-grown innovation aiming to reduce China’s dependence on overseas markets and technology in its long-term development a shift brought on by a deepening rift with the US.

Liu Daxiang deputy director of the science and technology committee at Avic said in December last year that aviation technology had accelerated this century competition was getting “more fierce” and that China had to rely on its ability to innovate.

“The established countries in aviation have become more strict with us when it comes to technology access” he said in a video seminar organised by the Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

“In the past we have leveraged market access in exchange for technology – I don’t think it works [for aviation].”

Kennedy of CSIS estimated that the C919 has received somewhere between US$49 billion and $72.1 billion of state-related support more than double the US$22 billion the World Trade Organization determined Airbus had received over many years from the European Union. The C919 is expected to win airworthiness certification by the end of the year after more than a decade of development.

Without mentioning foreign hostility to the Chinese aviation industry Avic said in its working report for 2021 it would “accelerate the deployment of the dual circulation strategy and lead and guide the [aviation] industry and focus on problems restricting the development”.

The company highlighted the lack of innovation ability supply chain co-ordination and the development of civil aircraft technology and products as its major “shortcomings” in China Aviation News a publication it owns.

“There are shortcomings in the development of civil aircraft technology products and industries” Avic said. “The ability to integrate market resources to promote business development is weak and lacks the ability to comprehensively respond to the impact of internal and external risks.”

(AP) — A joint program between Marshall University and Mountwest Community and Technical College in aviation maintenance broke ground ceremonially on Friday The Herald-Dispatch reported.

The program is a collaboration with the Huntington Tri-State Airport where an existing hangar and an armory are being renovated. Creating classroom and laboratory spaces is expected to cost about $2.7 million. The program already has received two planes and they plan to add seven more.

""Metaphorically I will say that Mountwest and Marshall are flying in new airspace here"" Marshall University President Jerome Gilbert said at the groundbreaking. ""The joint program is the first of its kind and we hope it will serve as a model to other institutions in the state.""

The program which is expected to start up next spring will give students right out of high school an opportunity to get a certification in aviation maintenance or complete general education courses through Mountwest for an associate degree following the certification of the program from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Airport Director Brent Brown said the program will give people a chance to learn and later work locally instead of having to go to other states to find jobs. There are 95 acres of flat land at the airport and Brown hopes the maintenance program provides chances for expansion and further development.

Gilbert said he hopes the program will also help attract aerospace companies to the region.

Gov. Jim Justice reminded those in attendance of the 1970 Marshall University plane crash that devastated the area. The new program is a way for the region to rise from those ashes and pay tribute to the 75 lives lost he said.

Why is it in the US sanction list ?,"Size of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is gigantic !

With more than 100 subsidiaries and 23 listed companies AVIC has over 450000 employees – more than America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus combined.

Avic is “of high strategic importance to China’s national defence and acts as the backbone of the country’s military and civilian aviation manufacturing industry” according to Fitch Ratings.

What is it's scope in aviation business ?

The firm is into products for military use as well as for the civil aviation market. It's subsidiaries manufacture some of China’s leading fighter aircraft such as the J-10 J-11 and J-20.

It is a major supplier of aero components for China's small regional jet ARJ-21 and C919 a narrow body medium-haul aircraft. It also exports products abroad including its regional turboprop MA60 series Y12s and the AC series helicopters.

What are the aspirations ?

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is the face of china in aviation it is infact responsible for China’s plan to become technologically self-reliant and become a key supplier for the homegrown commercial aircrafts that Beijing wants to export to the world.

Dominance !

Yes Avic is at the forefront it plays a dominant role in research and development operations manufacturing and financing in China’s aviation industry.

It has a monopoly on military aircraft manufacturing and maintenance and is the third-largest shareholder of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) the manufacturer of

C919 aircrafts which is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Though Avic only holds around 12.35% share in Comac it has an “outsize influence on Comac’s operations. Much of Comac’s original leadership employees facilities and technology came from Avic.

International Presence :

Avic and its subsidiaries have been buying overseas aviation-related assets and technology and the company has a number of joint ventures with foreign firms including with GE Aviation in avionics and Honeywell Aerospace in flight control systems.

The sanctions :

Avic’s overseas ventures started raising concerns for washinton DC in recent years as bilateral relations between the USA and China took a downward development.

Beijing’s strategy of “military-civil fusion” – the policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development was seen a challenge.

In December 2020 seven of Avic's subsidiaries entered on the 'US Commerce Department’s list of Chinese companies' with alleged military ties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWxvY2FsL25hbWUvcGF0cmljaWEtd2VsbGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcwMTMwMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patricia Weller Obituary (2021) - Coatesville PA - Daily Local News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailylocal/name/patricia-weller-obituary?id=7013024 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWxvY2FsL25hbWUvcGF0cmljaWEtd2VsbGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTcwMTMwMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

If you buy new PC parts in 2021 they’ll likely support the current fourth generation. But with Intel’s upcoming launch of its Alder Lake processors later this year we’ll already be moving to the fifth generation of the PCI Express interface known as PCIe 5 which should offer significantly faster data transfers.

Recommended Videos

Originally introduced with preliminary specifications in 2017 the PCIe 5 standard was formally ratified by the PCI Special Interest Group in 2019. The standard isn’t expected to arrive in PCs until late 2021 when Intel builds in PCIe Gen 5 support on its upcoming line of processors and new motherboards. With that in mind what exactly is PCIe 5 and will it be a substantial upgrade from PCIe 4?

PCIe Gen 4 vs. PCIe Gen 5

The main difference between each PCIe generation is speed. PCIe 1 had a bandwidth of 8 GB/s and a 2.5 GT/s (gigatransfer per second) clocked at a frequency of 2.5GHz. On the current PCIe Gen 4 standard that’s employed on many modern processors from AMD and Intel bandwidth can go up to 64 GB/s and there is a gigatransfer maximum of 16 GT/s with a frequency of 16GHz.

PCIe 5.0 is viewed as an extension of the PCIe Gen 4 standard. With PCIe 5 the bandwidth gigatransfer and frequency are all doubled from the prior generation which means that data can be transferred at substantially faster speeds. Here you’re looking at 32 gigatransfers per second or 32 GT/s a 128 GB/s bandwidth in an x16 configuration and a frequency of 32GHz.

The primary difference between the gigatransfer (GT/s) and bandwidth (GB/s) measurement is that the former is a measure of raw speed while the latter is the data transfer rate. Raw speed measures how many bits can be transferred each second while the data transfer rate must also take into account encoding overhead.

As an example a PCIe 5 x8 link means that you’re getting 32 GT/s raw speed but only 31.5 GB/s of bandwidth.

If you’re looking to be among the first to adopt PCIe 5 for your next desktop build you’ll have to wait till the second half of 2021 when Intel releases its Alder Lake family of processors which will be available for mobile and desktop. So far Intel is the only company to announce support for the new standard.

Alder Lake according to recent leaks will require a new socket and motherboard and upgrading to this latest silicon will require gamers to get a new board to benefit from all the latest changes including PCIe 5 support. A combination of architectural changes a switch to 10nm SuperFin manufacturing and PCIe 5 support along with faster DDR5 memory will allow Alder Lake to get a 2x performance uplift in multithread applications according to the latest leak.

Because of the faster speeds there is a greater chance for signal loss so the standard builds in capabilities to better handle noise and signal loss than PCIe Gen 4 to preserve data integrity.

Do you need to upgrade?

The faster transfer speeds will be important for applications that include machine learning and artificial intelligence data center uses and high-performance computing environments. This will help A.I. applications process more data at faster speeds. Given that PCIe is the highway that connects the processor graphics card storage and FPGAs and ASIC accelerators the move to faster PCIe Gen 5 could make cryptocurrency mining even more lucrative.

In general most home PC users and gamers will find the speeds and capabilities of PCIe 4 — and even the preceding PCIe 3 — specifications to be more than sufficient.

In our comparison of PCIe 4 versus PCIe 3 we found that even capable graphics cards — like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti — don’t make full use of the bandwidth available in a PCIe Gen 3 x16 slot yet. So PCIe 5 will be overkill for most gamers. Like the benefits of moving from Gen 3 to Gen 4 PCIe Gen 5’s speed boost will be most beneficial for those who need faster access to NVMe storage drives and RAID configurations.

Hopefully in the future with the faster speeds peripherals like GPUs that connect to a PCIe slot will require fewer lanes. Rather than requiring the x16 lanes from today’s PCIe 4 standard we can reduce that requirement to just x8 on PCIe 5. With smaller lane requirements to achieve similar speeds gamers can potentially build systems that are equally as powerful in a smaller more compact tower.

What is PCIe?

PCIe is known as the peripheral component interconnect express that’s used to connect various components in your desktop PC. It’s one of the most important connectivity standard on a modern PC as it allows various components to communicate with each other.

As an interface standard PCIe helps you connect high-speed solid-state drives (SSDs) graphics cards and wireless networking cards to your processor. On a desktop you’ll connect various cards to the PCIe slot on your motherboard and the number of PCIe slots available and type of slots will vary depending on the board you select.

You’ll often notice that PCIe slots and cards are designated with a numeric value that’s preceded by an x. The configurations include PCIe x1 x2 x4 x8 x16 and x32. These numbers indicate how many lanes are available — the higher the number the faster data can travel. PCIe x1 means that there is only one lane while PCIe x16 indicates that there are 16 available lanes.

Cards and slots can be mixed and matched despite the number of lanes indicated by each component with data bandwidth determined by the slower part. For example if you have a PCIe x4 slot on your motherboard you can connect a PCIe x1 card. Here your bandwidth is capped by the card’s single available lane which is one bit per cycle. Conversely if you insert a PCIe x8 card into the PCIe x4 slot data will only travel at half the bandwidth compared to a card that was inserted into a PCIe x8 slot.

For gamers the magical number is the PCIe x16 and most GPUs will require a PCIe x16 slot to fully take advantage of the card’s capabilities. In general even though PCIe x32 exists it is expensive and rare and most PC components top out at x16.

More importantly will they still be watching in a year’s time when BBC 3 re-launches as a linear station? Six years ago the youth orientated channel switched to digital-only as part of a £100 million cost cutting measure. Since then they have produced a couple of runaway successes such as the all-conquering Fleabag hence the decision to have another crack at broadening their appeal to a rapidly dwindling youth market where TV sets are a rarity and scheduling anathema.

Once it is up and running again in January will the channel be able to fulfil its remit by appealing to a broad spectrum of younger viewers most of whom have already switched to subscription platforms? By clinging on to the anachronistic licence fee that no right minded millennial let alone Gen-Z would go near given the choice Aunty has already alienated the very audience it is desperately trying to woo. So what of the channel’s content; is there enough there to grab attention away from Netflix et al?

The current schedule doesn’t inspire confidence with an all too familiar mix of garish reality shows social justice hammer blows and Stacy Dooley. The target audience appears to be almost exclusively urban kids with attitude. Core Reithian values have been jettisoned in the usual rush to stay relevant. But chasing after fickle fashion ‘edginess’ and the same old progressive orthodoxies doesn’t make you relevant it makes you a slave. Surely the job of a public service broadcaster is to buck trends and rise above the limits of the market place.

The good news is Gen Zs appear to be rebelling against the chilling conformity of identity-based programming

Yes BBC3 has produced some thought provoking shows that deal in worthy causes and Normal People really struck a chord with younger viewers but rather than broaden its appeal further producer Ash Atalla has revealed that the channel intends to narrow its approach by focusing instead on issues that ‘concern young people’ namely ‘gender race sexuality identity and the environment.’

Most popular Karl Williams How to fix Britain’s migrant crisis – quickly

But does Atalla honestly think kids lie awake at night worrying about gender pronouns? Aren’t these just the same old shibboleths that concern the sort of middle aged producers who see the entirety of human existence through the boringly reductive prism of immutable characteristics and environmental catastrophe.

Producers working to this sort of an agenda know full well that young people are already bombarded by this stuff day in day out not only from other BBC channels but from every HR department and university campus in the land. The last thing kids want as they slob out in front of the telly of an evening – if indeed that’s what they still do – is yet more proselytising progressivism.

The BBC’s obsession with politicising every inch of output is not only insulting to those of us who prefer content that also entertains and informs it is also deeply demoralising for younger audiences who long to escape the prison of their own circumstances. Most of the kids I meet are bored stiff by the narrow obsessions of our new cultural overlords. It’s also unforgivably lazy on the part of programme makers who simply reflect kids’ lives back at them rather than introducing them to big ideas that broaden their understanding of the world. Boxing young people into neat little comfort zones may make producers feel relevant but it does nothing for those looking to be inspired.

The good news is Gen Zs appear to be rebelling against the chilling conformity of identity-based programming where bludgeoning viewers with political messaging is the only narrative in town. According to Eric Kaufman professor of politics at Birkbeck University of London young people under the age of 22 tend to be more conservative and less politically correct than voters aged between 22 and 39.

In what he refers to as the Jordan Peterson effect Zoomers are turning to countercultural voices on social media and YouTube rather than relying on the mainstream media. They relish long form open debate and see the narrowing of creative freedom as a millennial dysfunction. When it comes to content Gen Zs are more open-minded and don’t take kindly to patronising producers lecturing them on what to think.

BBC3 is in a unique position to move youth programming beyond the narrow confines of progressivism and edgy urban cool. There’s a rich panoply of culture out there just waiting to be shared. Why should youth programming be rooted in geographical identity when great art speaks to universal truths that surpass place and time? As Netflix and Amazon Prime drift inexorably towards bland progressive conformity do we really need our national broadcaster to follow suit?

By returning to terrestrial TV BBC3 will once again be limited by the need to fill a strict scheduling timetable. Wouldn’t it be better to remain online where programme makers can afford to take their time and produce the sort of quality output not found on any other platform? In the end isn’t that the only justification for charging young people a license fee?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN1bmRheXRpbWVzLmxrLzIxMDMyOC9lZHVjYXRpb24vdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1vZi1rZWxhbml5YXMtMTE2dGgtZ2VuZXJhbC1jb252b2NhdGlvbi1oZWxkLXVuZGVyLWNvdmlkLWd1aWRlbGluZXMtNDM3ODUwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University of Kelaniya's 116th General Convocation held under COVID guidelines,"University of Kelaniya’s 116th General Convocation held under COVID guidelines View(s):

Last week the United States Navy awarded a $2.42 billion contract modification to General Dynamics' Electric Boat subsidiary to build an additional Block V Virginia-class submarine equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). The deal was awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington D.C.

The original contract that was awarded in December 2019 was for nine boats with an option for a tenth. With this added submarine the total cost of the contract with prime contractor Electric Boat will be $24.1 billion a net increase of $1.89 billion for the full contract.

Nasdaq reported that General Dynamics has substantially reduced the cost as well as the delivery time of the Virginia-class boats from eighty-four to just sixty-six months while also improving mission capability and ship construction quality. The defense contractor is also one of only two companies in the world that is equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines and as such General Dynamics has enjoyed a dominant position as a navy contractor.

""The 17000 shipbuilders of Electric Boat are pleased to receive the award for the tenth Block V ship and are ready to meet the generational challenge of building the Virginia and Columbia classes concurrently"" Kevin Graney president of General Dynamics' Electric Boat said in a statement that was also posted to Facebook. ""We are grateful for the continued support of our federal delegation who strongly advocated for this important funding.""

According to the Department of Defense (DoD) Electric Boat will continue to work with Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding division on the construction of the submarine. Contract work will occur in Virginia Rhode Island California Connecticut Maryland Arizona Pennsylvania and other areas within and outside the U.S. through February 2030 according to Govconwire.com.

The United States Navy has been focused on strengthening its naval power by upgrading its fleet of missile submarines in response to potential threats from near-peer adversaries including China.

The Virginia-class nuclear-powered cruise missile attack submarines were introduced in the mid-2000s as a replacement to the Cold War-era Los Angeles-class submarine line thirty of which have already been retired. Three of the Virginia blocks were focused heavily on cost-efficiency improvements: Block II slashed roughly $300 million worth of program costs introducing a more efficient production process; the eight Block III subs incorporated a new bow design including a new sonar array and large diameter vertical payload tubes and Block IV brought reduced maintenance periods and lowered total ownership costs to boost the program's sustainability well into the coming decades.

The Block V submarines feature the VPM an 84-foot section of the boat that will serve as an undersea vertical launcher for missiles. Each VPM on the Block Vs provides the capacity for 40 cruise missiles. Additionally with advancements in hypersonic missile technology the Virginia-class's larger launcher will be well suited to host such weapons once they are deployable. The boats can also host the new version of the anti-ship Maritime Strike Tomahawk a part of the Block V upgrade that will begin being delivered to the service later this month.

In late February I drove to see the Trump wall in Sasabe Arizona. As soon as I parked a green-striped Border Patrol vehicle stationed a quarter of a mile away began to creep down the dirt road toward us. Just ahead a dystopian “No Trespassing” sign was flapping in the wind. It was cold as I stepped out of the car with my five-year-old son William. The wall ahead of us 30-feet high with steel bollards was indeed imposing as it quavered slightly in the wind. Through its bars we could see Mexico a broken panorama of hills filled with mesquites backed by a blue sky.

The Homeland Security vehicle soon pulled up next to us. An agent rolled down his window and asked me “What are you doing? Joyriding?”

After I laughed in response to a word I hadn’t heard in years the agent informed us that we were in a dangerous construction zone even if this part of the wall had been built four months earlier. I glanced around. There were no bulldozers excavators or construction equipment of any sort. I wondered whether the lack of machinery reflected the campaign promise of the recently inaugurated Joe Biden that “not another foot” of Trump’s wall would be built.

Indeed that was why I was here — to see what the border looked like as the post-Trump era began. President Biden had started his term with strong promises to reverse the border policies of his predecessor: families torn apart would be reunited and asylum seekers previously forced to stay in Mexico allowed to enter the United States. Given the Trump years the proposals of the new administration sounded almost revolutionary.

And yet something else bothered me as we drove away: everything looked the same as it had for years. I’ve been coming to this stretch of border since 2001. I’ve witnessed its incremental disfigurement during the most dramatic border fortification period in this country’s history. In the early 2000s came an influx of Border Patrol agents followed in 2007 by the construction of a 15-foot wall (that Senator Joe Biden voted for) followed by high-tech surveillance towers courtesy of a multi-billion-dollar contract with the Boeing Corporation.

Believe me the forces that shaped our southern border over the decades have been far more powerful than Donald Trump or any individual politician. During the 2020 election it was commonly asserted that by getting rid of Trump the United States would create a more humane border and immigration system. And there was a certain truth to that but a distinctly limited one. Underneath the theater of partisan politics there remains a churning border-industrial complex a conjunction of entrenched interests and relationships between the U.S. government — particularly the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) — and private corporations that has received very little attention.

The small border town of Sasabe and its surrounding region is a microcosm of this.

The cumulative force of that complex will now carry on in Trump’s wake. Indeed during the 2020 election the border industry created through decades of bipartisan fortification actually donated more money to the Biden campaign and the Democrats than to Trump and the Republicans.

The Complex

In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dolled out 105000 contracts or a breathtaking average of 24 contracts a day worth $55 billion to private contractors. That sum exceeded their $52 billion collective budgets for border and immigration enforcement for the 28 years from 1975 to 2003. While those contracts included ones for companies like Fisher Sand and Gravel that built the 30-foot wall my son and I saw in Sasabe many of them — including the most expensive — went to companies creating high-tech border fortification ranging from sophisticated camera systems to advanced biometric and data-processing technologies.

This might explain the border industry’s interest in candidate Biden who promised: “I’m going to make sure that we have border protection but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it.”

Behind that bold declarative sentence lay an all-too-familiar version of technological border protection sold as something so much more innocuous harmless and humane than what Trump was offering. As it happens despite our former president’s urge to create a literal wall across hundreds of miles of borderlands high-technology has long been and even in the Trump years remained a large part of the border-industrial complex.

One pivotal moment for that complex came in 2005 when the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Jackson (previously Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer) addressed a conference room of border-industry representatives about creating a virtual or technological wall. “This is an unusual invitation” he said then. “I want to make sure you have it clearly that we’re asking you to come back and tell us how to do our business. We’re asking you. We’re inviting you to tell us how to run our organization.”

Of course by then the border and immigration enforcement system had already been on a growth spurt. During President Bill Clinton’s administration (1993-2001) for example its annual budgets had nearly tripled from $1.5 billion to $4.3 billion. Clinton in fact initiated the immigration deterrence system still in place today in which Washington deployed armed agents barriers and walls as well as high-tech systems to block the traditional urban places where immigrants had once crossed. They were funneled instead into dangerous and deadly spots like the remote and brutal Arizona desert around Sasabe. As Clinton put it in his 1995 State of the Union address:

“[O]ur administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.”

Sound familiar?

The Clinton years however already seemed like ancient times when Jackson made that 2005 plea. He was speaking in the midst of a burgeoning Homeland Security era. After all DHS was only created in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. In fact during George W. Bush’s years in office border and immigration enforcement budgets grew from $4.2 billion in 2000 to $15.2 billion in 2008 — more that is than during any other presidency including Donald Trump’s. Under Bush that border became another front in the war on terror (even if no terrorists crossed it) opening the money faucets. And that was what Jackson was underscoring — the advent of a new reality that would produce tens of thousands of contracts for private companies.

In addition as U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq began to wane many security and defense companies pivoted toward the new border market. As one vendor pointed out to me at a Border Security Expo in Phoenix in 2012 “We are bringing the battlefield to the border.” That vendor who had been a soldier in Afghanistan a few years earlier smiled confidently the banners of large weapons-makers like Raytheon hanging above him. At the time (as now) an “unprecedented boom period” was forecast for the border market. As the company VisionGain explained then a “virtuous circle… would continue to drive spending in the long term based on three interlocking developments: ‘illegal immigration and terrorist infiltration’ more money for border policing in ‘developing countries’ and the ‘maturation’ of new technologies.”

Since 9/11 border-security corporate giants became big campaign contributors not only to presidential candidates but also to key members of the Appropriations Committees and the Homeland Security Committees (both House and Senate) — all crucial when it came to border policies contracts and budgets. Between 2006 and 2018 top border contractors like General Dynamics Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Raytheon contributed a total of $27.6 million to members of the House Appropriations Committee and $6.5 million to members of the House Homeland Security Committee. And from 2002 to 2019 there were nearly 20000 reported lobbying “visits” to congressional offices related to homeland security. The 2841 visits reported for 2018 alone included ones from top CBP and ICE contractors Accenture CoreCivic GeoGroup L3Harris and Leidos.

By the time Donald Trump entered the White House in 2017 the border-industrial complex was truly humming. That year he would oversee a $20-billion border and immigration budget and have at his disposal nearly 20000 Border Patrol agents (up from 4000 in 1994) 650 miles of already built walls and barriers billions of dollars in border technology then in place and more than 200 immigration-detention centers across the United States.

He claimed he was going to build his very own “big fat beautiful wall” most of which as it turned out already existed. He claimed that he was going to clamp down on a border that was already remarkably clamped down upon. And in his own fashion he took it to new levels.

That’s what we saw in Sasabe where a 15-foot wall had recently been replaced with a 30-foot wall. As it happened much of the 450 miles of wall the Trump administration did in the end build really involved interchanging already existing smaller barriers with monstrous ones that left remarkable environmental and cultural destruction in their wake.

Trump administration policies forced people seeking asylum to wait in Mexico infants to appear in immigration court and separated family members into a sprawling incarceration apparatus whose companies had been making up to $126 per person per day for years. He could have done little of this without the constantly growing border-industrial complex that preceded him and in important ways made him.

Nonetheless in the 2020 election campaign the border industry pivoted toward Biden and the Democrats. That pivot ensured one thing: that its influence would be strong if not preeminent on such issues when the new administration took over.

The Biden Years Begin at the Border

In early January 2021 Biden’s nominee to run DHS Alejandro Mayorkas disclosed that over the previous three years he had earned $3.3 million from corporate clients with the WilmerHale law firm. Two of those clients were Northrop Grumman and Leidos companies that Nick Buxton and I identified as top border contractors in Biden’s Border: The Industry the Democrats and the 2020 Election a report we co-authored for the Transnational Institute.

When we started to look at the 2020 campaign contributions of 13 top border contractors for CBP and ICE we had no idea what to expect. It was after all a corporate group that included producers of surveillance infrastructure for the high-tech “virtual wall” along the border like L3Harris General Dynamics and the Israeli company Elbit Systems; others like Palantir and IBM produced border data-processing software; and there were also detention companies like CoreCivic and GeoGroup.

To our surprise these companies had given significantly more to the Biden campaign ($5364994) than to Trump ($1730435). In general they had shifted to the Democrats who garnered 55% of their $40 million in campaign contributions including donations to key members of the House and Senate Appropriations and Homeland Security committees.

It’s still too early to assess just what will happen to this country’s vast border-and-immigration apparatus under the Biden administration which has made promises about reversing Trumpian border policies. Still it will be no less caught in the web of the border-industrial complex than the preceding administration.

Perhaps a glimpse of the future border under Biden was offered when on January 19th Homeland Security secretary nominee Mayorkas appeared for his Senate confirmation hearings and was asked about the 8000 people from Honduras heading for the U.S. in a “caravan” at that very moment. The day before U.S.-trained troops and police in Guatemala had thwarted and then deported vast numbers of them as they tried to cross into that country. Many in the caravan reported that they were heading north thanks to back-to-back catastrophic category 4 hurricanes that had devastated the Honduran and Nicaraguan coasts in November 2020.

Mayorkas responded rather generically that if people were found to qualify “under the law to remain in the United States then we will apply the law accordingly if they do not qualify to remain in the United States then they won’t.” Given that there is no climate-refugee status available to anyone crossing the border that meant most of those who finally made it (if they ever did) wouldn’t qualify to stay.

It’s possible that by the time I went to see that wall with my son in late February some people from that caravan had already made it to the border despite endless obstacles in their path. As we drove down Highway 286 also known as the Sasabe Road there were reports of undocumented people from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Mexico all traveling through the rugged Baboquivari mountain range to the west of us and the grim canyons to the east of us in attempts to avoid the Border Patrol and its surveillance equipment.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans against what he dubbed “the military-industrial complex” in 1961 he spoke of its “total influence — economic political even spiritual… felt in every city every statehouse every office of the Federal government.” Sixty years later something similar could be said of the ever-expanding border-industrial complex. It needs just such climate disasters and just such caravans (or as we’re seeing right now just such “crises” of unaccompanied minors) to continue its never-ending growth whether the president is touting a big fat beautiful wall or opting for high-tech border technology.

For my son and me the enforcement apparatus first became noticeable at a checkpoint 25 miles north of the international boundary. Not only were green-uniformed agents interrogating passengers in any vehicle heading northwards but a host of cameras focused on the vehicles passing by.

Whether they were license-plate readers or facial-recognition cameras I had no way of knowing. What I did know was that Northrop Grumman (which contributed $649748 to Joe Biden and $323014 to Donald Trump in the 2020 election campaign) had received a valuable contract to ensure that CBP’s biometric system included “modalities” of all sorts — face and voice data iris recognition scars and tattoos possibly even DNA sample collection and information about “relationship patterns” and “encounters” with the public. And who could tell if the Predator B drones that General Atomics produces — oh by the way that company gave $82974 to Biden and $51665 to Trump in 2020 — were above us (as they regularly are in the border regions) using Northrup Grumman’s VADER “man-hunting” radar system first deployed in Afghanistan?

As we traveled through that gauntlet Border Patrol vehicles were everywhere reinforcing the surveillance apparatus that extends 100 miles into the U.S. interior. We soon passed a surveillance tower at the side of the road first erected by the Boeing Corporation and renovated by Elbit Systems ($5553 to Biden $5649 to Trump) one of dozens in the area. On the other side of that highway was a gravel clearing where a G4S ($49233 to Biden $33019 to Trump) van usually idles. It’s a mobile prison the Border Patrol uses to transport its prisoners to short-term detention centers in Tucson. And keep in mind that there was so much we couldn’t see like the thousands of implanted motion sensors manufactured by a host of other companies.

Traveling through this border area it’s hard not to feel like you’re in a profitable version of a classic panopticon a prison system in which wherever you might be you’re being watched. Even five-year-old William was startled by such a world and genuinely puzzled asked me “Why do the green men” as he calls the Border Patrol “want to stop the workers?”

By the time we got to that shard of Trump’s “big fat beautiful” wall it seemed like just a modest part of a much larger system that left partisan politics in the dust. At its heart was never The Donald but a powerful cluster of companies with an active interest in working on that border until the end of time.

Just after the agent told us that we were in a construction zone and needed to leave I noticed a pile of bollards near the dirt road that ran parallel to the wall. They were from the previous wall the one Biden had voted for in 2006. As William and I drove back to Tucson through that gauntlet of inspection I wondered what the border-industrial world would look like when he was my age and living in what could be an even more extreme world filled with ever more terrified people fleeing disaster.

And I kept thinking of that discarded pile of bollards a reminder of just how easy it would be to tear that wall and the world that goes with it down.

The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon remains the most procured fixed-wing aircraft in military service. Since its introduction in 1978 it has been adopted by twenty-five other nations and there are approximately 3000 operational Fighting Falcons in service. It has engaged in more than 400000 combat sorties and has a combined 19 million flight hours – while the aircraft has been adapted to complete a variety of missions ranging from air-to-air fighting ground attack and electronic warfare.

And it was even a contender the United States Air Force's Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program with a radically-modified delta wing shape design that more than doubled the area of a standard F-16 wing.

However the F-16XL as it came to be known began as the Supersonic Cruise and Maneuver Prototype (SCAMP) which was designed to highlight how supersonic transport (SST) aerodynamics had a place with military aircraft. Over two years it began as a largely theoretical and model-based test study during which it was determined that a cranked arrow wing shape could provide vastly increased lift without any of the limitations that came with a delta wing when paired with an F-15A fuselage.

According to the website AVGeekery.com General Dynamics invested heavily in the research and development of the delta-winged F-16XL and it partnered with NASA to test more than 150 different configurations. That included some 3600 hours in NASA wind tunnels.

In March 1981 the Air Force announced that it was looking to develop a new advanced tactical fighter to replace the F-111 Aardvark and General Dynamics entered the F-16XL in the competition.

Two prototypes were built and these featured a fuselage that was lengthened by 56-inches while the modified aircraft lacked the ventral fins which weren't required due to the delta wing that provided stability characteristics superior to the original F-16. However despite the fact that the wing was larger and the fuselage length increased the ""XL"" was not meant to stand for ""extra large"".

F-16XL Explained:

From the tests General Dynamics and the Air Force were able to demonstrate that the F-16XL could deliver double the range or payload of the original F-16.

""The F-16XL flight-test program has conclusively demonstrated that the XL performs as predicted"" explained D. Randall Kent vice president and program director for General Dynamic's F-16XL program in a 1983 interview with Air Force Magazine. ""This performance level represents a significant increase in mission capability for USAF. Coupling this with the affordability and low risk of the F-16XL presents USAF with a viable way to increase mission capability while simultaneously growing to a forty-wing TAC force structure.""

The F-16XL seemed to have all the merits the Air Force could have wanted and yet in the end it opted to go with the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. Among the factors was that the F-16XL would have required far more effort time and notably more money to put into production – while the Strike Eagle's two engines meant it had more thrust and the ability to carry more weapons.

The ETF contract was awarded to McDonnell Douglas and the two F-16XL prototypes were returned to the Air Force. The aircraft were placed in storage at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) Mojave California and that could have been the end of the story.

However in 1988 the aircraft were taken out of storage and provided to NASA for further research. After receiving serial numbers #849 and #848 the planes were used in a program designed to evaluate aerodynamics concepts to improve wing airflow during sustained supersonic flight. Both aircraft were used in a variety of experiments that only concluded in 1999.

The aircraft were then placed in storage at NASA Dryden but in 2007 NASA approached Lockheed Martin – which had acquired General Dynamics' aviation business – to conduct further tests on the feasibility of returning one of the prototypes to flight status. However the program ended in 2008 and both were retired and returned to storage.

One of the two F-16XL's now remains in storage at the Air Force Flight Center Museum at Edwards while the other is on display at the Museum Air Park.

The company's planned announcements of a corporate transaction and quarterly earnings were overshadowed by a viral social media episode with one of its top-selling cereals Cinnamon Toast Crunch at the center.

It started Monday when Jensen Karp a Los Angeles comedy writer posted on Twitter a picture of what appeared to be sugarcoated shrimp tails from his box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. His modest fame helped elevate the post.

From there General Mills was in the social media minefield that has trapped many companies. Customer service problems especially ones that normally take time to investigate can quickly go viral on social media and work their way into click-hungry news publications.

By Tuesday the New York Times had joined other outlets amplifying Karp's complaint and the initial public reaction from General Mills in which the company said on Twitter that what Karp thought were shrimp tails appeared to be ""an accumulation of the cinnamon sugar that sometimes can occur when ingredients aren't thoroughly blended.""

Social media influencers breathlessly documented the play-by-play between the comedian and the company. The event led to a frenzy on Twitter Instagram and TikTok where jokes abounded like a reworked General Mills logo that replaced ""Mills"" with ""Krills"" and images of cereal boxes renamed ""Cinnamon Toast Crustaceans.""

For Golden Valley-based General Mills one of its best-known products was getting enough negative attention to pose a risk to its reputation.

""There is potential for this thing to become worse than it is right now"" said Akshay Rao a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota. ""The fundamental issue is consumers might lose trust in your brand and your product.""

Anything related to contaminated items near the body — be it food clothing or cosmetics — creates an inherent ""disgust aversion"" Rao said.

Rao said the company made a mistake with the ""accumulation"" statement because it suggested Karp was wrong. ""That is a very very bad choice"" Rao said. ""The customer is never wrong.""

In an e-mail Tuesday night Karp said he was frustrated no one higher up at the company had yet reached out to him. He said it was unfair that staffers on the company's social media team had to be the company's face. The speed at which a social media post can spread makes these customer-facing decisions more critical. Corporations have dedicated social media managers with varying levels of responsibility and pressure.

The airline industry for instance is one where the customers are constantly airing their grievances on social media. The airline's social media employees respond to these complaints around the clock to both allay their customers' travel discomforts but also protect its brand's reputation.

The ""Cinnamon Toast Shrimp"" situation quickly rose up the chain of command at General Mills. On Wednesday the day the company announced its quarterly results chief executive Jeff Harmening knew all about it and was prepared to address it.

""We take food safety very very seriously whether it is this case or it is others before it"" Harmening told the Star Tribune that day.

""We are confident given the nature of what we see that this didn't take place in our manufacturing facility but it still leaves open the question of what exactly happened and that's what we are trying to investigate"" he said.

Los Angeles comedy writer Jensen Karp with wife Danielle Fishel Karp who played Topanga on “Boy Meets World.”

Because Karp sent images of tape over the cereal bag and the presence of string or dental floss the company suspects the cereal was tampered with after it left its production facility. Food manufacturers are highly regulated on food safety with those as large as General Mills having their own extensive protocols and teams dedicated to ensuring a safe supply chain.

Since 2017 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated dozens of food recalls with foreign objects such as pieces of metal or plastic and others related to ""extraneous animal matter"" or ""extraneous material"" found in food products.

So far the shrimp saga appears to be an isolated event. The FDA has not received any consumer complaints related to shrimp remnants found in Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

If it turns out that Karp's clusters are shrimp tails that did not originate at the General Mills factory it's ultimately on the company to smoke out where the tampering occurred said Rao. ""To the extent that someone is tampering with your product"" Rao said ""it's your product that you have to defend and protect.""

By Wednesday the new conversation on social media had changed. Karp went silent on social media after a number of women publicly accused him of past emotional abuse and others in the L.A. creative class relayed allegations of intellectual property infringement and other questionable professional conduct.

Karp did not respond to follow-up e-mails on Thursday and Friday.

His last post on Wednesday suggested he was working with General Mills to send in samples of the supposed shrimp tails for testing via courier. General Mills said in its latest statement Thursday that it was working with Karp to obtain samples ""conduct a thorough investigation and take appropriate next steps.""

On Thursday the viral moment appeared to be nearing its end. One person summed up on Twitter: ""Twitter is wild. One second we're all appalled by shrimp tails in cereal the next we're exposing that same guy for being an abuser. Amazing. Never change y'all. We are judge jury and executioner.""

To start the months-long Grape Nuts shortage is over and for anyone who turns to old-school sugary cereals to satisfy a sweet tooth we learned that shrimp tails were allegedly found in a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Yes pretty gross right? Naturally this sent cereal lovers on a deep-dive for answers.

Cereal maker General Mills has insisted that there is no earthly way that a man found actual shrimp tails in a box of their cinnamon-sugar dusted squares. However the alleging party seems pretty confident of what he says he discovered inside. Bringing further speculation to their debate is the fact that while these two sides spent part of the week duking it out over Twitter the world has learned more details that have made this whole thing even more trippy.

Grocery Shortages to Expect in 2021 According to Expert

Among all of us who are entirely uninvolved but still curiously invested in the saga it seems the jury's split on Cinnamon Toast Crunch ""shrimp-gate"": Some consumers around the country vehemently stand by the belief that food quality standards should be wholly unbending. After all when it comes to vigilance over hygiene allergens and just not grossing customers out of course it's most optimal not to find evidence of discarded marine life in one's cereal bowl.

But the opposing crowd is shrugging this one-off with some far more stunned after realizing that at some point in time General Mills deleted the three cartoon chefs from the original Cinnamon Toast Crunch box. (When did Chef Wendell disappear? General Mills explains he and his two colleagues were taken off the front of the box in 2009.)

The truth is this is far from the first time an unsavory foreign object has been reported inside breakfast food. We've rounded up some of the grossest things found in breakfast foods in recent decades—just one word of caution that you may not want to scroll this list while you're eating.

A cockroach in McDonald's hash browns

In 2012 a Reddit user posted a picture of a half-eaten McDonald's hash brown with a roach inside. Afterward he reported the chain made it up to him with a breakfast coupon for the same meal.

A glove in toast

In 2008 a woman in Northern Ireland had just made some toast when she suddenly sensed she was munching on fabric fibers. It turned out that an oven mitt had baked into her loaf of bread and had partially disintegrated during the baking process. The BBC reported that the company which manufactured the bread was fined £750 or what would have been about $1200 at the time.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

A mouse in a can of beans

Beans are a popular part of some breakfasts in Great Britain. In December 2011 a customer in the United Kingdom found a dead mouse in a can of store-brand beans from the grocery brand Sainsbury. An investigation led to the detection of bean starch in the mouse's stomach and the grocer paid £8000 (about $12000 at the time).

The Worst Breakfast Foods on the Planet

A black widow spider in grapes

In 2010 a Boston man and his son were reportedly eating a bag of Anthony's brand grapes from Whole Foods when they noticed a tangle of webs inside the bag just as something crawled out. That something was a black widow spider which is highly venomous. According to United Press International the store removed the brand from its shelves refunded the two men and stated that they ""inspect all of our produce … prior to it being merchandised on the sales floor."" They wisely took the all-natural angle by adding: ""Unfortunately these things happen from time to time with fresh produce. Spiders are part of the natural environment where grapes are grown.""

A scorpion in bananas

In 2014 a British woman discovered a live scorpion in a sealed bunch of bananas she'd bought from a supermarket chain in Wales. We previously reported that the three-inch poisonous arachnid had traveled 5000 miles from its native Costa Rica with the banana shipment and that the woman released it to the custody of a nearby zoo.

Canadian companies don't have to tell you,"Despite having to disclose many details about ingredients specific allergens  calorie counts and other nutritional information on labels food manufacturers are not required to include the amount of added sugar a product contains and don't have to disclose that information to an inquiring consumer a CBC Marketplace investigation has found.

As part of its latest investigation Marketplace reached out to the Coca-Cola Company General Mills and Campbell Canada asking how much added sugar is in some of their popular products: Coca-Cola's Vitaminwater calcium orange General Mills' Liberté organic vanilla 0% yogurt and Campbell's condensed tomato soup.

Only one company told us how much added sugar is in its product — and it turns out they don't have to.

""I'm not surprised"" said David Hammond  professor and university research chair in public health at the University of Waterloo.

""I don't think it's in their interest to talk about just how many of their products and at what levels they add sugar.""

Under Canada's Food and Drugs Act  Canadian food labels must list the total amount of sugars which includes added sugars and any naturally occurring sugars like those in dairy fruit and vegetables. The labels do not have to specify how much sugar the manufacturer has added to the product often just for taste.

Canadian food labels lacking

In an email Health Canada said ""the Food and Drugs Act and its regulations do not permit the declaration of added sugars information in the nutrition facts table.""

However Health Canada told Marketplace that ""Consumers are free to contact manufacturers directly to seek additional information about foods or ingredients that are not on the list of priority allergens or about added sugars in a product. While many manufacturers will provide such information there is no obligation on the part of the manufacturer to do so.""

Dietitians recommend limiting daily added sugar intake and the World Health Organization (WHO) and Heart & Stroke Canada  among others offer guidelines.

The WHO recommends limiting daily ""free sugars"" to 25 grams or six teaspoons for maximum health benefits. ""Free sugars"" include not only added sugars but also the sugars naturally present in fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Heart & Stroke Canada recommends Canadians ideally consume less than five per cent or six teaspoons of added sugars a day.

David Hammond found added sugar in over 40000 packaged food and beverage products found on Canadian store shelves. (David Hammond)

Back in 2015 Hammond researched the presence of added sugar in over 40000 packaged food and beverage products available on Canadian store shelves by analyzing the ingredient list. He found added sugar in two-thirds of products and he doesn't believe anything has changed in the years since the study was published.

""It's not just cookies and cakes. Most Canadians would be surprised to learn that some of the leading sources of added sugars are things like yogurt bread"" said Hammond.

Amount of added sugar tough to uncover

Marketplace bought the Vitaminwater yogurt and soup products and tried to determine how much added sugar was in each.

With only total sugar required on a Canadian food label Marketplace worked with registered dietitian Stefania Palmeri to work out the nutrition math.

Liberté organic vanilla 0% yogurt and Liberté organic plain 0% yogurt. Plain yogurts generally have only naturally occurring sugars and no added sugars. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Liberté’s organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving. (David MacIntosh/CBC)

Liberté's organic vanilla 0% yogurt has 19 grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving.

In contrast there is just five grams of total sugar per ¾-cup serving in Liberté's organic plain 0% unsweetened yogurt.

Palmeri's best guess is that compared to the plain version the vanilla yogurt has a whopping 14 grams of added sugar per ¾-cup serving or about three teaspoons. Four grams of sugar is equivalent to about one teaspoon.

""We're not sure how much of this is added but we're still not doing well if this is the first thing we start with in the morning"" Palmeri said.

When Marketplace asked General Mills how much added sugar is in the yogurt the company said it follows Health Canada labelling regulations which include the labelling of total sugars in the product.

U.S. does disclose added sugar on food labels

Campbell's tomato soup was an interesting case.

Unlike in Canada added sugar is now listed on all nutrition facts labels in the United States — including the label for Campbell's tomato soup. That's because it's now required in the U.S. under new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On its U.S. website  the American Campbell's tomato soup is listed as having eight grams of added sugar per 240-millilitre serving.

WATCH | Here's how much added sugar is in this tomato soup:

Added sugar in your soup? The label won’t tell you how much Duration 2:38 This tomato soup has added sugar. But you won’t find how much on Canadian nutrition labels.

When Marketplace called Campbell's Canadian consumer line no information about added sugar was provided for the product sold in Canada. However later in emails Campbell's said it is ""prohibited"" by the Food and Drugs Act from including added sugar on the label but did explain that the tomato soup it sells in Canada has 11 grams of added sugar in one 250-millilitre (one-cup) serving.

Despite the slightly larger serving size that is still more sugar than the U.S. product.

""I don't think most people have an awareness of how many places added sugars can be hidden"" said Palmeri.

""When you're looking at a tomato soup thinking 'I'm trying to eat more vegetables' you wouldn't expect one of the ingredients to be glucose-fructose.""

Coca-Cola the owner of Vitaminwater products refused to tell Marketplace how many of the 32 grams of total sugar in its product are added sugar.

However it did say ""too much sugar isn't good for anyone"" and noted that it offers many low- or zero-sugar drinks including zero-sugar Vitaminwater.

Palmeri suspects all of it is added considering the second ingredient in the water is cane sugar. In the U.S. the label for Vitaminwater orange lists 27 grams of sugar all of it added.

Time for change

Hammond says consumers deserve to know about added sugar in their food.

""We need to do something because the status quo certainly isn't helping consumers at all"" he said.

Canadian consumers were consulted about new food labels back in 2013 and 2014. In the ""Consulting Canadians to Modernize and Improve Food Labels "" report Canadian consumers requested that new food labels include a daily maximum value for sugar as well as the breakdown of ""naturally occurring"" and ""added"" sugars.

But industry stakeholders pushed back  questioning the scientific basis of requiring that added sugars be on nutrition labels ""given that the body metabolizes naturally occurring and added sugars in the same way.""

Industry stakeholders also expressed other concerns including the cost of declaring added sugar information on labels and cited U.S. research that found consumers had a ""limited understanding"" of what added sugar means.

It's not clear which companies or manufacturers participated in the pushback.

In emails Marketplace asked Health Canada why added sugar will not be on the new nutrition labels  which are currently rolling out across the country.

Health Canada replied that feedback in 2014 indicated that Canadians found the information about added sugars ""confusing.""

Health Canada also said it determined that having an added sugars declaration would be inconsistent with the WHO guideline on sugars  which recommends that people reduce their consumption of free sugars and not just of added sugars. Health Canada also told Marketplace it believes that information on the new labels — including the ""% daily value"" (DV) and a new footnote indicating ""5% or less is a little 15% or more is a lot"" — will help educate consumers.

(Health Canada)

Health Canada also introduced the requirement to group sugars-based ingredients together within the list of ingredients following the term ""sugars."" The agency says that ""Together these new requirements will support reduction in Canadians' sugars intake.""

Hammond strongly disagrees and says research shows more Canadians were able to identify the presence of added sugar in a product when information for added sugar was clearly indicated on the nutrition label.

""Canadians are trying to make healthier choices … and one of the things they care about is how much added sugar is in there"" he said.

""This should not be rocket science.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ud2l0aW1lcy9uYW1lL3J1ZG9scGgtbGVuY2lvbmktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9ODAxNzI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rudolph Lencioni Obituary (2021) - Saint John IN - The Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nwitimes/name/rudolph-lencioni-obituary?id=8017278 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ud2l0aW1lcy9uYW1lL3J1ZG9scGgtbGVuY2lvbmktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9ODAxNzI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzg2NDgwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for George Kotsonas,"George Kotsonas

The complex will feature a combination of ""Main Street"" retail space along Parkway Avenue a mix of restaurants and commercial space lining the Center's entrance and a community of new residential rental units with a 10000-square-foot clubhouse. Bike and walking paths will line the community's neighborhoods.

Rental options range from two-bedroom two-bath flats to two-bedroom townhomes with dens and attached garages.

When completed the 80-acre development will have more than 90000 square feet of retail space and more than 14000 square feet of office space in four live/work buildings.

Approved by the Ewing Township Planning Board in 2016 Ewing Town Center will transform the site of the General Motors plant that was built in 1938 to make auto parts. In World War II the plant was converted to produce aircraft for U.S. Navy. After the war the plant returned as an automobile manufacturer and made headlines as the site of the world’s first industrial robot in 1961. The plant closed in 1998.

They are asking for an hour-long Zoom meeting with her or in the alternative her resignation.

That's according to a full-page ad on page 3A in Sunday's Detroit Free Press accusing Barra of refusing to meet with them ""consistently over time and after multiple requests.""

The ad is signed by the heads of the seven Black-owned media companies including rapper and actor Ice Cube who co-founded pro-basketball league BIG3 TV and film production company Cubevision and Contract with Black America (CWBA) which he started with the goal of initiating dialogues about racism.

Also signing the ad is native Detroiter Byron Allen head of Allen Media Group and former NBA player Ulysses “Junior” Bridgeman who bought Ebony Media last year after bidding $14 million for it in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

In response to the ad GM said it aspires to be the most inclusive company in the world and that includes how it allocates its advertising expenditures.

""We have increased our planned spending with both diverse-owned and diverse-dedicated media across our family of brands"" said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey in an email. He did not provides specifics.

'No one happy with GM'

The Black-owned media group wants GM to allocate at least 5% of its ad budget to Black-owned media companies said Allen in an interview with the Free Press on Sunday.

The ad says ""less than 0.5% goes to media companies owned"" by African Americans calling that ""horrendous considering that we as African Americans make up approximately 14% of the population in America and we spend billions buying your vehicles.""

Allen said the group could recommend 14% of the budget be spent on advertising with Black-owned media companies “that would be economic parity we’re not even asking for parity we’re asking for inclusion.”

But Morrissey said GM spends more than .5% of its media budget now with Black-owned media. While he declined to provide specifics he said it is increasing and it is “much higher than .5%.”

Allen said the men who signed the ad have known each other for years. For the past five years they have been reaching out to Barra asking for a meeting to win more of GM’s advertising. But Barra does not respond he said.

About two weeks ago the group sent an email again to Barra. This time GM's Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl responded indicating she would meet with them instead Allen said. That was the final straw that prompted the group to compose the ad which Allen said is currently running only in the Free Press.

“If you say status quo is OK that’s wrong. That is racism. Let me be clear that is racism. But if you get to the table and you lean in to effectuate change then you are showing the world who you really are” Allen said. “This is an opportunity. The numbers will never lie. You’re either doing business with Black-owned media or you’re not in a fair and equitable way.”

Right now GM is the group's focus because it is the automaker that has shown ""a great deal of institutionalized racism against Black-owned media"" Allen said.

As for Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Allen declined to comment on their ad spending until he speaks to the rest of the group but he said “GM is where we checked all the boxes and no one is happy with GM.”

GM's view on its cultural change

Since May 25 2020 the day that a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of black man George Floyd resulting in Floyd's death GM has been outspoken in denouncing racism.

Amid the protests that followed Floyd's death Barra penned a letter to all employees saying she will commission and chair an Inclusion Advisory Board made up of internal and external leaders. Its goal is to make GM ""the most inclusive company in the world.""

GM has set aside $10 million to donate to organizations that will support racial equality.

In May 2020 Toyota Motor North America and GM each made the 2020 DiversityInc. Top 50 list — the only two car companies recognized. Toyota surged to No. 10 from No. 18. GM ranked No. 30.

Likewise on June 19 a date known as Juneteenth celebrating the end of slavery in the United States GM had all employees take 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence to support the Black community. That was the length of time the officer knelt on Floyd's neck.

More:GM's Mary Barra pens letter to workers amid George Floyd protests

Last week when speaking at the JP Morgan Global ESG conference Thursday Barra said GM is making ongoing progress toward diversity. All of GM's 250 managers worldwide are charged with changing the workplace culture she said.

""We continue to have conversations that make people a little uncomfortable because we believe once you’re aware of a situation and understand it better it’ll lead to change"" Barra said. ""We’re very aware of changing the culture of the company. Our goal is to create an environment where people can be their true self at work. If you can’t be your true self I would think that would be exhausting and how can you do your best work?""

Morrissey said GM is developing initiatives like the Chevrolet “Real Talk Real Change” a platform to promote discussions about race.

Also it has projects such as “More than That with Gia Peppers” where the journalist has conversations about Black America.

""We’ve partnered with the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters on a content series for Black American listeners produced and distributed by underrepresented businesses"" Morrissey said. ""In this same spirit we will continue to have an open dialogue with Mr. Allen.""

Systemic racism

But in the ad the Black-owned media leaders said Barra's talk is just that — all talk.

""You stand on stage after the death of George Floyd saying 'Black Lives Matter' when you have refused to acknowledge us"" the ad reads. ""The very definition of systemic racism is when you are ignored excluded and you don’t have true economic inclusion.""

The ad said the group has no interest in meeting with Wahl who was McDonald’s CMO from 2015 to 2018 and ""severely neglected minimized and discriminated against"" Black-owned media companies during her time in that job the ad said.

The ad is signed by the following:

'Meet or quit'

In the ad the men write that it is intended to publicly ask Barra to end the systemic racism and meet with them.

""We are requesting a one hour Zoom meeting with you and several of your key board members and us the largest Black Owned Media companies in America so we can resolve this very important issue and have a long-term partnership that’s mutually beneficial for General Motors and the African American consumers"" the ad reads.

""Mary we and others firmly believe that if you continue to hold the position that Black Owned Media doesn’t deserve meaningful economic inclusion and we are not worth meeting with then you should resign effective immediately"" it ends.

Allen said the purpose of the ad was to promote transparency into GM's spending given it's a publicly-owned company. He would be happy to make the Zoom call public he said.

“Mary should get on the Zoom call and talk to us and she should pledge that a minimum of 5% of her budget will go to black-owned media not to be confused with black targeted media"" Allen said. ""We can’t deposit her words. There isn’t a bank who would take a deposit of her words.”

When asked if Barra will meet with Allen and the others Morrissey said ""GM marketing and advertising executives have met often with Mr. Allen and his team and are committed to continuing to have an open dialogue.""

Diversity at the top

The ad ran three days after GM named Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum to its board of directors the company touting in a news release the additions as an expansion of the board's diversity. Whitman is the former CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tatum is deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association.

GM now has 13 directors seven of whom are women making GM the only automaker with more than half its board filled with women according to website 50/50 Women on Boards which tracks the gender composition of corporate boards in the Russell 3000 Index.

More:GM just became only automaker with board of directors that's majority women

Of the women on GM's board one identifies as Hispanic one as African American and one as Asian African American said GM spokesman Jim Cain.

Barra said on Thursday that the diversity of GM's board is a competitive advantage as GM works toward selling all light-duty zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

But the ad specified that it is seeking Barra's business as Black-owned media ""not minority owned media because minority includes white women and large corporations like General Motors can hide behind and tout their minority records while continuing not to do business with Black Owned Media companies.""

If Barra continues to avoid meeting with the group Allen said ""Her board should take a good look at somebody who won’t do a Zoom call and the numbers won’t be corrected. I think she’d be ill advised to not meet with us and know us and do business with us. The truth is we’re here to make GM better.”

The oil-rich nation has invested millions across the sporting world the report by the human rights organisation Grant Liberty says from chess championships to golf tennis and $60m alone on the Saudi Cup the world’s richest horse-racing event with prize money of $20m.

The report published next week also details the Kingdom’s $650m ten-year deal with Formula One whose world championships begin this Sunday and for the first time will include a race in the port city of Jeddah.

Grant Liberty’s analysis outlines the momentous scale of Saudi Arabia’s investments in what they term “sportswashing” the practice of investing or hosting sporting events in a bid to obscure the Kingdom’s poor human rights record and tout itself as a new leading global venue for tourism and events.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the Kingdom’s “Vision2030” masterplan five years ago a sweeping strategic plan intended to reduce Saudi Arabia’s economic dependence on oil. But the plan touted as a watershed that will transform the Kingdom socially as well as economically was followed by a broad crackdown on dissent including the arrest of feminist activists and religious clerics.

The Kingdom has also spearheaded an intervention in Yemen part of a war that has killed over 100000 people including at least 12000 civilians. Observers estimate that at least two-thirds of these deaths were caused by Saudi Arabia’s aggressive campaign of airstrikes.

A recently declassified US intelligence report named MBS as ultimately responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The Guardian recently revealed that a senior Saudi official issued what was perceived as a death threat against United Nations investigator Agnès Callamard to her colleague in January last year following her investigation of Khashoggi’s murder.

Meanwhile the Kingdom has spent big to secure involvement in global sporting events part of efforts to present Saudi Arabia as a newly business-friendly forward-thinking nation. This includes $145m in a three-year deal with the Spanish Football Association and $15m in appearance fees for a single Saudi International men’s golf tournament. It also includes $33m to host the Saudi Arabian Masters snooker tournament in the Kingdom and $100m for the boxing match known as “Clash on the Dunes” between Andy Ruiz Jr and Anthony Joshua in 2019.

Saudi Arabia also cut a $500m 10-year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2014 one where female performers were banned from appearing until two years ago.

“Saudi Arabia is trying to use the good reputation of the world’s best loved sports stars to obscure a human rights record of brutality torture and murder” said Grant Liberty’s Lucy Rae who accused Saudi Arabia of “committing human rights abuses on an industrial scale”.

“The world’s leading sports stars might not have asked to be part of a cynical marketing plan to distract the world from the brutality – but that’s what is happening” she added.

Grant Liberty compiled reported figures of deals between entities controlled by the Saudi state such as the organisation Visit Saudi and NEOM the body overseeing construction of a futuristic $500bn city in the desert but not individual members of the Saudi royal family meaning the $1.5bn figure is likely an underestimation of the true scale of the Kingdom’s investments in sports.

Also included is analysis of deals that never came to fruition following an outcry including a $6m offer to footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to be the face of the Kingdom’s tourism body Visit Saudi and a controversial $400m takeover-bid for Newcastle United.

The Kingdom has also entered pending bids for forthcoming events including $200m for the Tyson Fury vs Joshua boxing match set to take place later this year and $180m in sponsorship for Real Madrid through the Qiddiya project a tourism and entertainment megaproject in Riyadh under the umbrella of “Vision 2030”.

“Vision 2030 has set the creation of professional sports and a sports industry as one of its goals. That will not only potentially provide employment for thousands of Saudis but it will also improve the quality of life for everyone living in the kingdom” said Fahad Nazer spokesperson for the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington when asked about Grant Liberty’s findings.

He added: “The kingdom is proud to host and support various athletic and sporting events which not only introduce Saudis to new sports and renowned international athletes but also showcase the kingdom’s landmarks and the welcoming nature of its people to the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjYvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtbGVuZGluZy1hcHBzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lending Apps in India Shame Borrowers Who Can't Pay Money Back,"HYDERABAD India — The harassing calls began soon after sunrise.

A year since nations around the world started declaring lockdowns in a bid to control the contagion. While Covid-19 has been subdued ever so slightly even now it continues to hammer the world at large and various states continue to make fiscal and monetary adjustments to support battered economies.

Among the few positive lessons a year of pandemic has left us with is that cashless economies are very much possible and beneficial in times of emergencies like the one created by Covid-19. Keeping this in view a host of developed nations are moving towards adopting digital currencies at the national level. China has completed trials of its digital yuan while the Euro Zone and Canada are also bracing to introduce digital currencies.

Detailing its plans in a statement the European Central Bank said that a digital euro would guarantee that citizens in the euro area can maintain costless access to a simple universally accepted safe and trusted means of payment. It elaborated that the digital euro would still be a euro like the banknotes but digital.

“It would be an electronic form of money issued by the Eurosystem (the ECB and national central banks) and accessible to all citizens and firms” it said. “A digital euro would not replace cash but rather complement it.” According to ECB a digital euro would give customers an additional choice about how to pay and contribute towards financial inclusion alongside cash. While developed nations are working on digitalising entire currencies the developing world seems to be far away from even digitalising payments to their true potential.

Superficial ‘digitisation’

Lets take a look at where Pakistan stands in terms of cash economy. When Covid-19 emerged in Pakistan the central bank introduced a handful of measures to reduce the use of cash. The schemes were initiated in light of the findings that Covid-19 traces could be found on cash and that cash payments would require consumers to visit banks shops and other institutions that would raise the risk of Covid-19 infections.

From March to June 2020 digital payments all over Pakistan soared in the wake of a nationwide lockdown and many not so tech savvy people learned and adopted the use of online payments to meet day-to-day expenditure.

“Although cash on delivery remains the most preferred mode of payment use of debit/credit cards and Interbank Fund Transfer (IBFT) has risen in both volume and value terms during this period” stated a report from the State Bank of Pakistan. “The increasing trend of the already high level of cash penetration in the economy continues to undermine efforts to enhance the digital payments system infrastructure in the country.”

It pointed out that the existing customer base of e-commerce platforms also tended to avoid making cashless payments.

Speaking to The Express Tribune Telemart Co-founder and Director Hamza Abdul Rauf confirmed that digital payments on his platform doubled since Covid surfaced in March 2020 but this was because the number of orders soared.

“Since the increase in the number of orders was largely similar to the rise in digital payments I would say there was a negligible increase in them.”

The preference of people for digital platforms increased after Covid hit the country but they remained averse to digital payments because cash on delivery option was available.

Many other firms confirmed that the trend of digital payments had indeed risen during lockdown from March-June 2020 however it declined steeply after lockdown was lifted and cash was injected in the economy.

Adnan Shaffi CEO of Priceoye.pk said that digital payments on his platform rose just 15% on a year-on-year basis which was way below the true potential.

However he cherished that diverse segments of the economy were now moving towards digital payments which could be attributed largely to central bank’s measures.

“Now even allied businesses of out platform have started demanding payments digitally as opposed to cash” he said. “Our vendors who earlier insisted on dealing in cash now want payments to be done through digital means.”

According to him the push to digital payments and marginal contraction in cash economy was coming from commercial banks which were in turn being pushed by the central bank to steer digital payments in the economy.

He added that banks had been directed to enhance efforts aimed at improving the digital payment infrastructure of Pakistan.

Far below potential

An expert from financial sector on the condition of anonymity said many firms that offered only cash on delivery options had also started implementing digital payments in wake of Covid-19. “Moreover the growing digital payment ecosystem gave a drastic push to digital payment gateways because in the past few months a lot of private firms introduced diverse payment gateways.”

In addition international payments through digital means were made easier and secure through SBP’s measures.

A lot of companies in the financial sector particularly those specialising in mutual funds micro lending and investment platforms created their mobile application and offered cashless investment opportunities he said.

Similarly many commercial banks updated the digital applications to offer cashless payment services as the country was being gripped by the coronavirus.

Tez Financial Co-Founder and Business Head Naureen Hyat said that her company which specialised in digital financial inclusion saw number of customers rise on the digital application after March 2020.

“Our app offers different financial solutions ranging from lending to insurance and savings” she said. “After Covid-19 hit Pakistan we revised the lending criteria and turned it tougher however customers still increased on the application.”

When asked if the pandemic had boosted the fintech ecosystem of Pakistan she said it had given it a marginal push because it was still far below the true potential. Profits have indeed risen but in fintech space the amount of new customers matter more than the earnings and there is a lot of prospects to enhance consumers.

Giving insights on contraction of cash economy Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITeS (P@SHA) Chairman Barkan Saeed expected the trend of digital payments to rise in future because e-commerce was gaining traction in Pakistan. He underlined that the e-commerce sector was steering digital payments in every nation.

“If the government desires to significantly narrow down the cash economy it should support the e-commerce platforms because they are most crucial institutions with regard to raising digital payments” he said.

Hurdles remain

The Telemart and Priceoye.pk officials flagged high merchant discount rate (MDR) as the prime hurdle in way of enhancing digital payments in Pakistan.

Shaffi said that MDR rate stood between 2% to 3% which affected consumers’ preference of paying digitally and encouraged them to adopt cash on delivery mode. A commodity costing Rs30000 could become costlier by an additional Rs1000 due to high MDR and given that Pakistan is still in the midst of a pandemic shoppers would want to save the Rs1000 and opt for cash on delivery option he said.

Rauf said that brands like food and clothing could absorb MDR fee but digital platforms were unable to do so because profit margins were already quite narrow. He said that MDR on point of sales (POS) machines was 1.3% to 1.4% but few digital platforms were paying over 3% in MDR.

“Government should turn it the other way round and minimise MDR on digital platforms to discourage cash economy and to encourage people to pay through cards for their purchases” he said. “We discussed this issue with banks but no consensus could be reached.” According to him a drop in MDR would incentivise digital platforms to recommend customers to pay digitally as opposed to cash.

Both officials called for reduction in MDR to give a boost to digital payments.

Shaffi pointed out that another problem hindering online payments was that few banks demanded a picture of credit/ debit card and ID card of customers to approve online payments. “These days if an online platform asks for these particulars it triggers a sense of fear among customers who believe it to be fraud” he said.

In addition banks sometime reject transfer of payments from customers to e-commerce platforms if the condition is not fulfilled and it usually happens after two weeks of purchase which means that the consumer has received and used the merchandise he pointed out. Reaching out to him after two weeks of purchase and presenting the case of rejected payment can affect the image of business and also encourage consumer to consider the business a scam.

He appreciated that SBP was working at a rapid pace to enhance the use of digital payments and narrow down cash economy.

Though the speed is generally good given the fact that Pakistan is a developing nation it is quite low compared to the global initiatives he said.

He firmly believes that digital payments would persist even after Pakistan becomes Covid free.

Central bank’s push

In the past one year the SBP has taken countless measures to discourage the use of cash in Pakistan. These measures were introduced in light of the findings that Covid-19 traces could be found on cash and that cash payments would require consumers to visit banks shops and other institutions which would raise the risk of Covid infections.

Initially the SBP acted to reduce the need for consumers to visit bank branches or ATMs and in this regard it resorted to promote the use of digital payment services such as internet banking and mobile phone banking. In March 2020 SBP instructed commercial banks to waive all charges on fund transfers through online banking channels such as Inter Bank Fund Transfer (IBFT) and SBP’s Real Time Gross Settlement System for customers. The SBP claims this incentivised people to transfer money through mobile phones or internet banking because they were earlier averse to such a method in wake of additional costs.

“Consumers will not incur any cost in case of using ATMs or visiting bank branches for transferring large amounts and can avoid the use of cash” SBP said.

Banks were advised to facilitate customers in using online banking while taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of customer’s funds.

Keeping in view the low digital banking and mobile banking penetration in Pakistan SBP ensured that call centres/helplines of all banks were available round the clock for instant customer support.

This in particular helped give a boost to cashless banking in Pakistan because addressing of complaints was one of the main issue of consumers who were forced to adopt digital payments. In addition SBP instructed the financial sector to facilitate education fee and loan repayments through internet banking or mobile devices. “Financial institutions shall also run awareness campaigns through different channels to educate customers to use internet banking or mobile phones limit use of currency notes and restrict branch visits” it said.

Anticipating frauds in the wake of digital transactions SBP advised the financial industry to increase vigilance on digital channels and enhance monitoring on cyber threats.

In this regard SBP Governor Reza Baqir held a meeting with presidents and high ranking officials of all banks and urged them to use all available means of communications including advertisements in print and social media for promotion of digital banking and cash less payments and funds transfers.

In October 2020 SBP launched the FX Regulatory Approval System (RAS) for end-to-end digitalisation of Foreign Exchange (FX) related case submission process. The initiative was aimed at providing a fully digitalized platform to the business community and individuals in approaching banks for their foreign exchange related requests.

The scheme helped transform forex operations by replacing the paper-based requests with electronic submissions which is not only efficient but also cost effective. This development is also congruent with the Government of Pakistan’s vision of Digital Pakistan.

Baqir said that SBP worked with various public and private sector entities for providing alternate delivery channels for payments.

Speaking at a conference late last year he said that SBP has also fast tracked the licensing application process for EMIs which will help to accelerate digital payments by the non-bank players.

Last month SBP announced introduction of Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV) Chip and PIN compliant payment cards to improve payments to online e-commerce services.

They will be able to make payments up to Rs. 3000 by just tapping the card on POS machines and no PIN will be required.

Consumers will also be able to make loan repayments through cards.

State Bank has directed the banks to implement all these measures by June 30 2021.

The measure aimed at further strengthening the security of digital payments and curtailing the risk of frauds is a culmination of SBP’s efforts that started in 2016 outlining a detailed roadmap for adoption of EMV Chip and PIN standard for payment cards in Pakistan. Banks have also been directed to step-up their efforts to facilitate customers in case they face any issue while using their payment cards.

Taking notice of consumer complaints regarding delays in receiving refunds after resolution of disputes SBP has directed all banks to immediately credit customer accounts once they receive fund from either merchants or acquiring banks. The regulator has also directed banks to facilitate their customers in registering their complaints and disputes using mobile apps and internet banking portals without the need for physically visiting branches.

Enhancing the drive towards digitization of payments SBP has also directed all banks/microfinance banks to take measures to facilitate their borrowers in making repayments of loans such as consumer loans auto loans etc. digitally using internet and mobile banking applications of any bank.

Raast

On January 11 2021 SBP launched Pakistan’s first instant payment system Raast.

The scheme is a milestone in SBP’s broader strategic agenda of digitalisation and increasing financial inclusion in the country.

Launching the system Prime Minister Imran Khan termed it an important step towards fulfilling the government’s vision and commitment to effectively promote and encourage digitalisation of the economy.

“Raast will provide digital easy-to-use efficient and cost-effective payment options to people of Pakistan and expected to be a catalyst for providing sustainable opportunities to small businesses and individuals” he said.

He was hopeful that Raast would help government resolve current inefficiencies in various types of payments such as salary and pension and further improve disbursements under Ehsaas Program and BISPs amongst other areas.

According to SBP governor the system would provide cheap and universal access to people of Pakistan especially those who are financially excluded and less privileged like women.

The central bank hopes that the system would help spur economic growth especially by facilitating small businesses and individuals.

The system is expected to go live in June 2021.

Talking about Raast P@SHA Chairman Barkan Saeed held the view that payments systems were a thing of private sectors and governments were not supposed to make and run payment gateways.

Due to this reason he was uncertain over the success of Raast.

“Government should encourage the private sectors to make digital payment gateways and provide conducive environment to them to diminish the cash economy” he said.

Saeed lamented that companies that are abiding with all regulations are the ones to be affected the most when government amends laws or changes regulation.

He urged the government to introduce stringent regulations against unregistered firms that operate solely on cash to move to a cashless economy.

Tax evasion is rife in Pakistan and it is one of the reason why many firms do not enter the documented economy he said.

He recommended the government to relax the overall regulatory framework to make significant headways in moving away from the cash economy.

He pointed out that all across the world startups were leading digital payments and not banks.

He added that two of the most popular payment gateways of Pakistan Easypaisa and Jazz Cash were not created by banks.

He agreed that once payment platforms are introduced banks play a vital role in steering their adoption but they are not the ones to introduce them.

“Paypal the most prominent global digital payment system was a startup and it was not created by a bank” he said. “Similarly Wechat Pay was also a startup in China and now it is leading digital payments in the neighbouring nation.”

He stressed upon the country to enable the private sector to take a lead in digital payments.

He was of the view that if Pakistan had relaxed regulations Paypal would’ve extended its services here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L211bWJhaS9tYWxhZC1nbG9iYWwtc2Nob29sLWludmVzdG9yLWluLXRpZmYtb3Zlci1ub24tcGF5bWVudC1vZi1kdWVzLWluLW11bWJhaS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTcyOTI5MS5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9tdW1iYWkvbWFsYWQtZ2xvYmFsLXNjaG9vbC1pbnZlc3Rvci1pbi10aWZmLW92ZXItbm9uLXBheW1lbnQtb2YtZHVlcy1pbi1tdW1iYWkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxNzI5MjkxLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malad global school investor in tiff over non-payment of dues in Mumbai,Mumbai: An international school in Malad has been asked to vacate its premises by the majority stakeholder an asset investment company which alleged that there has been a delay in payment of lease rentals financial fraud through breach of escrow and wilful default of rent. However the school’s trust claimed that the investor did not honour the agreement of infusing promised equity in entirety forcing it to stop all rental.VJTF Infraschool Services (Mumbai) Private Limited (VIS) 56.5% stakeholder has terminated its lease deed with Pratiksha Foundation Charitable Trust (PFC) for the property and building of Witty International School Malad alleging defaults in payment of rent of Rs 12.5 crore and additional Rs 23 crore for breaking minimum lock-in period of 15 years. The company has asked the trust to vacate the lease premises. The school is affiliated to ICSE & Cambridge Boards and is catering to 1810 students.However PFC trustee Vinay Jain said after the agreement the company invested Rs 47 crore and failed to infuse the additional equity of Rs 51 crore by March 2020. “With no additional funds we want to terminate the deal. We have invited the company to sit across the table and allow us to settle the matter and buy back stakes. We are also pursuing the matter legally and approaching NCLT” said Jain.A VIS spokesperson said that as a SEBI fund they cannot invest more than 25% of their corpus in one entity and hence the decision to go in for a second round of fund infusion was cancelled. “In February 2016 we envisaged that we would raise Rs 500 crore but we could not raise more than Rs 200 crore so the decision to not invest any additional funds was taken in May 2016 itself” he added.While Jain used to pay Rs 85 lakh as lease rental to VIS the amount was increased to Rs 1 crore a month later. VIS which alleged it stopped receiving rentals from December 2019 started defaulting on their loan. In turn PNB Housing Finance Ltd has served a default notice of Rs 51 crore to Cerestra which is the majority shareholder in VIS.Meanwhile as the two companies drag the matter to court matters may worsen for the Udaipur school too where a similar deal has been signed between the same parties. Witty International’s third campus in Borivali however does not have the same investor.

Chairs were on the field. Directional signage was being set up.

It was three days prior and Stapleton a country music star performed that evening in Corpus Christi. By the end of that night his tour was on the verge of cancellation and the brand new Rangers ballpark had a new opening date of TBD — a wait that would seem interminable and financially costly.

“We were all expecting that we would still play baseball and have a normal year” Rangers vice president for business operations Rob Matwick said recently. “None of us could have anticipated what would happen until it did.”

All those cancellations are the basis for the Rangers’ new stadium strategy: Host as many events as possible in front of as many people as possible.

As the Rangers try begin a long-haul rebuilding effort the new ballpark will play a part in that process: Both in terms of being a revenue generator and as a venue that could create a home field advantage on the diamond.

The organization embraced Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order allowing 100% capacity at all venues across the state. To date the Rangers are the only MLB team to fully re-open their ballpark to everyone. It will open at that capacity for two exhibitions this week against the Brewers and then for the Rangers’ home opener against Toronto on April 5.

“No doubt about it” Matwick said when asked if the strategy was to populate the calendar with as many Globe Life Field events as possible. "" A lot of thought and design intent went into making the building usable 365 days a year.”

The stadium has already been used as the Rangers’ home park a neutral site for the playoffs and played host to college and high school tournaments. Graduations and rodeos have also been conducted. Football games have and will be played there as well as concerts luncheons and business meetings.”

Most ballparks are opening at 50% capacity or less with the majority on the low end of that. The Rangers hope allowing for larger capacity can be a driving force in aiding a business that like many in 2020 suffered a great deal financially.

“For our ability to drive ancillary revenue with retail with parking those things are all critical components to the sustainability of our business” Matwick said. “As are special events. Cumulatively it’s all important in terms of how we’ve able to be a viable business.”

Matwick said he and the organization understand the concern some fans might have regarding the full capacity policy. He also added that the team will enforce a mask requirement at the ballpark.

The team will also attempt to keep the roof open when possible. However hot weather could be a cause for closing the roof for games during the season.

Matwick said the responses from fans that have been relayed to him has been mostly positive but not universally so. Some have said they believe it’s too soon and that they won’t be attending opening day.

“The only protocol that changed in terms of mitigation is distancing in the seats” Matwick said. “Distancing and ingress egress concessions stands restrooms masks being required — I think a reasonable person would agree that a mask is a mitigation strategy.

“The only thing that’s changed based on the governor’s order is that we won’t have distancing in the stands.”

The NLCS and World Series were hosted at the ballpark with fans at 25% capacity in October. It was a successful event.

Matwick is excited for Rangers fans to get in the ballpark now and for them to experience home games with a hometown atmosphere. The feedback he wants to get is from those Rangers fans.

As the franchise builds a better on-field product from the ground floor with young prospects the stadium its revenue and its allure will possibly be an asset in that rebuild.

But even if the question of who has been answered season long decisions remain.

The Position Side

The roster here has been pretty much set since the onset of camp with the only question being how many spots the Rays give to the position side on account of who is healthy.

As of right now Ji-Man Choi is trending in the positive direction to be healthy shortly after the start of the year while Brett Phillips seems likely headed to the IL for a longer stint to begin the season.

The #Rays Ji-Man Choi says he resumed baseball activities yesterday and he feels back to normal. — Neil Solondz (@neilsolondz) March 25 2021

Here’s where I believe the Opening Day lineup and bench will likely look like:

C: Mike Zunino (R)

1B: Yoshi Tsutsugo (L)

2B: Brandon Lowe (L)

SS: Willy Adames (R)

3B: Joey Wendle (L)

LF: Randy Arozarena (R)

CF: Kevin Kiermaier (L)

RF: Manuel Margot (R)

DH: Austin Meadows (L)

Bench: C Francisco Mejía (S) UTIL Mike Brosseau (R) 3B/1B Yandy Diaz (R)

Injured List: OF Brett Phillips (L) 1B Ji-Man Choi (L)

Total spots: 12

With Ji-Man Choi unable to begin the season on the roster the Rays have decided to go with a short bench and have an extra pitcher.

Once Choi is healthy the Rays will need to drop one reliever and return to 13 Opening Day position players but it’s Phillips’s return that will complicate things slightly. Assuming health for the selected position players the Rays will likely need to demote Brosseau — one of the few position players with options — to retain the out of options Phillips.

The Pitching Side

The Rays are never going to run conventional roles for pitchers and this year especially will be a challenge of balancing usage with the season expanding back to 162. Pitcher stamina will be an open question for any team in 2021 so the Rays have leaned into the need for flexibility.

Throughout the season this is where you can expect the most moves and changes to occur with plenty of options for the Rays in the minors.

Rotation:

RHP Tyler Glasnow

LHP Ryan Yarbrough

RHP Chris Archer

LHP Rich Hill

RHP Michael Wacha

Injured List: RHP Yonny Chirinos

Bullpen:

RHP Pete Fairbanks

RHP Diego Castillo

RHP Chaz Roe

LHP Cody Reed

RHP Collin McHugh

RHP Ryan Thompson

LHP Jeffrey Springs

RHP Andrew Kittredge

LHP Ryan Sherriff

Injured List: RHP Nick Anderson LHP Jalen Beeks RHP Oliver Drake LHP Colin Poche

Total spots: 14

It’s a mild surprise that the Rays did not fill the back end of the bullpen with multi-inning guys. Among the nine pitchers in the bullpen perhaps Collin McHugh could be considered the longest arm but he has not exceeded 2.0 IP since his last start on May 7 2019.

Instead counting on the early off days and flexibility of options the Rays will start the season with their multi-inning role players LHP Josh Fleming RHP Trevor Richards and RHP Chris Mazza at the “Alternate Site” until the need arises.

All pitchers injured are already on the 60-day list but the position players injured are not yet listed which means the roster technically still at 28 players with the need for two more moves.

The roster does not need to be finalized until Thursday but with neither Choi or Phillips expected to be ready for Opening Day there should be no surprises between now and April 1."

After Abacus collapsed amid the housing crisis Paulson made $1 billion and Goldman's customers lost about the same amount. Goldman ultimately paid $550 million to settle fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 — the largest ever penalty faced by a Wall Street bank. In the settlement the bank didn't admit or deny the allegations.

Goldman advertised Abacus to its clients without disclosing that hedge fund manager John Paulson played a role in selecting its portfolio of subprime mortgages. Paulson's hedge fund Paulson & Co. had placed enormous bets on Abacus' failure.

The case which dates to the Great Recession concerns statements that the investment bank made while it was marketing ""Abacus"" an investment known as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation.

Arguments are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. ET Monday and will be streamed live as the court continues to meet remotely as a precaution against Covid-19.

The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments from Goldman Sachs in a long-running case that could have major implications for shareholders seeking to bring securities-fraud lawsuits.

The shareholders alleged that Goldman was lying when it made claims like ""Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business"" and ""Our clients' interests always come first"" even while marketing Abacus and other CDOs that it had bet against.

Those statements the shareholders said kept Goldman's stock artificially high.

Goldman has argued that the statements the shareholders cited are too vague and generic to be the basis of a securities-fraud case. The bank has also argued that the statements didn't affect the stock price.

While many securities-fraud cases stem from false comments that cause a share price to rise the Goldman shareholders are arguing instead that Goldman's alleged manipulation was ""inflation maintenance"" or preventing the stock from falling. The Supreme Court has never recognized such an argument though some lower courts have acknowledged it.

The shareholders who have been litigating since 2011 are seeking to bring the case as a class action on behalf of all the purchasers of Goldman stock between February 2007 and June 2010.

A district court has twice said that the shareholders may do so and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved that decision in April.

Goldman asked the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit's decision saying that allowing it to stand would be ""devastating"" for public companies. It has called the case the most important securities case to come before the Supreme Court since 2014 when the justices ruled in a case involving oil-field services giant Halliburton.

Goldman attorney Kannon Shanmugam a partner at the firm Paul Weiss wrote in court papers that a loss for the bank would mean that shareholders bringing securities-fraud suits in the future would be able to cite ""boilerplate aspirational statements that nearly all companies make.""

In a friend-of-the-court brief the Society for Corporate Governance wrote that the 2nd Circuit's opinion could have a chilling effect on companies seeking to make statements promoting diversity or opposing harassment in the workplace.

The decision gives ""companies a financial incentive to stay silent on important social issues out of fear that even generalized or aspirational statements will become the basis for allegations of crippling securities-fraud liability"" wrote Jeremy Marwell an attorney for the group and a partner at the firm Vinson & Elkins.

On the other side financial transparency groups have argued that Goldman should be held accountable.

Stephen Hall legal director at Better Markets which filed a brief in support of the shareholders said Goldman's argument was ""strained.""

""As we explain in the brief even before the ABACUS deal the bank's top executives knew full well that they were increasingly engaging in deals that presented stark conflicts of interest and they also knew they had to do a better job of managing those conflicts"" Hall said in a statement.

""Yet any such good intentions were completely abandoned — along with honest disclosures — as the bank aggressively sought to profit from the downward-spiraling mortgage market in 2007 at the huge expense of investors and ultimately shareholders"" he added.

Barbara Roper director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America said a win for Goldman ""would let companies off the leash ushering in a wide range of misleading behavior that could materially harm U.S. investors.""

The Department of Justice under President Joe Biden filed a brief in February that it said was in support of neither party.

In the brief the DOJ urged the justices to reverse the 2nd Circuit's opinion and order the appeals court to consider the case again while giving more consideration to Goldman's argument that its statements were too generic to have affected the share price.

Shanmugam will represent Goldman in Monday's arguments. The shareholders will be represented by Tom Goldstein a veteran Supreme Court lawyer who is known for publishing SCOTUSBlog. Sopan Joshi a Justice Department lawyer will represent the United States.

A decision in the case is expected by the summer.

(Reuters) - A number of large block trades on Friday which investors said caused big drops in the stocks of a clutch of companies has raised speculation about what was behind them with Goldman Sachs said to be a bank involved in the sales. Shares in ViacomCBS and Discovery tumbled around 27% each onFriday while U.S.-listed shares of China based Baidu andTencent Music plunged during the week dropping as much as 33.5%and 48.5% respectively from Tuesday's closing levels.

Investors and analysts on Friday cited large blocks ofshares in both Viacom and Discovery companies as being put inthe market on Friday calling them massive volumes likelyexacerbating the declines. Viacom also on Friday was downgradedby Wells Fargo.

A source familiar with the matter said on Saturday thatGoldman Sachs Group Inc was involved in the large blocktrades.

Bloomberg and the Financial Times on Saturday reported thatGoldman liquidated more than $10 billion of stocks in the blocktrades.

The Financial Times reported that Goldman toldcounterparties that the sales were prompted by a ""forceddeleveraging"" citing people with knowledge of the matter.

CNBC reported https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html that the selling pressure was due to liqudation of positions by family office Archegos Capital Management citing a source with direct knowledge of the situation.

Europe’s biggest insurer is discussing its options with potential advisers said the people asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. While Allianz views Hartford as one of the remaining property and casualty insurance targets with scale in the U.S. it’s also reluctant to enter into a pricey bidding war with Chubb because of a lack of synergies between the two the people said.

Deliberations are in an early stage and Allianz could likely decide against pursuing a deal which would be transformational for the German financial giant that has mostly stayed away from mega transactions the people said.

Representatives for Allianz and Hartford declined to comment on the story.

In spite of its dominance in Europe Allianz has a relatively small footprint compared with Chubb or other peers in the world’s largest economy. A combination of Chubb and Hartford could further marginalize the German insurer in the U.S. which like other insurance companies is battling low interest rates slowing growth and Covid-related business costs.

Among other European insurers Zurich Insurance Group AG isn’t currently considering such a deal according to a person familiar with the matter. The Swiss insurer agreed in December to buy MetLife Inc.’s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion. A spokesperson for Zurich declined to comment.

Hartford rejected Chubb’s proposal earlier in the week putting pressure on Evan Greenberg to sweeten the offer. A post-bid jump in its stock has pushed Hartford’s market value to $24 billion as of Friday’s close. Chubb has a market cap of $71.9 billion while Allianz is worth 87.9 billion euros ($103.7 billion).

Mergers and acquisitions among property and casualty insurers have been active in recent years. It’s the biggest sector within insurance and life coverage has fallen out of favor with many groups due to low interest rates and higher capital requirements.

Allianz’s Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has largely avoided major acquisitions since taking the helm. Still he’s been seeking new avenues of growth including a 2.5 billion euro deal in the past week to acquire Aviva Plc’s Polish life insurance business.

The German company did pursue a takeover of property and casualty insurer XL Group Ltd. in 2018 before losing out to France’s Axa SA which paid over $15 billion for the asset.

U.S. Footprint

Allianz has a life-insurance business in the U.S. and is mainly serving large companies in the country in the property and casualty space. It also owns U.S. bond asset manager Pacific Investment Management Co. or Pimco. Buying Hartford could help expand the business with smaller corporations and any deal could also help make consolidation easier in the future through synergies.

Among the financing options for such a deal include a capital increase raising debt and offering stock. The insurer also has excess cash and could lower the amount of its annual dividend or buyback. In November Allianz canceled a share buyback program that it had suspended earlier in the year as the hit from the Covid-19 pandemic continued to mount.

There’s also history with Hartford. The U.S. company turned to Allianz for capital in 2008 agreeing to pay 10% on $1.75 billion of debt as capital markets froze.

VIEW FROM HARTFORD

Head coach Kris Knoblauch's team snapped an eight-game winless in regulation skid on Thursday with a 4-2 victory against the Providence Bruins on the road. New York Rangers draft pick Morgan Barron scored twice and now has five goals in his last six games while James Sanchez (first pro goal) and Ty Ronning also scored in Hartford's first regulation win since Feb. 11th. Adam Huska (1-1-0) made 23 saves on 25 shots. The Wolf Pack are just 1-4-0-0 at the XL Center where they will play three of their next four games and each of Hartford's next three games will be against Bridgeport. The two teams will play seven times in the month of April.

OTTO IN OT

Otto Koivula’s first goal point and multi-point performance of the season helped the Sound Tigers capture in the win in their first game past 60 minutes. It was Koivula’s sixth career game-winning goal and his second in overtime assisted by Mitch Vande Sompel and Dmytro Timashov. Ten of Bridgeport’s 16 skaters registered at least one point in the 4-3 victory.

BOLDUC'S BIG START

Not only has Samuel Bolduc scored a goal in all three games against Hartford this season but five of his team-leading seven points have come against the New York Rangers’ affiliate including his drive from the deep slot 65 seconds into the third period on Mar. 18th that gave Bridgeport its first lead. Bolduc is tied for the team lead in goals (three) and assists (four) and is the outright leader in points (seven) plus-minus (+1) and shots (24). No defenseman has ever finished the season leading the Sound Tigers in scoring.

MILESTONE WATCH

Seth Helgeson is expected to play his 224th game with the Sound Tigers today moving past Scott Mayfield (2012-17) for 11th place on the team’s all-time list and closing within two games of Sean Bentivoglio (2007-10) for 10th. Today will also be his 492nd pro game while fellow defenseman Parker Wotherspoon is likely to make his 197th pro appearance (all with Bridgeport).

GOLYSHEV LOANED FROM ISLANDERS

The Islanders announced on Friday Mar. 19th that Anatolii Golyshev their fourth-round draft pick in 2016 has agreed to terms on a one-year two-way deal for the 2020-21 season and was subsequently loaned to the Sound Tigers. He has not yet joined the team. Golyshev notched 27 points (12 goals 15 assists) in 53 games with Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) earlier this season and ranked fifth on team in scoring. The Perm Russia native had 208 points (103 goals 105 assists) in 366 career games with Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg over parts of eight seasons in the KHL.

Epic Games has partnered with Hasbro to launch a new Fortnite figurine based on an iconic character from the Zero Point Crisis storyline: The Foundation. The figurine measures 6-inches in height and can be posed using any of its 20 points of articulation. As you'd expect the company is also limiting the number of units that can be ordered by a single customer.

The Foundation is the fourth member of The Seven; he made an appearance during the solo narrative experience that kicked of Fortnite Chapter 2 – Season 6 working with Agent Jones to deal with the Zero Point crisis. Now fans can get the character as a toy/collectible from Hasbro.

The figurine is part of the Victory Royale Series — it includes the skin's Brella Glider and back bling cape seen in the game. The collectible model features a considerable amount of detail for what is essentially a toy though kids can certainly play with it given the number of articulation points.

This is the first character from 'The Seven' to be released under the Victory Royale Series; it's reasonable to assume we'll see others arrive over time. Buyers can expect special packaging that is unique to The Seven figurines according to Hasbro.

Though the toy has been revealed you can't quite get it yet. Hasbro is accepting preorders for The Foundation at $39.99 USD but shipping isn't scheduled to start until April 1 with the charge for the toy going through at shipping time. Likewise the company is limiting orders to two units per customer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNnbWFnb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZvcnRuaXRlLWFuZC1oYXNicm8tdGVhbWluZy11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fortnite and Hasbro Partner for Season 6.,"Fortnite has teamed up with popular toy company: Hasbro to release The Foundation: Zero Crisis Edition—a Season 6 action figure.

The famous battle royale is no stranger to the toy scene with dozens of action figures based on characters from past seasons and an entire line of Nerf guns dedicated to the franchise. The Foundation is one of the newest introductions to Season 6 and a must have figure for any collector.

On Hasbro’s official site they list why to buy The Foundation: Zero Crisis Edition and make note that it is one of seven figures to be released in the collection. They also note:

The Foundation: Zero Crisis Edition ‘Brella Glider

Though who voices The Foundation hasn’t been officially announced we reported earlier this month that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson himself has had fans buzzing with rumours that this could be him. “The Rock” is no stranger to being an action figure between his WWE career and his role in popular Disney film Moana but this will be his first appearance as a Fortnite name.

The figure is recommended for ages eight and up and notes a choking hazard for anyone under the age of three. The Foundation: Zero Crisis Edition is available for pre-order now for $39.99 with a limit of two per customer. The action figure will be set to ship April 1st 2022 according to Hasbropulse.com so get your orders in!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2ZvcnRuaXRlLWhhc2Jyby10aGUtZm91bmRhdGlvbi16ZXJvLWNyaXNpcy1maWd1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Reveals Fortnite Figure for The Foundation Zero Crisis Character,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2ZvcnRuaXRlLWhhc2Jyby10aGUtZm91bmRhdGlvbi16ZXJvLWNyaXNpcy1maWd1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9mb3J0bml0ZS9lcGljLWdhbWVzLXJldmVhbHMtZm9ydG5pdGUtdGhlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24temVyby1jcmlzaXMtZWRpdGlvbi10b3ktc2V0LWhhc2Jyb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Epic Games reveals Fortnite The Foundation: Zero Crisis Edition toy set by Hasbro,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/fortnite/epic-games-reveals-fortnite-the-foundation-zero-crisis-edition-toy-set-hasbro on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9mb3J0bml0ZS9lcGljLWdhbWVzLXJldmVhbHMtZm9ydG5pdGUtdGhlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24temVyby1jcmlzaXMtZWRpdGlvbi10b3ktc2V0LWhhc2Jyb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Miles a freshman won his first race in his first high school track and field meet on Saturday at the Hershey/St. Pat’s Invitational.

“For the whole race I was just drafting behind everyone on the stretch” he said. “I had enough energy where I was like ‘You might want to win this two mile.’”

His time of 10:55.85 edged out Kuncl’s by four seconds and he beat third place Colin Rooney of Sandhills Valley by about seven.

Miles also ran cross country in the fall and he said preparing for those races helped him compete in the spring as a long distance runner.

“Getting a base from cross country and having a knowledge of how to kind of run my race” said Miles of what he picked up from cross country.

Mullen’s Callie Coble crossed the finish line in the girls 3200-meter so early that it made a runner she had previously overlapped believe she was done.

The junior long distance runner earned a time of 12:43.26 and was the only girl to finish under 13 minutes. She beat out second place Landyn Cole of South Loup by about 42 seconds.

“It felt pretty good for the first two miles” Coble said. “I’ve never run it before.”

But just like Miles Coble ran cross country in the fall so the 3200-meter wasn’t anything too new.

“Thought I may as well do the two mile in track” Coble said. “I feel like I know how to pace myself better now. And definitely in a lot better shape than I used to be.”

Coble a junior planned on running track last season before COVID-19 shut it down. To stay in track and cross country shape Coble ran along the dirt roads by her family’s ranch or on a treadmill.

“I would just go out and run in the mornings” Coble said.

St. Pat’s junior Hayley Miles had a strong showing on the 100-meter dash. She cruised to an easy victory in her prelim heat and in the finals her 13.51 was enough to capture first.

“It’s awesome” Miles said. “I was super sad last year and now it’s just really exciting. I have so much adrenaline.”

Miles said she was looking forward to getting back out on the track last season after a strong end to her freshman campaign.

“I ended last year very well went out really high” Miles said. “So I was so excited to see how much of that would come back the next year. When it wasn’t here it was really hard.”

Sutherland’s Chance Elwood competed in long jump on Saturday and recorded a personal best 19 feet and 11.5 inches to come in first.

“I lifted weights pretty hard” Elwood said. “I did a lot of squats and stuff. I just worked really hard in the weight room. And then worked on form and technique.”

He said he wants to hit 22 or 23 feet by the time district competition rolls around. But for now Elwood is improving and is happy to be back out.

“I was just looking forward to it all through the pandemic and quarantine” Elwood said. “I was just waiting for this.”

They are asking for an hour-long Zoom meeting with her or in the alternative her resignation.

That's according to a full-page ad on page 3A in Sunday's Detroit Free Press accusing Barra of refusing to meet with them ""consistently over time and after multiple requests.""

The ad is signed by the heads of the seven Black-owned media companies including rapper and actor Ice Cube who co-founded pro-basketball league BIG3 TV and film production company Cubevision and Contract with Black America (CWBA) which he started with the goal of initiating dialogues about racism.

Also signing the ad is native Detroiter Byron Allen head of Allen Media Group and former NBA player Ulysses “Junior” Bridgeman who bought Ebony Media last year after bidding $14 million for it in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

In response to the ad GM said it aspires to be the most inclusive company in the world and that includes how it allocates its advertising expenditures.

""We have increased our planned spending with both diverse-owned and diverse-dedicated media across our family of brands"" said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey in an email. He did not provides specifics.

'No one happy with GM'

The Black-owned media group wants GM to allocate at least 5% of its ad budget to Black-owned media companies said Allen in an interview with the Free Press on Sunday.

The ad says ""less than 0.5% goes to media companies owned"" by African Americans calling that ""horrendous considering that we as African Americans make up approximately 14% of the population in America and we spend billions buying your vehicles.""

Allen said the group could recommend 14% of the budget be spent on advertising with Black-owned media companies “that would be economic parity we’re not even asking for parity we’re asking for inclusion.”

But Morrissey said GM spends more than .5% of its media budget now with Black-owned media. While he declined to provide specifics he said it is increasing and it is “much higher than .5%.”

Allen said the men who signed the ad have known each other for years. For the past five years they have been reaching out to Barra asking for a meeting to win more of GM’s advertising. But Barra does not respond he said.

About two weeks ago the group sent an email again to Barra. This time GM's Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl responded indicating she would meet with them instead Allen said. That was the final straw that prompted the group to compose the ad which Allen said is currently running only in the Free Press.

“If you say status quo is OK that’s wrong. That is racism. Let me be clear that is racism. But if you get to the table and you lean in to effectuate change then you are showing the world who you really are” Allen said. “This is an opportunity. The numbers will never lie. You’re either doing business with Black-owned media or you’re not in a fair and equitable way.”

Right now GM is the group's focus because it is the automaker that has shown ""a great deal of institutionalized racism against Black-owned media"" Allen said.

As for Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Allen declined to comment on their ad spending until he speaks to the rest of the group but he said “GM is where we checked all the boxes and no one is happy with GM.”

GM's view on its cultural change

Since May 25 2020 the day that a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of black man George Floyd resulting in Floyd's death GM has been outspoken in denouncing racism.

Amid the protests that followed Floyd's death Barra penned a letter to all employees saying she will commission and chair an Inclusion Advisory Board made up of internal and external leaders. Its goal is to make GM ""the most inclusive company in the world.""

GM has set aside $10 million to donate to organizations that will support racial equality.

In May 2020 Toyota Motor North America and GM each made the 2020 DiversityInc. Top 50 list — the only two car companies recognized. Toyota surged to No. 10 from No. 18. GM ranked No. 30.

Likewise on June 19 a date known as Juneteenth celebrating the end of slavery in the United States GM had all employees take 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence to support the Black community. That was the length of time the officer knelt on Floyd's neck.

Last week when speaking at the JP Morgan Global ESG conference Thursday Barra said GM is making ongoing progress toward diversity. All of GM's 250 managers worldwide are charged with changing the workplace culture she said.

""We continue to have conversations that make people a little uncomfortable because we believe once you’re aware of a situation and understand it better it’ll lead to change"" Barra said. ""We’re very aware of changing the culture of the company. Our goal is to create an environment where people can be their true self at work. If you can’t be your true self I would think that would be exhausting and how can you do your best work?""

Morrissey said GM is developing initiatives like the Chevrolet “Real Talk Real Change” a platform to promote discussions about race.

Also it has projects such as “More than That with Gia Peppers” where the journalist has conversations about Black America.

""We’ve partnered with the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters on a content series for Black American listeners produced and distributed by underrepresented businesses"" Morrissey said. ""In this same spirit we will continue to have an open dialogue with Mr. Allen.""

Systemic racism

But in the ad the Black-owned media leaders said Barra's talk is just that — all talk.

""You stand on stage after the death of George Floyd saying 'Black Lives Matter' when you have refused to acknowledge us"" the ad reads. ""The very definition of systemic racism is when you are ignored excluded and you don’t have true economic inclusion.""

The ad said the group has no interest in meeting with Wahl who was McDonald’s CMO from 2015 to 2018 and ""severely neglected minimized and discriminated against"" Black-owned media companies during her time in that job the ad said.

The ad is signed by the following:

'Meet or quit'

In the ad the men write that it is intended to publicly ask Barra to end the systemic racism and meet with them.

""We are requesting a one hour Zoom meeting with you and several of your key board members and us the largest Black Owned Media companies in America so we can resolve this very important issue and have a long-term partnership that’s mutually beneficial for General Motors and the African American consumers"" the ad reads.

""Mary we and others firmly believe that if you continue to hold the position that Black Owned Media doesn’t deserve meaningful economic inclusion and we are not worth meeting with then you should resign effective immediately"" it ends.

Allen said the purpose of the ad was to promote transparency into GM's spending given it's a publicly-owned company. He would be happy to make the Zoom call public he said.

“Mary should get on the Zoom call and talk to us and she should pledge that a minimum of 5% of her budget will go to black-owned media not to be confused with black targeted media"" Allen said. ""We can’t deposit her words. There isn’t a bank who would take a deposit of her words.”

When asked if Barra will meet with Allen and the others Morrissey said ""GM marketing and advertising executives have met often with Mr. Allen and his team and are committed to continuing to have an open dialogue.""

Diversity at the top

The ad ran three days after GM named Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum to its board of directors the company touting in a news release the additions as an expansion of the board's diversity. Whitman is the former CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tatum is deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association.

GM now has 13 directors seven of whom are women making GM the only automaker with more than half its board filled with women according to website 50/50 Women on Boards which tracks the gender composition of corporate boards in the Russell 3000 Index.

More:GM just became only automaker with board of directors that's majority women

Of the women on GM's board one identifies as Hispanic one as African American and one as Asian African American said GM spokesman Jim Cain.

Barra said on Thursday that the diversity of GM's board is a competitive advantage as GM works toward selling all light-duty zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

But the ad specified that it is seeking Barra's business as Black-owned media ""not minority owned media because minority includes white women and large corporations like General Motors can hide behind and tout their minority records while continuing not to do business with Black Owned Media companies.""

If Barra continues to avoid meeting with the group Allen said ""Her board should take a good look at somebody who won’t do a Zoom call and the numbers won’t be corrected. I think she’d be ill advised to not meet with us and know us and do business with us. The truth is we’re here to make GM better.”

Now plans are advancing to raze International Palms and replace it with a $300 million four-star-plus Westin-branded oceanfront resort with 502 rooms.

“They say a rising tide raises all boats"" the developer Driftwood Capital CEO Carlos Rodriguez Sr. told the Cocoa Beach City Commission on March 18.

""And quite frankly when you are getting rid of the ugly duck that basically charges very little for its rooms — and you’re replacing it (with) a hotel that generates $300-$350 room nights — all the other hotels in the area will be able to raise rates"" Rodriguez said.

The City Commission unanimously approved first reading of the project's development agreement and rezoning. Commissioners will consider the ordinance's second final reading during Thursday's meeting which starts at 7 p.m. at City Hall.

Driftwood Capital bought International Palms for $23 million in October 2016. If commissioners approve the ordinance Thursday Rodriguez said he hopes to demolish the aging 16-acre complex at 1300 N. Atlantic Ave. by year’s end.

The target Westin opening date: early 2024.

Driftwood Capital is a Coral Gables private firm that owns Hilton Cocoa Beach Oceanfront and Crowne Plaza Melbourne Oceanfront in unincorporated Indialantic along with a nationwide portfolio of hotels.

Rodriguez said the Cocoa Beach Westin will be a resort destination where visitors spend “many days.” Plans call for:

The largest conference center in Brevard County.

Tennis bocce ball shuffleboard basketball and pickleball courts.

A deep-water wave pool for surfers.

Topgolf Swing Suites.

A resort pool with cabanas and a kiddie pool.

A day spa and salon.

The Westin redevelopment project has involved four years of extensive City Hall negotiations said Randy Stevenson building department and development services director.

“This particular project represents probably the largest redevelopment project in Cocoa Beach in my memory” Stevenson said.

International Palms has 11 buildings that were constructed during phases in 1963-64 and 1978-79 with internal renovations added in 2004. The hotel has 502 rooms more than any competitor on the Space Coast.

From September 2016 to September 2019 Cocoa Beach police received 2155 calls at the property — ""many of them drug-related and far in excess of any other resort area in the city"" a City Commission easement ordinance said.

Nick Miller a Kimley-Horn & Associates engineer told commissioners nearly 50% of the International Palms site is covered with impervious material. This sends “significant” polluted stormwater runoff into the State Road A1A drainage system and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon.

Miller said the Westin project will decrease impervious surfaces by 22% and incorporate an underground stormwater retention system.

Rodriguez said the project will incorporate today’s public beach-access easement that extends across the property. This easement will serve as a landscaped “central spine” leading past a coffee shop a diner a beach club and a gelato shop.

Representatives of the nearby Marlin Condominiums and Sandcastles Condominiums asked commissioners to be kept in the loop regarding plans on demolition construction a proposed loading dock off Tulip Avenue and other items.

Commissioner Skip Williams and Stevenson said the Westin project still has to go through the building permit process and many details will be resolved later.

The Duke of Sussex has announced that he has accepted the role of chief impact officer at billion-dollar coaching and mental health company BetterUp.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco–based firm confirmed the news to BAZAAR.com adding that they are excited to have Harry officially on the team.

In a blog post Harry shared why he joined the business which has a network of more than 2000 coaches across the United States working with companies and organizations such as Hilton Worldwide Chevron NASA and Salesforce Ventures.

“My goal is to lift up critical dialogues around mental health build supportive and compassionate communities and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations. And my hope is to help people develop their inner strength resilience and confidence” he wrote. “I firmly believe that focusing on and prioritising our mental fitness unlocks potential and opportunity that we never knew we had inside of us. As the Royal Marine Commandos say ‘It’s a state of mind.’ We all have it in us.”

He continued “Being attuned with your mind and having a support structure around you are critical to finding your own version of peak performance.

“What I’ve learned in my own life is the power of transforming pain into purpose.

“During my decade in the military I learned that we don’t just need to build physical resilience but also mental resilience. And in the years since my understanding of what resilience means—and how we can build it—has been shaped by the thousands of people and experts I’ve been fortunate to meet and learn from.”

BetterUp’s mobile-first learning platform connects workers with professionals in coaching counseling and mentorship on a one-to-one basis via phone text or video chat. The duke revealed that he had connected with a BetterUp coach before officially taking on the role.

“I was matched with a truly awesome coach who has given me sound advice and a fresh perspective” he explained. “And because we believe in strengthening our own mental fitness our entire Archewell team also has access to BetterUp coaching.”

In his new role which he has already began work on Harry will drive advocacy and awareness for mental health guide BetterUp’s social mission and impact work on product strategies and help expand their global community of coaches and members. When travel is safe the duke will occasionally travel to the company’s San Francisco headquarters.

CEO Alexi Robichaux who was introduced to Harry last year via a mutual friend wrote in a statement “We are energized by his model of inspiration and impact through action. As a true citizen of the world he has dedicated his life’s work to bringing attention to the diverse needs of people everywhere and advocating for mental health initiatives: from founding the Invictus Games a platform for service personnel to use sport as part of their psychological and physical rehabilitation to launching Sentebale which supports the mental health and wellbeing of young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.”

The Wall Street Journal reported that though the duke won’t be managing employees or have direct reports he will participate in “all-hands meetings” and will be expected to appear at special company events. Last month BetterUp raised $125 million in a round of financing that pushed the value of the company which was founded in 2013 to just more than $1.73 billion.

Posted on: March 28 2021 10:23h.

Last updated on: July 19 2021 02:53h.

Celebrities and reality television stars were among those on hand Thursday to christen the Mohegan Sun Casino at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas the city’s newest casino resort.

The event at the off-Strip resort was a historic occasion as it marked the opening of the first tribal-operated casino in the Las Vegas Strip area.

The casino resort brings together several big names in the hospitality and leisure industry as the Virgin Hotel is part of the Hilton Curio Collection. JC Hospitality owns the property.

The Mohegan casino features 650 slot machines and nearly 60 table games across a 60000-square-foot gaming area. A Betfred sportsbook is also slated for the property. The hotel features more than 1500 rooms across three towers and the resort includes a five-acre pool an event lawn and a 4500-seat live stage theater.

Among those on hand at the event were Saved By The Bell star and Access Hollywood host Mario Lopez and Matt James the latter the lead on season 25 of The Bachelor.

Casino Grand Opening Delayed

The new casino resort is on the grounds of the former Hard Rock Hotel which closed in February 2020 for the extensive remodeling and rebranding project.

At the time the Mohegan Sun Casino at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas was expected to open that fall. However the grand opening was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials announced the March 25 opening date last month.

JC Hospitality President and CEO Richard Bosworth noted the struggles the region endured over the past year at the grand opening gala.

May Las Vegas live in a world where we never have to close doors again to our resorts” Bosworth said at the door-opening event.

The exact investment amount was not released. However Bosworth’s LinkedIn page said it was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. More than 300 employees of the Hard Rock Hotel – which was not affiliated with Hard Rock International – were working on the Mohegan Sun’s opening night.

Resort officials are also hopeful its no resort fee policy will help it attract visitors away from competitors from nearby on the Strip.

Mohegan Leadership Changes

On hand for the grand opening was Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment COO Ray Pineault. He’ll become the company’s interim CEO later this week when Mario Kontomerkos leaves the company.

In his remarks at the opening he explained why the event was a special one.

“I know opening casinos may not be a monumental occasion for Las Vegas as you do it regularly. But bringing a Native American tribe to be the first tribe operating in the Strip corridor is a monumental occasion something we’re very proud of” he said.

Meanwhile the man Kontomerkos replaced is back with Mohegan Gaming. On Thursday The New London Day reported that Bobby Soper will become the president of the company’s international gaming division.

Soper’s departure from the company four years ago coincided with his failing to reveal he had an ownership stake in a marketing company that did business with Mohegan Sun Pocono. He paid a $60000 fine to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board."

The bony giant which retailed for $300 turned heads for its extravagant physique this past Halloween. It also garnered quite a number of hits on Google and attention on social media (see the Instagram hashtag #12footskeleton). However once the spooky festivities were over it was back to the attic for this bag of bones... or was it?

In the months following Halloween Home Depot's 12-foot skeleton has continued to make seasonally-appropriate appearances. Most recently it was spotted donning a cheery Easter outfit. Earlier in the year St. Patrick's and Valentine's-themed garbs draped over its gaunt figure. Heck there are even 12-foot skeletons sporting New Years' and Christmas attire. For a character that is supposed to be dead this skeleton is ironically keeping a trend very much alive year-round— both on homeowners' lawns and on social media. It's a decoration that has yet to go out of style.

Now some may argue that it's silly to repurpose a Halloween decoration for other holidays. Usually I would agree — decorating for Valentine's Day or Easter with Halloween decor seems a bit grim. However when it comes to this towering bone structure's recent activity I support it. This larger-than-life skeleton made its debut at the perfect time — a time when we all needed (and still need!) a good laugh. Are you really going to tell me that seeing a gigantic skeleton wearing bunny ears doesn't tickle your insides?

This skeleton doesn't just bring joy to its owners but so many others as well. I bet at this very moment someone is probably walking by a 12-foot skeleton on their daily quarantine stroll and thinking to themselves: OMG is that a skeleton disguised as an Easter bunny!? Or scrolling through social media and getting a good hoot from a photo of the big guy. Can you name any other seasonal decorations that generated this much buzz? I can't. It was honestly in everyone's best interests that this skeleton continued to be displayed past Halloween.

And look we can relate to the poor skeleton: someone who feels dead inside (completely burned out from a global pandemic) yet is still trying to be festive? For many of us holiday celebrations this year weren't what they used to be yet we keep moving forward. We put on our bunny ears and log onto Zoom and think ahead to a time when we can be together with our family and friends. The 12-foot skeleton dressed up in Easter attire is us.

The 12-foot skeleton is truly a one-of-a-kind character a star a pal — one that many of us can relate to. It's a decoration we'll remember years from now and one that will always know how to make us laugh — whether it's on display for Halloween or Easter.

So who else is looking forward to 12-foot Uncle Sam skeletons this July?

Over about three hours the man allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven evaded an officer who'd cornered him on foot stole an officer's police cruiser led a chase through several towns south of Boston and engaged in standoffs with police twice officials said.

What Happened?

On Friday morning an armed suspect later identified as Eric Leach allegedly stole more than $300 from a Rockland 7-eleven according to Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrisey.

Surveillance video from the store shows a man in a black hoodie pointing a gun at the cashiers; both are okay police said. The handgun he used in the store hadn't been recovered by Friday afternoon.

Leach allegedly fled the store and tried to get into at least two people's homes before police spotted him according to 911 calls to Rockland police; then an officer spotted him and cornered him on foot Llewellyn said. Held at gunpoint the man defied orders to surrender challenged the officer to shoot him and then ran around a house -- where he found an officer's unlocked police cruiser which was unlocked despite Rockland police regulations the department's chief said.

Leach attempted to hit officers with the SUV before taking off.

“The officers approached from the front of the vehicle drew their service weapons pointed it at the suspect in the vehicle. [Leach] backed up for about 12 feet put it in drive and then sped towards the officers” Chief John Llewellyn said.

The officers never fired their service weapons he said adding that it was a good decision given state law about shooting at moving vehicles.

Law enforcement expert Todd McGhee former defensive tactics coordinator for the Massachusetts State Police explains the protocol as authorities stopped a stolen cruiser in Quincy and are working to apprehend the person.

Now leading a chase the robber struck a number of other police cruisers on a chase that went through Abington and Weymouth but was stopped on the Burgin Parkway in Quincy where the vehicle was surrounded by police from multiple agencies authorities said.

At one point during the chase an Abington police officer who was taking part lost control of his car on East Water Street in Rockland hitting a utility pole and flipping over. He went to the hospital but is okay according to Llewellyn.

The stolen vehicle stopped off a highway ramp near Home Depot but later maneuvered around a Massachusetts State Police armored vehicle and sped down the parkway.

Officers used tire-deflation devices to once again bring the cruiser to a stop near a BJ's Wholesale gas station about three-quarters of a mile down the parkway. Armored vehicles then pinned the SUV in place according to authorities.

Despite continued negotiations the suspect allegedly opened the door of the stolen cruiser with a police rifle in hand. He had worked the semiautomatic rifle free from a secure mount.

Rockland Police Department

An officer then opened fire and shot the man.

Leach was given first aid after being shot and rushed to Boston Medical Center but he was pronounced dead about 10:15 a.m. Morrisey said.

What We Know About Eric Leach the Man Killed in the Standoff

The armed robber involved in Friday night's standoff has been identified by authorities as Eric M. Leach.

Leach 36 has lived in Brockton and Winthrop according to the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office.

Rockland's police chief indicated in a news conference where he didn't name Leach that Leach had a ""lengthy criminal record"" and had spent time in prison. He said his officers recognized him but didn't know Leach by name.

An armed robbery suspect who barricaded himself inside a Rockland Mass. police cruiser after leading officers on a chase was fatally shot the Norfolk district attorney said.

Court records reviewed by the NBC10 Boston Investigators show Leach was indicted in December 2012 in Plymouth Superior Court on felony counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and assault with serious bodily injury as well as a pair of firearms charges and a misdemeanor count of reckless endangerment of a child.

Then 28 Leach had been wanted for shooting an 8-year-old girl in the leg in Brockton according to The Enterprise.

Leach pleaded guilty in July 2015 and was sentenced to serve three to five years at MCI Cedar Junction followed by three years of probation with credit for time already served while his case was pending court records show.

What We Know About the Injured Police Officer

An Abington Massachusetts police officer was injured Friday morning when his police cruiser struck a utility pole in Rockland and rolled over landing on its roof.

The Abington officer was taken to an area hospital and is expected to be OK.

The officer was assisting Rockland police in catching the fleeing armed robbery suspect who had allegedly stolen a Rockland police cruiser at the time of the accident.

Witness Reactions

Customers at the BJ's Wholesale gas station were told to run by police and some saw the incident unfold up close.

""Panic pure panic"" one witness told NBC10 Boston. ""My heart was pounding. I'm still shaking just imagining it.""

A man in a stolen Rockland police cruiser who'd robbed a 7-Eleven was shot by police after a long standoff officials said. The hourslong incident caused chaos in several Massachusetts towns.

Witness Jason Dove told NBC10 Boston the front of the stolen cruiser was damaged.

""The whole front of it was gone completely smashed up you know it wasn’t going to make it too far"" he said. Authorities ""just T-boned him and that was it. [...]He couldn’t go anywhere at this point.""

The MBTA was asked to shut down the Red Line and commuter rail service in the immediate area and provided shuttle buses between Braintree and Wollaston during the incident.

Red Line and commuter rail service resumed later on Friday.

The incident left at least one neighbor rattled.

""I’m a little nervous to be quite nervous with you"" said Mark Perkins who lives in the area. ""I’m a little shaky.""

About 3 years ago I started regularly applying Alaska Fish Fertilizer to my yard on the advice of Barrels and Branches a fantastic nursery in Encinitas.

My plants were looking sluggish to the point where I was considering a pricey yard overhaul. After one application of fish fertilizer my ginger plants started flowering again and things started perking up drastically.

9 Reasons To Use Fish Emulsion Like Alaska Fish Fertilizer

It’s an organic liquid fertilizer that is safe to use around pets and kids. Fish emulsion is derived from unused fish parts that would otherwise be wasted therefore it’s eco-friendly. Fish emulsion can stink but deodorized versions like Alaska are available. It’s an all-purpose fertilizer that can be used on both outdoor and indoor house plants. Fish emulsion is mild and tends not to burn plants. An essential building block for healthy soil naturally occurring soil microbes thrive and work their best in soil rich in organic matter. It’s easy to spray on your yard using a hose attachment. It works. I’ve seen it with my own eyes and you can check the reviews and ratings at online retailers like Home Depot. A gallon is inexpensive at Home Depot.

How To Use Alaska Fish Fertilizer 5-1-1

It’s very easy. All you need is either a watering can or a hose with a dial and spray attachment. The amount of fish fertilizer to measure per gallon or quart of water is on the back of the Alaska Fish Fertilizer jug. I have the Alaska dial and spray attachment so follow the directions on it. Apply to the area you would like to cover.

In my experience it’s hard to overdose on this product so I do just guess on occasion. When I’m using the hose I make sure the soil is sufficiently moist but avoid puddling.

In a perfect world I’d apply it once a month but realistically it’s once a quarter at the very most. Due to being extraordinarily busy over the last year it has been 6 months between applications and things aren’t looking nearly as good as they should around here.

Plants That Always Improve

Everything does seem to perk up a few weeks to a month after an application but these are the plants that seem to benefit the most:

Lady Palms (the fan palm above)

Orchids

Ginger

Canna

The number reflects both increased testing and a surge in transmission of the virus that has strained hospitals led to shortages in a key antiviral drug and amplified fears about the pace the state lifted restrictions on movement and commerce. And it is a new red mark on the nation’s floundering efforts to combat the virus.

“It has just been horrifically busy” John Toney a professor of infectious diseases at the University of South Florida said of hospitals where patients were flooding in and doctors and nurses were growing overwhelmed and exhausted.

“It’s reminiscent of what everyone dealt with in New York” Professor Toney said. “It’s certainly putting a strain on a lot of the systems even though hospitals are trying to accommodate.”"
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAzLzI3LzMtc3RvY2tzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXdvdWxkLWxvdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks Warren Buffett Would Love,"These three dividend stocks would make perfect additions to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

Warren Buffett one of the greatest value investors of all time is turning 90 this year. Operating from his hometown of Omaha Nebraska Buffett lives in a modest house drives a modest car and enjoys the simple pleasures of life like an ice-cold Coke.

After sticking to the same investing game plan for years Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.07%) (BRK.B 0.10%) portfolio has gotten a fairly considerable revamp over the last few years. For instance trusting the wisdom of his closest Berkshire money managers the company began buying shares of tech growth stock Apple in 2016. Technology a sector that Buffett used to mostly avoid now comprises about 40% of Berkshire's portfolio.

So it's clear that Buffett is willing to go in new directions if the right opportunity comes along. With this in mind perhaps Buffett should consider Starbucks (SBUX 1.05%) Honeywell (HON 0.60%) and United Parcel Service (UPS 0.07%). These companies offer a great combination of market leadership dividends and value.

Here's why Buffett would love all three companies and why they would fit nicely into Berkshire's portfolio.

1. Starbucks

Berkshire Hathaway owns over $30 billion in shares of consumer staple stocks Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. Although Starbucks technically falls in the consumer discretionary category its product line has arguably become more of a staple for consumers than many offerings from Coke and Kraft Heinz. The shift in consumer sentiment away from sugar and preservatives toward healthier options hinders the growth prospects of soda and processed-food companies. Yet Starbucks manages to have a similar level of recession resilience as these companies (with a much brighter future in the forecast).

Starbucks was hit hard by the pandemic but has since reopened nearly all of its stores. Its revenue and earnings are close to pre-pandemic levels with U.S. same-store comps down just 5% year over year as of its most recent quarter. This is impressive considering 60% of its U.S. company-operated stores are still offering limited seating.

Starbucks leaned heavily on grab-and-go ordering and its mobile app during the pandemic. And it worked. Customers are using the app and spending more money per transaction than ever before which bodes well for Starbucks' future.

Since issuing its first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in April 2010 Starbucks has raised its annual payout every single year. Its quarterly dividend is now $0.45 per share which is a yield of 1.7% at today's prices. Starbucks has plans to build new stores focused solely on grab-and-go ordering -- which should help it grow earnings and its dividend for years to come.

2. Honeywell

Just over 2% of Berkshire's portfolio is dedicated to industrial stocks. If Buffett was looking for an industrial to add then Honeywell deserves to be a top contender.

Like most industrial stocks Honeywell suffered revenue and earnings declines last year. As results improved toward the end of the year management said it is now confident that the company can return to growth.

The same factors that hurt Honeywell's 2020 results should help it in 2021. Commercial aviation could rebound as air traffic improves. Higher oil prices and industrial production will help its performance materials and technologies segment. Honeywell's customers delayed building solutions projects in 2020. But in its fourth-quarter conference call Honeywell management announced orders were piling in putting its backlog in a good position for 2021. And finally safety and productivity solutions (SPS) -- the only segment that grew in 2020 -- should continue to benefit from warehouse automation and productivity solutions. SPS ended 2020 with a $4 billion backlog -- double the backlog at the end of 2019. Simply put Honeywell is seeing business pick up in all of its segments.

Aside from an optimistic outlook Honeywell has many qualities that Buffett would love. The company's strong balance sheet history of dividend increases and growth prospects give it long-term value. Despite last year's challenges Honeywell was able to generate tons of free cash flow that more than doubled its dividend payments.

Excess free cash flow continues to give Honeywell the dry powder needed to limit how much debt it adds to its balance sheet. Today its balance sheet remains one of the best of the major industrials.

3. UPS

Ranking 48 out of 48 on Buffett's list of holdings is UPS. So yes Buffett owns the stock. But at 0.003% of Berkshire's portfolio the company's UPS shares could double and it would hardly make an impact.

UPS rival FedEx reported encouraging earnings and guidance on March 18 that showed a strong recovery in business-to-business (B2B) sales and e-commerce growth. This is good news for UPS which would like its B2B volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.

UPS has the makings of a perfect Buffett stock. With 70% higher net income and double the market cap of FedEx UPS is the market leader in its industry. Its adjusted 2020 EPS of $8.23 per share gives it a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of around 19. UPS has a dividend yield of 2.6%. The company just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.02 per share more than double what it was 10 years ago.

UPS has plenty of growth prospects as well. It's leading the distribution process for COVID-19 vaccines a trend Buffett can appreciate seeing as he's been buying healthcare stocks. UPS was also one of the few industrial stocks that crushed earnings throughout 2020 not to mention notching its best quarter ever at the end of the year.

E-commerce is a booming trend that benefits UPS. The company has been expanding its fleet and laying the groundwork for what it expects to be years of e-commerce growth. The pandemic accelerated that trend which was a big part of UPS' strong 2020 performance. However there's reason to believe it will retain much of the business it gained while adding more in the years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The companies have figured out that 3D printer waste including plastic and powder can be recycled to produce injection molded vehicle parts for the F-250 that are lighter cheaper more resistant to chemicals and above all more sustainable.

It's a great example of two companies from markedly different industries working together to become more sustainable. Ford and HP are using waste plastic and powder from 3D printers to create injection-molded fuel-line clips for the Super Duty F-250 truck. Dental company SmileDirectClub which has a small army of 3D printers producing dental aligners is also contributing to the green production line.

Waste from the printers is apparently passed on to a couple of further companies---Lavergne and ARaymond---who turn the recycled matter into fuel clips.

Impressively the recycled fuel clips created from 3D printer waste are 7% lighter and cost 10% less according to Ford and more resistant to chemicals and moisture than their non-recycled predecessors.

Debbie Mielewski a technical fellow at Ford said ""Many companies are finding great uses for 3D printing technologies but together with HP we're the first to find a high-value application for waste powder that likely would have gone to landfill transforming it into functional and durable auto parts."" The research team at Ford has identified 10 other existing vehicles that could benefit from this use of material and are migrating it to future models.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy93YXRjaC10aGUtMS0yNS1taWxsaW9uLTEyMDAtaHAtZHJha28tZ3RlLWJlaW5nLXB1dC10by10aGUtdGVzdC1vbi1hLWZyb3plbi1sYWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch The $1.25 Million 1200 HP Drako GTE Being Put To The Test On A Frozen Lake,"The all-electric Drako GTE has sleek looks and according to the company behind it will also offer tremendous performance. It also looks rather graceful when being driven on ice.

These two videos feature racing drivers Andy Pilgrim and David Hackl testing the car both at the Winter Performance Track in Steamboat Springs Colorado and across Georgetown Lake also in Colorado. While we don’t actually get to hear what the two drivers think of the Drako GTE we are provided with some glamour shots of the all-electric grand tourer.

Watch Also: Jay Leno Doesn’t Seem That Impressed With The Electric $1.2M Drako GTE

From the outside the GTE looks like a bespoke creation but in fact it is based on the Fisker Karma. With a $1.25 million asking price many would expect a hypercar built from the ground-up not one based on an existing vehicle.

For what it’s worth the GTE has powertrain technology distinct from the Karma. This includes a bespoke 90 kWh battery pack that is incorporated into the floor as well as four electric motors that combine to produce 1200 hp and 6491 lb-ft (8800 Nm) of wheel torque. Those are some very impressive figures and according to the company allow the vehicle to hit 60 mph (96 km/h) in around 2 seconds as well as a top speed of 206 mph (332 km/h).

Drako had intended on starting customer deliveries of the GTE last year but this has since pushed back to 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLWdlbWJhbGxhLXR1bmVkLXBvcnNjaGUtOTExLWlzLWEtNjEwLWhwLW1hc3RlcnBpZWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Gemballa-Tuned Porsche 911 Is A 610-HP Masterpiece,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLWdlbWJhbGxhLXR1bmVkLXBvcnNjaGUtOTExLWlzLWEtNjEwLWhwLW1hc3RlcnBpZWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3dhdGNoLWhlbm5lc3NleXMtbWFtbW90aC05MDAtdXBncmFkZWQtcmFtLXRyeC1sYXktZG93bi03MjgtaHAtb24tdGhlLWR5bm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Hennessey's Mammoth 900 Upgraded Ram TRX Lay Down 728 HP On The Dyno,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3dhdGNoLWhlbm5lc3NleXMtbWFtbW90aC05MDAtdXBncmFkZWQtcmFtLXRyeC1sYXktZG93bi03MjgtaHAtb24tdGhlLWR5bm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNkbmF0aXZlcy5jb20vZW4vZm9yZC1ocC0zZC1wcmludC1yZWN5Y2xlZC1tYXRlcmlhbHMtMjcwMzIwMjEv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuM2RuYXRpdmVzLmNvbS9lbi9mb3JkLWhwLTNkLXByaW50LXJlY3ljbGVkLW1hdGVyaWFscy0yNzAzMjAyMS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford and HP Use Recycled 3D Printing Materials to 3D Print New Auto Parts,"After the decision to once again turn to 3D printing for its manufacturing processes Ford has joined forces with HP.

While the primary importance of this feat is of course its reduction of the detrimental impacts 3D printing materials in particular plastics can have to the environment it is also important to note that despite reusing old materials the final parts show no compromise in durability or quality.

“Finding new ways to work with sustainable materials reducing waste and leading the development of the circular economy are passions at Ford” Debbie Mielewski Ford technical fellow Sustainability commented. “Many companies are finding great uses for 3D printing technologies but together with HP we’re the first to find a high-value application for waste powder that likely would have gone to landfill transforming it into functional and durable auto parts.”

First installed on the Ford Super Duty F-250 trucks these recycled materials are currently being used in the manufacture of injection-molded fuel-line clips. Not only do these parts meet the standard of chemical and moisture resistance offered by their conventionally manufactured counterparts but surpass them in terms of lightness (by 7%) and cost (by 10%). As such Ford’s research team have investigated which other parts may benefit of this new material and found ten other fuel line clips on existing vehicles that fit the profile.

While HP 3D printers are intended for and well-suited to high efficiency production their systems and structures are also designed to generate a minimal amount of excess material and reuse as much of the material put into them as they can. HP’s chief sustainability and social impact officer Ellen Jackowski commented “You get more sustainable manufacturing processes with 3D but we are always striving to do more driving our industry forward to find new ways to reduce reuse and recycle powders and parts. Our collaboration with Ford extends the environmental benefits of 3D printing even further showcasing how we are bringing entirely different industries together to make better use of spent manufacturing materials enabling a new circular economy.” Working together Ford and HP have now developed this solution which produces zero waste.

Ford have already incorporated 3D printing technologies in several areas of production. The company hope to one day exclusively use totally sustainable materials in its vehicles. Mielewski commented on how Ford’s collaboration with HP will facilitate the realisation of this goal: “A key to achieving our sustainability goals and solving the broader problems of society is working with other like-minded companies we can’t do it alone” she continues. “With HP we defined the waste problem solved technical challenges and found a solution in less than one year which is something in which we all take pride.”

Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue won their third consecutive world medal at the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships in Stockholm Sweden on Saturday although it wasn’t the color they most wanted.

The three-time U.S. champions poured their hearts and every ounce of their energy into a deeply emotional and technically challenging free dance to a medley of Jeff Buckley and k.d. lang’s renditions of the soulful ballad “Hallelujah.”

The captivating program produced deep edges brilliant ice coverage and seamless steps — nearly everything but the gold medal which went to Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of the Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSR) who led the field with 221.17 points.

“Our performance felt very present and intentional and it is really a joy to skate together when it’s like that” Hubbell said. “But there is also that little dissatisfaction of not reaching our goal of bringing home the gold medal. Right now I’m a little bit numb.”

Hubbell and Donohue who amassed a total 214.71 points won silver for the second time; they also placed second in the world in 2018. In 2019 they won bronze. The 2020 world championships were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We came here for a gold medal and there is definitely disappointment around that … We also know that we are progressing that we are building we are gaining the qualities we want as a team” Donohue said. “We look at this as momentum creating a hunger.”

Entering the free dance the Americans trailed the FSR dancers by a bit over two points after Friday’s rhythm dance. That’s not much in singles’ competition — Nathan Chen overcame an eight-point deficit after his short program to win a third world title earlier in the day — but it is an appreciable amount in ice dance. Still they had high hopes.

“You don’t know the (judges) we don’t know what could happen” Hubbell said on Friday. “We can skate well and come second we could skate OK and win that is the thing. We won’t know when we step out on the ice what it is going to take. We are just going to show our programs all the work we’ve put in and the rest is not our job.”

While there was little Hubbell and Donohue could have done to infuse more performance quality into their program several of their step sequences gained Level 3 — instead of the highest Level 4 — from the technical panel. Their final element circular steps earned just Level 2. This alone likely cost them two points.

“The perfect performance doesn’t exist” Donohue said. “I could probably find you ten things off the top of my head I could have done better — extension stretch pushed a little more.”

“My goal was to be focused on my partner from beginning to end and that’s what I came off with” he added. “We like to talk about (how) we make our own wins and that’s a win in my book.”

Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier climbed from fourth place after Friday’s rhythm dance to claim bronze with 214.35 points.

Madison Chock and Evan Bates — who train alongside Hubbell and Donohue in Montreal Quebec under Marie-France Dubreuil Patrice Lauzon and Romain Haguenauer — entered the free skate in third place and also hoped to win a third world medal. Instead they placed fourth with 212.69 points.

Saturday was the final time the two-time U.S. champions competed their “Snake and Snake Charmer” free dance the program that led them to the 2020 U.S. title as well as the 2020 Four Continents crown.

“It’s been a signature program for us” Bates said on Friday. “The last few days at home training it was really emotional. I think we can use that in a good way tomorrow and bring the emotion we’ve brought in practice. It’s been a big focus of ours to put our hearts and souls into the skating and to let the rest take care of itself.”

The emotion was there on Saturday and the polished highly detailed choreography showed off Chock’s charismatic presence and Bates’ strengths as a partner. But Bates made a minor error on the twizzles (fast one-foot turns). In addition the judges gave them slightly lower program component scores (PCS) than the top three teams.

“Maddie was so excited when we finished. She looked at me and I was like ‘I didn't skate as well as you did babe’” Bates said (he and Chock are an off-ice couple). “There were certainly just a few seconds in the program where I made some technical errors that were obviously costly and honestly we're quite disappointed about it.”

Disappointed too are Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker who performed a haunting free-flowing program — set to a remix of Blondie’s “Heart of Glass” and Philip Glass selections — that had no major errors yet earned a lower score than they had hoped.

“Technically I think we put out a solid performance and met all of the (technical) requirements with a very strict panel here but the judges were looking for something clearly different” Hawayek said. “So we're going to make sure that we get the proper feedback and our coaching team also will be on top of that for sure with us. And we have to go back to the drawing board and come back stronger for next season.”

Despite their disappointment Hawayek and Baker earned 188.51 points to place ninth and equal their best finish at the world championships.

With all three couples placing in the top ten Team USA easily qualified three spots in ice dance for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal was awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington D.C.

Last week the United States Navy awarded a $2.42 billion contract modification to General Dynamics' Electric Boat subsidiary to build an additional Block V Virginia-class submarine equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). The deal was awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington D.C.

The original contract that was awarded in December 2019 was for nine boats with an option for a tenth. With this added submarine the total cost of the contract with prime contractor Electric Boat will be $24.1 billion a net increase of $1.89 billion for the full contract.

Nasdaq reported that General Dynamics has substantially reduced the cost as well as the delivery time of the Virginia-class boats from eighty-four to just sixty-six months while also improving mission capability and ship construction quality. The defense contractor is also one of only two companies in the world that is equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines and as such General Dynamics has enjoyed a dominant position as a navy contractor.

""The 17000 shipbuilders of Electric Boat are pleased to receive the award for the tenth Block V ship and are ready to meet the generational challenge of building the Virginia and Columbia classes concurrently"" Kevin Graney president of General Dynamics' Electric Boat said in a statement that was also posted to Facebook. ""We are grateful for the continued support of our federal delegation who strongly advocated for this important funding.""

According to the Department of Defense (DoD) Electric Boat will continue to work with Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding division on the construction of the submarine. Contract work will occur in Virginia Rhode Island California Connecticut Maryland Arizona Pennsylvania and other areas within and outside the U.S. through February 2030 according to Govconwire.com.

The United States Navy has been focused on strengthening its naval power by upgrading its fleet of missile submarines in response to potential threats from near-peer adversaries including China.

The Virginia-class nuclear-powered cruise missile attack submarines were introduced in the mid-2000s as a replacement to the Cold War-era Los Angeles-class submarine line thirty of which have already been retired. Three of the Virginia blocks were focused heavily on cost-efficiency improvements: Block II slashed roughly $300 million worth of program costs introducing a more efficient production process; the eight Block III subs incorporated a new bow design including a new sonar array and large diameter vertical payload tubes and Block IV brought reduced maintenance periods and lowered total ownership costs to boost the program's sustainability well into the coming decades.

The Block V submarines feature the VPM an 84-foot section of the boat that will serve as an undersea vertical launcher for missiles. Each VPM on the Block Vs provides the capacity for 40 cruise missiles. Additionally with advancements in hypersonic missile technology the Virginia-class's larger launcher will be well suited to host such weapons once they are deployable. The boats can also host the new version of the anti-ship Maritime Strike Tomahawk a part of the Block V upgrade that will begin being delivered to the service later this month.

Now IBM (creator of the Watson AI which famously mastered Jeopardy!) has developed an AI debater that can not only craft arguments in natural human language but also defend them — and it might one day help you make better decisions.

An AI Debater

IBM’s AI doesn’t debate the same way you and your SO might “debate” where to eat for dinner — kicking around vague thoughts feelings pros and cons.

Instead it’s trained to engage in formal debates. Those are the kind where two people on opposing sides of a proposition deliver timed arguments and rebuttals in front of judges.

The best debaters are wordsmiths weaving facts into clear well-organized arguments that hold up under intense scrutiny.

That’s hard enough for humans to do but it’s a seemingly impossible task for an AI. Still IBM decided to attempt it with Project Debater — and the success has been remarkable.

IBM’s Project Debater

For Project Debater IBM trained an AI to sift through newspaper and journal articles looking for claims and evidence to support an argument. That process is called “argument mining” and until recently it was something only humans could do.

But AI has gotten so good that it can now spot the kind of words that indicate someone is making an argument and citing evidence for it.

Trained on these arguments the system could debate topics it’d never tackled before — after just a few minutes of prep time it would have a four-minute long argument ready to go.

The AI debater could also listen to an opponent’s argument and form a rebuttal.

IBM worked on Project Debater for six years before debuting the project in 2018 putting its AI debater up against a human expert in a live event.

The AI debated several other experts the following year and while it scored lower than the humans on average audience members have rated the AI’s performance as “decent” — a major win given the difficulty of the task.

Some audience members who said they were on the opposite side of a topic before the debates were even swayed to change their minds after listening to the AI’s arguments.

The Future of Reasoning

IBM has now published a paper on Project Debater in the journal Nature. It’s also made a dozen of the AI’s underlying technologies freely available to academics and licensable to developers.

Though the AI isn’t yet as convincing as the best human debaters the hope is that it one day may be able to sift through the expansive amount of text online to quickly form well-researched factually supported arguments on complex subjects.

There’s an urgent need for humans to be supported in navigating complex arguments.

Chris Reed

If so the AI debater could eventually be used in an app that you can use when you’re trying to make up your own mind on a topic — you could look at the AI’s arguments and rebuttals then come to a conclusion for yourself.

“(Project Debater’s) successes offer a tantalizing glimpse of how an AI system could work with the web of arguments that humans interpret with such apparent ease” Chris Reed head of the University of Dundee’s Center for Argument Technology who wasn’t involved in the study wrote in a commentary published in Nature.

“Given the wildfires of fake news the polarization of public opinion and the ubiquity of lazy reasoning” he continued “that ease belies an urgent need for humans to be supported in creating processing navigating and sharing complex arguments — support that AI might be able to supply.”

Predictions are made skeptics respond and the vision reboots. The future offers few guarantees. But it also tends to develop over time rather than spring up shockingly new overnight.

In brief After making gradual inroads in drug and materials discovery in recent years artificial intelligence is suddenly appearing in a new light. Autonomous labs that link AI-based data analysis to robotic synthesis and validation are being demonstrated in both academia and industry. These labs prefigure a new work environment in which machines perform many of the traditional functions of researchers. Proponents argue that this self-driven R&D environment will enhance the efforts of multidisciplinary scientists who will maintain ultimate control. Chemical and drug firms are taking a serious look at what may be the lab of the future.

The lab of the future Platonic ideal that it remains has always had a foot in the door. But some say it crossed the threshold to reality entirely last year.

High-tech labs unveiled by academic researchers a computing giant and a major drug company all blend artificial intelligence computing and robotics in ways that may herald a new world of research. They suggest a kind of Renaissance lab for multidisciplinary scientists steeped in chemistry biology and data science.

Alán Aspuru-Guzik a professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto and colleagues reported in Science Advances the discovery of thin-film materials in a “self-driving laboratory” in which AI controls automated synthesis and validation in a cycle of machine-learning data analysis. Andrew I. Cooper director of the Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool and colleagues published results from an AI-directed robotics lab that optimized a photocatalytic process for generating hydrogen from water after running about 700 experiments in 8 days (Nature 2020 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2442-2).

Meanwhile IBM launched a self-driving—or autonomous—lab combining AI with robotics at its research facility in Zurich. And Eli Lilly and Company rang in 2020 with the debut of a self-driving lab at its biotechnology center in San Diego.

“My lab has already been able to close the loop” Aspuru-Guzik says describing a circuit of continuous learning in which AI algorithms guide data analysis and automation toward the identification synthesis and validation of novel molecules. The autonomous lab accesses produces and reprocesses data as it goes along.

You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time.



Alán Aspuru-Guzik professor of chemistry and computer science University of Toronto

These labs aren’t perfect yet and much work and convincing are needed before research managers in the drug and chemical industries embrace them. Observations vary on where the bottlenecks lie in the clocklike loops—some point to the data; others to the robots. But the innovators are unanimous regarding the importance of the third element in the loop: the human researcher.

“This idea of the clockwork laboratory is in the long term not the strongest approach” Cooper says of the notion of a self-sufficient research machine. “The strongest approach is to have the clockwork laboratory with a very permeable interface so that the human knowledge can be captured as well.”

The academics

AI most likely debuted in science fiction with Samuel Butler’s 1872 novel Erehwon or Over the Range. It made news in the real world a quarter century ago when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer took down Garry Kasparov the world chess champion. Kasparov came to terms with his defeat much as the research community has learned to stop worrying and love a machine that accelerates discovery.

“You ask me why I’m doing this; it’s because the world has no time” Aspuru-Guzik says. He points to rapid design techniques in industries such as automotive that rely on advanced materials and the urgency to confront climate change with new materials for storing sun and wind energy. “We have to enter the era of rapid prototyping in materials.”

Researchers say the challenge in accelerating discovery comes down to improving their data sets. That’s a primary function of machine learning in an autonomous lab as it cycles and directs data from synthesis and validation melding them with data from available published literature.

Assembling and fine-tuning a system in Toronto to demonstrate the power of closed-loop autonomous discovery took about a year and a half Aspuru-Guzik says. Once operational the machine was able to produce about 40 molecules in a production run he says “which is more than the number of published molecules in the field I am working on organic semiconductors for laser devices.”

But while the system is intended to support an around-the-clock process it is still operating in discrete runs each averaging a day and a half. “The biggest holdup is not AI” Aspuru-Guzik says. “Data bottlenecks? Zero. The area that is the challenge for getting the self-driving lab to work is the synthesis machinery. The robotics are a little finicky a little hard to control.”

Those robots are the source of the synthesis and validation data necessary for machine-learning algorithms to drive toward discovery. “The point is to generate data on the fly” he says. “That is what you’re getting a robot for.”

The University of Liverpool applied a twist to robotics in its autonomous lab. “It’s ironic that Alán calls his a self-driven laboratory” Cooper quips. “Our robots actually drive.” Indeed robotic agents scoot around a traditional-looking research space in a video released by Cooper’s group. “We decided to automate the chemist not the instrument” he says.

Cooper’s catalyst experiment operated nonstop for 8 days completing about 6500 manipulations in a complex workflow involving solid and liquid handling some under a nitrogen-sealed inert atmosphere and multiple measurements. The mobile robots scooted a total of 2.2 km in a room measuring 5 by 10 m. Cooper says the system can theoretically operate for much longer. “We used 8 different experimental stations” he says. “It could have been 18 or 80.”

As for bottlenecks Cooper also points to robot mechanics. “AI is most powerful when there are multiple choices a wide variety of measurements” he says. But the more involved the experiment the more complex the machinery “and every bit needs to be really reliable. Once you string 10 operations together even a failure point of 0.1% becomes quite significant.”

Regina Barzilay a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colead of the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium notes that AI can run into problems as it operates in new areas of chemical space. But the technology works to solve the problems partly through interaction with a researcher.

“You need to have a mechanism whereby the machine can tell you it needs to look in a particular part of chemical space where it needs to have more training” Barzilay says. “An essential component is to know when the machine is actually not confident in its own prediction which means it needs more help.”

Connor W. Coley assistant professor of chemical engineering at MIT and part of the consortium says advances made in pursuit of the autonomous laboratory reveal the critical importance of the human element. Even if the lab is a closed loop it intersects with an adjacent loop defined by researcher interaction with the machine starting from the word “Go.”

“Humans are always going to set the design objective and specify something that an algorithm can reduce to a numerical optimization” Coley says. “Humans will always be setting the big-picture goal” through rounds of interrogation.

“The big questions include which experiments are accessible to the platform compared to which are needed to prove or disprove the kinds of hypotheses we’re after” he continues. “Another big question is which are the workflows that we can physically automate as steps in the process.”

And there are considerations beyond academic labs like Coley’s. “The interesting question is whether industry is actually going to bite on this or whether it’s some academic bullshit” Cooper says. His laboratory is exploring this question directly: Mobotics a company spun off from Cooper’s lab is pursuing business with materials companies.

Similarly Aspuru-Guzik colaunched Kebotix an AI services firm working with robotics in 2017 when he was at Harvard University. He is also coordinating the launch of a consortium called Acceleration Consortium focused on autonomous technology in materials discovery. Members include industrial and academic researchers.

The start-ups

IBM followed up its chess win with a second popular showcase for AI by introducing Watson a question-answering computer as a contestant on the quiz show Jeopardy! In 2011 Watson defeated champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings winning $1 million.

IBM went on to launch Watson as a commercial product; its first application was in decision management for lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The firm also customized Watson for industrial research markets including chemicals in which companies including the big German firm Evonik Industries have deployed it.

In 2019 IBM announced that it would shift development in its Watson Health division from drug discovery in which the tool struggled to gain traction to clinical development. And the company is working on a new AI architecture to support autonomous chemical discovery in both materials and drug applications.

IBM’s RoboRXN for Chemistry combines AI algorithms commercially available robotics and cloud computing. The firm debuted RoboRXN in a fully autonomous lab last year at its Zurich research laboratory with experiments involving photoacid generator molecules carbon-capture materials and pharmaceutical compounds.

IBM began working on the system in 2017 with a project to apply natural language programming to predictive chemical synthesis problems. Philippe Schwaller a PhD student at IBM who studied reaction prediction at the Zurich lab says the AI component of RoboRXN digitizes chemistry through language to promote machine learning.

“Our models are trained on molecular representations where atoms are like characters molecules are like words and chemical reactions are like sentences” Schwaller says. Thus programmed the model can learn in a fashion that mimics human learning.

The model is also generating data says Teodoro Laino a research scientist and leader of the RoboRXN project. “AI is generating instructions” he says. “The net effect of AI is to add software that is writing software for the robot.”

IBM is working with industrial and institutional partners to implement the technology in research Laino says. For example XChem an experimental facility at Diamond Light Source the UK’s national synchrotron facility is testing whether RoboRXN can discover compounds from data the group generates on how small molecules bind to proteins.

IBM has competition in offering AI research services: start-ups like Insilico Medicine Exscientia and Citrine Informatics are landing contracts with big chemical and pharmaceutical firms. Some of them are also teaming up with lab robotics providers.

Insilico for example announced a partnership last July with Arctoris a supplier of automated drug discovery technology. Insilico CEO Alex Zhavoronkov says the company is looking for an optimum fit between AI and robotics in a closed-loop laboratory. “We are trying to get high-quality data from a controlled robotics environment” he says.

For Zhavoronkov as for Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto robots are the crux. “Synthesis is the main bottleneck. Currently we outsource synthesis” to a contract research organization (CRO) he says. Insilico used AI to discover an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis drug candidate earlier this year then signed on the CRO WuXi AppTec to synthesize it for testing.

‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists. Paul Collier research fellow Johnson Matthey

Exscientia launched in 2012 with a vision of automated drug design CEO Andrew Hopkins says. The firm is continually searching for elements of the process in which AI can increase productivity he says.

“Drug discovery is both a big data and a small data problem” Hopkins says. Databases patents and pertinent literature create a huge amount of data from which to build models he says. “But whenever we look at first-in-class drug targets chances are we know very little about them.” AI allows researchers to design algorithms that explore chemical space beyond the parameters of the original experimental model. “We think of drug discovery as a learning problem not a screening problem” he says.

The company which counts GlaxoSmithKline as a client is preparing to bring robots into the fold. “We are building labs in this space and hiring a director of automation” Hopkins says.

Citrine targets the materials industry and boasts the chemical giant BASF as a client. The company is keeping its focus on AI joining where needed with partners for robotics and other components of a closed-loop discovery system. CEO Greg Mulholland describes the role of AI in an autonomous lab as a central guidance system working hand in hand with the researcher. Other elements of the loop will vary from company to company as will the closedness of the loop Mulholland says.

The real-world users

“Artificial intelligence is very much on our agenda” says Henrik Hahn Evonik’s chief digital officer. The German chemical company has been working for several years to understand the implications of AI in materials discovery as part of a digitization program that has introduced AI at various stages of research. The firm is moving toward closed-loop AI and robotics but Hahn questions whether such an environment will ever fully evolve.

“The autonomous laboratory in materials discovery appears to be some kind of holy grail as computer programs and algorithms surpass the creativity of our materials science experts” he says. “But this is really rather a vision and a vision means it will never come true.”

Evonik is using IBM’s Watson AI technology in its labs and programing its own algorithms Hahn says. And it is beginning to explore automation looking for example into IBM’s RoboRXN technology.

Hahn emphasizes that the autonomous lab poses a steep management challenge. “Wherever we can automate we will try to do so” he says though costs can be an issue. And the people who work in the lab now are no small consideration. Lab automation “is clearly disrupting classic lab work” Hahn says. “This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings.”

Dow is similarly pacing itself toward achieving autonomy in the lab. “My vision of the lab of the future has been practiced at Dow for a while” says A. N. Sreeram the firm’s chief technology officer. He notes that Dow built and programmed its own supercomputers since late in the first decade of this century and is among the industry pioneers in automated research.

These days Sreeram adds the firm is working with robotics big data high-performance computing and now AI and machine learning. And the company has been accessing technology through partnerships. They include a 2017 pact with 1QBit to develop quantum computing applications and a deal announced last year with Microsoft to develop AI for polyurethane research.

The British chemical maker Johnson Matthey is working with Mobotics the company launched by Cooper at the University of Liverpool on robotics for data-driven discovery. The firm says the work builds on a tradition of enabling scientists in materials discovery through technology that supports synthesis characterization and measurement.

“The self-driving or self-guided laboratory is another practical capability which our scientists will use to speed up the innovation process” Paul Collier a research fellow at the company says in an email. “ ‘Self-guided’ in this area means within boundaries set by human scientists.” AI-directed automation provides a tool “that complements human scientists rather than replacing them” he says.

Another chemical maker DSM recently announced a partnership with Delft University of Technology aimed at linking AI with automation. Marcus Remmers DSM’s chief technology officer says the project aims to supercharge aspects of industrial biotech research—automation modeling data management and AI—that are already in place.

This term autonomous lab has to be handled with care because there will always be the connotation that we are substituting human beings. Henrik Hahn chief digital officer Evonik Industries

A major focus will be on the researcher Remmers says. “In the early stages of our digital transformation in R&D we were focused on pilots and tools trying to work things out in small environments” he says. “As we mature we realize the tools are not the limiting factor any more. More so it is the mindset of the people. The scientist will have to reinvent what they are and how they see themselves and the value that they bring to this new world. If you see yourself as just somebody setting up a machine you may well end up missing the big picture.”

In drug discovery AI has gained traction managing data complexity. “Huge progress has been made over the last few years in comprehensively cleaning unlocking and harnessing the diverse and large volumes of discovery data accumulated over decades of research” Hugo Ceulemans scientific director of discovery data sciences at Janssen Research & Development says in an email.

Drug companies are investing in data generation and acquisition for traditional data types such as assays and chemical reactions as well as for new types such as high-content microscopy images. As a result Ceulemans says pharmaceutical research is building up an AI and automation infrastructure.

“The large data volumes flowing from automated pipelines boost AI impact on the portfolio” he says. AI-created insights are also beginning to direct the data that scientists collect he adds.

Biotech companies have the luxury of implementing AI from the ground up. Moderna’s success in arriving at a vaccine with 95% efficacy against COVID-19 in less than a year is partly attributed to AI algorithms according to an article in Digital Initiative published by Harvard Business School.

For established drug companies the adoption of AI can be a more protracted journey. Some major companies however are making a determined effort to close the research technology loop.

Eli Lilly and Company opened a robotics center in San Diego early last year in partnership with Strateos a developer of research-scheduling software. The Lilly Life Sciences Studio is a 1100 m2 facility that includes an autonomous lab with over 100 instruments and storage of over 5 million compounds. It is the culmination of a 6-year project says James P. Beck the head of medicinal chemistry at the center.

Like most drug companies Lilly has been doing automated biology for decades and automated chemistry for more than 10 years Beck says. The Life Sciences Studio puts the company’s expertise in chemistry in vitro biology sample management and analytical data acquisition in a closed loop. AI controls robots that Lilly researchers can access via the cloud he says.

The lab which is operated by Strateos is also accessible to outside researchers who can bring their own data compounds and experiments to the system.

Christos A. Nicolaou head of chemical informatics at Lilly says AI algorithms have evolved to the level where they can orchestrate automated operations in a lab. “AI is mature enough nowadays and we have enough good data to come down to earth and design with action in mind” he says. Lilly worked with software developers Nicolaou says but designed the AI architecture in-house.

“The lab of the future is here today” Beck says. But closing the loop requires heavy lifting. “It is a multifactorial challenge involving science hardware software and engineering” he says. “It is far more than a science story.”

In fact proponents of the autonomous lab suggest it is a human evolution story—one in which a technological environment rises around the enlightened scientist posing little threat to the human. “Imagination and creativity will remain human for the foreseeable future” the University of Liverpool’s Cooper says.

Aspuru-Guzik at the University of Toronto takes that idea one step further quoting Jorge Luis Borges’s poem “Chess”:

The Masters’ Every Shot Every Hole coverage is an innovative all-access execution of state-of-the art broadcast tech. Beau Daniels

You don’t have to be an economist to know that the Masters thrives on scarcity. There’s only one Augusta National only a small group is welcome to stroll down Magnolia Lane on a (normal) tournament week and fewer still who don green jackets.

Heck it’s even in the branding. Every year those who aren’t lucky enough to land a coveted spot among the patrons are greeted by Jim Nantz’s proclamation of “a tradition unlike any other.” The beauty the history and of course the golf — all of it a testament to Augusta National’s awe-inspiring rarity.

But in 2019 the Masters bucked the trend dabbling in excess the likes of which most diehards had only ever dreamed. For all four days of the tournament every shot from every player on every hole was available to be seen on the Masters app and Masters.com.

It wasn’t easy with camera operators and editors working around the clock (and with eye-popping expediency) on most tournament days and a herculean level of coordination needed between two of Augusta National’s oldest partners CBS and IBM.

Yet 20 minutes after history unfolded for Tiger Woods on Sunday in April 2019 another improbable feat occurred on the mobile app. For the first time each of the Masters’ 22118 shots was viewable with the tap of a screen. Here’s how they did it.

Beau Daniels

1. THE PLAYER

To begin the chain reaction a player addresses his ball and makes a stroke.

2. CAMERA OPERATORS

With 110 cameras spread across 18 holes (including dozens of operators carrying cameras on foot) CBS uses its Super Bowl–sized infrastructure to grab shots of every tee box fairway and green. Of course scale has its limitations — operators are often left framing shots on their own without the help of a director.

3. SERVERS

Footage is uploaded to on-site servers where asset-management software sorts each clip by camera time taken time uploaded and later time exported. As the footage uploads to the servers in Augusta live-scoring information is overlaid on each clip producing a shot sheet for editors and expediting the time it takes to access various shots.

4. REMOTE SOFTWARE

Proprietary remote software allows off-site editors to access CBS’s Augusta-based servers from multiple locations around the world.

5. QUALITY CONTROL

Editors located at CBS offices in New York Atlanta and the UK comb through player footage and prepare it for the Masters app by selecting the best shots applying the appropriate tags and queuing each clip’s “in” and “out” points. From here clips are sent to Los Angeles where a quality-control team ensures the footage maintains the Masters’ rigorous standards.

After a clip has been cleared it is exported back to the Augusta servers in two formats — the first broadcast-quality high definition for the CBS and Augusta National archives; the second a lower resolution presentation used for Every Shot Every Hole.

6. TRANSMISSION

With the footage cleared it is passed off to IBM for transmission to the mobile app. Watson technology scans each clip as it is uploaded for visual and audio cues that decipher highlights from normal shots.

7. THE APP

The video is now available for the world to see. In total the process typically takes less than 20 minutes from swing to app with a new clip created an average of every six seconds. Later each player’s day is edited down to a 20-minute full-round video and a three-minute highlight reel.

A noted typewriter enthusiast Hanks has also written about his collection. himself He even owns one used by Leonardo DiCaprio his costar in Catch Me If You Can. In an interview with Alan Alda for Alda’s Clear + Vivid podcast Hanks explains how he kept DiCaprio’s typewriter.

Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio shared more than screen time in ‘Catch Me If You Can’

In Catch Me If You Can DiCaprio played real-life con artist Frank Abagnale while Hanks played the FBI Agent trying to catch him. Abagnale used a typewriter to forge some of his documents such as government checks.

“I think the most valuable typewriter I have is oddly enough an IBM Selectric that Leo DiCaprio used in the movie Catch Me If You Can” Hanks told Alda. “It’s funny. I went to the propmaster after we were done shooting the scene and I said ‘I will give you $25 for that IBM Seletric.’ He said okay and took $25. He said ‘You know you could’ve had it for free.’”

Leonardo DiCaprio’s is not the only famous typewriter he has

Among his collectible typewriters Hanks also owns a famous author’s machine.

“I have one typewriter I think that was owned by Mickey Spillane” Hanks said. “I can’t prove he wrote anything on it but there’s a providence that says Mickey Spillane owned the typewriter. All my typewriters are worth about 60 bucks tops and if I sign them they’re worth 62 bucks tops.”

Hanks’ typewriter collection is getting out of control the actor admits.

“At home I probably have 15 scattered about the house but down at the office I have like 120 or something like that” Hanks said. “I gotta start getting rid of them because my kids have said ‘We’re not going to bury you with these things dad. You’d better start giving them away.’”

The beginning of Tom Hanks’ typewriter collection

Like any superhero story Hanks’ typewriter collection also has its own origin tale. Hanks shared it with Alda.

“A friend of mine was a year ahead of me in school” Hanks said. “When he went off the college he gave me his high school typewriter which was a piece of junk. It was like a knockoff 1970s version of a very very cheaply made horribly constructed typewriter that you could type on. I had it for a couple of years. I was working in Cleveland as an actor and needed to get it fixed.”

L-R: Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks | DreamWorks SKG/Getty Images

Hanks took his first typewriter to Detroit Avenue Business Machines. That’s when he learned what a real typewriter was and his obsession began.

[The owner] had a shop that was just jammed with every kind of 1000 key adding machines. He was also servicing by that time printers and copy machines. He said ‘What can I do for you young man?’ I said ‘I need to have this typewriter serviced.’ He said ‘Let me see the machine.’ He threw his hands up and said ‘I will not touch it.’ I said ‘Why? Isn’t it your job to repair business machines?’ He said ‘Yes I work on machines not on toys and this is a toy.’ He lectured me for the better part of 20 minutes about what a true typewriter is. I walked out of there with a Hermes 2000 typewriter. Tom Hanks Clear + Vivid with Alan Alda 2/24/2020

Raptor Lake-S desktop CPUs were highlighted on Twitter by hardware leaker @momomo_us spotted in material from Intel which provides technical details on the requirements and spec of the chips. Also provided is compatibility guidance pertaining to Alder Lake the 12th-gen processors that Raptor Lake will likely succeed.

In theory then this is solid evidence that not only is Raptor Lake coming but that it will take the baton from Alder Lake as rumored and will be on the same platform (which makes sense given that Alder Lake brings in an entirely new design and socket – LGA 1700 – requiring new motherboards and Intel would hardly switch after a single generation).

Here are the best gaming PCs

We’ve picked out all the best processors

And check out the best motherboards

In a way Raptor Lake looks a little lost among the major upgrades coming to Intel’s future processors. After Rocket Lake which is about to debut we then have Alder Lake (10nm) coming later in 2021 bringing huge changes in terms of switching up the whole design (adopting a hybrid model of big cores and small power-efficient cores).

Meteor strike

As previously rumored it would then seem that Raptor Lake will simply be a refresh of Alder Lake honing and tweaking still on 10nm whereas the following 14th-gen chips Meteor Lake will make a bigger splash as this is where Intel theoretically changes gear and hits 7nm.

We’ve already heard about Meteor Lake (and lots on Alder Lake too of course) but Intel thus far hasn’t said anything at all about Raptor Lake; but with it being a more low-profile affair that makes sense.

The plan is that Alder Lake will arrive late 2021 as mentioned possibly September according to rumors and Meteor Lake is planned for a 2023 debut which obviously leaves a hole in 2022 where Raptor Lake should find a home. Handfuls of salt with all this of course but the Intel documentation – assuming it’s genuine – certainly seems to position Raptor Lake as Alder Lake’s successor as per previous speculation.

While Raptor Lake may ‘only’ turn out to be a refresh of Alder Lake it should still bring a substantial IPC (instructions per clock) performance boost and we’ve also heard that it could introduce a nifty bonus for gamers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbHMtbmV3LWNlby13YXMtcHVzaGVkLW91dC1vZi10aGUtY29tcGFueS15ZWFycy1hZ28taGVyZXMtaG93LWhlLWNhbWUtYmFjay0xMTUyMjgzMDMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's new CEO was pushed out of the company years ago— here's how he came back,"By his own admission Pat Gelsinger bleeds Intel (INTC) blue. It's no surprise seeing as the self-described tech geek started at the chipmaker at the age of 18 became its first chief technology officer and learned alongside storied Intel CEO Andy Grove.

But up until the announcement in mid-January that he would be Intel's eighth-ever CEO Gelsinger was 11 years into the top job at cloud player VMWare.

""When I left the company [Intel] 11 years ago I was pushed out of the company and it was hard. You know there is this typical phrase that what was meant for evil worked out for good. And boy it hurt at the time. It was difficult. But it made me better"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Presents.

Gelsinger said he used the time as CEO of VMWare to learn new leadership skills that ultimately set him up perfectly to return home as Intel's chief. VMWare shareholders were handsomely rewarded under Gelsinger's watch: amid the acceleration in the cloud shares of VMWare have gained 193% these past five years.

Recalls Gelsinger ""My 11-year vacation as I call it I became a seasoned CEO. I have learned new leadership skills in customer focus a new emphasis on diversity and inclusion and what it means to build a culture and how to work with finance on the Street. All of these things are now combining with that 30-year experience I had at Intel. I will say every neural pattern that I ever exercised is being used fully every day on the job at Intel.""

Patrick Gelsinger Intel Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Digital Enterprise Group talks at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco Tuesday Aug. 19 2008. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Those neural patterns of Gelsinger have surely been firing on warp overdrive this week.

The company — which has been pressured to outsource more of its chipmaking — announced Tuesday during a business update its plan to invest $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona. Intel also committed to making chips for other companies in a bid to increase industry capacity.

""There is an extraordinary demand for semiconductors as we're seeing basically the world is becoming more digital in every aspect"" Gelsinger said.

Gelsinger will further be bringing back Intel's version of a developer's conference in October.

""It really is an extraordinary opportunity that I have been given to come back and play this role"" Gelsinger said.

While we generally review hardware that is designed to meet TCO metrics the NUC is different. This device is let us face it designed to also be fun. Intel NUCs in this type of form factor has been around for a while and despite the ominous “Tiger Canyon” codename (after all who would want to walk through a canyon filled with hungry tigers?) this is actually a fun little node. This is not just because it has a 10nm SuperFin Tiger Lake processor in it. In our review we are going to see why.

Video Version

As we have been doing with more of our content this year we have a video version as well.

If you want to listen this weekend feel free to open this in a new browser tab for a better viewing experience.

Intel NUC 11 Pro (NUC11TNKi5) Overview

The system itself is a relatively compact unit with a huge asterisk next to it. We will get to the asterisk later but the unit measures 112mm x 117mm which is around 4.5 inches.

On the front of the unit we have a power button along with two USB Type-A ports. These are USB 3.2 Gen2 ports which means they operate at 10Gbps.

Moving to the rear of the unit we have a fairly full I/O panel. There are two HDMI 2.0b ports. Many other nodes in this class have at least one DisplayPort so this is a bit different. One also gets a USB 2.0 port and a USB 3.2 Gen2 port each in Type-A form factors. The Type-C ports are interesting. They are listed as USB 4 / Thunderbolt 4 and 3 ports. This is a massive amount of USB connectivity in such a small chassis.

Another big feature is the Intel i225-lm networking. With this generation we get 2.5GbE. Although it is a single port having faster Ethernet is a big deal for many. We get comments on the availability of 2.5GbE switches but Rohit has two fairly reasonably priced units in his review pipeline. The switch situation will get better this generation as 2.5GbE becomes more prevalent. Even the Supermicro X12SCA-F we reviewed this week has a 2.5GbE port.

On the sides we simply have vents for cooling.

The plastic top of the system can be removed. This however only exposes a metal airflow guide as well as WiFi antenna wiring. It is not much here.

Removing the bottom cover involves four screws one in each rubber foot. As we take the cover off we notice that inside the NUC we get several thermal pads to keep components such as the M.2 SSD cool.

Inside the system we see a packed set of components. Standard we get a WiFi 6/ Bluetooth solution in the Intel AX201 NIC.

There are then two M.2 slots. One is a M.2 2242 (42mm) SATA III/ PCIe Gen3 x1 slot which is designed for boot devices. The other is a M.2 2280 (80mm) PCIe Gen4 x4 slot. That means one can install both a boot drive in the M.2 2242 slot as well as have high-performance M.2 storage in the x4 slot.

In terms of memory we get two 1.2V DDR4-3200 SODIMM slots. We added two 32GB SODIMMs and the system had no issue running with 64GB of memory.

Perhaps one of the biggest features is the CPU. This system has an Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU. While this is a lower-power four core/ 8 thread unit it also has a new technology in it specifically the Intel Iris Xe graphics. As Intel begins to re-enter the GPU market after many years this Xe architecture is designed to scale from this class of chip to the large Ponte Vecchio HPC GPUs for Exascale computing. There of course is going to be a fairly massive difference but Intel is getting back in the running.

The size was mentioned with an asterisk. That is because the power supply is external and is roughly the size of the unit perhaps a bit larger. At 120W the 19V power supply is larger than one may need for just the system however this is designed to have headroom for plugging-in higher power USB/ Thunderbolt devices.

Next we are going to get to the performance followed by power consumption noise our key lessons learned and then our final words.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L2NoaW5hLWNoYWxsZW5nZS1pbnRlbC1zdHJhdGVnaWMtZmFpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The China challenge: Why Intel is too strategic to fail,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/03/27/china-challenge-intel-strategic-fail/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L2NoaW5hLWNoYWxsZW5nZS1pbnRlbC1zdHJhdGVnaWMtZmFpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk5LTExOTAway1vdmVyY2xvY2tlZC10by03Z2h6LWF0LTEtODN20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-11900K overclocked to 7GHz at 1.873V,"Intel’s Rocket fueled by liquid nitrogen

Meanwhile an Indian YouTube channel PC Wale has a video showing the overclocking process of the same processor model but only to 6.5 GHz. This frequency was achieved at a slightly lower voltage of 1.678V voltage.

The overclockers from PC Wale received a custom XOC BIOS from SafeDisk an overclocker from South Korea who works for ASUS. This version of BIOS unlocks the voltage to up to 2V. A frequency of 6.5 GHz by PC Wale was achieved with the ROG Maximus XIII Hero motherboard.

Mobile gaming company Roblox (RBLX -3.50%) recently went public but opted not to take the traditional IPO route. And despite the wave of SPAC IPOs over the past year or so Roblox didn't use that method either. Instead Roblox used a less common method of going public known as a direct listing. In this Fool Live video recorded on March 11 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP gives investors an overview of the direct listing process how it differs from a traditional IPO and why several big-name companies have used it to go public in recent years.

10 stocks we like better than Roblox Corporation

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Roblox Corporation wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24 2021

Matthew Frankel: There's a few big differences we'll get into. In a traditional IPO which is what Airbnb and DoorDash did last year companies hire underwriters they send an IPO price they determine a certain amount of new stock they want to sell for the public to raise money. That's the traditional IPO.

The direct listing the company and its investors they simply list the shares that already exist directly on the public markets. They don't have to hire underwriters. They do hire some financial advisors but it's much less of a process. They determine the day one price of the stock which is the reference price which will get into a little bit later. It's not the same thing as when a company sets an IPO price.

Direct listings are only available on the New York Stock Exchange which is something else that's interesting. Generally tech stocks list on the NASDAQ as most investors know. If you want to invest in a broad-based tech index you buy the NASDAQ-100 something like that. So if you're seeing some of these tech stocks on the New York Stock Exchange Slack was one of them Spotify was another good example it's because that's the only exchange that offers them. [Editor's note: Both the NYSE and NASDAQ now offer direct listings.] Next slide please.

Who sells the shares? Where do they come from? One of the biggest difference is that no new capital is usually raised in a direct listing. The New York Stock Exchange actually just recently made a change where a company can raise capital in a direct listing but it's usually not the case. Usually it's just the existing stock. One big difference is that there is no required lockup period.

Normally when a company goes public there's a lockup period which is a period of time in which existing shareholders are not allowed to sell their shares. It usually expires a month or two later. Like Airbnb insiders couldn't sell shares on day one of that IPO it just wasn't allowed. That's called a lockup. In a direct listing existing shareholders early investors the company's founders the VC firms that backed it can choose to sell some of their stock or not on day one. It's really just a supply-and-demand model. It's not dependent on a certain amount of new shares being created. It's not dependent on a certain amount of shares being allowed to be traded. It's just the existing shares come on the market. Some people want to sell them great. They can get money for them on day one. It democratizes the process not just for investors like you and me like we're going to talk about in a second but also for company insiders and things like that too. Next slide please.

How is the direct listing stock price determined? We mentioned a thing called a reference price and it's different than an IPO price. In an IPO underwriters determine a price that the company is going to sell its shares to the public for. The shares at the IPO price anyone who tried to get in on the Airbnb or DoorDash IPOs I don't know if Brian owns shares of either of those but if you wanted to get in at the IPO price you were pretty much out of luck. The shares at the IPO price are generally sold for large investors leaving retail investors to buy on the open market at whatever supply and demand allows them to do so once the shares begin to freely trade. In a direct listing because you're not selling any new shares everybody has an equal opportunity to buy. Once shares are available for public trading you might pay more than the IPO or reference price but so will the big investors who want to get in.

We saw Ark Invest bought some Roblox yesterday. They paid a premium just like everyone else did. They did not get in at that $45 reference price. The reference price is a starting point determined by financial advisors. Usually it's loosely based on what the company's shares have been trading for on the secondary market the valuation the companies used last time they fundraised things like that. It's not what any investors actually pay including the big investors. Roblox's reference price was $45.

As Brian mentioned the shares are trading for a whole lot more than that right now. The lowest that any Roblox shares have actually traded for on the public markets since it went public yesterday has been $60.50. The reference price is just a starting point for an auction in other words. Think of it as like the reference price is what the market makers are putting out there like an auctioneer. As supply and demand dictates it usually goes up from there. By the time Roblox actually opened it was in the 60s so nobody paid $45 for it. Not the big investors not retail investors. It really levels the playing field. It's not just supply and demand on the retail side it's supply and demand on all sides. If you're paying $60-something for Roblox shares that means that the big investors are also willing to pay those prices.

One more. Here's an Airbnb chart. The IPO price of Airbnb was $68. That's what big investors actually paid. Big investors who committed to buy shares at Airbnb's IPO actually paid $68. What do you see as the lowest share price that it actually has traded at? A little over $120. The cheapest any retail investor really has been able to get it on the Airbnb at is about double what the big investors paid. That's just a really good example of how direct listings really level the playing field. Everybody is paying between $60 and $75 for Roblox shares these past couple of days. Everybody who wants to invest so big difference between a direct listing and a traditional IPO especially for very popular stocks like these.

On the next slide I just broke down some of the pros and cons of direct listings. Just to break it down real easy. Some of the advantages they are cost effective for the company. They don't have to hire underwriters they don't have to do an IPO roadshow. They have to hire some advisors but it's generally a much more inexpensive process. There's no lockup periods required for insiders. It democratizes the public listing process for both investors and for inside investors. Even if the company is raising capital this is an interesting point the company's interests are aligned with the public. The company doesn't set its IPO price. If it decides to sell 10 million new shares the price of those 10 million new shares will be determined by how excited investors are to buy their stock not by whatever price the underwriters decided to sell it to hedge funds for it. It's really an interesting model.

Disadvantages just real quick and then I'll shut up and let Brian talk. They're unpredictable. Like I said it democratizes the capital-raising process and things like that but it's also unpredictable for the company. If the company needs to raise $100 million they don't know how many shares to sell because the price is going to be hammered by supply and demand. It can be difficult to get a lot of interest for direct listing because like I said there's no roadshow there's no buildup toward it. If the company isn't widely known typically these are only used by big established brands. I mentioned Slack Spotify. Coinbase is another one that's about to do a direct listing. These are big companies that people are already interested in investing in. The initial price is governed by supply and demand. That could be good or bad for investors in the company it just makes it unpredictable and they still have the same disclosure requirements as an IPO. They still have to produce financials really open up the books. SPAC IPOs avoid this to some degree.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbnRoYWlsYW5kLmNvbS9pbi1mb2N1cy8zMDQwNDIyOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTT partners Abu Dhabi oil company energy giants to launch secondary futures market,"The official opening ceremony of IFAD is scheduled for March 29.

Trump Hotels are just the cherry on top of Donald Trump’s real estate ventures. He reached dizzying heights of fame – fame that ultimately propelled him all the way to the White House – by doing deals with some of the world’s biggest names in property often for iconic pieces of real estate. And while other members of his family have shown a preference for Florida the Donald’s long-time home of New York is where he has had the most visible impact by far.





Central Park attractions

One of the most magical things about visiting NYC in the winter is getting to experience ice skating in Central Park. It’s become the spot to ring in the festive season and even a popular place to pop the question.



Trump manages both the Wollman Rink at the south end of the park and the Lasker Rink on the north end. But the Donald’s operation is a year-round affair as the Wollman Rink turns into Victoria Gardens from June to September where visitors can enjoy an amusement park filled with rides food concessions and live music entertainment. The Trump Organization also manages the Michael Friedsam Memorial Carousel the fourth such carousel in this spot since 1871.

40 Wall Street

While few tourists know this building – also known as the Trump Building (not to be confused with Trump Tower) – it was built in 1930 and formerly known as the Manhattan Company Building was once the tallest building in the world at 283 metres (927 feet). Designed by architects H. Craig Severance and Yasuo Matsui it is situated opposite the New York Stock Exchange and still sticks out as a green jewel in the city’s skyline thanks to its rusted copper roof.

Purchased by the former president of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s after the February Revolution of 1986 toppled his reign the building spent years vacant until Trump bought it in 1995. He claims he only paid US$1 million and has invested US$200 million in renovations since. The building is mainly recognised for its beautiful exterior but inside the tower is 1.1 million square feet of office space spread across 70 floors.



Jean-Georges

Jean-Georges Vongerichten has restaurants in 11 countries with the same number in New York City alone. But what the map on your phone may not tell you is that the celebrity chef’s signature Central Park restaurant sits on the property of The Trump International Hotel. The place is one of only five two-Michelin-starred establishments in the city so tourists flock there and it’s where Trump has often chosen to host politicians and business associates. The menu at the 1 Central Park West restaurant blends French American and Southeast Asian ingredients and is a favourite among celebrities.



Empire State Building

This famous landmark was completed in 1931 and remained the world’s tallest building until the original 1 World Trade Center tower was completed in 1970. In 1991 Japanese billionaire Hideki Yokoi acquired the land the 102-floor skyscraper was built on for a reported US$42 million and later transferred it to the Trump Empire State Partners. In 2002 Peter L. Malkin’s Empire State Land Associate purchased the land from Trump’s business for US$57.5 million. The 86th floor observation deck remains one of the city’s most popular tourist attractions but few visitors today have any idea of the building’s previous connection to Trump.



The Plaza

Donald Trump didn’t have a cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York for no reason. Trump used to own The Plaza Hotel where Macaulay Culkin’s character Kevin stayed. The property opened in 1907 and Trump bought it at a 1988 auction for US$407.5 million. He said later: “This isn’t just a building it’s the ultimate work of art. I was in love with it.” According to Bloomberg Trump sold the place seven years later in 1995 at an US$83 million loss.

Resolute fearless and gutsy were some of the special qualities prerequisite for women to survive in the all-male bastion of Wall Street in the 1960s.This Wall Street pioneer not only survived that challenge but also became a role model for other women for the way she lived her life and made a name for herself on Wall Street.Known as the First Lady of Wall Street stockbroker Muriel Siebert earned her place and respect among other Wall Street legends and made history in 1967 when she became the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange Siebert was known not only for her skill in picking stocks that turned into winners but also for the company she built from scratch turned into one of the US’s best known discount stock broking firms.Throughout her career Siebert took many risks and was known for being fearless outspoken smart and determined. She was the only female trader among 1300-plus male traders on Wall Street for more than a decade and was the first woman to own a discount brokerage firm. She later launched initiatives to help women understand and take control of their finances.Although she did not have a college degree Siebert was the first woman to become the superintendent of banking for New York state.Siebert attended business classes at the Western Reserve University and was often the only girl in her class. She often visited the New York Stock Exchange and was determined to work there one day. Unfortunately her father was diagnosed with cancer in 1952 and she had to leave school early.Despite many setbacks in her life she was able to achieve her dream of working on Wall Street at a time when the only women allowed on Wall Street were secretaries and support staff.How she became a member of NYSE Siebert was very disturbed about the way women were treated in the financial world when she was an entry-level research analyst and felt women deserved the same respect as men. Her investor friend Gerald Tsai advised her to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and become a part of the system to change everyone’s perspective towards women.Although it was a daunting task she managed to convince an investor after getting rejected by many to sponsor her application to buy a seat on NYSE.Then with great difficulty she received a loan from Chase Manhattan Bank after two years to buy a seat and on December 28 1967 she became the first woman member of the New York Stock Exchange.She always believed in giving back to the community and made many generous contributions through the Siebert Entrepreneurial Philanthropic Plan to charities and did a lot to encourage women to actively enter the financial world.She also ran a famous campaign where she got a ladies washroom installed on the seventh floor of the New York Stock Exchange because there was no toilet for women during most of her time there.Siebert died of cancer on August 24 2013. The New York Stock Exchange named a room after her called Siebert Hall to honour her. This was the first time a room was named after a person on the stock exchange.In 2002 Siebert published her autobiography Changing the Rules: Adventures of a Wall Street Maverick where she described her experiences and adventures of Wall Street and also offered young investors tips to survive in the investment world.Here are some of the tips that she shared in her book for investors many of which are relevant to this day.Siebert attributed her success to three four-letter words ending in 'K' which were-She believed risk was the ability to study the information assess liability and be brave enough to make a decision. “If you’re not willing to accept the worst that can happen don’t do it. Recognizing the capacity for calculated risk is the key to success” she once said in an interview.Siebert was of the view that there were always inherent risks in investing. So she advised fellow investors to start buying stocks only when they had enough funds to do so.She felt investors should prioritise saving funds for monthly expenses debt and also some savings to cover emergencies and then only should they think of investing in stocks.Further she felt one should allocate the money for investment which they do not need at least for next five years. She suggested investors to choose investments that reduced chances of the worst-case scenario of losing all the money.Also she felt investors should diversify portfolio by investing in a variety of companies in different industries or buying a broader collection of stocks through an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund Siebert believed putting all the money into a single stock was risky because then the investment would be dependent on only one company’s performance.According to Siebert younger investors should consider allocating a larger share of their portfolio (70 per cent or more) to equities rather than bonds. As they grow older and approach retirement they can change that approach and bring down the allocation to stocks to cut down the risk.Siebert believed investors should avoid the temptation of chasing hot stocks when their picks are underperforming on the basis of some attractive stock tips. She felt pursuing stock tips without deep and thorough research was more of gambling than investing.Siebert felt it was best for investors to invest for the long term and ‘stay the course’ as investing in stocks required a stomach of steel in tough times and a telescope-like focus on the long term.According to Siebert investors who did not panic and rush for exit during tough times eventually got rewarded as stocks with strong fundamentals did bounce back in due course.“So I tell people stick to your guns. You will make money eventually. There undoubtedly will be tough years during the course of your investment horizon but a commitment to investing and a well-diversified strategy have consistently proven fruitful in the long term” she said.Siebert believed that it was essential for investors to shortlist a few companies they were planning to invest in and conduct an in-depth research on them as it would help them pick the right stocks.She felt it wasn’t necessary to focus on a large group of companies instead one should pick up a select few and study them often from every possible angle.She advised investors to talk to customers suppliers and engineers and spend time with executives and keep up to date on all contracts cancellations slowdowns and bids.She said investors should study everything there is to know about the management production suppliers competition research and labour conditions.Investors should have that level of knowledge that if a company had a disappointing quarter they could figure out whether it was a systemic problem in the organisation or something beyond its control she said.An investor should also have a keen business acumen so that when she interacts with the company staff and management she can ask the right questions to benefit from informative answers as it is obvious a company's management may hold back information she saidAccording to Siebert analysing the market could be considered both an art and science. While analysing the market the financial data shows how a company fits into the economy and that makes up the science part. But seeing a pattern in those numbers and then looking ahead is an art.“While learning everything possible there is to know about a company it is the numbers that eventually tell the story” says she.Siebert’s legacy goes beyond her professional achievements and deserves more than just a footnote in the history books. She’s regarded as a trailblazer who made investing more accessible for women everywhere.In her own words she explained her life motto as: “When you hit a closed door and it doesn’t budge just rear back and kick it in but hold it open so others can follow you.”(Disclaimer: This article is based on’s various interviews and her book"

Key metrics such as financial strength growth and valuation have shown declines suggesting that International Flavors & Fragrances Inc may not maintain its historical performance levels. This article delves into these critical metrics to uncover the evolving narrative of the company.

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

ADVERTISEMENT

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Story continues

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

This card includes medical information such as the type of vaccine you received the date you received it and where you were vaccinated. We're not yet close to a standardized global system that tracks this information so this small card is one of the most valuable assets you can have right now -- especially as travel restarts.

Wondering what to do with your vaccination card until it's time to travel? Here's what we know.

What should I do with my vaccine card?

(Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)

First things first: Put your vaccination card in a safe place. If you haven't already done this do it now. It's an extremely important document and the only way to easily verify that you've been vaccinated against COVID-19.

That means you should give it the same kind of treatment you would your credit cards driver's license or passport and store it in a secure location such as a wallet safe or a desk drawer at all times.

Do I need to keep my vaccine card if I use a vaccine passport?

You will want to keep your vaccination card handy but you may not have to travel with it in the future if you're using a digital health (vaccine) passport.

Certain destinations tour operators and travel providers may require proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or accept proof of vaccination as an alternative to strict testing and quarantine requirements. Streamlining those processes is something the travel industry has been working on in the form of digital vaccine passports.

A digital health passport will host verified test and vaccine information. They are expected to be optional but experts say they will be widely used in the travel industry and at large public gatherings such as sporting events.

Digital health passports have already been rolled out on several popular routes on various airlines such as Clear's Health Pass feature for Delta and United flyers traveling to Honolulu International (HNL).

American Airlines and British Airways introduced a mobile health passport called VeriFLY. Copa Airlines and the Panamanian government are also partnering with IATA Travel Pass to create a health passport. If you are traveling to a destination or with a provider that allows you to present digital verification of your vaccination status that may suffice in place of the paper vaccination card.

What if I lose my vaccine card?

(Photo by ArtistGNDphotography/Getty Images)

We shouldn't have to say this but you don't want to lose or damage your vaccination card.

""Even though it's a low profile small piece of paper it's an extraordinarily high value for you as a person to be able to travel"" said Steve Swasey the vice president of communications at Healthline in an interview last month. (Healthline is also owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures).

Until there's a universal verification tool Swasey says he'll laminate and wear a sticker he received after being vaccinated when he hits the road. Other travelers I've spoken to have said they plan to laminate their vaccination cards to prevent damage -- and Staples will even do it for free.

If you do lose or damage your card don't panic. All COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report data within 72 hours in their state's immunization system. That means there will likely be a back-up record of your vaccination status.

The CDC recommends contacting the immunization information system (IIS) in your state to see if they have records (but not to contact the CDC since they do not keep a record of COVID-19 vaccines). You can also contact the place where you got your shot or your state's health department. And don't forget you have these options with all vaccines — not just the COVID-19 shots.

Recently a friend who got vaccinated in Brooklyn accidentally got her card wet before receiving a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and workers at the facility happily exchanged it with a new card. So depending on where you are in the vaccination process you may be able to easily get a new card too.

Bottom line

The world hasn't found a standardized system for COVID-19 vaccination verification so keep track of your vaccination card is extremely important.

However as more digital health passport apps are rolled out this year you may be able to keep your card at home in your drawer and use a digital version instead of the original paper copy. And if you lose your card you can try and get a replacement through your local immunization site or state health department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcGFnZWFudHMvdHJhbnNjcmlwdC1zYW1hbnRoYS1iZXJuYXJkby10b3AtMTAtc3BlZWNoLW1pc3MtZ3JhbmQtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC0yMDIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TRANSCRIPT: Samantha Bernardo's Top 10 speech at Miss Grand International 2020,"This is AI generated summarization which may have errors.

SPEECH. Samantha Bernardo speaks about coming together in the COVID-19 pandemic at the coronation night of Miss Grand International.

'It's an everyday battle that confronts all of us regardless of who we are and where we are from' Sam says of the COVID-19 pandemic

The Miss Grand International 2020 coronation night on March 27 saw each of the top 10 candidates give speeches on the theme “Stop the war and violence.”

In a segment made to remind the audience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the candidates donned white gowns and emerged on stage after the image of the virus was flashed on screen.

Giving their speeches as an instrumental version of Michael Jackson’s “Heal the World” in the background the women spoke about the importance of unity and working together in the middle of a global health crisis.

Philippine bet Samantha Bernardo highlighted the problems the world has been facing throughout the pandemic and spoke about what she would do if she won the title of Miss Grand International.

Here is a transcript of Sam’s speech:

Year 2020 will be remembered as the most challenging period in our history. COVID-19 pandemic has brought despair destruction and death. Today our world war has changed from armed conflicts to war on hunger for better healthcare system racism and education.

It’s an everyday battle that confronts all of us regardless of who we are and where we are from. As a Malaria Free Philippines spokesperson I have always lived up to my faith in humanity cultural understanding and respect for others. These are what I will continue to stand for if I become your next Miss Grand International. I will be a channel of hope compassion and unity; to stand and form and stop any form of violence and war in this world.

As we face a COVID-free world join me as we work together in mending our conflicts and focusing on what truly matters. We are living under one sky so let us all live peacefully where love is our language humanity in our race and peace is our lasting legacy to the world.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Most Americans are eligible for free tax-preparation services but the truly free options can be hard to find. If you’re not careful you could end up using a service that says it’s free but demands payment after you’ve spent time entering your information.

Now that the IRS has pushed the deadline for 2020 taxes to May 17 you have even more time to make sure you’re using the service that’s right for you.

How do you file online for free?

If you make less than$72000 a year you can find free tax filing options at the IRS Free File webpage.

Here are Free File options from TurboTax TaxSlayer and others. (H&R Block has left the Free File program since last year.)

Each site has its own eligibility requirements so be sure to find one that will be free for you.

It can take a bit of effort to find an option that fits your situation. Try using the IRS lookup tool to find the right one. Most of the options provide tax prep for both federal and state returns.

Best for: People who make less than the income cap and want a convenient and easy way to file online.

If you make more than $72000 a year you may have access to free options offered by several commercial tax prep companies like Intuit (TurboTax) H&R Block or TaxAct.

But buyer beware: Some companies use a variety of tactics to try to wring money out of you often only throwing up a paywall after you’ve gone through the trouble of inputting most of your information.

The widely advertised “free” options are typically only really free based on which tax forms you need to file. Which forms are free and which will trigger a demand for a fee depends on the company. So read the fine print before you decide.

Here is the list of forms supported by H&R Block’s “free online” version.

Here is the list of forms supported by TaxAct’s “free” offer. Click the tab labeled “forms.”

Here is the list of forms supported by TurboTax “Free Edition.”

Credit Karma also offers a free tax filing service for “all supported forms” but the company tries to monetize your personal tax data by using it to target you with advertising.

Best for: People who don’t qualify for Free File but have income only from a standard job and perhaps a bank account and who want to file online.

If you’re in the military you can use MilTax a service provided by the Department of Defense that uses a version of H&R Block’s tax software. It is available for free to active-duty service members as well as those in the National Guard or the reserves as well as their families. There are no income or tax form restrictions. There are also free in-person options to get tax help if you are in the military or family — see the section below.

You can also get free advice from a professional who understands tax issues specific to the military. The phone number is 800-342-9647 or you can live chat with them.

Best for: People in the military guard or reserves and their families.

How can I get personal tax help for free?

You can qualify for the IRS’Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program if you:

Make less than around $57000 a year OR

Live with a disability OR

Speak limited English.

You can qualify for the IRS’Tax Counseling for the Elderly program if you:

Are at least 60 years old.

These programs match you with IRS-certified volunteers across the country who can help with free basic income tax preparation and electronic filing. You can use the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance locator tool or call 800-906-9887 to find someone to help you. Keep in mind that some locations may require an appointment.

Best for: People who are confused by the tax process and want someone to help walk them through the process.

If you’re in the military and want individual tax help you can get freein-person tax help on many U.S. military bases worldwide. Military.com’s base guide is a good place to start.

Best for: People in the military and their families who want advice from someone who knows the ins and outs of military tax filing.

Why is TurboTax charging me?

If you make less than $39000 a year (or $72000 if you’re in the military) and TurboTax is telling you it costs money to file you are probably using the wrong version of TurboTax. Don’t worry there is a way to access the truly free version.

As ProPublica reported in 2019 TurboTax purposely hid its Free File product and directed taxpayers to a version where many had to pay called the TurboTax Free Edition. If you clicked on this “FREE Guaranteed” option you could input a lot of your information only to be told toward the end of the process that you need to pay.

You can still accessTurboTax’s Free File version. This version is offered through the Free File agreement.

TurboTax’s misleading advertising and website design directed users to more expensive versions of the software even if they qualified to file for free. After our stories published some people demanded and got refunds. Intuit the maker of TurboTax faces several investigations and lawsuits over this practice. The company has denied wrongdoing and has moved to acquire other free tax-preparation companies like Credit Karma.

Following ProPublica’s reporting the IRS announced an update to its agreement with the tax-preparation companies. Among other things the update bars the companies from hiding their Free File offerings from Google search results. It also makes it so each company has to name their Free File service the same way using the format: IRS Free File Program delivered by [COMPANY NAME].

What’s the difference between TurboTax’s “Free Guaranteed” and IRS Free File Delivered by TurboTax?

TurboTax Free Edition is not always free. It has only been free for tax returns that the company defines as “simple.” That often means people with student loans and freelance income actually have to pay to file. Look for Intuit’s “IRS Free File Program delivered by TurboTax.” This year you are eligible if you:

Make less than $39000 a year OR

Make less than $72000 a year and serve in the military.

What is Free File and who is the Free File Alliance?

The Free File Alliance is actually a group of tax companies that — contrary to the name — is in the business of charging people to help them file their taxes. They spent a lot of money to make sure that the IRS didn’t develop its own free tax filing service that would compete with what they have to offer. As part of the new Free File Alliance deal the IRS is now able to offer a competing service but it’s not doing so this year.

The Free File Alliance companies have agreed to offer free tax filing for a certain percentage of the population based on income. Head to the IRS website to see which option is the best for you. These are the companies in the alliance:

1040NOW Corp.

About this guide:

ProPublica has reported extensively about taxes the IRS Free File program and the IRS. Specifically we’ve covered the ways in which the for-profit tax preparation industry — companies like Intuit (TurboTax) H&R Block and Tax Slayer — has lobbied for the Free File program then systematicallyundermined it with evasive search tactics and confusing design. These companies also work to fill search engine results with tax “guides” that sometimes route users to paid products.

The 6-foot 3-inch All-U.P. center scored 26 points as the Wolves defeated North Dickinson 49-36 to claim the MHSAA Division 4 District 99 championship at the Carl F. Lemin Jr. Gymnasium in Felch.

The game was the third meeting between the teams this season as they’re both Skyline Central Conference members. C-N won both regular-season matchups on Feb. 25 and March 1.

The Wolves finished the regular season as the No. 1-ranked team in Division 4 in the Upper Peninsula Sportswriters and Sportscasters U.P. basketball poll. Carney also garnered a No. 2-ranking in the Michigan Associated Press Division 4 state basketball poll.

The Nordics came out of the starting gates full speed jumping out to a 5-0 lead at the 4:57 mark of the first quarter.

Their 3-2 zone defense gave the visitors from Menominee County trouble at first as ND was swarming Wagner with two to three defenders.

“I told the girls before the game ‘we’re going to get punched in the mouth right from the start'” said Carney head coach Ken Linder. “North Dickinson comes out fast and strong and (Ashton) Hord is so quick. I wasn’t surprised at all by the way they started.”

The Wolves however held steady to their methodical game plan.

“We couldn’t get into a back and forth game of both of us pushing the tempo against them” Linder added. “We had to stay steady and play our game the way we did.”

In doing so Carney took the lead at 11-10 with 1:38 remaining in the quarter. The Nordics did regain a slim lead at the end of the quarter but the Wolves soon took control.

In the first four minutes of the second C-N went on a 7-0 scoring run. They ended up outscoring the Nordics 14-6 in the stanza to have a seven-point halftime lead — a lead they didn’t relinquish.

“The girls worked the ball around well tonight and were getting and taking good shots” Linder added.

The Nordics were able to run their own offense fairly effectively at times. But the Wolves’ man-to-man defense forced most of ND’s shooting inside where Wagner was able to either force extra passes or block shots.

Hord led the Nordics with 19 points.

“Our focus tonight was to come out strong don’t turn the ball over and take good shots” said North Dickinson head coach Kirk Mattson. “As the game wore on we got tired but I give a ton of credit to Carney. They play very very good defense. We got wore down but I am happy with how hard our girls worked tonight.”

“Wagner is a smart player on both ends of the floor. Plus they have some good guards as well” Mattson added.

The Nordics who finish their season at 10-6 will have their entire roster returning next season.

“With no seniors on our roster I feel we’ll be in good shape next year as I expect the girls will work hard in the offseason” Mattson said. “Also I wish Carney the best with the rest of their tournament.”

With the win Carney-Nadeau remains undefeated and will travel to Westwood High School in West Ishpeming on Monday night to take on Munising in an MHSAA Division 4 regional semifinal. The winner will advance to the regional championship game Wednesday night at Gladstone High School.

“Tonight was a great performance from our girls. We’re 19-0. They haven’t let up all season and I couldn’t be more proud of them” Linder said.

Her study resulted in the ‘Mapping Death’ online database of burials and burial sites in Ireland (www.mappingdeath db.ie) compiled from published reports going back to the 19th century as well as grey literature from development-led excavations that have brought the discovery of dozens of new cemetery sites of this period throughout Ireland. These more recent excavations benefit from radiocarbon dates and strontium and oxygen isotopic evidence all of which is detailed in her book which encompasses 68 Iron Age sites 156 secular early medieval cemeteries and 27 ecclesiastical cemetery sites in total.

Burial B10 is one of 14 people buried at Knowth between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Isotope analysis has established that some members of the group came from northern Britain. The choice of this Neolithic monument for their burial was perhaps intended to create a link between the newly arrived people and the indigenous ancestors. Photo: RIA and G Eogan.

Like much of Scotland Ireland traded with the Roman Empire (see CA 317) but was never colonised and so there is much greater continuity over this great span of time than in much of England and Wales. This makes it easier in some ways to spot cultural changes that might have been introduced through trade diplomatic contact or migration. It also means that the period straddles prehistory (when the only evidence we have is archaeological) and the beginnings of literature. Useful information can be extracted about death and burial from early medieval saints’ lives annals and secular and Church laws including insights into the rationale behind the burial practices that prevailed at the time these works were written down.

Ancestral associations

O’Brien’s analysis begins in the Iron Age when the indigenous burial rite was a continuation of the later Bronze Age practice of cremation but with an intriguing difference: the use of pottery was abandoned for both funerary and domestic purposes at some point between 700 and 400 BC. Native pottery does not re-emerge in Ireland until the later 8th century. The reason for this cultural change is not known but it has interesting implications for the very early medieval period in England and Wales which is also aceramic. The sudden end to the Roman-British pottery industry is seen as a symptom of decline in England and Wales but it looks much more like a deliberate choice. The Iron Age people of Ireland and the post-Roman people of England and Wales clearly preferred vessels of carved wood leather cloth metal stone horn and bone for both domestic and ritual purposes – and maybe ceramic was associated with something they disliked.

Interments in the Neolithic passage grave and satellite tombs at Knowth Co. Meath ceased at the start of the Bronze Age but the monument was used again in the Iron Age with the insertion of 14 crouched inhumations around the main monument (here numbered) suggestive of a new group moving into the district and seeking to identify with the earlier inhabitants. Photo: RIA.

In Ireland instead of a funerary urn cremated bone was collected from the pyre and placed in an organic container for burial. When burials lack dateable ceramics archaeologists have to detect Iron Age burials by stratigraphic relationships radiocarbon-dating or by the small personal adornments that were included at just under half of the burial sites – sometimes burned and fused from the funeral pyre and sometimes added unburnt to the cremated remains as part of a separate burial rite. Glass beads are the most numerous followed by brooch and mirror-handle fragments rings bone or antler gaming pieces and in one case a small finely decorated unburnt but damaged cylindrical bronze box. The beads and the box are most closely paralleled by examples from England (the box being similar to one from Chariot Burial 2 at Wetwang Slack Yorkshire – see CA 363) and Scotland. Their import could be evidence of trade or of the movement of people across the Irish Sea.

Burial B4 at Knowth a flexed and prone female dating to the 1st to 3rd centuries AD was buried like several other people in the group with 43 blue glass beads which may have been stitched to her clothing as a symbol of group identity. The heavy stone placed over her head might indicate a desire to prevent her spirit rising from the grave to haunt the living. Photo: G Eogan.

The inclusion of both burnt and unburnt animal bone in some deposits suggests an element of feasting as part of the rites for the deceased which began with the cremation process – perhaps a very public spectacle symbolic of the liberation of the spirit from the body – followed some time later by selective burial of a small portion of the cremated remains perhaps as a smaller and more private ceremony. At ten of the 68 sites in the study the remains were inserted into existing Bronze Age burial monuments and in 42 cases they were buried in Iron Age mounds and ring-ditches that imitated the form of older monuments. These were constructed among existing Neolithic and Bronze Age burial monuments demonstrating continuing veneration of the ancestors and perhaps a sense that all the dead live on together in another world.

Among the most remarkable of all grave goods found in Ireland is a bronze cylindrical box which along with a fibula brooch and 86 stone and glass beads (all unburnt) had been added to a 4th- to 1st -century BC cremation burial at Ballydavis Townland Co. Laois. The box is nearly identical to the one recovered from Chariot Burial 2 at Wetwang Slack East Yorkshire. Nothing links the two burials other than the bronze box which might indicate that the deceased had a trading connection with the source of such objects in Britain or mainland Europe. photo: G Eogan.

Known burial sites account for a minute fraction of the population of Ireland at the time so it is difficult to tell whether cremation and resulting burial was typical or whether it was a special rite reserved for particular members of society. Pyre sites are elusive and experimental archaeology shows that those constructed on flat ground (as distinct from those built over a pit) leave very few traces. The remains are quickly dispersed by wind rain ploughing and soil erosion. Burial might always have been an exception. Eleven flat cremation cemeteries have been found however with no recognisable monument above ground to indicate their presence. Since these burials were invisible until discovered by chance it is possible that there are many more burials of this kind that we do not know about and that burial might have been a much more common rite than the excavated finds suggest.

There are two outstanding exceptions to these general patterns. The cremated remains of an older man were discovered in a promontory fort at Fore Co. Westmeath placed in a bronze bowl of 1st-century AD type probably imported from Britain. This prestigious object perhaps used in gift exchange was probably the prized possession of the individual whose remains were buried in it. The second example found in 1852 consisted of a green glass urn containing cremated bone covered by a bronze mirror – a style of burial for which the closest parallels are again in the Romanised parts of 1st-century AD Britain.

A rare example in Ireland of a Romano-British cremation jar found at Stoneyford Co. Kildare in 1852. The jar contained cremated bone and a small glass lachrymatory (a bottle for holding the tears of the mourners). It was covered by a bronze mirror. The burial site above a navigable river leading to the sea at Waterford suggests that the deceased was involved in trade with Roman Britain.

Romano-British influence is even clearer in the case of a small group of inhumation burials found in 1837 at Bray Co. Wicklow where workmen erecting gateposts found several individuals buried side by side along with coins of Trajan (r. AD 97-117) and Hadrian (r. AD 117-138). At the time they were interpreted as shipwreck victims but current thinking is that they may have been associated with an early 2nd-century AD Romano-British trading post. Another group of migrants from across the Irish Sea has been found in the form of 14 crouched burials inserted around the Neolithic passage grave at Knowth Co. Meath and its satellite tombs. Isotope analysis of the teeth from six of these burials shows that four of them (three adults and a child) came from north-eastern Britain where crouched burial was the tradition in the late Iron Age. The burials were accompanied by large numbers of small blue glass beads perhaps sewn onto the burial garments and these individuals are thought to represent a kin group for whom burial within an ancient burial complex was clearly of some symbolic importance.

Christian clues?

The burial cairn at Ballymacaward Co. Donegal is a good example of the reuse in later times of an ancient burial mound. The original monument was raised over two Bronze Age cist burials. A pit was dug into the mound and a cremation burial inserted between the 3rd century BC and 1st century AD. A further cremation was spread on the ground adjacent to the mound in the 2nd to 4th centuries AD. Four slab-lined cists were inserted into the surface of the mound during the early medieval period including this grave of an elderly woman buried according to the newly introduced rite of extended inhumation in the 5th/6th centuries. She suffered from osteoporosis of the spine which would have limited her mobility but she was clearly respected and cared for by her community. Photo: Elizabeth O’Brien.

This rare example in Ireland of the crouched burial rite had no influence on the indigenous population at the time. Cremation continued to be the mainstream burial rite until extended inhumation was introduced to Ireland in the 4th or early 5th century probably as a result of trading in tandem with the spread of Christianity to Ireland from the Romanised parts of western Britain. For the next 300 years cremation continued as a minority rite in parallel with inhumation. Although inhumation came to be identified with Christianity it was used much more widely and so archaeologists are not able to assume that every inhumation represents a Christian burial. Indeed the point that Christians and pagans were buried together in identical fashion is made by two literary sources from the 7th century that refer to an incident when St Patrick travelling along a road stopped at two adjacent graves one marked with a wooden cross. When questioned a voice from the grave marked with the cross admitted that he was a pagan and that the cross had been placed in error on his grave rather than that of his Christian neighbour.

Fortunately archaeologists do not have to depend on voices from the grave to distinguish Christian from pagan because Christian burials from the 6th century onwards used winding sheets for burial in imitation of the Gospel descriptions of Christ’s body being wrapped in strips of linen. Bodies thus wrapped can be recognised by the closeness of the arms to the body and the legs to each other while the foot bones are often commingled. By contrast unwrapped bodies are more spread especially their foot bones.

There is some evidence that bracken fern leaves or animal skins were used to wrap bodies before burial in the late Iron Age and early medieval period but Christian burial followed Gospel descriptions of Christ having been wrapped in a winding sheet of fine linen as depicted here at the base of the Cross of the Scriptures at Clonmacnoise Co. Offaly. photoS: Elizabeth O’Brien

Christian grave types cannot always be distinguished from pagan however. Manufactured wooden or stone coffins are unknown in Ireland at this time and some bodies were simply laid in the ground but some graves were lined and roofed by timber planks or stone. Bodies might also have been surrounded by selected stones which could have supported a wooden grave cover.

Isolated burial rather than burial in a formally organised cemetery continued to be the norm during the 4th to 7th centuries. The Iron Age practice of inserting human remains into prehistoric burial mounds seems to have ceased c.AD 200 only to be revived c.AD 400 and continued until c.AD 700. Nobody has been able to explain the 200-year gap nor the reason for the reintroduction of the practice but some memory of past practice must have survived because a 7th-century account of the life of St Patrick says that two daughters of the king of Tara whom Patrick had converted were ‘buried in a circular ring-ditch… because that is what the heathen Irish used to do’. Clearly nobody thought it odd or wrong to mix pagan and Christian customs and high-born Christian individuals were still being selected for burial among the pagan ancestors.

In part this might be explained by Irish law tracts dating from the 7th and 8th centuries which frequently refer to burial monuments as territorial boundary markers. A specific legal process is described whereby anyone seeking title to a property had to obtain the permission of the ancestors who were seen as guardians of the land and who could make their wishes clear through natural signs and omens. Incorporating the remains of important individuals into the ancestral environment could thus be interpreted as an act by the legitimate occupants of the land undertaken to reinforce their dynastic title. Alternatively an intrusive group might insert their own ‘guardians’ as a way of legitimising their claim to a territory – much as (Elizabeth O’Brien observes) later medieval genealogies were manipulated by the insertion of the names of ancestors from whom the present generation claimed to be descended.

Early Christian burials used slabs to create a stone-lined cist or boulders that might have supported a wooden grave cover both in imitation of the rock-cut tomb in which Christ was laid. Photos: G Eogan.

Settling on cemeteries

New mounds and ring-ditches continued to be constructed in imitation of ancestral monuments and these gradually evolved into formally organised communal cemeteries a practice unknown in Ireland until the late 4th century that continued into the 7th century. The first grave to be inserted into a newly constructed cemetery was perhaps seen as a foundation burial. These could contain the remains of a solitary adult or adolescent (male or female) or an adult and child or even a family group: the stone-lined grave within a ring-ditch at the centre of a cemetery at Ninch 3 Co. Meath contained a man and a woman as well as two children. Foundation burials were placed within the area enclosed by the ditch. Subsequently further interments occurred within or around the enclosed area possibly as a result of certain families returning to the same location to bury their dead over an extended period of time eventually leading to a cemetery with anything from 24 to 100 or more burials.

Surprisingly too we now know from strontium- and oxygen-isotopic analysis that some of these foundation burials contain the remains of migrants. Isotopic analysis has been obtained from 54 burials from 20 early medieval sites and though this represents a tiny fraction of excavated burials the results nevertheless give us an insight into the mobility of people at this time. Ten individuals were probably migrants from outside Ireland nine could have been born in Ireland or Britain 11 were Irish-born but not from the locality in which they were buried and the remaining 24 had been born in the same area where they were buried. Those from overseas include people from eastern and central Europe Scandinavia and north Africa or southern Spain as well northern and western Britain.

This cemetery at Westreave Co. Dublin has the hallmarks of a formally organised communal burial ground with a penannular ring-ditched enclosure imitating Bronze and Iron Age types. The central burial dates to the 5th/6th centuries AD. It is larger than necessary and is aligned on the entrance suggesting it is the foundational burial. The other 56 burials follow the same alignment some in rows some cutting across the enclosure ditch and all of similar date. IMAGE: MGL.

As O’Brien observes such results are consistent with the findings of similar research into early medieval burials in south Wales where individuals from Ireland have been identified all of which confirms literary accounts of the extensive travel undertaken mainly by clerics and scholars between Ireland Britain and the Continent in this period. Indeed early Irish laws state that freemen were permitted to travel for military service pilgrimage or for study while Aldhelm (AD 639-709) writing towards the end of the 7th century refers scathingly to the numbers of ‘students by the fleet-load’ travelling to Ireland ostensibly to further their education. Clearly some of these individuals became integrated into local society and some ended up as the possible progenitors of new family lines. Women however form the most numerous group of non-local burials (albeit only just: 15 compared to 13 men) and this perhaps represents exogamous marriage practices whereby the women marry outside of their kinship group.

A rare example of a male double burial at Mount Gamble Swords Co. Dublin. Both males are 25 to 35 years of age date from the 7th/8th centuries AD and died from severe weapon trauma. One has been decapitated though his head was placed in the correct anatomical position for burial while the other suffered a fatal stab wound to the back. They might have died together in battle or a fight or they may have been victims of ritual ‘kin-slaying’ the victims of a succession dispute. Photo: E O’Donnell and MGL.

An interesting variation on the theme of these organised and long-lived burial sites is the settlement cemetery where the cemetery is invariably located in a central position within an enclosure that is otherwise used as a livestock corral or for industrial activities such as cereal-drying and -milling and metalworking. Seldom is there any evidence for domestic habitation at these sites and Elizabeth O’Brien suggests this represents a pragmatic separation of potentially polluting and dangerous activities involving the use of fire from the areas where people were living in structures of timber and thatch. Probably used by several local kin groups the inclusion of a cemetery at the heart of farming and industrial sites suggests again that the ancestors were considered to be guardians of these important activities.

Regulated religion

By contrast with the Iron Age the inclusion of grave goods within pagan and Christian inhumations in the early medieval period is very rare indeed. Only 89 of the 11000 burials studied (0.81 per cent) have grave goods and these usually involve relatively minor artefacts. This is true even of the quartz pebbles commonly encountered in early medieval graves in Scotland Ireland Wales and the Isle of Man. White stones have also been found in hundreds of Neolithic mounds. Classical writers attributed healing and protective powers to quartz while Christianity adopted white stones to symbolise baptism and resurrection. In Ireland there is a notable decline in their use as grave goods from the 7th century. It is possible that white stones were initially used to distinguish Christian from pagan graves but once the majority of the deceased were Christian they were reserved for newly baptised individuals an idea supported by the frequency with which they occur in the graves of children.

Atypical burials raise all sorts of questions about the circumstances in which the deceased met his or her death. In this extreme case (Burial SK 42 Owenbristy Co. Galway) a 24- to 29-year-old man dating from the 7th/8th centuries AD had been quartered and decapitated and his head taken elsewhere. At least 127 cut marks have been identified including those in the groin consistent with genital mutilation.

From the early 8th century the Church authorities in Ireland began to regulate the lives of Christians to a far greater degree than in the past including the rules for burial. Biblical justification could be found for the secular desire to be buried in the grave of one’s ancestors but monks and clerics were expected to prefer the cemetery of the church or monastery to which they were affiliated. The Church offered persuasive arguments for burial within an ecclesiastic or monastic cemetery: the angels whose task was to carry the souls of the deceased to heaven were according to canon law unwilling to visit the places where evil men (that is pagans) were buried. It is clear too that money was at stake: canon law allowed lots to be drawn to decide how much of a deceased person’s estate should go to the Church and how much to the upkeep of an ancestral cemetery ‘but he ought to contribute the greater gift to the Church’ presumably in return for prayers for his or her soul.

O’Brien says that all the literary and canonical evidence suggests that the Church was seeking to overturn strong political and familial resistance to the abandonment of ancestral burial places even after three centuries of Christianity. The archaeological evidence suggests they were ultimately successful. The use of cremation and burial within an ancient monument had virtually ceased by the early 9th century though burial within some settlement and secular cemeteries continued right up until the further Church reforms of the 12th century. It is entirely possible that the Church authorities sought to make burial within a monastic cemetery more attractive by making it more exclusive – a closely guarded privilege perhaps reserved for those of high status willing to make a generous gift to the institution. Or perhaps there was an element of backing both horses: some members of a community or kin group were buried in a church cemetery and others in the secular ancestral cemetery. In the end though it seems that burial among ‘the saints’ became an acceptable substitute for burial among the ancestors.

Facing higher transportation costs at a time of surging demand is prompting the nation’s leading discount retailer to bring more of its transportation in-house. After successfully moving 20% of its freight via private fleet in 2020 Dollar General is seeking to step up its own fleet to mitigate soaring freight costs. Dollar General’s profit and gross margin expanded year-over-year in the latest quarter but higher shipping rates weighed on the bottom line the company said.

In a recent McKinsey survey of CPG companies 80% said they did not expect transportation costs to decrease this year from 2020’s elevated levels.

The expansion comes as Dollar General is increasing its store network in the U.S. and building up its DG Fresh program which aims to shift distribution of refrigerated goods to the company’s own trucks COO Jeff Owen said in a March 18 earnings conference call.

Ewing—that cackling whisky tumbler-holding pinnacle of television villainy—not being played by Larry Hagman. It almost happened.

Before Hagman’s successful audition the actor Robert Foxworth was offered the part of J.R. Dallas creator David Jacobs recently recalled during an interview with The Daily Beast.

It wasn’t J.R. that had percolated in Jacobs’ mind first when he created the CBS saga which ran from 1978 to 1991. It was the character of Pam later played by Victoria Principal—and the show’s original Romeo and Juliet storyline between her and Bobby (Patrick Duffy). “Pam wanted the house with the white picket fence. She didn’t want any of the rich Ewing fortune stuff. Their fathers were enemies. Her brother was investigating J.R.”

Foxworth Jacobs recalled asked the producers “Well why is this guy such a son of a bitch?”

Jacobs said he replied “Well he’s got all the power he needs. He knows this woman is not good for the family. There are people looking over his shoulder he doesn’t want any of that.”

“Well” Foxworth said “why is he such a son of a bitch about it? How are you going to change him? Why is he like that? How can we change him to be more human?”

“And everybody was looking at me” Jacobs recalled. “I said ‘We’re not going to change him. He likes that power. He likes being J.R. Ewing. That’s it.’ I won the battle of keeping J.R. mean.”

Foxworth—who later starred as Falcon Crest patriarch Chase Gioberti—passed on the role and then the show’s casting director Barbara Miller suggested Hagman. Jacobs recalled he was sitting with his back to the door when Hagman came to the audition. He saw his colleagues’ eyes flick past him. “I looked to see what they had seen” Jacobs recalled “and standing there goddammit if it wasn’t J.R. Ewing. Larry wore boots had a Stetson in his hand and called us all ‘Darlin.’ He dressed for that little meeting. I knew he was right for the part. We all knew. But I didn’t know he would become the show.”

In creating Dallas and Knots Landing (1979-1993) Jacobs now 81 rewrote the rules of primetime serial drama (he does not wholly reject but really doesn’t love the term “soap opera”). Before Dallas there had been the TV series of Peyton Place which had ended in 1969. But Dallas was the show whose influence can still be seen in shows like Succession and Knots Landing’s innocuous cul-de-sac as a cover for all manner of far-fetched melodrama and bed-hopping shenanigans has been echoed in shows like Desperate Housewives and Big Little Lies.

Jacobs laughs that anyone under 30 “doesn’t know what you’re talking about” when invoking Dallas and Knots Landing “unless they watched the shows with grandma.” All roads lead back to Dallas as a template for making the night-time drama a weekly soapy indulgence. It was Jacobs who invented this original crown prince of water-cooler TV and you can see his influence on your favorite shows today.

Just the presence of Dallas showed that soap operas could not only work in primetime but flourish—with storylines like “Who shot JR?” (watched by 90 million Americans) and the notorious season that turned out to be a dream. After Jacobs came show runners like Stephen Bochco who in Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law developed the primetime serial dramatic form even further and Darren Star who sought to make soapiness younger in his ’90s playgrounds Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place.

“ The show should have worked but the way they did it made them completely dependent on old Dallas characters and kept them around too long. ” — David Jacobs

When this reporter asked Jacobs how he felt about Dallas’ 2012 reboot he sighed and said “You don’t want to go here do you? I hated it and it should have been so easy because all you do is flip the boys. You make J.R.’s kid the good kid and Bobby’s kid the bad kid. You flip them and all of a sudden you’ve got a whole new thing to play with. It makes sense J.R.’s kid would be a good kid because he wants to show the world that not all Ewings are sons of bitches like his father. And the other boy Christopher is adopted so he wants to show everyone that he can be just as much of a prick as any Ewing. That would have given the whole thing a new part of the canvas to play.

“Bobby’s new wife should have been a rich Black woman from Chicago. The show should have worked but the way they did it made them completely dependent on old Dallas characters and kept them around too long. The old characters weren’t interesting and their presence meant the show never really got the kids to run with the show. I didn’t like the material. I thought it was just a lost opportunity. People wanted to like it but there was nothing to hold them. It just didn’t work.”

And then there is Jacobs’ favorite creation Knots Landing—the best-written of all the first generation primetime soaps and most ignored—which Jacobs rightly thinks became “the real favorite of the audience” and is still loved passionately by its fans and creator today.

“From 1964 to 2004 not one year went by when I didn’t have something published or produced.”

Jacobs wasn’t a fan of soap operas when he was young growing up in Baltimore Maryland. He loved movies but thought he would grow up to be a visual artist. The New York-set crime show Naked City (1958-1963) was his favorite television series because it felt “so real it had that Sidney Lumet style of realism. It was like a repertory company. Actors like Jack Warden and Martin Balsam appeared in different episodes as different characters.”

Until he reached his teenage years Jacobs thought of himself “as if I was living in a world of my own. I had almost a mile to walk to get to the bus that would take me to school. I used to always talk out loud. I don’t know what I was talking about. I guess I was rehearsing for something. Everything.”

The young Jacobs liked elementary school but not high school. “It took me a long time to be insulted by things I should have been insulted by earlier” he said laughing as he recalled his English teacher asking if he had really written a piece of work. “I said ‘yeah’ and she sort of nodded her head. I had the feeling she didn’t quite believe me and I didn’t realize then it was a compliment. It was too good for a fifth grader to have written. She gave me an E which meant ‘Excellent’ then.”

Jacobs’ father was “mostly an insurance salesman” who also owned a bar and gambled in Vegas until Jacobs’ mother “made him get out of it and go straight. I love my father desperately. He really influenced me. I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up but I knew I didn’t want to be like him. I wanted to be like him in his character but go to work every day which he hated. That made me ultimately take my art seriously.”

Jacobs “made the mistake” of going to an all-boys high school. “If there had been girls in the class I would never have been so lazy and stupid.” He graduated high school in 1957 429 out of 479 in his year. At a party for those leaving to go to college a girl—“way out my league”—sat next to him on some swings. He told her if he went to the University of Maryland he would flunk out. She like his mother told him if he did that he would get drafted.

He changed his mind and attended the Maryland Institute College of Art. “I was always one of those kids who drew a little so I got in and all of a sudden my life changed I learned in four years that I was never going to make it as an artist but that’s the world I wanted to be part of.”

As soon as Jacobs graduated he got the first train he could to New York City where he first worked as an illustrator and researcher for Grolier's Encyclopedia. He wrote on the Bauhaus and was put in charge of art and architecture articles. He realized he had a knack for writing for children and explaining complex ideas easily. He co-wrote a book about the workings of a New York police precinct.

In 1963 he married his first wife Lynn Pleshette. They had a daughter Albyn in 1965. After their divorce in the mid-1970s Lynn next married the actor John Pleshette who played the character of Richard Avery in the early seasons of Knots Landing. Lynn remains Jacobs’ agent today. (Jacobs went on to marry second wife Diana with whom he has two children Aaron and Molly.)

In order to be near Albyn Jacobs moved to Los Angeles where he began his life in television. “I had this kind of arrogance I could write my way out of anything. From 1964 to 2004 not one year went by when I didn’t have something published or produced. And sure I think back on it now and wondered how the hell I did it. I hope I’m very modest about what I do.”

On his arrival in L.A. Jacobs joined a writers’ group and—armed with some short stories—began to arrange meetings. His first credit was for an episode (“The Great Wall of Chinatown”) of the crime series The Blue Knight. He recalled writing it over Labor Day weekend in 1976 and it being good enough to be made just days later. The series was canceled.

He became friends with Lorimar development executive Michael Filerman who later became his producing partner on Knots Landing and who said that he would get writing jobs on TV shows—and so he did on the mystery crime drama Kingston: Confidential and the topically inclined ABC show Family. The latter show had a “wonderful reputation for being smart but they were tough on writers. No one lasted more than a month but I lasted. And I was hot. I made it on Family. It was a show about a middle-class family. It was where I belonged.”

Filerman said to Jacobs that he should come up with ideas to pitch for the new TV season. Knots Landing was his first. He saw it as his take on the television version of Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage focused on four couples living in Southern California. Filerman showed him a movie called No Down Payment (1957) about yet more suburban misadventures. “It was really trashy” recalled Jacobs. “That set the stage for Mike and my relationship. I wanted to do art. He wanted to do trash. And together we did television.”

CBS told Jacobs “they sort of liked” his Knots Landing idea a domestic drama. “But I really think they were thinking ‘Oy vey that’s the last thing we need.’ They said what they really wanted was something glitzy more of a saga and that became Dallas. But I always felt more personally connected to Knots Landing. Still when CBS said ‘saga’ I thought westerns. I loved westerns. Later I said it had to be set in Texas. Sagas always happen in Texas.”

In the first draft of the Dallas script Bobby said Jacobs was much more like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof “like ‘I want to go to Vegas. I don’t want to work this weekend.’ But Patrick Duffy didn’t want to play him that way and Bobby became much stronger as we developed him.”

J.R. was set up as Pam’s enemy. “She needed somebody to be the villain” recalled Jacobs. “She needed an obstacle and J.R. was it because Bobby’s parents Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes; and for one season Donna Reed) and Jock (Jim Davis) liked Pam.”

Another classical narrative template—Cain and Abel—was formed as J.R. and Bobby began their seemingly endless struggle for control for Ewing Oil. As the actors settled into their roles and as the show’s national and international viewership increased Hagman-as-J.R. emerged as the fulcrum of the show: the reason viewers around the world tuned in to see what dastardly machinations he would unleash on poor Sue Ellen Bobby and Pam that week.

“ I didn’t realize until later how incredible it was and how lucky I had been to have been in the right place at the right time. ” — David Jacobs

Jacobs recalled the draft Dallas script “evolving fast” completing it over Thanksgiving weekend 1977. The first episode aired on April 2 1978.

The modern primetime soap was born even if the early seasons of shows like Dallas and Knots Landing began as self-contained episodes.

A colleague said to Jacobs that Dallas should become a continuing drama.

“You cannot not play what happened last week” the colleague told Jacobs. “Every week you want to resolve the situation but not solve the problem. If somebody’s wife dies the guy can’t be the same as he was the following week. Continuing drama is a natural genre for television but back then they were always afraid of people watching shows out of order.”

Jacobs successfully lobbied for Dallas to become a continuing drama and Dallas transformed into an episodic soap opera in its second and third seasons.

“I wasn’t familiar enough with TV to know how unusual it was” Jacobs recalled. “I didn’t realize until later how incredible it was and how lucky I had been to have been in the right place at the right time.”

It feels “good” to Jacobs to have created a character like J.R. who has passed into TV legend Jacobs said with characteristic humility. “In public I always say creating a TV character is a collaboration between the actor and writer.” Jacobs recalled that he once wrote “He laughs” at the end of one of J.R.’s speeches at the end of an episode where he swears to never underestimate Pam ever again.

Later he thought he had written “He smiles” and that Hagman had turned it into a laugh proving his point about the collaboration of writer and actor. Years later Jacobs chuckled he came across the original script. Jacobs had written “He laughs” so Hagman was merely doing what was written on the page—and he had been giving him incorrect credit for years.

The women of Knots Landing led the show but the women of Dallas—at least in the early years with Sue Ellen drunk and gaslit to insanity and Pam beyond-sappy—were not as instrumental. Jacobs says as the 1980s progressed the female characters accrued more power.

Jacobs didn’t have much to do with the writing of Dallas after the first 16 episodes although the production—led by show runner Leonard Katzman—was always very “respectful” of Jacobs. He sat in on the season storyline “bible” meetings too.

“ I said to Leonard ‘He’s dead.’ So he said ‘Well what if it were all a dream?’ ” — David Jacobs

CBS’ orders for episodes rose and rose from 24 to 31 episodes; the revelation of “who shot JR” in 1980 garnered a then record-breaking 90 million viewers. Jacobs said the idea for the infamous storyline came from writer Camille Marchetta saying “Let’s just shoot the bastard.”

Jacobs had “mixed feelings” when Bobby infamously appeared from the shower revealing the preceding season (and his death!) to have been a dream. He recalled bumping into Katzman on their office staircase one day.

“Leonard (Katzman) told me they had lost Patrick (Duffy). The next season hadn’t been that good anyway so Patrick was coming back and Leonard said to me ‘He doesn’t do me any good if he’s not Bobby.’

“I said to Leonard ‘He’s dead.’ So he said ‘Well what if it were all a dream?’

“I said something clever like ‘I think the audience will resent you for the tears they had shed when Bobby died.’

“Leonard said ‘But it doesn’t do me any good if Patrick comes back as anybody else unless he’s Bobby Ewing.’ And he was right. I thought it was not a good idea. But I don’t think it had anything to do with the decline of the show. I think the show was in decline anyway. I didn’t care for that storyline but I didn’t care for a lot of things I have profited by. I only used to get pissed when anyone in the Dallas cast would put down Knots Landing in interviews. Then I became ferocious to the extent I could be ferocious.”

Jacobs recalled making $12000 the year before he created Dallas and then being able to buy a house the year after that and building his own home the year after that. Katzman’s stewardship of the show was “terrific” he said although the profile writers in magazines wrote longer pieces about Jacobs the creator. Katzman was quoted in interviews emphasizing his own authority over the show; it seemed to Jacobs that he was “defending his right to be the boss.”

ABC’s Dynasty originally titled Oil premiered three years after Dallas. It was glossier more glamorous and it also had an iconic villain: Joan Collins’ Alexis. It also featured a constantly feuding mega-rich family whose premier business interest was oil. Jacobs said that he still jokes with Dynasty creators his longtime friends Richard and Esther Shapiro that he’s awaiting royalty payments from them (“They always say it’s coming”).

Both Dallas and Dynasty vied in the ratings and became steadily more bonkers and outlandish as they did so. Dallas got a “little better with the wardrobe budget” Jacobs concedes “though we could never compete with what they were spending on Dynasty. I never became hooked on Dynasty.” (Jacobs had worked with the Dynasty creator Aaron Spelling on Family.)

Dallas’ decline was a natural byproduct of any long-running TV show’s aging Jacobs says. Dallas had been on TV for 13 years when it ended—“a rare thing” as Jacobs put it. “When the show started sinking a little fading it was just tired. It needed some craziness. Not crazy stories just some outrageousness in the writing.”

“ One of the things that was wrong about the Dallas ending is that it wasn’t illuminating for J.R. so why do it? It should have been more radical. ” — David Jacobs

Jacobs still sees Linda Gray occasionally and says he always wanted to inject her “sense of fun” into the character of Sue Ellen—indeed early on in making the show Jacobs and Gray would meet up at the hotel bar where cast and crew were staying to give Sue Ellen more lines at the expense of Pam. There was a “flirty edge” off camera between Gray and Patrick Duffy which Jacobs always thought should have been played on screen.

How did Jacobs feel about how the original series of Dallas ended in 1991—with Joel Grey as the devil showing J.R. what the rest of the Ewings’ lives would have been like without him culminating with J.R. finally being goaded into possible suicide? (A subsequent movie proved he had not.)

“It was like It’s a Wonderful Life. I just didn’t think that worked” said Jacobs. “I would have liked a character really having to take stock. One of the things that was wrong about the Dallas ending is that it wasn’t illuminating for J.R. so why do it? It should have been more radical or gone against the It’s a Wonderful Life idea with J.R. not understanding what a great life he had. Or maybe he should have done another horrible thing like kicking puppies.”

“The greatest pleasure I got out of Knots Landing was keeping it real.”

Jacobs’ heart has always been with Knots Landing. Dallas may be better known but it was Knots that remained his most cherished child. It was also the better show. Jacobs recently spoke to Henry Winkler on the phone the Fonz himself who was producing a “where are they now?” kind of show which had led to him watching a lot of Knots Landing.

“I didn’t watch it at the time. This show could run today!” Winkler told Jacobs excitedly.

The show began in 1979 and used the characters of Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) and wife Valene (Joan Van Ark) decamping west to begin a new life in the eponymous Californian cul-de-sac. It wasn’t much of an escape from J.R. for them with attempted murders affairs double-dealing baby kidnap and the consistently vexatious presence of another iconic TV villain Abby (Donna Mills).

As Dallas’ popularity picked up CBS asked Jacobs for a spin-off. Out came the original script inspired by Scenes from a Marriage with Gary and Val now written as the leads and the link back to Southfork—although in an alternate reality because while Dallas had a dream season to explain Bobby’s reappearance Knots Landing did not.

Jacobs was now the boss of his ex-wife Lynn’s second husband which sounds pretty soapy itself. “We were close enough friends” Jacobs said of his relationship with John Pleshette who played Richard in Knots Landing. “I had a big fight to get him on the show. It was just easier to be decent about things. The best easiest way to have some things happen is not to pick fights. John is very opinionated just like Richard. Richard was definitely John” Jacobs laughed. “But our fights were always about the work.”

Jacobs recalled that Alec Baldwin who played insane abusive preacher Joshua Rush had said in his memoir that he had been born an actor but Broadway icon Julie Harris who played his mother Lilimae Clements on Knots had made him professional. He had also noted that all the things the women on Knots Landing had said were things believed by Jacobs.

Jacobs agrees with this. “Knots Landing was written for women” he said proudly—and at its heart were strong female characters: Karen (Michele Lee) Val Abby Laura (Constance McCashin) and later Paige (Nicollette Sheridan).

“ Knots Landing married really rich production values with really strong melodrama that worked in this middle-class setting. We could make a great scene out of someone putting their hair in curlers. ” — David Jacobs

“The greatest pleasure I got out of Knots Landing was keeping it real” said Jacobs. “In Dallas if a car pulled up in front of a building there was always a parking space. Those things bothered me. In Knots Landing if someone bought a car they talked about financing it. Dallas set the stage for continuing drama. Knots Landing married really rich production values with really strong melodrama that worked in this middle-class setting. We could make a great scene out of someone putting their hair in curlers.”

Sure this reporter said but Knots Landing also knew how to make things crazy such as when evil Jill (Teri Austin) tried to make Val commit suicide or when the latter’s babies were not dead as she presumed but taken from her.

Jacobs was concerned with the lack of Black lead characters on the show which his studio bosses in those days were initially resistant to. He tried to ensure that as many secondary professional characters featured in episodes were Black until he was finally able to write a Black family on to the cul-de-sac in Season 9 (1987-8)—the Williams’ Frank (Larry Riley) Pat (Lynne Moody) and Julie (Kent Masters-King).

How and why did CBS relent this reporter asked.

“I just did it” said Jacobs.

He recalled speaking at an event for Knots Landing’s 200th episode making the point masked in a joke that Knots Landing had lasted so long “because CBS had forgotten to cancel it. They didn’t love it the way they loved Dallas because of the ratings.” Jacobs and his more beloved TV child were left alone to their own devices. He recalled Dallas producer Lee Rich once saying after a meeting at CBS. “They don’t care about Knots Landing.” The network kept the show on air said Jacobs “as part of the price of having Dallas.”

The irony of this is that Knots Landing was the better show and deserved as much of an audience—as well as care and attention—as Dallas. As well as soapy melodrama there was also humor. The middle-class setting made the characters feel relatable even if their storylines were occasionally outlandish. The writing was sharp and nuanced and its lead actors utterly inhabited their characters.

Today it is Knots Landing that remains beloved by fans (who can feast on lovingly curated gossip and interviews at KnotsLanding.net)—and Michele Lee Joan Van Ark and Donna Mills still delight fans with public appearances such as the “Stars in the House” special of last October hosted by Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley.

Even if all the ’80s soaps became more and more loopy as their seasons wound on Jacobs insists “I always let Knots go its own way and tell its own stories. We had a brilliant cast who were always willing.” He is particularly proud of the storyline which saw Abby deal with her daughter Olivia’s (Tonya Crowe) drug addiction a storyline inspired by the 1985 TV movie Toughlove. The episode where mother insisted daughter go cold turkey was one of the best Knots Landing ever did Jacobs thinks.

While ’80s TV was relatively sparse when it came to LGBTQ representation—the homophobia and nervousness of networks and advertisers dictated it so—Jacobs said the extremely vanilla flirtation of Laura and Ciji (Lisa Hartman) was deliberately written as a lesbian subplot. The network had been nervous about it just as it had been resistant to Black characters—and Filerman gay himself had been “responsive to the network’s reluctance” and uncomfortable about pushing the same-sex storyline Jacobs said.

The only show Jacobs loved making as much as Knots Landing was Paradise the ill-fated family-based western series he did afterward. One article from the early ’90s when Knots—like Dallas—was undergoing later-in-life story and character problems says that the actors had gone to Jacobs with lists of issues and requests for changes.

“ Michele understood that every word that came out of Karen’s mouth was mine me the way I felt. Karen’s alter ego was me. ” — David Jacobs

When this reporter asked Jacobs if they were divas or nightmares to work with he says emphatically “They were absolutely not like that. They could be very protective. If Joan (Van Ark) wanted a change to something Valene was saying or doing she would send my wife flowers and send my kids toys. Ten minutes later the problem would be taken care of.

“Michele (Lee) would say the script was fine there were just these one or two things. I remember once she didn’t want Karen to be dying. And two weeks later a new script would come out of that. She also knew how to handle me. We were too much alike. We were too New York too Jewish and we’ve always been friends.”

“Michele understood that every word that came out of Karen’s mouth was mine me the way I felt” Jacobs said. “Karen’s alter ego was me. She was the one who got maddest at the political situation. She was most angry over prejudice.” Karen famously delivered “the Pollyanna speech”—a suburban cri-de-coeur about the decline of decency and community—which Jacobs revealed first came from the cast ad-libbing at Jacobs’ house. The scriptwriters then shaped it into the famous speech. “It came from the guts of the show” Jacobs says.

However he laughed he was against the agonizingly drawn out twin babies’ kidnap storyline saying to Richard Gollance the scriptwriter who proposed it and Filerman that it was too evil even for Abby to be involved in. The storyline tempered her involvement but it was still one of the show’s most memorable storylines.

Donna Mills was nothing like Abby Jacobs says. “She really was the easiest person to work with along with Julie Harris.” Her arrival in Knots Landing was deliberately delayed until season two and planned as a surprise to audiences not expecting a Volvo-driving mom of two to become the show’s chief antagonist.

Jacobs recalled he had first seen Mills on screen one cold winter while staying alone at a friends’ place in the Hamptons.

The local cinema had a double feature for a dollar on Monday nights; and so it was that he saw Mills playing Toby Clint Eastwood’s very nice artist girlfriend in Play Misty for Me (also starring Jessica Walter who died on Wednesday aged 80 as the psychotic Evelyn). Jacobs said Mills was his “dream shiksa” and couldn’t get her out of his head. At Mills’ Knots Landing farewell lunch he said that if anyone had told him just a few years later they would be working together he would not have believed them.

It was never easy when stars like Mills left the show. The very presence of Don Murray (Sid Fairgate) and Julie Harris ensured a “well-behaved and professional set” recalled Jacobs. When Murray asked to leave the show to do movies it took two men to replace him said Jacobs—Kevin Dobson as Mack MacKenzie Karen’s second husband and William Devane as Greg Sumner cigar-chomping business tycoon; the former for his butchness and the latter for his gravitas.

As the years went on the network kept seeking budget cuts and so much-loved stars—like McCashin as Laura—left the show leaving Jacobs with the task of “amputating” parts of the show to save the whole. He knew the show was in trouble when the female store and restaurant workers near the studio stopped interrogating him and excitedly critiquing the previous night’s outrageous plot developments.

“ I like to think Knots Landing would have evolved into Big Little Lies. I thought that was just fabulous. ” — David Jacobs

The Knots Landing finale with the central characters reuniting in the cul-de-sac with the villainous Abby noting it’s “just like old times” felt “a little too understated” to Jacobs. “I would like it to have been more dramatic.”

“I like to think Knots Landing would have evolved into Big Little Lies” Jacobs said. “I thought that show was just fabulous.” Jacobs also enjoys watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Queen’s Gambit in which he was particularly struck by the relationship of Beth (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her adoptive mother (Alma played by Marielle Heller): “I’ve never done a mother-daughter relationship on TV done so well.”

Jacobs laughed that since retiring 20 years ago he had repeatedly said Dallas and Knots Landing had changed the format of primetime drama.

He noted that Bochco’s Hill Street Blues was scheduled against Knots on Thursdays at 10 p.m. “It became everybody’s darling” Jacobs recalled. “The first couple of years I always won the numbers and he would win the Emmys. And of course Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law also reinvented the form. Stephen Bochco and I once did a panel. He said all TV shows were cop shows. And I said ‘That’s funny. I always say all TV shows are family shows.’ And he said ‘Same thing.’”

“I think the middle class is the most interesting class.”

So Jacobs’ true devotion was to Knots Landing rather than Dallas? “Absolutely. I have very middle class… I don’t want to say values but tastes and ambitions. I think the middle class is the most interesting class. Do you know what show I like now? Succession it’s a really great drama but I don’t want to be in that world. Knots Landing has that same middle-class footing I have. I used to get pissed off in the early days of Dallas when Bobby would go to the bank and ask for $300 million.”

A colleague once joked to Jacobs that she was going to pretend to be him or someone “who never doesn’t want to come to work.” It was good to hear but not entirely true he said. He left television because he found himself having to worry about things he had never had to worry about before like budgets. “It just wasn’t fun anymore” he said. “What was right for me what stirred my juices wasn’t there anymore.”

“ I have no doubts I have never had doubts. I never regret anything. I never plan anything. I never had any goals but it’s worked out. ” — David Jacobs

Jacobs is proud to have two television hits and to have made 57 episodes of Paradise as his swan song. “One of the reasons I walked away was because I didn’t want to do the same thing over and over again. I have no doubts I have never had doubts. I never regret anything. I never plan anything. I never had any goals but it’s worked out.”

There is also a David Jacobs show we have never seen. He first pitched The Last Island in 1977 featuring a place “like Nantucket or East Hampton.” The show opens the week before Labor Day and by the end of the pilot the island inhabitants have no contact with the outside world. “It becomes both utopia and the end of the world. They have to create an entirely new society. All the parts felt right and the pandemic has made me think again about how things change and don’t change.”

Jacobs almost sold the show to the BBC last year but its producer said they could not do it because the most intriguing thing about the show—the change in society and values—“was not the same as British values.”

Jacobs said his life today at 81 was “weird and wonderful.” He is one of a six-member “cabal” of friends whose connections date back to their teenage years in Baltimore. The group was born between 1939 and 1941. Jacobs is the oldest and when he turned 80 in 2019 he held a birthday party for all the group. “We had a great week it was terrific.” He is presently grieving the loss of one of the group Bob who died two months ago.

“ I’m so mad he died first. There is no time in any day that I don’t reach for the phone to call him. So that’s affected me a lot. I am really grieving. ” — David Jacobs

A few years ago Jacobs thought he had Alzheimer’s; his father suffered from it and his sister has it. The tests revealed nothing was wrong but a heart test revealed he needed to have an aortic valve replaced. He had the operation and recovered fast and was soon able to drive. Bob had seemed to have survived the cancer he had fought and needed the same aortic valve replacement and—encouraged by Jacobs’ recovery—had the same surgery.

“Of all those people who I know who are not related to me by blood I loved Bob” said Jacobs. “We were always friends right to the end. I’m so mad he died first. There is no time in any day that I don’t reach for the phone to call him. So that’s affected me a lot. I am really grieving. I never grieved before you know. I have lost aunts uncles and parents—but they’re supposed to die you’re conditioned for it. But I can’t stand this. I hate it.”

Jacobs says he has lost a few friends in recent times like Bob Michael Filerman and Lee Rich. “At least Mike had the good grace to be older than me” Jacobs said. It hasn’t affected how he sees his own mortality. “I know I’m going to die. Since losing Bob I realize the thing I dread is other people dying. I don’t want any of the other guys to die but I have to put up with that.” He cherishes his wife his children and grandchildren (one in Sherman Oaks one in London; both born when he was 72) and his friendship with Lynn.

Is Jacobs still proprietary when it comes to Dallas and Knots Landing? “I’m much more protective of Knots Landing. It needed more protection because it was ignored. However that’s changing and in fact you see a lot of Knots Landing now.” Jacobs paused and chuckled softly. “I still feel they’re both mine. I’m their dad.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvZHJhZnQvcGxheWVyLWludGVydmlld3MvbmZsLWRyYWZ0LWNsYXNzLW9mLTIwMjEtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWplcnJ5LWphY29icy1hcmthbnNhcy1jb3JuZXJiYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL DRAFT CLASS OF 2021 INTERVIEW: JERRY JACOBS | ARKANSAS | CORNERBACK,"How did you do today at your Pro Day? I performed very well. I did good. I could improve on a little stuff. Today I benched 20 reps to the bench thing. I jumped 25 on the vert 10-1 on broad. I got different numbers in the 40. I had one scout that had 4.3 another caught 4.4 some 4.5. So I really don't know the times. But I ran the 4.5. I can say that. I didn't get my numbers on the 5-10-5 but I think I did pretty good.

What played into the decision to opt-out? Just went through stuff. My mind wasn't there. I was losing it. Honestly it was me. I wasn't — I don't want to say no COVID or nothing. It was my decision. I should have talked to someone before I made it. Honestly it was my decision. So own up to it and learn from it.

How would you say the opt-out benefited you? At the beginning it was bad. A lot of people just questioned me like 'Why did you opt out?' So I feel like it was hurtful but knowing that the priority of pro day and they asked me stuff like that. So I feel like they want to see if I can handle adversity see if I can be coachable and stuff. It hurt me a little bit but I still think I'll still be good.

What have you told teams about what you can bring to the table? Just I told them I can be coachable. I can learn from my mistakes my opt-out decision. I learned what to do to make a better decision to not make a decision like that. Just my playing skills that I can play and do whatever they need; special teams.

Where have you done since the fall? Where have you worked out? Who's representing you? I worked out in Miami. I signed with this agency called Agency 1 Sports Group located in Miami. I was training at Mike Lawrence Performance Center in South Florida. And I've been there since I left here.

Did you go down to Miami almost immediately? It took me probably no later than four weeks to go there and get training and get started. I probably left right after.

Did you regret your decision to opt-out? 100% sure I regret it. If I can there again and change my life change that decision that would be one that I did. I did on my own. I didn't talk to nobody. I talked to Coach [Sam] Pittman but he gave me a lot of reasons why I should have stayed. I probably wasn't just hearing it at the moment. I feel like I regret it 1000%. Live and learn. So got to let it go.

What does it mean to come back and participate in the pro day? It just showed me they got a lot of character. They got a lot of love. I thought the love was going to be lost here. I just appreciate the coaches and let me come and perform in front of these scouts and let me come back on campus at the end of the season like that. So I just think that played a role in why Coach Pittman and the rest of the staff let me come back.

If it wasn't about COVID why did you opt-out? What were your concerns? Really just me. My health was good. My mind and what I was eating me up on the inside. So honestly nobody took my position my health none of that. It was me. It was Jerry Jacobs. I wasn't there all the way. I wasn't like me. So yeah it was me.

How does your personal story help you to overcome such a thing? I learned from so much stuff. I've been through so much and a lot of scouts write me in their story. I don't want that story to rebound because everybody got some story and nobody's cared. It just showed me that my mom is still with me because the decision I made was hurtful and stuff like that. But I still got the opportunity to come out and here perform. So I just think God blessed me. I really can't say nothing bad. It was me.

Is your 40-time the range of what you thought you would record today? I really think I got a 4.38. I was moving — it was everybody got a different time though. Some scouts got a 4.4. Some scouts had me at a 4.5. I got Coach Walker clocked me at a 4.39. So it was just all around. But honestly I know my speed and I know what I can do. I think my range was 4.3. But everybody got different times.

Jacob who represented District 4 was the Boone County Council’s sitting president when he died. He had not attended council meetings for several months because of health issues.

“We all anticipated him coming back” said Elise Nieshalla vice president of the Boone County Council. “I spoke with him in January and at that point he was coming back and we fully expected he would be able to continue his service. He leaves us with incredible loss and the great gift of his legacy. He was a tremendous public servant and he loved our county.”

Jacob served on the Boone County Council for more than 20 years and was a chairman of the Boone County Convention & Visitors Bureau a member and vice chairman of the Boone County Republican Central Committee and member of the Boone County Economic Development Corp.’s executive committee. He was also active in many other community organizations including Zionsville Youth Soccer Association and the Zionsville Rotary Club.

“He was a people-first consensus builder” Nieshalla said. “He always looked for the win-win solution for all involved. He was a servant leader through and through.”

Boone County Council member Kevin Van Horn met Jacob five years ago.

“What I was surprised by was at that time I did not know that he had been on the council for maybe three or four terms” Van Horn said. “So I said to myself ‘OK this guy has been around this (a) long (time). He obviously knows something. I’m going to follow his lead.’ And it turned out to be one of the best choices I ever made. I had never been in politics before until I was appointed to the council and Steve was strictly professional. His leadership abilities were off the chart.”

Jacob drew his inspiration to serve as an elected official from his father-in-law Paul Green who also served as president of the Boone County Council according to Jacob’s obituary. Green was inspired by Ollie Berry his own father-in-law. Berry served in the same role.

Debbie Ottinger chairman of the Boone County Republican Party and the county’s recorder was Jacob’s friend for many years. Jacob served as the vice chairman of the party when Ottinger was chairman.

“He was always willing to offer advice not only to me but to anyone who was considering getting into the political arena or if they were struggling with a political issue” said Ottinger who has served Boone County for 22 years as an elected official. “He helped mentor them into helping themselves and that was what he was really really good at.”

Steve is survived by his wife Janet Green Jacob; their three adult children Jeff Jill and Chris Jacob; and four grandsons Will Cole Jake and Henry. An informal outdoor visitation was held March 22 at the Jacob’s home in Whitestown to celebrate Jacob’s life.

Born March 16 1947 Jacob was raised by William and Marietta Jacob on their family farm in Jasonville Ind. According to his obituary he honed his basketball skills in the family’s hay loft on a bent rim without a backboard and he still holds several Shakamak High School basketball records.

Jacob attended Purdue University and was the first in his family to attend college. He earned a Bachelor of Science in management at Purdue completed Wabash College’s Executive Development Program and served as a Congressional Fellow for the United States Congress in Washington D.C.

“The debate remains today over whether Janet spilling acid on Steve’s shirt in chemistry class was accidental or a complex and reckless but oddly successful ploy to get his phone number” his obituary stated. “Either way the pair graduated and the farm-kid from southern Indiana worked his way up through the ranks of Indiana Bell to a vice-president of Ameritech.”

Jacob went on to work in Washington D.C. lobbying for the telecom industry. He retired after an 18-year career with Time Warner Telecom (Bell AT&T and Ameritech) where he served as a vice president executive director of government affairs and general manager.

Big shoes to fill

Elise Nieshalla Boone County Council’s vice president said the council will vote at its April 13 meeting to determine who will serve as council president.

A caucus will determine who will fill Steve Jacob’s seat on the council.

“That will be addressed after we pay our respects” Nieshalla said.

Debbie Ottinger the chairman of the Boone County Republican Party and the county’s recorder will call the caucus with 10 days’ notice listing the precincts involved timeframe and candidates."

The 6-foot-4 275-pound defensive lineman from North Fort Myers H.S. in Florida spoke to Peegs.com about his interest in the IU program.

Johnson was just offered this week by Indiana but he has already started to learn about them and he likes how they use their D-linemen.

""They have a good football football program"" he said about Indiana. ""Their defensive line is very good and they have good play calls and good stunt calls.""

The IU coaches have told Johnson that they see him being an impact player in their defensive scheme.

""Their message to me has been that they think I would be a great fit on there D-line"" Johnson said. ""They said I could help them win games and be a part of a winning program.""

The talented prospect wants to make a trip to Indiana to check out the program. Johnson said whenever he is able to visit there are a few areas of program he wants to learn more about.

""I do have plans to visit Indiana"" Johnson said. ""When I do visit I will be looking to see if they have a good weight lifting program and a good recovery and treatment program.""

Indiana is the first Big Ten offer for 2026 Florida defensive lineman James Johnson.

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”"

If you've been using your credit card to pay others through cash payment apps you may want to consider changing your habits. That's because Chase cardholders may soon pay more for cash-like transactions when using a Chase credit card. Chase has recently announced updates to its cardmember agreement terms and these changes will go into effect in early April 2021. A portion of the updated cardmember agreement discusses cash-like transactions and notes changes to how these transactions will be treated.

Cash-like transactions will be treated as cash advances

Cash-like transactions can include the following:

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Purchasing traveler's checks foreign currency money orders wire transfers cryptocurrency and other similar virtual currency

Purchasing lottery tickets casino gaming chips race track wagers and similar online and offline betting transactions

Person-to person money transfers and accounting funding transactions

Making payments using a third-party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with a merchant or service provider

It's worth noting that this is not an exhaustive list and may include other similar transactions.

Since cash advances come with an added cost you can expect that these cash-like transactions will soon come with fees. Cash advances are not cheap. Most card issuers charge a fee for cash advances and these transactions also have a high APR interest rate. Because of these costs it's recommended you never get a credit card cash advance unless you're out of other options.

That means if you've been doing the following you may soon pay more:

Using a Chase credit card to pay friends or family members through payment apps such as PayPal or Venmo

Using a Chase credit card to pay bills through an outside payment processing system

Using a Chase card to bet online through gambling apps or at casinos

What will happen if you keep making these choices? You can expect to be charged cash-advance fees and expect to pay higher interest on these types of activity once the updated cardmember agreement terms go into effect. Wondering how much you might pay? It's best to check your own card agreement but Chase lists an example cardmember agreement on its website and these are the fees listed:

Cash-advance fee: Either $10 or 5% of the amount of each transaction whichever is greater

Cash-advance APR: 24.99%

You can avoid these fees by no longer using your credit card for cash-like transactions. It's best to consider your spending habits and make adjustments as needed so that you can avoid unwanted extra fees.

The exact date that these changes go into effect depends on the Chase card that you have. If you're unsure when to expect these changes you can contact Chase's customer service team or search your email inbox for a message with the subject line ""Important information regarding changes to your Chase account"" to read your updated agreement.

How to avoid cash-advance fees

If you want to ensure that you avoid cash-advance fees and accidental cash-like transactions from posting to your account contact Chase. You can adjust your cash-advance limit. You may want to make this limit zero or as low as possible so that you avoid accidentally paying more.

The bottom line

Pay attention to changes to your credit card account terms. If you get an email or letter from Chase be sure to read the updated terms so that you avoid surprises. Now that you know about these cash-like transaction updates you can adjust your habits and avoid unwanted fees.

Editor’s note: This story was originally published by The Guardian. It appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The world’s biggest 60 banks have provided $3.8 trillion of financing for fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal in 2015 according to a report by a coalition of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic cutting energy use overall funding remains on an upward trend and the finance provided in 2020 was higher than in 2016 or 2017 a fact the report’s authors and others described as “shocking.”

Oil gas and coal will need to be burned for some years to come. But it has been known since at least 2015 that a significant proportion of existing reserves must remain in the ground if global heating is to remain below 2 degrees Celsius the main Paris target. Financing for new reserves is therefore the “exact opposite” of what is required to tackle the climate crisis the report’s authors said.

US and Canadian banks make up only 13 of the 60 banks analyzed but account for almost half of global fossil fuel financing over the last five years the report found. JPMorgan Chase provided more finance than any other bank. UK bank Barclays provided the most fossil fuel financing among all European banks and French bank BNP Paribas was the biggest in the EU.

Overall financing dipped by 9 percent in pandemic-hit 2020 but funding for the 100 fossil fuel companies with the biggest expansion plans actually rose by 10 percent. Citi was the biggest financier of these 100 companies in 2020.

A commitment to be net zero by 2050 has been made by 17 of the 60 banks but the report describes the pledges as “dangerously weak half-baked or vague” arguing that action is needed today. Some banks have policies that block finance for coal the dirtiest fossil fuel but almost two-thirds of funding is for oil and gas companies.

The report’s authors said targeting of banks by campaigners and activist shareholders could help change bank policies but that action by governments was also needed.

“When we look at the five years overall the trend is still going in the wrong direction which is obviously the exact opposite of where we need to be going to live up to the goals of the Paris Agreement” said Alison Kirsch at Rainforest Action Network and an author of the report. “None of these 60 banks have made without loopholes a plan to exit fossil fuels.”

“We have seen progress in restricting financing for special places like the Arctic or greenhouse-gas-intensive forms of oil like tar sands but these are such a small piece of the pie” she said.

“One bank after another is making solemn promises to become ‘net zero by 2050’” said Johan Frijns at BankTrack part of the coalition behind the report. “But there exists no pathway towards this laudable goal that does not require dealing with bank finance for the fossil fuel industry right here and now.”

“Banks provide the financial oxygen that allows the fossil fuel industry to breathe” said Mark Campanale at financial thinktank Carbon Tracker which was not involved in the report. “It reveals the shocking fact that lending has grown since the Paris Agreement [which] should concern everyone not least policymakers and shareholders of the banks themselves. “The cost of carbon in terms of extreme weather events lost lives and livelihoods will be borne by society and sadly not the banks nor the fossil fuel companies” said Campanale. “Next time the banks come looking to taxpayers for a bailout they shouldn’t be surprised to find backs are turned.”

The report was produced by six NGOs and is endorsed by over 300 organizations from 50 countries. It used Bloomberg data to analyse both direct loans by banks to fossil fuel companies and funding from other investors that the banks arrange via bond and debt sales.

“A surprising result from the 2020 data is that BNP Paribas a bank that never loses an opportunity to boast of its clean green credentials and those of its US subsidiary Bank of the West came in as the fourth-worst fossil bank in 2020” the report said with the $41 billion provided by far the biggest sum in last five years.

BNP Paribas has some of the strongest policies on unconventional oil and gas such as fracking and tar sands Kirsch said: “But it’s a relatively small part of their overall funding and the bank hasn’t reined in its financing to the oil and gas supermajors which get really big deals.”

A spokesperson for BNP Paribas said the report has ranked the bank second for the strength of its restrictions on financing coal fracking and tar sands. “During the Covid-19 crisis all sectors of the economy needed support and BNP Paribas like other banks played an important stabilising role for the economy. However BNP Paribas supported the oil and gas sector to a lower extent than other sectors of activity.”

JPMorgan Chase launched a “Paris-aligned financing strategy” in October pledging to set intermediate emission targets for 2030 for its financing portfolio. It declined to comment on the report.

A Barclays spokeswoman said: “We have made a commitment to align our entire financing portfolio to the goals of the Paris Agreement with specific targets and transparent reporting on the way to achieving our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050.” Citi did not respond to requests for comment.

A separate report last Thursday from the International Energy Agency and Imperial College London found that investments in renewable energy have seen a 367 percent greater return than fossil fuels since 2010.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svYmFua2VyLWJ1cm5vdXQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Wall Street Deals with Banker Burnout,"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in the news.

Starting jobs at investment banks are notorious for long hours and a lot of pressure. But junior bankers say the pandemic booming markets and other factors are making their grueling jobs even more intense. Some are near or past breaking point.

Burnout on Wall Street became a hot topic of conversation this week after a group of 13 anonymous first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs circulated a slide deck — meticulously branded with footnotes — that described how 100-hour weeks were taking a toll on their mental and physical health. “I’m in a really dark place” one wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5rcy10cmFkaW5nLWFtZXJpY2FuLWRyZWFtLWRlYnQtMDExNjExNTEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks Trading American Dream Debt for Mall of America Stock,"Bankers are taking a minority stake in Triple Five Group’s Mall of America and West Edmonton Mall as a make good following a default on the firm’s American Dream mall complex WWD has confirmed.

J.P. Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and a group of real estate investors are set to receive a 49 percent stake in the two mammoth malls after the New Jersey entertainment complex fell short.

The Mall of America and West Edmonton was used as collateral for a loan to build American Dream. J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment and Triple Five could not immediately be reached over the weekend.

The Financial Times earlier reported the deal which could close soon but is complex.

American Dream which has been 20 years in the making and has seen repeated changes in ownership in 2019 finally opened some of its marquee entertainments including the Big Snow Ski and Snowboard Park. But the coronavirus lockdowns delayed the long-awaited opening of the retailing component last year and when the mall did open it was launching into the pandemic.

It cost more than $6 billion to build the 3.3 million square foot complex which also includes the world’s largest indoor wave pool encompassing 1.5 acres.

The very best ‘A’ malls with established businesses appear to be holding on in the pandemic but much of the rest of the mall world is struggling.

American Dream once called Xanadu is a massive project with huge debts and needed a steady flow of business to keep its books balanced.

The banks and lenders that bet on that dream are now going to be owners in other mega retail projects. The Mall of America features over 520 stores eight acres of skylights an aquarium events and more. And the West Edmonton Mall has over 800 stores two hotels and over 100 dining venues.

Share this obituary

Dan Twining was born on May 31 1947 and passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his family on March 27 2021.

Born in Seattle Dan spent his childhood in Missoula before his family relocated to Bellingham. He graduated from Bellingham High School earned a BS from Central Washington University and later received an MBA from University of Puget Sound. He initially worked as a CPA before making his career in accounting and finance in the pulp and paper industry retiring from Kimberly Clark in 2009.

Faith played an important role in Dan’s life. Since 1980 he was an active member of St. Luke Catholic Parish in Shoreline where he was also confirmed into the Catholic Church. He became a strong supporter of Catholic education while each of his children attended St. Luke School and graduated from Seattle Preparatory School.

Dan believed “actions speak louder than words” and never shied away from a volunteer opportunity as it allowed him to meet new people and make new friends. At St. Luke he served as the maître d' for the annual Italian Dinner for many years. His warm smile was often the first thing people saw when they walked in the door. He also coached his children’s sports teams coordinated CYO baseball and served on many committees over the years.

Dan continued to live that motto in his retirement years serving as a member and eventual Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Seattle Prep. He also was a longtime advocate for the Fulcrum Foundation which supports Catholic education in the Archdiocese of Seattle and served many years on its Board of Trustees.

Dan lived an active life and loved sports of all kinds. In 1976 it was through his love of snow skiing that he connected with his wife Theresa after meeting her at Potlatch Corp in Lewiston ID where they both worked. He played adult softball and soccer well into his 50s and golfed weekly with the Men’s Club at Harbour Pointe. Dan loved traveling and enjoyed planning family vacations. He looked forward to March Madness especially cheering on Gonzaga and for 20+ years he and his buddies competed in a bracket challenge. He liked playing cribbage watching the Mariners hosting barbecues for family and friends and working in his yard. He always enjoyed a nice glass of red wine and watching the sunset over the Olympic Mountains.

Dan (aka Mister T) was the type of person who could make friends wherever he went; everybody was either a friend or a potential friend. If you weren’t friends with Dan it’s probably because you hadn’t met him yet. He will be remembered for his infectious smile his love for telling stories and the lasting impact he made wherever he went.

He is survived by Theresa his wife of 43 years; his four children James (Laura) Anne Marie Jeffrey (Stephanie) and Paul (Hailey); his five grandchildren Noah Miles Ava Grace and Lucy with a sixth on the way; his brothers David (Connie) and Richard (Linda); and a large extended family. He is preceded in death by his parents Daniel and Lucille; and his sister Linda.

Due to COVID restrictions a private funeral Mass will be held at St. Luke Catholic Church in Shoreline at 11 AM on Wednesday April 7 2021. To view a live stream of the Mass please visit the St. Luke Parish Facebook page (facebook.com/StLukeCP). The family requests any donations made in Dan’s honor be directed to the Fulcrum Foundation Seattle Preparatory School or St. Luke School.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0Y3Jlc2NlbnQvbmFtZS9jYXJtZW4tY2FzdGlsbG8tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTk4NDU0NzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carmen Castillo Obituary (1947 - 2021) - Neenah WI - Appleton Post-Crescent,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/postcrescent/name/carmen-castillo-obituary?id=19845478 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0Y3Jlc2NlbnQvbmFtZS9jYXJtZW4tY2FzdGlsbG8tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTk4NDU0NzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvc3RhbmxleS16d2FyZXNoLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQwNDEzNDIw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Zwaresh Obituary (1931 - 2021) - Thunder Bay ON - The Thunder Bay Chronicle Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/chroniclejournal/name/stanley-zwaresh-obituary?id=40413420 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvc3RhbmxleS16d2FyZXNoLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQwNDEzNDIw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

One Holmdel firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion and released. And the store sustained water damage Eric Hernando chief of the Holmdel Fire Department said.

""The sun is shining today it's nice and bright"" Hernando said. ""But as long as the sun is hitting (the solar panels) they continue to receive energy. They always pose a challenge to put out.""

Hobby Lobby is part of the Holmdel Towne Center on Route 35. Other tenants include Marshalls PetSmart and Texas Roadhouse. The center is operated by Kimco Realty Corp.

A spokeswoman from Kimco said she had no comment until she could find more information.

The fire was reported at 11:14 a.m. bringing activity in the shopping center to a standstill.

Haley Meggison a cashier at Buy Rite liquor store next door to Hobby Lobby said she and her co-workers were evacuated for about an hour before the fire was extinguished and they were allowed to return

""There were no flames or anything so I don't know exactly how big the fire was but obviously there was a ton of smoke"" Meggison said.

Hobby Lobby employees gathered in the parking lot but company officials said they couldn't comment.

Holmdel's fire police and first aid departments were joined by mutual aid squads from Hazlet Keyport Union Beach and Tinton Falls Hernando said. The Monmouth County Fire Marshal also was on the scene.

Once the crews arrived it took about 10 to 15 minutes to put the fire out Hernando said.

Solar panel fires aren't rare he said. In fact a different set of solar panels on the same roof caught fire last May leading to another evacuation. The nearby stores were back in operation within two hours.

Solar panel fires are ""tricky to put out because it's not like you can shut the sun off"" Hernando said. ""There's nothing to do to stop the energy from coming in.""

The stock of The Kraft Heinz Co (NAS:KHC 30-year Financials) is believed to be modestly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $40.03 per share and the market cap of $49 billion The Kraft Heinz Co stock gives every indication of being modestly overvalued. GF Value for The Kraft Heinz Co is shown in the chart below.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. The Kraft Heinz Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.12 which is worse than 78% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of The Kraft Heinz Co at 4 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of The Kraft Heinz Co is poor. This is the debt and cash of The Kraft Heinz Co over the past years:

It is less risky to invest in profitable companies especially those with consistent profitability over long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. The Kraft Heinz Co has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $26.2 billion and earnings of $0.29 a share. Its operating margin is 21.11% which ranks better than 92% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of The Kraft Heinz Co is 0.1% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -24% which ranks worse than 88% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months The Kraft Heinz Co's return on invested capital is 2.08 and its cost of capital is 6.29. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of The Kraft Heinz Co is shown below:

The Kraft Heinz Co Stock Is Believed To Be Modestly Overvalued

In summary the stock of The Kraft Heinz Co (NAS:KHC 30-year Financials) appears to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is poor and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 88% of the companies in the industry of Consumer Packaged Goods. To learn more about The Kraft Heinz Co stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

Warren Buffett one of the greatest value investors of all time is turning 90 this year. Operating from his hometown of Omaha Nebraska Buffett lives in a modest house drives a modest car and enjoys the simple pleasures of life like an ice-cold Coke.

After sticking to the same investing game plan for years Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.07%) (BRK.B 0.10%) portfolio has gotten a fairly considerable revamp over the last few years. For instance trusting the wisdom of his closest Berkshire money managers the company began buying shares of tech growth stock Apple in 2016. Technology a sector that Buffett used to mostly avoid now comprises about 40% of Berkshire's portfolio.

So it's clear that Buffett is willing to go in new directions if the right opportunity comes along. With this in mind perhaps Buffett should consider Starbucks (SBUX 1.05%) Honeywell (HON 0.60%) and United Parcel Service (UPS 0.07%). These companies offer a great combination of market leadership dividends and value.

Here's why Buffett would love all three companies and why they would fit nicely into Berkshire's portfolio.

1. Starbucks

Berkshire Hathaway owns over $30 billion in shares of consumer staple stocks Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. Although Starbucks technically falls in the consumer discretionary category its product line has arguably become more of a staple for consumers than many offerings from Coke and Kraft Heinz. The shift in consumer sentiment away from sugar and preservatives toward healthier options hinders the growth prospects of soda and processed-food companies. Yet Starbucks manages to have a similar level of recession resilience as these companies (with a much brighter future in the forecast).

Starbucks was hit hard by the pandemic but has since reopened nearly all of its stores. Its revenue and earnings are close to pre-pandemic levels with U.S. same-store comps down just 5% year over year as of its most recent quarter. This is impressive considering 60% of its U.S. company-operated stores are still offering limited seating.

Starbucks leaned heavily on grab-and-go ordering and its mobile app during the pandemic. And it worked. Customers are using the app and spending more money per transaction than ever before which bodes well for Starbucks' future.

Since issuing its first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in April 2010 Starbucks has raised its annual payout every single year. Its quarterly dividend is now $0.45 per share which is a yield of 1.7% at today's prices. Starbucks has plans to build new stores focused solely on grab-and-go ordering -- which should help it grow earnings and its dividend for years to come.

2. Honeywell

Just over 2% of Berkshire's portfolio is dedicated to industrial stocks. If Buffett was looking for an industrial to add then Honeywell deserves to be a top contender.

Like most industrial stocks Honeywell suffered revenue and earnings declines last year. As results improved toward the end of the year management said it is now confident that the company can return to growth.

The same factors that hurt Honeywell's 2020 results should help it in 2021. Commercial aviation could rebound as air traffic improves. Higher oil prices and industrial production will help its performance materials and technologies segment. Honeywell's customers delayed building solutions projects in 2020. But in its fourth-quarter conference call Honeywell management announced orders were piling in putting its backlog in a good position for 2021. And finally safety and productivity solutions (SPS) -- the only segment that grew in 2020 -- should continue to benefit from warehouse automation and productivity solutions. SPS ended 2020 with a $4 billion backlog -- double the backlog at the end of 2019. Simply put Honeywell is seeing business pick up in all of its segments.

Aside from an optimistic outlook Honeywell has many qualities that Buffett would love. The company's strong balance sheet history of dividend increases and growth prospects give it long-term value. Despite last year's challenges Honeywell was able to generate tons of free cash flow that more than doubled its dividend payments.

Excess free cash flow continues to give Honeywell the dry powder needed to limit how much debt it adds to its balance sheet. Today its balance sheet remains one of the best of the major industrials.

3. UPS

Ranking 48 out of 48 on Buffett's list of holdings is UPS. So yes Buffett owns the stock. But at 0.003% of Berkshire's portfolio the company's UPS shares could double and it would hardly make an impact.

UPS rival FedEx reported encouraging earnings and guidance on March 18 that showed a strong recovery in business-to-business (B2B) sales and e-commerce growth. This is good news for UPS which would like its B2B volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.

UPS has the makings of a perfect Buffett stock. With 70% higher net income and double the market cap of FedEx UPS is the market leader in its industry. Its adjusted 2020 EPS of $8.23 per share gives it a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of around 19. UPS has a dividend yield of 2.6%. The company just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.02 per share more than double what it was 10 years ago.

UPS has plenty of growth prospects as well. It's leading the distribution process for COVID-19 vaccines a trend Buffett can appreciate seeing as he's been buying healthcare stocks. UPS was also one of the few industrial stocks that crushed earnings throughout 2020 not to mention notching its best quarter ever at the end of the year.

E-commerce is a booming trend that benefits UPS. The company has been expanding its fleet and laying the groundwork for what it expects to be years of e-commerce growth. The pandemic accelerated that trend which was a big part of UPS' strong 2020 performance. However there's reason to believe it will retain much of the business it gained while adding more in the years to come.",,,,,,

It’s the first NASCAR dirt race since 1970.

On Friday drivers took to the track for two rounds of practice. Many were shocked to see the tires burning off in 20 laps.

That’s an interesting situation given Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race will be 250 laps. The final stage of the race will be 100 laps.

This race is different from traditional NASCAR races as there are no pit crews. Teams are allowed to change tires between each stage and that was suppose to be all.

Ryan Blaney on the Bristol tires

Blaney was quickest overall in the final practice session on Friday.

“The track’s rough really rough actually. The track’s kinda coming up. There wasn’t much lane changing. Larson and Reddick could run the top for a little while then it kinda went away after a handful of minutes” Ryan Blaney stated after practice.

“Trying to keep tires on it. You know we’re seeing a lot of tires getting corded pretty quickly. Especially right rears but even the right front is starting to go. That’s something that’s going to come into play saving your tires.”

Blaney concluded “We got windshields in these things. You can’t make it super tacky to where there’s mud flying everywhere.”

Denny Hamlin isn’t looking for more tires

Tires are suppose to wear. It creates passing when drivers take care of the tires better than others. Hamlin sees this as an opportunity…

“Selfishly I just like saving my stuff. So I would say leave it as is. But I doubt that will happen” Hamlin stated after his practice runs.

“It comes in pretty quick. After 2-3 laps you notice that you don’t have the grip on corner exit that you did on the first lap. It progressively gets a little worse.”

“For us it really kinda plateaued. Where we really didn’t fall off a cliff. It just got to a certain lap time and kinda stayed there.”

“You’re going to have to be technical with making sure you hit your marks. But I didn’t see where someone just lost control because they were on a bald tire. It’s the same for everyone you just gotta do the best you can.”

Hamlin concluded “I’m really not educated enough to know what to do [on the track]. In talking to Christopher Bell their hands are tied. If weather comes in you can’t dig up the race track because all the moisture would just seep in. You’d have ruts and just a mess. So they have to keep it sealed and let the rain fall off of it. At that point you can till it and water it.”

Bowman was fastest in the opening round of practice.

“I had a blast. I thought it was a lot of fun” Bowman stated.

He added The tire wear is a little concerning. But other than that everything went great. These cars are a lot of fun. They’re really drivable on dirt. It got a little rough but it’s just character in the race track. I enjoyed the hell out of it.”

Chase Briscoe says track prep could help some

“It’s certainly a concern. It’s hard for any of us to expect what would happen as far as the tire wear stuff. At Eldora it doesn’t appear there was ever this bad of an issue” Briscoe commented

“Red clay is just always more abrasive for whatever reason. I think we probably need to do something. Our car after 20 laps we’re already showing cords.”

“They’re in a tough box because there’s no pit crews here. So if you did have something happen under green it’s just a tough situation.”

“Personally I would like to see something halfway through that final stage. I don’t think that would change the complexion of the race. But it would be better for the teams.”

“You’ve seen it in sprint car racing where guys are running on a rubbered down race track. Lap after lap guys are blowing tires cautions keep coming out. We don’t want to see that here.”

“At Eldora we ran over 100 laps on a set of tires. I didn’t think tires would even be a thought. The track [at Bristol} didn’t rubber up it was black slick the whole time. Red clay it’s really gritty it tears tires up for whatever reason.”

“If the track had a little more moisture in it who knows if the tires would do that. It’s a tough box for everyone involved because nobody knows what to expect.”

“You can’t have a ton of moisture in it because of the windshields. They can’t till it up because they know the rain’s coming. I’m confident it’s still going to be a really good race on Sunday regardless.”

“If they would just go out there and till the top of the race track and water it. We would be running up there instead of on the bottom. It all comes down to track prep. That’s the key ingredient when it comes to dirt racing. You can really control what lane is faster.”

Briscoe concluded “Hopefully they can do something track prep wise. Obviously the more moisture it has the better the tires will last as well. They’re in a tough box with the rain coming you have to keep it sealed.”

Bristol Dirt Racing Tires – NASCAR

Crew chief Rudy Fugal says more tires are a must

William Byron has little experience on dirt surfaces. A couple weeks ago Fugal and Byron went to a local track in an open practice night to turn some laps.

“The loads black slick and wearing the tires out is totally different [than Eldora]. You can go a whole race at Eldora without seeing much tire wear. This is all kinda new” Rudy Fugal stated.

“If we don’t get anymore tires it’s going to be really hard. You’re going to have to choose to ride. Maybe just try to stay on the lead lap and not have a flat.”

“I expect that they’re going to hopefully add another caution and another set of tires. That will at least let you survive a little bit. But you’ll still be saving some tire.”

Fugal concluded “We need the [extra] tires. Obviously without pit crews we need the [extra] caution to break it up and make it even. But I think 100 laps is stretching it right now unfortunately. It could get better. But it could be the same or worse too.”

Commander Antony Crabb NavyX team leader said: “With Madfox now directly in the hands of NavyX the team will be able to explore a multitude of issues such as safety regulatory compliance new missions new payloads and the role that a USV can play in complex operations and within the future fleet.

“Later this year NavyX will also accept an autonomous Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) into the inventory. This exciting work will help inform how systems are deployed and employed from future vessels of the Type 26 and Type 31 classes.”

The investment in Madfox comes as the Royal Navy and Royal Marines look to expand their use of crewless and autonomous equipment.

Mast-13 proved the value of USVs during experimentation in Norway last year when it was successfully integrated with HMS Albion for Autonomous Advance Force 3.0. There it was controlled remotely including for the transit in and out of the ship’s dock.

About Madfox USV (Mast-13):

The MAST-13 which was designed and built by L3Harris for Dstl (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) is a 13-meter (41-foot) long high-speed unmanned testbed vessel intended for the Royal Navy to explore new methods of maintaining a technical advantage over potential adversaries. It was integrated into HMS Albion using the ASView control system which allowed the unmanned vessel to be remotely controlled from a station on board the warship.

The successful integration meant that MAST-13 could operate at range from its operator and safely navigate with full situational awareness via the on-board sensor package. The MAST-13 ASV utilises Domo Tactical Communications’ technology for secure data communications.

At the beginning of the trial MAST-13 was remotely piloted into HMS Albion’s dock thus demonstrating the ease of operating an ASV alongside a warship. The team then carried out 22 manned cycles of entering and retracting before switching over to the remote station to complete the same task multiple times without an onboard crew. Using the Maritime Autonomous Platform Exploitation (MAPLE) integrated command and control system MAST-13 also completed several other tasks in unmanned mode while sending feeds back to the remote station.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvcm95YWwtbmF2eS1yZWNlaXZlcy1mdXR1cmlzdGljLW1hZGZveC11bm1hbm5lZC1zdXJmYWNlLXZlc3NlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Navy receives futuristic Madfox unmanned surface vessel,"The Royal Navy’s experimentation innovator NavyX has officially welcomed a new autonomous vessel into its service.

Deputy Speaker in the State Legislative Assembly Kona Raghupati has already discussed the matter with Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has gave his nod to the proposal.

Kona Raghupati and Chief Whip in the State Legislative Council Ummareddy Venkateswarulu are in favour of it.

According to sources in order to shift Acharya N G Agriculture University from Guntur city to Bapatla the State government has to take prior permission from the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) in the Union Ministry of Agriculture. For constructing the building on the university campus at Lam the Central government has sanctioned Rs300 crore. While Rs120 crore was released the officials spent Rs88 crore. The State government is ready to repay this amount to the Centre.

Speaking to 'The Hans India' Deputy Speaker Kona Raghupati said ""Bapatla town is the right place for setting up Acharya N G Ranga Agriculture University. Students are here in the Agriculture College in Bapatla town. Sufficient place is available for doing research in agriculture. CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has agreed to shift the university to Bapatla.""

However former member of Acharya N G Ranga Agriculture University Mekala Lakshminarayana is not in favour of the proposal. ""In order to shift the Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University from Lam to Bapatla town the State government should obtain prior permission from the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) in New Delhi. Lam in Guntur city is convenient place for Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University because it is nearest to the Secretariat at Velagapudi and Lam is located the district headquarters in Guntur"" he said.

Gannavaram Airport Guntur and Vijayawada railway stations are nearest places. There is a lot of land available at Lam for conducting agriculture research. In addition to this sufficient infrastructure is developed on the university campus at Lam. Huge buildings were constructed for the university at Lam. Sufficient water is available for agriculture research from Krishna river. There is no need to shift Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University from Lam.""",,,,,,

The other barely blipped on the media radar.

For those following the international narcotics trade which historically has had many links to Las Vegas both hold the promise of intrigue and insight into the flow of cartel drugs and money through the valley.

The first is the made-for-tabloid television tale of the ‘cartel princess’ Emma Coronel Aispuro the former beauty queen and wife of imprisoned Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman whose glamorous life was interrupted with her February arrest on charges of conspiring to distribute large quantities of cocaine heroin marijuana and methamphetamine.

The mother of twin daughters made a nightly star turn in New York during Guzman’s 2017 drug trafficking and racketeering trial during which it was revealed that she had played an integral role in the Sinaloa boss’s 2015 escape from a Mexican prison. Instead of keeping a lower profile she courted the spotlight with an appearance on a cartel-themed reality television show Cartel Crew and in 2019 launched a Chapo-themed clothing brand.

The Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement authorities have long tracked Sinaloa traffickers and operatives to Las Vegas which is recognized as an active distribution hub for the cartel.

Mike Vigil the former chief of International Operations for the DEA tracked Sinaloa’s ever-expanding influence in the drug world for many years. Although he’s now retired Vigil brings a rare insight into the Coronel arrest. All the glitz aside her cooperation could devastate the cartel. She’s not just another pretty face.

“Emma Coronel is not somebody that penetrated a criminal organization” he says. “She was born into the drug trade. She grew up in the mountains of Durango and her father Ines and her brother Omar were drug traffickers. She was knowledgeable of the drug trade and then she met Chapo Guzman and married him in 2007. She became the primary confidant of Chapo Guzman. Because like in any criminal organizations the biggest thing that they value is trust. Who do they trust more than family members? No one.”

Trust goes a long way. But under the threat of 40 years in prison and with the future of young twin daughters in the balance she can be expected to cooperate Vigil believes. What could she provide?

“Chapo Guzman would confide in Emma Coronel” he says. “She has a very keen understanding of the entire infrastructure of the Sinaloa Cartel who the members are how they operate the drug routes and then more importantly she knows what officials the Sinaloa Cartel is paying. She would do things for Chapo Guzman that placed her squarely into a conspiracy case here in the United States.”

In the U.S. some of those routes run right through Las Vegas.

---

Surely Coronel would also understand the complex connections between the Sinaloa cartel’s money laundering connections to Las Vegas and whether they still exist in the wake of the notorious case of Zhenli Ye Gon whose high-rolling gambling on the Strip at the Venetian and other resorts unsuccessfully masked his role as a major Sinaloa methamphetamine precursor chemical trafficker and money mover.

You don’t have to search far on the Internet to find the now-famous (at least in investigative reporting circles) photograph of the secret room inside Ye Gon’s home outside Mexico City that contained $205 million in cash some of it still in Venetian casino wrappers. The Chinese national born in Shanghai was a Mexican citizen at the time of his 2007 arrest. He was extradited to the US in 2016.

The Las Vegas Sands in 2013 agreed to pay a $47.4 million fine to avoid criminal charges stemming from a money laundering investigation.

Much less reported but no less intriguing is the February federal grand jury indictment in the Eastern District of Texas charging eight persons with crimes related to what the Department of Justice is calling a complex international drug trafficking conspiracy. Among those charged are Debbie Mercer and her daughter Kayleigh Moffett of Oklahoma City Federico Machado of Florida and Carlos Villaurrutia of Texas.

The case is the result of an interagency effort led by the DOJ’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and Homeland Security Investigations. According to the indictment the defendants allegedly purchased and registered thousands of aircraft under foreign corporations and individuals for export. As owners of Aircraft Guarantee (also spelled Guaranty) Corporation it’s alleged that Mercer (listed in business filings as Mercer-Erwin) and Moffett registered the aircraft at a mailbox in Onalaska Texas a town of 2800 that surely has much to offer its residents.

What Onalaska doesn’t have investigators noticed was an airport.

Authorities allege the planes were used by drug traffickers from Mexico to Colombia seven countries in all to haul multi-ton shipments of cocaine north to the insatiable US market and back south with piles of cash to Mexico. Planes were typically purchased according to the indictment by wiring funds from casa de cambios (money exchange houses) and traditional banks in Mexico to US shell corporations.

Thanks to Nevada’s uber-friendly incorporation and LLC laws there’s a Las Vegas connection to the case. As early as 1996 Mercer’s name has been associated with Nevada LLCs Aircraft Guaranty Financial Corp. Aircraft Guaranty Holdings and Cirrus Air Ag according to the secretary of state’s website and Corporationwiki.com.

The federal criminal investigation picked up steam in 2019 following a report from Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA that raised questions about the propriety of Mercer’s aircraft registration operation. Along the way investigators uncovered evidence of a $560 million Ponzi scheme that moved investor funds from the U.S. to Mexico. And none of it made much news outside the region.

With law enforcement and the DOJ hoping to make substantive investigative inroads from the information gleaned from defendants who now find themselves compelled to cooperate or risk spending the rest of their lives in prison the secrets of Sinaloa figure to reverberate far from sunny Mexico.

Here are three more we think it should consider.

Cathie Wood is the hottest name in investing right now.

Investors have been clamoring for stocks that are owned in exchange-traded funds run by Wood's ARK Investment Management LLC thanks to the success of the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK -2.50%) which is up more than 200% over the past year.

Wood and her team are doing an impressive job on their own. But there is always a place for new ideas. Here is why three Fools believe Leidos Holdings (LDOS 1.52%) QuantumScape (QS -2.78%) and ABB (ABBN.Y 1.84%) should be on Wood's radar screen.

Why limit autonomous to driving?

Lou Whiteman (Leidos Holdings): We know ARK sees the potential in autonomous technologies based on its bullish stance on Tesla and stakes in Palantir Technologies and Kratos Defense & Security show the firm is not opposed to dabbling in defense stocks. With that in mind I suggest Leidos Holdings as a good fit for the portfolio.

Leidos is a defense tech company. It is the largest provider of outsourced IT services for the Pentagon and civil agencies including a substantial classified business working with spy agencies. But in recent years Leidos has grown to be much more than that and is now one of the first companies that comes to mind when thinking about futuristic defense tech.

In 2019 the U.S. Navy passed a key autonomous milestone when it sailed a Leidos-designed ship from San Diego to Hawaii and back with little human intervention. While drones get most of the attention for now autonomous operations are key to the Navy's planned growth because they offer the potential for the government to expand its fleet without taking on massive new personnel costs.

Leidos added to its high-tech hardware business last year when it spent $1.7 billion to acquire Dynetics a research shop focused on intelligence missiles aviation and space. Dynetics has a lot of futuristic contracts including serving as the lead contractor on the ""Gremlins"" project aiming to launch a swarm of autonomous drones from a plane. It is working with Kratos on that effort.

By ARK standards Leidos is a value play trading at 1.1 times sales and 15 times forward earnings. The stock has been flat since the beginning of 2020 in part due to market nervousness that with pandemic-related government spending heating up the Pentagon budget is going to have to take a hit.

But over the past five years Leidos has outperformed the S&P 500 and the company's suite of products is well suited to match areas of Pentagon demand in the years to come. Leidos is an underappreciated long-term tech play.

Big risks big potential and electric cars: This one is right up ARK's alley

John Rosevear (QuantumScape): We should be clear up front that this stock is kind of an all-or-nothing bet. But if it pays off it could pay off big -- making it just the kind of stock that Wood and her team seem to love.

QuantumScape went public late last year but it isn't a new company. It has been working for over 10 years on a ""holy grail"" technology that the battery industry has been hoping to commercialize for decades namely solid-state batteries for electric cars. And it may have solved a key puzzle that will finally open the door to the technology.

This is a big deal. Solid-state batteries have the potential to be more energy-dense lighter in weight less expensive quicker to recharge and safer than current lithium-ion batteries in vehicle applications. To put it even more simply a solid-state battery that is reliable and that can be affordably mass-produced will be a big advance for electric vehicles.

That has all been known for years but of course it's not that simple. The industry has struggled to develop a solid-state battery that works outside of a laboratory setting and that has the durability necessary for automotive applications. The details are somewhat complicated but what investors need to understand is that solid-state batteries require a ""separator"" that behaves in certain ways and nobody has been able to come up with one that works.

That's the puzzle that QuantumScape may have solved. The company said in December that it has developed a new flexible ceramic material that appears to make a good separator for a solid-state battery. That's genuinely exciting and it could make QuantumScape a big winner in the EV battery space -- but Cathie Wood and her team will need to keep in mind that the timeframes are quite long.

Let's put it this way. Volkswagen (VWAGY -0.72%) which has invested about $300 million in QuantumScape doesn't expect to be shipping cars with solid-state batteries for at least five years and possibly longer. QuantumScape itself is hoping to begin manufacturing in 2024.

The long timelines mean that there's a lot of risk here. QuantumScape has promising technology but there are other solid-state battery efforts under way and there's no guarantee that QuantumScape will be first to market even if its tech pans out.

But for an aggressive investor who is convinced (as I am and as Cathie Wood certainly seems to be) that electric vehicles are the future it's an intriguing bet.

ARK Invests in the future and robots are the future

Rich Smith (ABB): According to its mission statement ARK Invest ""aims to provide broad exposure to disruptive innovation"" such as ""artificial intelligence robotics energy storage DNA sequencing"" and others. And yet if you go down the list of stocks that ARK Invest currently owns one name is notably absent: ABB.

One of the biggest robotics stocks in the world Swedish-Swiss conglomerate ABB (which also has substantial operations in the fields of electric car charging and solar power solutions hint-hint) is a titan of industry. By market capitalization it weighs in at $62.3 billion. By sales it boasts a $26.1 billion revenue stream.

ABB also earns a lot of profit on those sales. Over the past five years total profits as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) amounted to $12.8 billion. Real free cash flow backed up about 84% of those reported profits -- not ideal but not too shabby at $10.8 billion. That's especially true when you consider how much the coronavirus pandemic disrupted operations last year cutting free cash flow to a mere $1 billion.

And yet as the world emerges from a recession ABB is ramping its business back up. To illustrate almost all of ABB's free cash flow last year came in just the fourth quarter alone -- $920 million of it -- and this implies that the company has significant momentum as the world emerges from its economic crisis in 2021. Over the next five years analysts who track ABB actually see profits growing 19.5% every year for the next five years a fantastic growth rate for a company of ABB's size.

At a recent valuation of just 12.2 times trailing earnings I think ABB is the kind of robotics stock Cathie Wood should buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This market’s strength is impressive considering that of the top 5 stocks by market cap none are at all-time highs. Only two of them Google and Microsoft hit that mark over the last two months. Apple the biggest stock in the world is 16% below its peak in January.

If you break the S&P 500 into deciles by market cap you can see complete randomness into how far the median stock is from its 52-week high. This is a 180 from early in the pandemic where the only thing you needed to know about the condition of stock was its relative size. Small worst big best. It’s not that simple anymore.

The strongest stocks in today’s market are the ones most levered to the economic recovery. The median industrial stock for example is just 2.5% below its 52-week high. 36% of the members in this group closed at a 52-week high on Friday.

If you did nothing but look at a chart of every stock in the S&P 500 you would conclude that the economy was booming. Pull up a chart of Lennar or CSX or CAT or AA. Yes that Alcoa.

None of the aforementioned companies are considered glamour stocks. You wouldn’t find them trading with valuations sported by some of the high-flying tech companies.

If you sorted the market on a price-to-sales ratio you wouldn’t find any pattern. At least not until you got to the most expensive bucket. Those are where you’ll find the weakest names. But other than that the distance from a 52-week high seems to be completely random as far as valuation goes.

Another way of looking at a similar concept is to sort the buckets by their dividend yield. Again no pattern develops until you get to the stocks with low or no dividends. This is where you’ll find Twitter Tesla and Take-Two Interactive.

The stock market is in a very healthy place right now. 93% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average right now. The last time you saw a reading this high was 2013.

I continue to be impressed at the way sector rotation has kept this market afloat. If you told me 6 months ago that the momentum names would pause while industrial and materials lead us to a new phase of the bull market I wouldn’t have believed you.

The only reason to be concerned right now is that things might look too good. Not exactly a persuasive argument but I can understand this mentality.

Her particular small town was Checotah Oklahoma which had one school one stop light and umpteen churches. Carrie showed her flair for public performances at a precociously young age. ""My mom has a picture of me on stage in our church when I was three years old"" she says down the line from Tennessee. ""I was never shy about singing in front of people."" The First Freewill Baptist Church had a small stage but a big heart. ""It was such a warm environment"" she smiles. ""It was like family. Everybody knew everybody."" Carrie's faith always the cornerstone of her life inspired her to make her latest album My Savior - a moving and unashamedly Christian collection of gospel hymns. Her falsetto is at its sweetest on songs like How Great Thou Art; her piano reading of Softly And Tenderly is sublime.

""It's the album I always wanted to make"" the seven-time Grammy award winner tells me. ""Hymns and gospel music shaped me as an artist. They were the first things I sang. I've been singing them my whole life."" My Savior is the follow-up to 2020's Carrie winning Idol in 2005 Christmas album My Gift which included her poignant duet with John Legend on new song Hallelujah along with traditional Yuletide favourites. ""I had such an amazing inspired time making My Gift I wanted to stay in that mindset"" Carrie 38 explains. ""With My Savior I wanted it to feel like I was in the church I grew up in to freshen the hymns up but keep the traditional feel and the heart."" Carrie performs the hymns live on Easter Sunday on a live stream from the Ryman Auditorium - the historic home of country's The Grand Old Opry in Nashville. ""It was all about wanting to bring these songs to life again and obviously now I wanted to do something on stage. The Ryman is so inspirational it feels like a church."" Not many people have had anything good to say about the lockdown but the upbeat Underwood sees the positive in everything.

""Being home has been such a blessing"" she says. ""Watching my boys grow spending time cooking spending time in the garden I do feel people who try their hardest to look at the silver linings in life have probably learned so much from this time. ""I have a three-year-old and a six-year-old. Normally we're travelling so much and mommy's so busy. ""To have every single day and every single dinner together that really is special. As crazy as things were just having time to think about what matters most in life is a blessing and we should enjoy that."" Carrie married retired ice hockey star Mike Fisher in 2010. Their sons are Isaiah who sang Little Drummer Boy on My Gift and Jacob - who arrived after she had suffered three agonising miscarriages in two years. The family home is a 1000-acre ranch in Franklin 21 miles south of Nashville. It's full of laughter she says. ""My husband always does a lot of dad jokes and that makes me laugh. My humour is a little cheesy and a little dry."" The youngest daughter of papermill worker Steve and primary school teacher Carole Carrie had unusual teenage idols for a country star. ""I was lucky enough to grow up with 90s grunge"" she confides. ""In my teens I was into Nirvana and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden. I loved everything he did. But I always loved country music that is my home and my heart.""

Horror movies and Stephen King novels are another unexpected influence - King's Christine inspired her song Two Black Cadillacs. After majoring in mass communications at university Carrie planned to work in broadcast journalism. American Idol changed all that. Underwood won the TV talent show in 2005 after deciding ""Why not?"" was a smarter question than a lifetime of asking ""What if ?"" She is a bona fide superstar in the USA now with seven top five albums - six of them platinum four multi-platinum - along with huge hit singles such as Inside Your Heaven and Before He Cheats. She's even had three Top 20 albums here. Carrie's 2019 Cry Pretty tour saw her headline UK arenas and storm Glastonbury. After her set she decided to stay and watch Janet Jackson ""because when was I ever going to be on a bill that varied again?"" she says. ""I started to watch her and Janet looked over and threw a kiss towards us. I thought 'Who does she know over here?' I looked around and it was only us standing there. It felt amazing to be recognised in that moment!"" Her big brown eyes open wide at the memory. Carrie didn't stop work completely during lockdown of course. As well as recording two albums she had a fitness book and products to promote including a US sports drink and a successful fitness and lifestyle clothing/accessories brand CALIA.

She managed to perform live twice too once at the Country Music Awards and then starring in her own HBO Christmas TV special. ""It was just beautiful.

Last year she was invited to perform Still Woman Enough with country legends Loretta Lynn and Reba McEntire for Lynn's latest album. ""My response was 'Anything for Loretta'. It was great to be in the studio with her - Reba was on the phone from another studio. Loretta is such a queen!

Mariah has been working in the music industry for more than 30 years. With incredible platinum-selling hits including All I Want For Christmas Is You and Hero she has become a legendary artist. The self-confessed “diva” - who turned 52-years-old yesterday - has previously opened up on how her voice is so unique revealing that an affliction on her vocal cords are the reason.

Speaking in an interview in 2017 Mariah first spoke about how she takes care of her five-octave range voice. She said: “It is all about timing vocal rest sleep. It’s a different kind of thing.” The star then explained: “My cords actually have nodules on them and I have for my whole life.” According to online healthcare site Cleveland Clinic vocal cord nodules are “sometimes called singer’s nodules or nodes and result from repetitive overuse or misuse of the voice. These callous-like growths develop in the midpoint of the vocal folds. ""That’s why my speaking voice is actually more low. But the top [range] stuff is a whole different thing.

Over the years however the singer’s voice has become strained from powerful use. Last year Mariah confessed the pandemic has healed her vocal cords somewhat.

In 1964 the segregation of Black and white people was still rife in the USA despite the fact Black performers were becoming more popular and accepted at the time. The Beatles fought alongside the civil rights movement when they arrived at their gig at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville Florida USA.

Once the band learned they would be playing to a segregated crowd they refused to get on stage. Paul McCartney spoke about the event years later saying: “When we found out that it was going to be a segregated audience – blacks one side whites the other. It just seemed so mad. “We couldn’t understand that. So we just said: ‘We’re not playing that!’” The band’s refusal to play put enough pressure on the venue’s officials to make them change their minds about the divide.

When they arrived John Lennon reportedly quipped: “We never play to segregated audiences and we aren’t going to start now. I’d sooner lose our appearance money.” Further details of the event were provided by director Ron Howard who explored the band’s days touring in 2016 documentary The Beatles: Eight Days a Week. He said: “It was a ludicrous idea to them but it was clear to them and that’s the position they took and lo and behold they de-segregated that concert.”

Ron added: “Often the world was influencing what the Beatles were going through and the Beatles were influencing the way the world looked at things.” Shortly after the band played the gig in Jacksonville they worked together with their manager Brian Epstein on writing up a new contract. It specified that The Beatles would “not be required to perform in front of a segregated audience”. Speaking about the band’s decision the statement it made and later being inspired to write the song Blackbird McCartney said: “The concert we did do was the first non-segregated audience.” DON'T MISS...

But it turns out it was quite a statement.” Last year McCartney spoke out against racism in America once again when George Floyd was killed a murder which sparked many protests and a surge in the Black Lives Matter movement.

There are secrets to keep ridiculous deadlines and a high bar for the requisite quality of engineering fabrication and overall problem-solving. Running parallel with the stress however is how satisfying these projects are. You are basically working in the future and it’s a future that very few in the present are privy to. The monotony of production is nonexistent as new challenges are presented at every turn. And the payoff . . . it’s difficult to quantify how rad it is to see the things you pour your blood and tears into finally break cover and do what you built them to do.

The secrecy stokes the flames of mystery and mystery is cool. Now let’s add in experimental aircraft development for the U.S. Department of Defense funded by black book programs and that level of cool goes off the charts.

At its core Overcrest podcast is a car and car culture-centric show but recently its team put together an epic seven-part series (starting at episode 270) on the history of Lockheed’s Skunk Works division (the official pseudonym for Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs). Co-hosts Kris Clewell and Jake Solberg set the scene for historical context; lay out a bit of the bio of the program’s iconic lynchpin Kelly Johnson; and also get into the details of a few of the “baddest” most technically advanced aircraft ever to exist. At least so far. That we know of.

But the highlights of these episodes by far are the interviews Kris hosts with the pilots both test and active duty who flew these crazy machines. The F-35 Lightning the U-2 Dragon Lady the SR-71 Blackbird and the F-117 Nighthawk are radical to ponder but even more so when you’re talking to their rare pilots who come complete with first-hand accounts of crazier-than-fiction real-life experiences. And with so much pertinent information still classified these episodes provide a peek through the looking glass at some of America’s most bonkers engineering and manufacturing feats. These episodes are more than worthy of a listen.

You can find the Overcrest podcast wherever you listen to podcasts and if you’re feeling it make sure to check out Episode 183 from March 13 2020 where yours truly is the guest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3Mvbm9yd2VnaWFuLWxpZ2h0bmluZ3MtYXR0ZW5kaW5nLWZpcnN0LWJpZy1leGVyY2lzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Lightnings attending first big exercise,"Norwegian Lightnings attending first big exercise

For the first time in history Luftforsvaret (RNoAF Royal Norwegian Air Force) Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighter aircraft were used during exercise Red-Flag 21-2. Four Norwegian owned F-35As Norwegian pilots and associated Norwegian technicians participated in the Red-Flag 21-2 exercise which was held from 8 March until 19 March 2021 at Nellis AFB (NV).

The Lightnings pilots and technicians are part of the 62nd Fighter Squadron Spikes which trains Norwegian Italian and American F-35 pilots on a daily basis. The squadron is part of the 56th Fighter Wing and is based at Luke AFB (AZ).

About 2500 people from different countries participated in the latest Red Flag exercise.

Besid es Norway the United States Singapore Sweden and six other NATO countries were represented. Although some Norwegian 62nd FS members already participated the Red Flag exercise 19-2 the latest Red Flag was the first one that they attended with their own aircraft.

At this moment ten RNoAF F-35As are attached to the 62nd FS. In March 2021 three Lightning IIs from 332 skv were flown to Luke AFB where they joined the 62nd FS to increase the training capacity of Norwegian fighter pilots until the autumn of 2023:

They also have many F-15s which serve as compact long-range bombers.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Rather than serving as a fighter Israel decided to take advantage of the F-15 family’s twin engines and high payload capacity to serve as a sort of compact but long-range strategic bomber that could be successful in a ground-attack role. The result was the F-15I Ra’am or Thunder.

Israel operates what may be the world’s largest fleet F-16s. They also have many F-15s which serve as compact long-range bombers.

F-15I

The F-15I is essentially an F-15E but made according to Israeli specifications used to replace Israel’s venerable but aging fleet of F-4 Phantoms.

Rather than serving as a fighter Israel decided to take advantage of the F-15 family’s twin engines and high payload capacity to serve as a sort of compact but long-range strategic bomber that could be successful in a ground-attack role. The result was the F-15I Ra’am or Thunder.

During the 1991 Gulf War Iraq had been able to successfully launch Scud missiles at Israel. Though Israel would have preferred retaliating with aircraft they lacked the capabilities to pull off a long-range bombing run on Iraq.

Israel already had considerable experience with the F-15 platform having flown them for nearly twenty years. Part of the appeal of the huge airframe is due to it’s large conformal fuel tanks which allow for a whopping 18000 pounds of fuel. When combined with drop tanks the Israeli F-15Is have a considerable range and loiter time.

Despite moving to acquire the Lockheed Martin F-35 Adir platform (also tailor-made to Israeli specifications) Israel additionally decided to upgrade their F-15 fleet in 2016. For instance domestic avionics were installed to simplify the F-15I’s compatibility with the system used in other Israeli aircraft.

Initially F-15Is had an Israeli Radar Warning Receiver installed although this was eventually swapped out for a more sensitive American system. The F-15I is still on active service with Israel.

These planes also take advantage of a domestic helmet mounted display system that eventually contributed to the display system in use with the F-35 program to which Israel is a customer.

F-16I Sufa

Israel operates more F-16s than anyone else in the world—except for the United States Air Force.

In the mid-2000s Israel ordered fifty F-16Is from Lockheed Martin bringing their total F-16 fleet up to more than 300 “including 102 new ones ordered since 1999 and 50 earlier model F-16s that were acquired from the U.S. inventory in the mid-1990s” according to a Lockheed Martin press release.

Some of the F-16Is are two-seaters in a tandem configuration. The extra seat is a necessary precondition for Israel’s domestically produced Popeye family of missiles. The Popeye’s terminal guidance system requires a so-called “man-in-the-loop” to bring it to target hence the extra seat.

The newer F-16Is are equipped with the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229 engine which is used for both the F-15 and F-16 family of airframes. It commands respect with its 23770-pound dry thrust which jumps to 29160 pounds with afterburner.

F-16Is were in the news in January of 2020 when a handful of them were damaged during flooding caused by a rainstorm despite being covered and in their hangars. A total of eight F-16Is were damaged—five of them suffered minor damage—and three sustained “significant” harm.

Despite the setback F-16Is will undoubtedly serve Israel for the foreseeable future.

Jeff Lowe who appeared in a successful Netflix documentary ""Tiger King"" had a stroke at a casino last week.

Lowe and his wife were staying at WinStar World Casino when he suffered the health scare.

Lauren Lowe told TMZ that she found Jeff unresponsive and not breathing around 3 a.m. on March 18. Emergency medical technicians who arrived at the scene determined that Lowe was undergoing a stroke and decided to airlift him to a hospital in Denton Texas.

""I thought he was dying in my arms"" Lauren told the outlet.

More from a press release issued by Dorna:

Lowes lights up Losail for first pole position of 2021

The Brit heads rookie Fernandez and Bendsneyder after a classic shootout to begin the Moto2™ season

Sam Lowes (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) was once again in superior form at the Barwa Grand Prix of Qatar as the British rider set a 1:58.726 to take the first honours of the season. The Brit beat rookie sensation Raul Fernandez (Red Bull KTM Ajo) to pole position by 0.140s with Bo Bendsneyder’s (Pertamina Mandalika SAG Team) awesome early season form seeing the Dutchman claim just his third Grand Prix front row start in P3 0.233s from Lowes’.

Ahead of the opening Moto2™ pole position battle four riders entered the fray from Q1. Fabio Di Giannantonio (Federal Oil Gresini Moto2) was the quickest as rookie Celestino Vietti (Sky Racing Team VR46) Somkiat Chantra (Idemitsu Honda Team Asia) and 2019 Moto3™ World Champion Lorenzo Dalla Porta (Italtrans Racing Team) finished within a tenth of each other to get another crack at the whip in Q2.

As Q2 kicked into life the fastest rider after the opening flying laps was Lowes. Jake Dixon (Petronas Sprinta Racing) made it a British 1-2 but working in tandem Red Bull KTM Ajo’s Raul Fernandez and Remy Gardner then took over at the top – the latter leading his rookie teammate with a 1:59.245. Incidentally Lowes’ first lap time was then scrapped but soon after his second lap then saw him fly to P1 0.447s faster than Gardner’s best.

Once again Dixon made it a British 1-2 but Lowes’ lead was still considerable. Bendsneyder then catapulted himself to P2 before Lowes once again pulled clear of the chasing pack. Marco Bezzecchi (Sky Racing Team VR46) then took over in second but the Italian was still over three tenths behind. The Red Bull KTM Ajo duo then launched themselves onto the front row Raul Fernandez P2 and Gardner P3 but the Aussie’s lap would get cancelled.

The ever-impressive Bendsneyder then hit back to demote Bezzecchi off the front row on his final lap as Gardner then threatened Lowes’ time on his last lap. However a crash for Xavi Vierge (Petronas Sprinta Racing) at Turn 10 – minutes after the Spaniard and teammate Dixon collided at Turn 3 – put a halt to Gardner’s late charge. Dixon was judged to have been riding slow on the line causing a collision and has a three-place grid penalty.

At the top though Lowes was untouchable. The 2020 title challenger has been in supreme form at Losail and will launch from pole and he’ll line up alongside a rookie sensation in Raul Fernandez. The Spaniard has taken to Moto2™ like a duck to water and Bendsneyder impressed too picking up his first front row start since the 2017 Moto3™ Dutch GP.

A star-studded second row will be lining up for the opening round of the season as Bezzecchi Joe Roberts (American Racing) and Gardner claim P4 P5 and P6 in Q2 respectively. Dixon couldn’t improve on his couple of early banker laps and slipped down to P7 but will start further back in tenth. Q1 graduate Di Giannantonio was P8 but will start seventh ahead of Jorge Navarro (MB Conveyors Speed Up) with rookie Vietti boosted up to ninth after an impressive day.

Marcos Ramirez (American Racing) and Simone Corsi (MV Agusta Forward Racing) both went to the medical centre for check-ups after both suffering big crashes in Q1. Unfortunately both riders have been declared unfit. Corsi sustained a left wrist fracture and Ramirez suffered a right humeral fracture the duo will miss the Qatar GP.

Can anyone beat Lowes at Losail? It’s looking like a tricky task but Sunday is surely going to throw up some drama under the lights. Make sure you check the clock changes before tuning in for the Moto2™ race at 18:20 local time (GMT+3)!

Sam Lowes: “I felt good in qualifying it was the first time we went out with low fuel I did a quite a lot of fast laps not a perfect lap but I’m happy. We’ve done a good job all winter and good job in the test it’s been nice to do testing cause last year I missed it! It’s nice to understand more and give ourselves more possibilities in the race weekend if we need to it’s going good. When you have a good year it’s nice to carry it on next year and carry the momentum.”

American Cameron Beaubier set for Moto2 debut in Qatar

Teammate Marcos Ramirez injures arm will miss season-opening race

Calabasas Calif. (March 27 2021) — American Racing riders Marcos Ramirez and Cameron Beaubier qualified 20th and 22nd for the opening round of the FIM Moto2 World Championship. Unfortunately Ramirez will not start Sunday’s 20-lap race at the Losail International Circuit in Doha Qatar.

The 23-year-old Spaniard crashed at Turn 14 with fewer than five minutes remaining in the first of two qualifying sessions. X-rays revealed Ramirez fractured the humeral head—the ball that sits in the shoulder socket—of his right arm.

Shortly before his crash Ramirez set the fifth-quickest lap of the session and a personal best for the weekend a 1:59.638.

“I am happy about the bike but I touched the curb and crashed” said Ramirez. “It was a hard landing. I hope to come back next weekend.”

Beaubier continues to progress in his Moto2 debut. On Friday he shaved more than 1.6 seconds from his best lap in opening practice.

The five-time MotoAmerica Superbike champion was quicker on Saturday recording a 1:59.673—0.947 seconds from pole position—on his eighth and final lap of 15-minute Qualifying 1. Beaubier ended the session eighth 0.319 seconds from first.

“I’m improving” said Beaubier. “I think it will be really good to get a race under my belt. I’m looking forward to lining up.”

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Lululemon Athletica is 21.2% which ranks better than 91% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 29.4% which ranks better than 81% of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Lululemon Athletica's return on invested capital is 24.59 and its cost of capital is 9.53. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Lululemon Athletica is shown below:

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvbW91bnRhaW4tdmlldy1zdHVkZW50cy1leHBlbGxlZC12ZXJkaWN0LWJsYWNrZmFjZS0xOTQ0NDM5MC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bay Area jury awards $1M to boys expelled after 'blackface' incident,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/mountain-view-students-expelled-verdict-blackface-19444390.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvbW91bnRhaW4tdmlldy1zdHVkZW50cy1leHBlbGxlZC12ZXJkaWN0LWJsYWNrZmFjZS0xOTQ0NDM5MC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL21hdHRoZXctcGVycnlzLWxhLWhvbWUtbGlzdHMtZm9yLTUtMTltL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL21hdHRoZXctcGVycnlzLWxhLWhvbWUtbGlzdHMtZm9yLTUtMTltL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The LA home that Matthew Perry purchased months before his death lists for $5.19M,"The late “Friends” star Matthew Perry’s mid-century abode in Los Angeles has hit the market for $5.19 million according to a report in Domain.

But now thanks to new leadership at the Department of Interior the federal government is taking a fresh look at their claims. Some see it as a sign that not only might their voices finally be heard in this case but also that a turnaround has begun in the nation’s long history of injustices toward Indigenous people.

For Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation members with land allotments at Fort Berthold an encouraging signal came earlier this month. That’s when the Department of Interior’s Acting Secretary Scott de la Vega scrapped the Trump administration’s decision to reduce a $187 million penalty assessed against the oil company that owns the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline for trespassing on the reservation for seven years after its contract lapsed.

Days before leaving office in January a Trump official had cut Tesoro’s penalty to less than $4 million. Then on March 12 de la Vega ordered the Bureau of Indian Affairs to revisit the case and provide a “full and fair opportunity” for due process. “It does not appear that the parties had a full fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard” he wrote.

The ruling puts the tribal allottee’s claims “back in play” said Reed Soderstrom the attorney handling the cases of 80 landowners who’ve been pressing for fair compensation for years. “Finally we hope that we can get some traction and get to the merits of the case.”

Federal Tribal Relations Begin A New Historic Era

Although de la Vega’s order was issued the week before Interior Secretary Deb Haaland took office it’s one of several recent moves by the department that oversees the nation’s mineral resources and tribal trust lands that is inspiring a new sense of hope among Indigienous peoples.

Members of the nation’s 574 registered tribes are eager to see Haaland a New Mexican from the Laguna Pueblo and the first Indigenous U.S. cabinet secretary bring greater understanding to tribal rights and sovereignty. They hope she can help end a long history of exploitation of their land and natural resources without compensation or consultation.

Another reason for optimism came on March 19 when Interior’s new top attorney Robert T. Anderson reversed another controversial Trump era ruling affecting the MHA Nation. Anderson’s order restored longstanding mineral rights along a stretch of Missouri River riverbed to the tribe a reversal of former Solicitor Daniel Jorjani’s declaration last year that those rights belonged to the state of North Dakota.

“Today’s action will allow us to review the matter and ensure the Interior Department is upholding its trust and treaty obligations in accordance with the law” the department said in a statement.

Heather Tanana a research professor with the Stegner Center at the University of Utah law school said she thinks the Biden administration is trying to live up to his campaign promise to Native Americans.

A Navajo and member of the Navajo Nation Bar she also noted that the president has directed federal leaders to include Indigenous people in day-to-day decisions. This “consultation” as it’s called is both a legal standard for federal-tribal relations but also a moral one that arose from the long history of federal relocation exploitation and even extermination of Indigenous people.

“It’s rooted in an acknowledgement that tribes are sovereign entities and the government relationship to tribes is a government to government one” she said adding that the federal trust role means tribal community members are given a meaningful opportunity to understand the actions being considered.

The High Plains pipeline gathers crude oil along 700 miles from the Williston and Bakken areas of North Dakota and Montana and transports it underground to the Tesoro Logistics refinery in Mandan North Dakota according to the website Global Energy Monitor Wiki. In 2015 the pipeline was expanded to carry 90000 barrels per day and three years later the nation’s sixth largest oil company Marathon Petroleum Co. bought the High Plains pipeline as part of a $23 billion acquisition.

Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said in an emailed statement that the oil giant hadn’t received word about Interior’s ruling on the Fort Berthold trespass case “and we do not have any comment on it at this time.”

Guided by our values of integrity respect and collaboration” the statement concluded the company “remains committed to respecting the rights of the MHA Nation and its members as we work with them to resolve this matter.”

‘New Sheriff in Town’ at the Interior Department

Back at the Fort Berthold Reservation where Soderstrom circulated news about the trespass case there’s lots of talk about a “new sheriff in town.”

Tex Hall a former high school principal and basketball coach who now leads the Fort Berthold Land and Mineral Allottee Association is thrilled to see Haaland leading the Interior Department because she understands the U.S. government’s legal responsibility to consult tribes.

Tex Hall is one of more than 300 Fort Berthold landowners who say they’ve been treated unjustly by Interior Department officials and the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Co. in an eight-year dispute over the use of a crude oil pipeline traversing 16 miles of the reservation. A ruling this month gives the case new life now under the oversight of the nation’s first-ever Indigenous cabinet secretary Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Credit: Jodie Baxendale Photography “She knows about land ownership and she knows about the [U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s] trustee role looking out for the best interests of the landowner” said Hall who has served two terms as chairman of the MHA Nation’s governing Business Council. “So when she hopefully gets the time to look at our case she will see the injustice that we’ve endured.” “In any place other than a reservation that pipeline company would have been shut down” he said referring to a pattern of injustice that has historically plagued U.S. relations with sovereign tribes. “But I think Deb Haaland knows that.” Tara Sweeney an Alaska Native who served as the last assistant secretary for Indian affairs during the Trump administration failed to demonstrate that ethic he said when she took control of the Fort Berthold trespass case twice in the past year and made a final decision on Jan. 4 to settle the trespass case for $3.9 million.

“She never even asked us” he said. “I can only guess and speculate that politics played a role.”

Hall said he organized the allottees group four years ago after learning that current leaders of the Three Affiliated Tribes as the MHA Nation is also called had negotiated lucrative trespass and right-of-way deals with the oil company on the side. The company agreed to pay more than $2 million an acre for right of way over 25.65 acres of tribe-owned land. But for more than 300 individuals who owned allotments on the remaining 90.85 acres of right of way negotiations started as low as $200 an acre he said.

The allottees first took their complaints to federal court with one group of allottees working with Soderstrom and another working with a different attorney raising the same issues. But judges dismissed the cases saying the proper starting point for addressing the issues was the Interior Department’s Bureau of Indian Affairs and then if necessary moving through Interior’s multi-step administrative appeals process.

In July the BIA’s Great Plains Regional Director Timothy LaPointe ordered the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Co. to pay allottees a total of $187 million. Part of the payout was for using the pipeline for seven years after the previous right-of-way agreement lapsed in 2013 which amounted to trespassing on the tribal land. Some of the penalty covered the company’s earnings from the pipeline during that time and those amounts were tripled as allowed by federal law.

Tesoro shut down the pipeline and appealed. Then in August Sweeney took over the appeal threw out the $187 million settlement and directed a new appraisal based on “fair market value” of the allottees’ land.

That assessment came up with the figure of $85000 per acre—significantly less than the $2 million-per-acre value tribal leaders had secured for the tribe-owned allotments—and it included no penalties or interest for nearly eight years of trespass.

On Jan. 19 the day before President Joe Biden’s inauguration Sweeney mailed out an order finalizing the $4 million award. The Interior Department’s Board of Indian Appeals also dismissed a request by the allottees to reverse Sweeney’s rulings as a “manifest error or injustice.

“Some of our clients they’re mad about it” said Debra Hoffarth an attorney working on the Fort Berthold case with Soderstrom. “But then it’s not terribly surprising.”

But de la Vega’s March 12 order finally provided the reset of the process for which the tribal members had been fighting.

Now Soderstrom is looking forward to the discussions that his clients have been pressing for all along: developing a factual record adding up the money Tesoro has earned using the pipeline while it trespassed through the reservation and talking about damages.

And tribal members are looking not only at a fair settlement for past trespasses but a future in which sovereign tribal nations may be able to prevent new violations.

MARGARET BRENNNAN: We go now to Tony Capuano CEO of the world's largest hotel company Marriott International. He joins us from Bethesda Maryland. Good morning.

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL CEO ANTHONY CAPUANO: Good morning.

MARGARET BRENNNAN: We just heard Dr. Fauci say that travel remains high risk and yet we see numbers from TSA reporting people are getting on planes in record numbers in terms of the pandemic. Are you seeing a similar surge in spring bookings?

CAPUANO: We are seeing pretty significant acceleration of demand. The reality is people are traveling which is why we can't let our guard down. We've got to continue to adhere to the CDC protocols and keep our cleaning and operating protocols in place.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So vaccination you have said is going to be key to business to the economy reopening it. You have actually opened a program to try to incentivize your employees to take that vaccine by offering them four hours of pay. Why did you need to give that incentive? And is it working?

CAPUANO: We didn't need to. We chose to. Our culture is very much an employee-first culture and we wanted to make sure they had access to education about the vaccinations and the flexibility to take time off work if they chose to get vaccinated.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So that four hours of pay is to allow them to take the time off work to get the shot in the arm.

CAPUANO: That's correct.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So last March your predecessor said the financial impact of the pandemic was on par with 9/11 the Great Recession and the financial crisis around that time. Marriott cut thousands of jobs. You lost about $276000000. When do you expect to get back to that pre pandemic level of both jobs and business?

CAPUANO: It really depends on demand recovery. And demand recovery will be driven by consumer confidence. The good news is we have such great visibility into real-time data. In certain markets where the vaccine- the virus containment seems to be proceeding well and where you're seeing broad distribution of vaccine we are seeing demand recover and that's allowing us to bring many of our employees back.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So demand is up Arizona Texas and Florida I see. But it's still low in some of the big cities. Is that a trend you think is going to stay with us for some time?

CAPUANO: We'll continue to see growth in demand in drive-to destinations and I think leisure destinations. One of the really interesting phenomenon we've seen over the last year is a blending of trip purposes. People have learned that they can in fact work from almost anywhere. And as a result we're seeing our guests combine business travel with leisure travel.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Gas prices aren't going to impact those drive-to destination bookings?

CAPUANO: Certainly they'll have some measure of impact but we've really not seen it yet. There is enormous pent up demand and because of concerns about safety we continue to see lots of appeal of drive-to destinations.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You know when we look at the jobless rate in the country your industry is so frequently turned- pointed to as one of the biggest places of losses particularly for women. I'm wondering of all the adaptations that you have had to make in your hotels for safety reasons and protocols with you know not checking in in person but doing it on your phone or doing it digitally haven't you managed your way towards just needing to employ fewer people? I mean are these jobs actually coming back?

CAPUANO: In markets where demand is recovering we're absolutely seeing those jobs come back and in many of the markets you described were actively hiring. I think what those technological advances allow us to do is really engage our employees more in interacting with the guests and meeting their needs.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So desk clerk is not a job that's going to disappear?

CAPUANO: Absolutely not.

MARGARET BRENNAN: In New York State they're kind of experimenting with something I'm interested in getting your view on which is this idea of having some kind of vaccine passport so to speak some kind of digital stamp to show that you have been vaccinated. Is this something that you think business-wise you would encourage other states to adopt? I mean would it help give you some reassurance?

CAPUANO: Time will tell what the right platform is. What we know with certainty however is a global coordinated reliable health credential system will be key to giving folks comfort about traveling to and to giving jurisdictions comfort in opening their borders.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But who is going to run that since the states are administering these vaccine programs? You know the particulars of how you actually get this up and running are kind of a big stumbling point.

CAPUANO: It's the right question to ask. I- I worry a bit that the approach to-date is a bit fragmented. And again we need a comprehensive and global solution for it to be effective.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you talked to the White House about that?

CAPUANO: We're in active discussions with the administration with our industry colleagues to try and identify opportunities to inform borders as they consider opening.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You know two dozen or so industry groups wrote a letter to the White House pushing for international travel to be reopened by this summer saying that's a really key time frame for them. Do you have any indication that any of the travel restrictions will be lifted that international travel will return?

CAPUANO: It really varies by jurisdiction. We know there's enormous pent-up demand for international travel and we know those destinations like many European cities are struggling mightily because they rely so heavily on inbound international travel. The markets that have recovered most quickly are those that have depths of demand domestically. So we've seen that in drive-to destinations in the US and we've seen it across China.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But no promise from the White House? We're lifting the travel restrictions on countries by the summer. Nothing yet?

CAPUANO: Not yet.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much Tony Capuano for your time and your perspective. We'll be right back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL21hcnJpb3R0LXJlZGVtcHRpb24tc2VydmljZS1jaGFyZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ridiculous: This Marriott Hotel Charges Fee To Use Points (Update),"About a week ago I wrote about how at least one Marriott property has been charging Bonvoy members a fee to redeem their points which is outrageous. There’s now a positive update on this front as this hotel will no longer be allowed to charge this fee.

I’ll start the post by recapping what has been going on and then the last section below has the latest update.

Resort fees are bad enough…

Many hotels charge “resort fees” which is one of the most frustrating practices in the hotel industry. There are two primary motivations that hotels have to engage in this practice:

It limits how much commission they have to pay travel agents (since travel agents don’t get a commission on resort fees)

It makes the rate appear lower and more competitive than it actually is especially since many websites display hotel rates before all taxes and fees

The practice is bad enough at resorts though in the past few years we’ve also seen this spread to city hotels which is obscene. Hotels typically call these “destination fees” and it’s nothing more than a money grab.

Typically when you redeem points you still have to pay these resort and destination fees. Even elite members typically aren’t exempt from these:

That’s one thing I love about World of Hyatt as top tier Globalist members are always exempt from these fees regardless of whether they’re on a paid or award stay

All World of Hyatt and Hilton Honors members are exempt from these fees when redeeming points

…but award redemption fees are even worse

That brings me to one hotel that has had a ridiculous fee exclusively for award stays. The JW Marriott Los Cabos doesn’t have a resort fee. If you’re paying cash you’re just subjected to Mexico’s usually high hotel fees which include 19% government taxes and fees plus a 10% service charge for a total of 29% on top of the regular rate.

As you’d expect you don’t have to pay that on an award stay since the 29% would be added to a rate of zero. I guess to make up for that the JW Marriott Los Cabos has been charging a service charge of 30USD per night for all award stays.

It’s one thing to charge something on an award stay that’s also charged on a revenue stay but to add fees to award stays that don’t exist on paid stays is just plain ridiculous.

The kicker here is that this policy has been in place for at least three years as I wrote about this back in 2018. I figured Marriott corporate would’ve made the hotel undo it after this got publicity the first time around but that didn’t happen.

Suffice to say that this is completely outrageous — the whole point of redeeming points is to avoid paying cash for your room so if the hotel is just going to add an imaginary fee what’s the point? Why stop at a $30 fee? Why not add a $289 service charge while you’re at it and just charge the normal cash rate in addition to the points?

Marriott forces hotel to reverse redemption fee

Here’s what a Marriott spokesperson had to say about this practice:

“All hotel reservations at the JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort and Spa include service charges. The full amount received from these service charges is paid directly to hotel associates as a gratuity. These service charges have also been applied to redemption stays using Marriott Bonvoy points which is inconsistent with the program’s terms and conditions. We are taking this matter very seriously and have instructed the property to rescind the service charge for all redemption stays. Marriott is looking into whether this practice existed at other properties in the company’s portfolio. Once our review is completed we will communicate with our members who were impacted by such charges and intend to address the situation.”

As you can see:

The claim is that this $30 fee was essentially being paid to hotel employees as gratuity

Marriott has instructed the property to no longer charge this fee for all award stays

Marriott is allegedly looking into whether this practice has been implemented at other properties

Marriott then intends to contact members who were impacted to “address the situation”

I’m happy to see Marriott forcing this hotel to reverse its policy but I’d be shocked if Marriott proactively offers a refund to any Bonvoy member who has redeemed points at the hotel in the past

Bottom line

For the past few years the JW Marriott Los Cabos has charged Bonvoy members $30 per night when redeeming points in what has been referred to as a “service charge.” The hotel doesn’t have any sort of a resort fee so this didn’t apply on paid stays.

Fortunately Marriott corporate has addressed this and the hotel will no longer be able to charge this fee going forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mYi1yb3VuZHVwLWNyb3duLXJlc29ydHMtbWFycmlvdHQtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1ncm9zdmVub3ItZXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FB Roundup: Crown Resorts Marriott International Grosvenor Estate,"James Packer’s Crown Resorts considers $6.2 billion Blackstone bid

Crown Resorts Australia’s largest casino operator and majority owned by billionaire heir James Packer is mulling an acquisition offer of $6.2 billion from US private equity giant Blackstone.

The Melbourne-based Crown confirmed this week it received an unsolicited non-binding and indicative proposal to acquire all its shares at an indicative price of A$11.85 ($9.04) per share. Blackstone already held a 9.99% stake in Crown which it acquired from Melco Resorts and Entertainment for $8.15 per share in April 2020.

The New York-based group with $619 billion worth of assets under management bought the Bellagio casino resort in Las Vegas (pictured) for $4.25 billion in 2019. In January 2020 Blackstone entered a $4.6 billion joint venture to bring into its fold two additional MGM Resorts International properties on the Strip MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

The non-family Crown board said it had “not yet formed a view on the merits of the proposal”. The four directors were starting their assessment with the involvement of stakeholders regulators and legal and financial advisers. The board said it did not need to take any action regarding the bid and there was no certainty a deal would be made. Share prices rocketed 21% on the day of Crown’s Blackstone announcement.

James Packer (pictured above) 53 is the largest shareholder at 36% in Crown but stepped down for its board and resigned from the board of his family company Consolidated Press Holdings in 2018 to recover from mental health issues. Packer reportedly indicated this week he will follow the Crown board’s decision on the Blackstone proposal.

Packer is worth $3.5 billion according to Forbes. With his elder sister investor and philanthropist Gretel Packer 55 he is the only son of the late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer (pictured left). He is the grandson of the late Sir Frank Packer (pictured below) who founded Australian Consolidated Press in 1936 long since absorbed by other media companies.

James Packer may welcome a lucrative exit from Crown Resorts. Australian regulators ruled in February the operator was not fit to hold a gaming licence in Sydney citing money laundering and organised crime links. Five directors resigned from the Crown board. The states of Victoria and Western Australia will open their own inquiries into Crown in the coming months.

Due to Australia’s Covid-19 restrictions in March 2020 Crown was directed to close for an extended period its gaming activities and a significant part of its non-gaming operations at its integrated Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth resorts for the first time in the company’s history. The temporary closures were reflected in its dire 2020 finances with an 80% plunge in net profits to $79.5 million ($60.6 million) from a profit of A$401.8 million ($306.4 million) a year earlier.

In addition to its Melbourne and Perth resorts Crown developments include the Crown Sydney Hotel Resort and the One Queensbridge site in Melbourne. Crown owns and operates Crown Aspinalls in London and holds a 50% equity interest in the UK-based casino-operating Aspers Group co-created with the multi-millionaire Aspinall family.

Crown owns a 20% interest in the restaurant and hotel chain Nobu. It has interests in digital businesses including the wholly owned Betfair Australasia an 85% stake in DGN Games and 50% stake in Chill Gaming.

Next-gen hotel heir David Marriott to succeed father Bill Marriott

US hotel heir David Marriott has been elected as a director on the board of Marriott International in anticipation of succeeding his father as chairman in 2022.

Marriott (pictured left) 47 president of the company’s US full-service hotel division is the son of JW “Bill” Marriott Jr (pictured below) 89 and grandson of late founder J Willard Marriott.

The election of Marriott and Horacio Rozanski 53 president and chief executive at consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton swelled the board’s membership to 13 nine of whom are independent.

After consultation the company announced in May 2020 that Bill Marriott planned to transition from serving as executive chairman and chairman of the board to the role of chairman emeritus in 2022. The next-gen Marriott will assume the chairmanship on an unspecified date in 2022 and would step down from his presidency at the end of April 2021.

The appointments followed the loss of Arne Sorenson (pictured right) who died of cancer in February 2021 at the age of 62. Sorenson was the first non-family member to lead the company when he became chief executive in 2012. Praised as “exceptional” by Bill Marriott Sorenson led the transformation of the family business into the largest hotel chain in the world which involved the $13 billion acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

The new team will need to continue to manage the seismic impacts of Covid-19 restrictions on the hotel business. Marriott International reported a loss of $164 million in the fourth-quarter of 2020 compared to a profit of $279 million in the same quarter in 2019.

The third-generation David Marriott youngest son of four children joined Marriott International in 1999 and worked his way up through several operational roles. As president of the company’s US full-service hotel division he was responsible for overseeing more than 330 hotels operating under 14 brands in 34 states and French Polynesia. While he worked as chief operations officer for the brand’s Americas eastern region from 2010 to 2018 he oversaw the US integration of Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

He is a trustee of the J Willard and Alice S Marriott Foundation. The family charity co-created a hospitality career development fund in Sorenson’s name.

“Like me David grew up in the hospitality business” Bill Marriott said.

“While having Marriott as his last name opened the first door for him he has proven throughout his 21 years with the company that he is a disciplined operator a thoughtful collaborator with our owners and franchisees and a passionate steward of our culture. The board will benefit from his experience and insights.”

Based in Bethesda Maryland Marriott International encompasses more than 7600 properties under 30 leading brands spanning 133 countries and territories. Marriott also operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts around the world.

Grosvenor Estate appoints new family office head in management revamp

The Duke of Westminster says the new management structure of his family’s Grosvenor Estate including a new family office head will help shape long-term success in its commercial and social activities.

The Grosvenor Estate announced the promotion of Nicholas Dobbs rural estates’ director to the role of head of the Grosvenor Family Office from 1 April reporting to Mark Preston executive trustee and chief executive of the estate. The Grosvenor Family Office is responsible for the management and enhancement of environmentally sensitive habitats within the Grosvenor family’s rural estates and for supporting their philanthropic activities through the Westminster Foundation.

Chaired by Michael McLintock a new investment committee was formed comprising Grosvenor’s trustees the newly created role of chief investment officer the estate’s chief financial officer and two independent advisers. The committee will be responsible for capital allocation as well as for strategy and performance of the estate’s commercial activities in international urban property food and agriculture and in financial investments.

Family principal Hugh Grosvenor (pictured above) 30 became the 7th Duke of Westminster upon the death of his father Gerald Grosvenor (pictured left) aged 64 in 2016.

“These changes will help us shape our long-term success building on our international growth of the past 50 years and meeting the many and varied challenges of the next 50” the billionaire millennial aristocrat said.

“I am confident we will continue to adapt and change as we have many times in the past to make a sustainable and meaningful impact on the communities we support and work alongside.”

The duke personally gave £10 million ($13.8 million) in April 2020 following an initial donation of £2.5million ($3.4 million) in March 2020 to support the United Kingdom’s health service medical research and development and charities to help the country’s long-term recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJvb3QuY29tL2JsYWNrLWhvdGVsLWd1ZXN0LWZpbGVzLWxhd3N1aXQtYWdhaW5zdC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWhvdGUtMTg0NjU2NzQ5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Man Sues Marriott Hotel in California Over Alleged Racial Bias,"In today’s episode of Can Black People Even Exist Without Looking Suspicious Someone? a Black man has filed a lawsuit against the Fremont Marriott Silicon Valley hotel in Alameda County Calif. after he said he was racially profiled and treated like shit last year by the hotel manager all because he committed the egregious crime of...sitting in his car in the hotel parking lot.

From the San Francisco Chronicle:

Dramaine Vinegar said he booked a three-night stay at the Fremont Marriott Silicon Valley last April with his fiancee. On the second-to-last day of his stay Vinegar sat in his car in the hotel’s parking lot to make a phone call according to the lawsuit. Vinegar said a car pulled up behind him. A hotel manager William Gheen jumped out and told Vinegar to “Get the f— off the property” according to the lawsuit which names Gheen Marriott International and the hotel’s franchisee and management company Fremont Hotel Operating Co. and Remington Hotels. In an interview with The Chronicle Vinegar said he told Gheen that he had a “motel” room. Gheen snapped back “It’s a hotel not a motel” according to Vinegar and the lawsuit. The pair continued to argue in the hotel’s lobby in an interaction that Vinegar filmed with his cell phone. “I’m a customer. I’ve been here for two nights. You got out your truck and you told me to get the f— off of private property without even addressing me properly” Vinegar tells Gheen in the video. When Vinegar asks Gheen for his name the manager extends his middle finger while walking away the video shows.

It appears to be a classic case of negroes not being able to engage in even the most mundane of activities—such as sitting in a car while making a phone call—without a Karen-esque white person thinking something isn’t right and then acting like a child after being called out on their shit.

“I’m 100% certain if I was white he wouldn’t have addressed me like that” Vinegar told the Chronicle.

Like Black men across the country Vinegar said he’d been subjected to “certain looks certain stereotypes” but he said nothing as blatant as what he experienced at the hotel has ever happened to him. (Which honestly makes him a relatively fortunate Black man in America.)

Jason Kafoury Vinegar’s attorney said the incident was just one in “a pattern of white managers in hotels walking up to paying guests and racially profiling them to try to clear out lobbies and parking lots.”

According to the Chronicle Vinegar’s lawsuit doesn’t specify any damages but he is demanding that Marriot hotels screen people for racial bias before hiring them to be managers.

“For the most part I’m hoping that people will understand that they have to treat all races the same” he said.

My petty side really hopes Vinegar goes after the manager’s and/or the hotel’s pockets as well. If racists can’t say “I’m sorry” from their hearts they can say it with their wallets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L3JlYWRlci1xdWVzdGlvbi0xNTAtbmlnaHRzLWxvbmctc3RheS1hdC1tYXJyaW90dC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1ob3ctcG9pbnRzLWFyZS1jb3VudGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader Question: 150 Nights Long Stay At Marriott Property – How Points Are Counted?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2021/03/28/reader-question-150-nights-long-stay-at-marriott-property-how-points-are-counted/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L3JlYWRlci1xdWVzdGlvbi0xNTAtbmlnaHRzLWxvbmctc3RheS1hdC1tYXJyaW90dC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1ob3ctcG9pbnRzLWFyZS1jb3VudGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Defender Matthijs de Ligt had said ahead of the match that the Dutch team wanted to make a statement about the human rights situation in Qatar saying “it’s a very difficult situation with workers’ rights there.”

The Dutch action before the game at the Johan Cruyff Arena followed expressions of support for human rights by Norway and Germany players ahead of their first World Cup qualifying matches on Wednesday and Thursday.

The German team lined up in black shirts each with one white letter to spell out “HUMAN RIGHTS” ahead of the 3-0 win against Iceland in Group J. Midfielder Leon Goretzka said the German players had followed Norway’s lead and that they wanted to make a statement about the 2022 World Cup.

Norway players wore shirts stating: “HUMAN RIGHTS” and “Respect on and off the pitch” before their game against Gibraltar in Group G on Wednesday.

FIFA’s disciplinary code states players and federations can face disciplinary action in cases of “using a sports event for demonstrations of a non-sporting nature.”

FIFA has not opened a case against Norway or Germany for their actions.

The Norwegian national team made a point about human rights again ahead of its game against Turkey in Malaga Spain. Its players took off jackets for the national anthem to reveal white T-shirts with the message “HUMAN RIGHTS On and off the pitch” but this time calling on more teams to join forces with them. The shirts also bore the names of Norway and Germany with ticks beside them and the question “Next?”

Alexander Kazakis 0-5 Albin Ouschan

SEMI-FINALS

Alexander Kazakis 5-1 Marc Bijsterbosch

Albin Ouschan 5-2 Billy Thorpe

A mightily relieved Albin Ouschan finally made it through to Predator Championship League Pool Winners’ Group at the sixth attempt when he beat Alexander Kazakis 5-0 in the Group 6 final on Saturday evening avoiding having to play his sister Jasmin in Group 6 in the process.

The Austrian former World Champion started the tournament in the very first group and had played two finals and two further semi-finals before this group. During the round-robin league phase he won four of his six matches before defeating Billy Thorpe 5-2 in his semi-final.

In the final he met Kazakis in what was Ouschan’s 44th match of the tournament and unlike previous finals this one was almost routine for the three-time Mosconi Cup winner who ran out 5-0 winner to advance to Monday’s showpiece finale where he will meet Chris Melling David Alcaide Eklent Kaci Niels Feijen Naoyuki Oi and the winner of tomorrow’s Group 7.

“It is an incredible feeling” said Ouschan. “I was exhausted but I tried my best and played pretty solid. It has been the most horrible feeling of my whole career. Everyone saw that I went through everything. The first day was good the second day was horrible. Then I kept getting better and better but it was never enough. I lost to Oi I lost to Niels I played so many matches but now I am super super happy.

“I was just playing and thinking from match-to-match I wasn’t thinking what would be the outcome of the tournament. I had nothing to lose any more; I had proved I could be in every semi-final and final and if it doesn’t work in the end it is ok so I took pressure off myself.

“I will have a nice long run tomorrow have a day off get some fresh air get my brain cleaned and be ready for Monday. The best players of each day will come together to perform so it is going to be tough for everyone.”

In the semi-finals Kazakis made light work of his clash against Marc Bijsterbosch who finished fourth in the group table. The Greek former World Pool Masters finalists defeated his Dutch opponent 5-1 to book his place in the final after performing superbly throughout the day his first in the tournament.

Casper Matikainen and Mieszko Fortunski will return in Group 7 having finished fifth and sixth respectively but the Group 6 runner-up Roberto Gomez has been eliminated after winning just one match on Friday. Jasmin Ouschan and Denis Grabe are the final two players to join the event and will complete the Group 7 line-up.

Predator Championship League Pool has a prize fund of $85950. Every day features a seven-player group with each player facing every other player once in a race-to-5. At the end of the group the top four advance to the play-offs playing a semi-final and then final also played as race-to-5. Play-off champions will advance to the big-money Winners’ Group on March 29 which will provide the showpiece conclusion of Predator Championship League Pool.

Players who finished bottom of each group are eliminated from the event while the remaining five players in each group will continue to the next day’s play where two new players enter the tournament.

Narbavi R Share Tweet

Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant stuck to the plans of going hard against the spinners and ended up adding 99 off just 70 deliveries ©BCCI

During the innings break in the third ODI on Sunday (March 28) Hardik Pandya sounded a tad disappointed with India's total of 329. He had every reason to not feel content considering how the series had panned out. 300 was nothing but a par total and India were defending those scores against a side that had redefined batting in ODI cricket enroute to winning their maiden World Cup. No wonder Hardik was aiming for 360!

England swatting aside 337 in the second game and coming back from the dead to almost clinch the series on Sunday were further proof that 329 wasn't safe enough. But what was remarkable in Hardik's statement was the fact that India were in no position to even get to that total by the halfway mark during their innings. Having lost the toss once again they were handed the tougher job of setting a target for the third successive game. For a while now there have been question marks over India's intent in ODI cricket especially at the top of the order in the powerplay and in the middle phase as well. Murmurs only grew louder after the defeat in the second ODI and this was a recurring pattern especially in games where they batted first.

India and England over the years have taken contrasting approaches in the first powerplay. While England go hard at the bowlers right from the word go Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are generally content being there out in the middle by the end of the 10th over and then picking pace. In the opening ODI India were 39/0 after 10 overs whereas Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy scored 50 more in the same phase. For a side that has believed in conserving wickets and going hard at the death India ended up making 126 in the final 10 overs on Friday (March 26) but their tactic of going pretty easy on the England spin attack perhaps cost them 25-30 odd runs.

The signs of a change in their approach were finally visible in the series decider when Dhawan started to go hard up top. But India's plans appeared to go for a toss when they lost their top three in three overs. Dhawan Rohit and Virat Kohli have done the bulk of the scoring for the national side in this format over the last few years and losing all three before the 18th over already posed a challenge on a wicket where a huge total was needed. And for aggression to sustain the last thing you need is to lose wickets in a cluster. Quite surprisingly it was England's spin duo of Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali who were causing damage on a day they were expected to be taken apart.

To add insult to injury England brought on their third spin option of the day Liam Livingstone to send KL Rahul packing and suddenly the team's four most reliable batters were already in the pavilion with a little more than half the number of overs still left. But what followed suit was perhaps a sign of things to come in the future. Instead of following the old template of trying to resurrect an innings by being watchful and then going hard at the end the finishers paved the way for India going forward by continuing to go for the kill despite being on the backfoot. Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant stuck to the plans of going hard against the spinners and ended up adding 99 off just 70 deliveries to reverse the fortunes.

These two combined smashed four sixes and two fours off Rashid two fours and a six off Livingstone and Hardik took on Moeen in an over to clear the ropes thrice. In contrast Rahul and Kohli added 121 off 140 balls to rebuild the innings in the second ODI and didn't fancy their chances against spin. Hardik and Pant didn't slog aimlessly. It was controlled aggression at its best where a team managed to turn the tables in a matter of a few overs despite appearing to be in trouble. Their enterprising partnership also reinforced belief that India doesn't always need one of their top order players to bat deep into an ODI innings.

Like they have shown in the recent past India's younger core have not shied away from challenges thrown at them. Here was a man who had not played ODI cricket in more than a year but still managed to register his highest score in the format on Friday before bettering it on Sunday. Hardik pulled off something very similar against Australia last December alongside Ravindra Jadeja. And once the left-arm spinner eventually returns to the side India will have three reliable fearless finishers at the death to bank upon.

Can sustained aggression redefine the concept of rebuilding an innings? England have paved the way for the rest of the world in that regard. And going by what we witnessed in the series decider starting from Dhawan's approach to how Hardik Pant and even Shardul Thakur batted India appear to be willing to change their methods in 50-over cricket to fetch desired results. And if the top three can complement the finishers by being a bit more adventurous India might regularly start breaching 370 or 380 as Kohli pointed out after the series win.

Tunisia defeated Equatorial Guinea 2-1 at Stade Olympique de Rades on Sunday to end their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying campaign unbeaten with five wins and a draw from their allotted fixtures.

Victory moved the Eagles of Carthage up to 16 points in Group J seven clear of Nzalang Nacional who like Tunisia had already qualified for next year’s tournament before the match following their win over Tanzania earlier this week.

Tunisia went into the fixture in free-scoring form following their 5-2 victory at Libya on Thursday and carried on from where they left off as Seifeddine Jaziri found the back of the net with four minutes on the clock in Rades. The Tunisian forward ran onto a precise ball from Zamalek teammate Ferjani Sassi over the Equatorial Guinea defensive line before finishing with aplomb.

Tunisia doubled their lead seven minutes after the half-time break albeit through rather fortunate circumstances as Ali Abdi’s cross took a wicked deflection off Carlos Akapo before looping over Embela Gil’s head and into the back of the net.

Tunisia returned the favour with two minutes of regulation time remaining as Firas Chaouat put the ball beyond his own goalkeeper but it proved too little too late for the visitors as the Eagles of Carthage held on for all three points.

The top two nations in each group advance to the 24-team finals hosted in Cameroon next year.

(NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"The Pittsburgh Steelers made it an emphasis to improve their offensive line in the 2024 NFL Draft selecting Troy Fautanu Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick with three of their first five selections. While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick.

MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtbWNkb25hbGRzLXdvcnN0LW1lbnUtaXRlbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is the Worst McDonald's Menu Item,"If you're looking for a healthy fast-food choice or even a reasonably nutritious one there is one menu item at McDonald's you're going to want to avoid.

Simply put—we repeat do not go anywhere near this Mickey D's staple.

Sorry to break it to you but even if you're planning on fully treating yourself you should know the facts beforehand.

So without further ado the worst menu item at McDonald's is…

McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese

740 calories 42 g fat (20 g saturated fat 2.5 g trans fat) 1360 mg sodium 43 g carbs (2 g fiber 10 g sugar) 48 g protein

As a rule a meat and cheese entree with the word ""double"" in its name is grounds for extreme caution and this menu item is no exception. The Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese packs 740 calories which is at least one-third of what many people require for an entire day. But a high calorie count is hardly this burger's biggest fault.

That honor is reserved for its fat content—the amount and the type—according to registered dietitian nutritionist Hillary Wright author of The Prediabetes Diet Plan.

""For starters the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese serves up 42 grams of fat or 54% of what you require on a 2000-calorie eating plan never mind the other dangerous fat it supplies"" she says.

If you think Wright is referring to saturated fat you're correct—there's nearly 100% of the suggested daily maximum intake of the artery-clogging stuff lurking in a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese. But she's also talking about trans fat a type of fat that doesn't always garner as much attention as saturated even though it's worse for your health. While the U.S. has banned trans fat it is is found in full-fat milk and cheese butter and fatty meat as well as some fried foods.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Trans fat raises LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol and lowers HDL or ""good"" cholesterol setting the stage for blocked arteries that can lead to heart disease and stroke.

Trans fat also stokes inflammation that further contributes to these cardiovascular diseases and may promote the build-up of fat around the belly which exacerbates heart disease risk.

Experts recommend eating no trans fat or coming as close to zero as possible.

However adhering to that advice is impossible with a McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese which provides 2.5 grams of trans fat. Trans fat is so potent that it makes saturated fat look good and 2.5 grams is considered a relatively large amount.

As with many fast food choices the sodium levels in the McDonald's Double Cheeseburger are through the roof: 1360 milligrams or about 60% of the daily suggested upper limit.

""Having to use a comma for the sodium content of a single food item is never good"" Wright says. ""A consistently high intake of sodium is linked to elevated blood pressure which increases the risk for stroke and heart attack.""

Looking for helpful tips? Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!

What should a burger-lover order instead?

Wright would never suggest choosing a fish sandwich and apple slices at McDonald's when you're craving beef and cheese. But there's no reason to go over the top either.

She recommends opting for a McDouble.

""You'll satisfy your hankering for a cheeseburger but for just 400 calories which is 340 fewer than the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese and half the total and saturated fat.""

You'll also slash trans fat from 2.5 grams to just one and you'll save about 400 milligrams of sodium. Oh and you'll do your body a big favor!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWljaGlnYW5yb3NzLnVtaWNoLmVkdS9hYm91dC9wcm9maWxlL2tldmluLW96YW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Ozan | Michigan Ross,"Career Background

Ah McDonald's: certainly a fast food joint fit for royalty! Literally. (Though Burger King might disagree.)

Unbeknownst to many a key member of the British Royal Family does a whole lot more than representing the British monarchy across the pond. In addition to serving as the current Head of State Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II also holds the unique title of... McDonald's restaurant owner. That's right! The ultra-chic McDonald's is located in the Banbury Gateway Shopping Park a promenade mall in the heart of Oxfordshire England. But in order to get there the Queen would have to travel a long 80 miles (that is 128.75 kilometers) from her home Buckingham Palace in London (via Business Insider). That's quite a trek to get a good ol' McD's fix!

How – and why – does the Queen own a McDonald's? The McD's in question is located on Sovereign-owned property specifically a piece of land that is part of the Crown Estate. Prince Charles who's the Queen's son and the person next in line to rule the monarchy will acquire the royal McD's when he is crowned King one day. And just to clarify the Treasury receives all money made from Crown Estate-owned sites; so the restaurant won't add to the wealth of any royal family members per The Sun. The Queen was also the previous owner of another McDonald's drive-thru at Slough's Bath Road Retail Park. However the Crown Estate sold the land in 2016 for a whopping £177 million (or $212080515).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWlzYmFyLmNvbS9lbi9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wMy8yOS9tY2RvbmFsZCVFMiU4MCU5OXMtYW5kLWNva2UtbmV2ZXItYW5ub3VuY2VkLXRoYXQtdGhleSVFMiU4MCU5OWQtc3RvcC1oaXJpbmctd2hpdGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's And Coke Never Announced That They'd Stop Hiring Whites | Misbar,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2FyaXpvbmF3aWxkY2F0cy9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL21jZG9uYWxkLXRpbWUtcmFua2luZy1hYXJpLW1jZG9uYWxkcy10aW1lbGVzcy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZXMtd2l0aC10aGUtd2lsZGNhdHMvYXJ0aWNsZV9jY2Y2YzNjNi1hMjlmLTViMWQtYjQzMi02NzA1ODBkMTQ1Y2YuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'McDonald time': Ranking Aari McDonald's timeless performances with the Wildcats,"You’d be hard-pressed to find a player in Arizona women’s basketball history that’s had a bigger impact than Aari McDonald.

McDonald is the Pac-12 Player of the Year and Pac-12 Co-Defensive Player of the Year and has been named a second-team Associated Press All-American for the second year in a row.

This season marks McDonald’s final run at the UA. As the Wildcats look to make the program’s first-ever Elite Eight we take a look at McDonald’s best performances at Arizona:

Start of something special

Opponent: Loyola Marymount

When: Nov. 13 2018

Where: McKale Center

Final stats: 39 points (20-23 FT) 8 rebounds 3 steals 6 turnovers

What went down: Arizona meet Aari. Aari meet Arizona. The game after McDonald’s UA debut where she dropped 22 points against Idaho State the Washington transfer recorded a season-high 39 points becoming the first Wildcat since LaBrittney Jones in 2015 to score at least 30. McDonald made 9 of 21 field-goal attempts but the majority of her scoring came from the free-throw line where she went 20 for 23. However the Wildcats fell to LMU 66-64. Regardless of the outcome it was one of McDonald’s top offensive showings as a Wildcat. A star was born.

She said it: “I took it upon myself to get my teammates together just try to talk just try to be a leader out there.” — McDonald

Treinta in Tempe

Opponent: Arizona State

When: Feb. 28 2021

Where: Desert Financial Arena Tempe

Final stats: 30 points (10-19 FG) 4 rebounds 4 assists 6 steals

What went down: McDonald’s season-high performance of 30 points and six steals wasn’t enough and Arizona was upset by ASU 66-64. McDonald will finish her UA career with a 4-2 record against the Sun Devils.

She said it: “We gave them momentum we let them stick around. Then they just punched us in the face and took it from us. And that’s unfortunate.” — Barnes

Wildcats make program history with in Corvallis

Opponent: No. 9 Oregon State

When: Feb. 9 2020

Where: Gill Coliseum Corvallis Oregon

Final stats: 22 points (8-23 FG) 9 rebounds 4 steals

What went down: McDonald was once again the Wildcats’ top bucket-getter in the program’s first-ever road win over a top-10 team. After the UA fell to the Beavers in nail-biting fashion at McKale Center Arizona avenged its loss to win in overtime and snap a 12-game losing streak to OSU. In the final 17 seconds of overtime McDonald iced the game with a steal a pair of free-throws and a defensive rebound. Arizona’s win over the Beavers sparked a four-game winning streak.

She said it: “It feels great. Today my team showed a lot of toughness and we stuck with ’em and we finished it out.” — McDonald

Aari drops 35 in 3 OTS

Opponent: UCLA

When: Jan. 27 2019

Where: McKale Center

Final stats: 35 points (14-25 FG) 12 rebounds 7 assists 4 steals

What went down: McDonald’s sixth 30-plus-point game as a Wildcat nearly helped the UA upset UCLA. With the game on the line in double-overtime McDonald sunk a 3-pointer to extend the game into a third extra period — the first triple-overtime contest between two Pac-12 teams since 2001. The Bruins dominated the glass and hauled in 27 offensive rebounds and survived 98-93.

She said it: “I liked the way my team fought despite the outcome. We definitely have things to work on but we definitely showed a lot of fight.” — McDonald

Put a ring on it

Opponent: No. 3 Oregon

When: March 7 2020

Where: Las Vegas

Final stats: 34 points (14-25 FG) 5 rebounds 5 assists 3 turnovers

What went down: Oregon was a buzzsaw during the 2019-20 season boasting top-10 WNBA draft picks Sabrina Ionescu Satou Sabally and Ruthy Hebard. Arizona lost to the Ducks twice in the regular season then faced them once again in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals. Both teams shot over 40% but Oregon’s star power was too overwhelming for the rising Cats and Arizona was defeated 88-70.

What happened after the game changed McDonald’s life forever.

McDonald walked over to her family members who held up placards that spelled out “Will you marry me?” Her boyfriend former UA defensive back Devon Brewer knelt down and proposed with an engagement ring. The entire thing was shown on the Pac-12 Networks postgame show.

She said it: “I was so shocked. I was looking and was like ‘What does that say?’ And I saw him get on his knee and I was like ‘Oh my god.’ It’s crazy. I should have put everything together because the last couple of months he’s really been talking about it. I am just shocked because my parents my siblings and him — even my teammates plotted against me. I’m just happy.” — McDonald

Cutting down the nets

Opponent: Northwestern

When: April 6 2019

Where: McKale Center

Final stats: 19 points (8-17 FG) 7 rebounds 3 assists 6 steals 7 turnovers

What went down: On a sunny cloudless April day in Tucson a line of spectators wrapped around McKale Center hours before Arizona’s WNIT championship game against Northwestern. Near the end of the game the McKale Center public address announcer relayed that Arizona had set a Pac-12 attendance record. Those fans in attendance caught a glimpse of the Aari McDonald Show as she tallied a game-high 19 points and six steals in a WNIT championship win.

It wasn’t McDonald’s best performance but winning the WNIT changed the direction of the Wildcats’ program. She set Arizona’s single-season scoring record with 890 points in 2019.

She said it: “It’s just big. I am so excited just to be part of this team. We did amazing things this program hasn’t done in years. It’s exciting. The best is yet to come.” — McDonald

A record-setting showing

Opponent: No. 22 Texas

When: Nov. 17 2019

Where: Frank Erwin Center Austin Texas

Final stats: 44 points (14-18 FG 14-14 FT) 5 rebounds 4 turnovers

What went down: McDonald broke Arizona’s single-game scoring record with 44 points as the Wildcats beat the Longhorns 83-58. She remains the only player in program history to score 40 in a game.

She said it: “No one could guard Aari. She proved when it counted … how she’s going to step up and perform that she is one of the best guards in the country.” — Barnes

The Stanford stunner

Opponent: No. 4 Stanford

When: Feb. 28 2020

Where: McKale Center

Final stats: 20 points (7-20 FG) 4 rebounds 3 assists

What went down: Following a sluggish start McDonald flipped a switch. The UA’s star guard scored 13 of her 20 points in the fourth quarter and overtime. McDonald turned the ball over with 42 seconds remaining in overtime but Helena Pueyo and Amari Carter’s defense on the inbounds pass coming out of the timeout break gave the Wildcats the ball with 13.1 seconds left. McDonald sank the game-winning jump shot with eight seconds left to give Arizona a 73-72 triumph. Arizona’s victory over the fourth-ranked Cardinal was the UA’s first-ever win against a top-five opponent.

She said it: “I was like ‘OK time to score.’ So we got to (get the) stop and convert it. I didn’t hang my head — it was just next play. It was gutsy. I knew my team needed that.” — McDonald

‘McDonald time’

Opponent: 11th-seeded BYU

When: Wednesday

Where: UTSA Convocation Center San Antonio

Final stats: 17 points (7-16 FG) 11 rebounds 4 steals 3 assists 3 turnovers

What went down: The second-seeded Wildcats trailed 43-39 with 5:12 left to play when “McDonald time” began. McDonald posted seven points two rebounds and two steals in the closing minutes to help Arizona beat BYU 52-46 and punch the UA’s ticket to its first Sweet 16 since 1998. Shaylee Gonzales the West Coast Conference co-Player of the Year was limited to five second-half points with McDonald as the primary defender.

McDonald — and Arizona — will have an opportunity to make more history and enter uncharted territory on Saturday."

Companies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid permanent capital loss an investor must do their research and review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to to understand its financial strength. Medtronic PLC has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.48 which which ranks worse than 78% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments.

Medtronic PLC Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Modestly Overvalued

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Medtronic PLC's 3-year average revenue growth rate is in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. Medtronic PLC's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -2.3% which ranks worse than 70% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Medtronic PLC's return on invested capital is 5.45 and its cost of capital is 4.40. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Medtronic PLC is shown below:

Medtronic PLC Stock Shows Every Sign Of Being Modestly Overvalued

In summary the stock of Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT 30-year Financials) is believed to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 70% of the companies in the industry of Medical Devices & Instruments. To learn more about Medtronic PLC stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Social media stocks: Love 'em or hate 'em it's where many eyeballs are going these days. While social media stocks are susceptible to government regulation thorny privacy and safety issues and not to mention young upstart challengers most companies did exceptionally well last year in the pandemic. With the continuing shift to digital advertising these companies could be in for sustained growth in the years ahead even when the pandemic subsides.

Social media companies also benefit from powerful network effects making first-movers hard to displace. So it's not surprising that two ""granddads"" of social media Facebook (META 1.03%) and Twitter (TWTR) did well last year. Facebook is up 75% and Twitter is up 140% over the past 12 months compared with 62% for the S&P 500.

With economies reopening and advertising revenue starting to recover which is the better stock today?

Facebook exceeds Twitter on every business metric but can things change?

Twitter is up more than Facebook over the past year due to improvements relative to 2019. Still Facebook clearly has the better overall business as things stand today. During the fourth quarter here's how the two social networks stacked up on several key metrics.

FY 2020 Metric Facebook Twitter Year-end MAUs 2.80 billion N/A Year-end DAUs 1.84 billion 192 million DAU growth 11% 27% Revenue $86.0 billion $3.7 billion Revenue growth 22% 7% Operating profit $32.7 billion $26.7 million Operating profit growth 36% (93%)

There's no real question as to which is the better business at this moment: Facebook wins hands-down. Thanks to its unmatched scale intimate knowledge of customers highly visual format and precision targeting capabilities Facebook is becoming the advertising platform of choice for businesses large and small and is especially key for small online businesses to reach new customers.

But Twitter is improving

Despite the massive outperformance of the Facebook business Twitter has been the better stock over the past year. This is likely due to where both stocks started. Facebook is a nearly $800 billion market cap behemoth while Twitter even after its big run only has a market cap of $49 billion.

Twitter's user base also accelerated more than Facebook's with mDAUs growing 27% in 2020 versus Facebook's 11%. That could lead some to believe Twitter will accelerate its top line even though it actually lagged Facebook on a revenue growth basis last year.

Twitter has clearly had problems monetizing its platform but things began to improve throughout 2020. Revenue accelerated throughout the year exiting Q4 at a 28% revenue growth rate higher than the 7% it posted for the full year. Within overall revenue ad revenue growth was an even higher 31%.

Notably the company brought in more direct response advertisers not just big brands. And Twitter also retooled its ad server to better target mobile ads. The new mobile application promotion (MAP) tool generated 50% growth in Q4. Management also hopes to improve its non-existent standing with small businesses going forward.

But Facebook may be the better stock in a rising rate environment

With the economy reopening and interest rates going up things may swing more in favor of more profitable companies in 2021. That bodes well for Facebook which is still much much cheaper than Twitter on both a price-to-earnings and price-to-sales basis:

Twitter may also have a hard time generating near-term profits even if its revenue growth holds up because it's still making some heavy investments. Management forecasts 25% growth ""or more"" in total expenses in 2021 so Twitter will have to accelerate revenue if it hopes to grow profits at all.

Meanwhile Facebook should continue to mint profits which not only affords Facebook the ability to reinvest in its core platform and buy back stock but also invest in new technologies setting up its next chapter. For instance Facebook's Oculus AR platform could be a future growth driver and the company just unveiled a new wrist-based wearable that could become an AR-based virtual computing platform of the future.

Stay with the safer bet

Whether or not Facebook can make a disruptive breakthrough in augmented reality is still an open question. However even absent any new business Facebook's better value and more solid profits stand to hold up better in the rising rate environment than Twitter's hoped-for growth. I'd expect the relative performance of these two companies to reverse in 2021. Today Facebook's the choice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1YWxzaG9ja2Vycy5jb20vcm9ibG94LWVnZy1odW50LWV2ZW50LTIwMjEtaW50by10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1nYW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roblox Egg Hunt Event 2021: Into The Metaverse Release Date Games,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1YWxzaG9ja2Vycy5jb20vcm9ibG94LWVnZy1odW50LWV2ZW50LTIwMjEtaW50by10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1nYW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Europe’s biggest insurer is discussing its options with potential advisers said the people asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. While Allianz views Hartford as one of the remaining property and casualty insurance targets with scale in the U.S. it’s also reluctant to enter into a pricey bidding war with Chubb because of a lack of synergies between the two the people said.

Deliberations are in an early stage and Allianz could likely decide against pursuing a deal which would be transformational for the German financial giant that has mostly stayed away from mega transactions the people said.

Representatives for Allianz and Hartford declined to comment on the story.

In spite of its dominance in Europe Allianz has a relatively small footprint compared with Chubb or other peers in the world’s largest economy. A combination of Chubb and Hartford could further marginalize the German insurer in the U.S. which like other insurance companies is battling low interest rates slowing growth and Covid-related business costs.

Among other European insurers Zurich Insurance Group AG isn’t currently considering such a deal according to a person familiar with the matter. The Swiss insurer agreed in December to buy MetLife Inc.’s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion. A spokesperson for Zurich declined to comment.

Hartford rejected Chubb’s proposal earlier in the week putting pressure on Evan Greenberg to sweeten the offer. A post-bid jump in its stock has pushed Hartford’s market value to $24 billion as of Friday’s close. Chubb has a market cap of $71.9 billion while Allianz is worth 87.9 billion euros ($103.7 billion).

Mergers and acquisitions among property and casualty insurers have been active in recent years. It’s the biggest sector within insurance and life coverage has fallen out of favor with many groups due to low interest rates and higher capital requirements.

Allianz’s Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has largely avoided major acquisitions since taking the helm. Still he’s been seeking new avenues of growth including a 2.5 billion euro deal in the past week to acquire Aviva Plc’s Polish life insurance business.

The German company did pursue a takeover of property and casualty insurer XL Group Ltd. in 2018 before losing out to France’s Axa SA which paid over $15 billion for the asset.

U.S. Footprint

Allianz has a life-insurance business in the U.S. and is mainly serving large companies in the country in the property and casualty space. It also owns U.S. bond asset manager Pacific Investment Management Co. or Pimco. Buying Hartford could help expand the business with smaller corporations and any deal could also help make consolidation easier in the future through synergies.

Among the financing options for such a deal include a capital increase raising debt and offering stock. The insurer also has excess cash and could lower the amount of its annual dividend or buyback. In November Allianz canceled a share buyback program that it had suspended earlier in the year as the hit from the Covid-19 pandemic continued to mount.

There’s also history with Hartford. The U.S. company turned to Allianz for capital in 2008 agreeing to pay 10% on $1.75 billion of debt as capital markets froze.

Crown Resorts Australia’s largest casino operator and majority owned by billionaire heir James Packer is mulling an acquisition offer of $6.2 billion from US private equity giant Blackstone.

The Melbourne-based Crown confirmed this week it received an unsolicited non-binding and indicative proposal to acquire all its shares at an indicative price of A$11.85 ($9.04) per share. Blackstone already held a 9.99% stake in Crown which it acquired from Melco Resorts and Entertainment for $8.15 per share in April 2020.

The New York-based group with $619 billion worth of assets under management bought the Bellagio casino resort in Las Vegas (pictured) for $4.25 billion in 2019. In January 2020 Blackstone entered a $4.6 billion joint venture to bring into its fold two additional MGM Resorts International properties on the Strip MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

The non-family Crown board said it had “not yet formed a view on the merits of the proposal”. The four directors were starting their assessment with the involvement of stakeholders regulators and legal and financial advisers. The board said it did not need to take any action regarding the bid and there was no certainty a deal would be made. Share prices rocketed 21% on the day of Crown’s Blackstone announcement.

James Packer (pictured above) 53 is the largest shareholder at 36% in Crown but stepped down for its board and resigned from the board of his family company Consolidated Press Holdings in 2018 to recover from mental health issues. Packer reportedly indicated this week he will follow the Crown board’s decision on the Blackstone proposal.

Packer is worth $3.5 billion according to Forbes. With his elder sister investor and philanthropist Gretel Packer 55 he is the only son of the late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer (pictured left). He is the grandson of the late Sir Frank Packer (pictured below) who founded Australian Consolidated Press in 1936 long since absorbed by other media companies.

James Packer may welcome a lucrative exit from Crown Resorts. Australian regulators ruled in February the operator was not fit to hold a gaming licence in Sydney citing money laundering and organised crime links. Five directors resigned from the Crown board. The states of Victoria and Western Australia will open their own inquiries into Crown in the coming months.

Due to Australia’s Covid-19 restrictions in March 2020 Crown was directed to close for an extended period its gaming activities and a significant part of its non-gaming operations at its integrated Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth resorts for the first time in the company’s history. The temporary closures were reflected in its dire 2020 finances with an 80% plunge in net profits to $79.5 million ($60.6 million) from a profit of A$401.8 million ($306.4 million) a year earlier.

In addition to its Melbourne and Perth resorts Crown developments include the Crown Sydney Hotel Resort and the One Queensbridge site in Melbourne. Crown owns and operates Crown Aspinalls in London and holds a 50% equity interest in the UK-based casino-operating Aspers Group co-created with the multi-millionaire Aspinall family.

Crown owns a 20% interest in the restaurant and hotel chain Nobu. It has interests in digital businesses including the wholly owned Betfair Australasia an 85% stake in DGN Games and 50% stake in Chill Gaming.

Next-gen hotel heir David Marriott to succeed father Bill Marriott

US hotel heir David Marriott has been elected as a director on the board of Marriott International in anticipation of succeeding his father as chairman in 2022.

Marriott (pictured left) 47 president of the company’s US full-service hotel division is the son of JW “Bill” Marriott Jr (pictured below) 89 and grandson of late founder J Willard Marriott.

The election of Marriott and Horacio Rozanski 53 president and chief executive at consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton swelled the board’s membership to 13 nine of whom are independent.

After consultation the company announced in May 2020 that Bill Marriott planned to transition from serving as executive chairman and chairman of the board to the role of chairman emeritus in 2022. The next-gen Marriott will assume the chairmanship on an unspecified date in 2022 and would step down from his presidency at the end of April 2021.

The appointments followed the loss of Arne Sorenson (pictured right) who died of cancer in February 2021 at the age of 62. Sorenson was the first non-family member to lead the company when he became chief executive in 2012. Praised as “exceptional” by Bill Marriott Sorenson led the transformation of the family business into the largest hotel chain in the world which involved the $13 billion acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

The new team will need to continue to manage the seismic impacts of Covid-19 restrictions on the hotel business. Marriott International reported a loss of $164 million in the fourth-quarter of 2020 compared to a profit of $279 million in the same quarter in 2019.

The third-generation David Marriott youngest son of four children joined Marriott International in 1999 and worked his way up through several operational roles. As president of the company’s US full-service hotel division he was responsible for overseeing more than 330 hotels operating under 14 brands in 34 states and French Polynesia. While he worked as chief operations officer for the brand’s Americas eastern region from 2010 to 2018 he oversaw the US integration of Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

He is a trustee of the J Willard and Alice S Marriott Foundation. The family charity co-created a hospitality career development fund in Sorenson’s name.

“Like me David grew up in the hospitality business” Bill Marriott said.

“While having Marriott as his last name opened the first door for him he has proven throughout his 21 years with the company that he is a disciplined operator a thoughtful collaborator with our owners and franchisees and a passionate steward of our culture. The board will benefit from his experience and insights.”

Based in Bethesda Maryland Marriott International encompasses more than 7600 properties under 30 leading brands spanning 133 countries and territories. Marriott also operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts around the world.

Grosvenor Estate appoints new family office head in management revamp

The Duke of Westminster says the new management structure of his family’s Grosvenor Estate including a new family office head will help shape long-term success in its commercial and social activities.

The Grosvenor Estate announced the promotion of Nicholas Dobbs rural estates’ director to the role of head of the Grosvenor Family Office from 1 April reporting to Mark Preston executive trustee and chief executive of the estate. The Grosvenor Family Office is responsible for the management and enhancement of environmentally sensitive habitats within the Grosvenor family’s rural estates and for supporting their philanthropic activities through the Westminster Foundation.

Chaired by Michael McLintock a new investment committee was formed comprising Grosvenor’s trustees the newly created role of chief investment officer the estate’s chief financial officer and two independent advisers. The committee will be responsible for capital allocation as well as for strategy and performance of the estate’s commercial activities in international urban property food and agriculture and in financial investments.

Family principal Hugh Grosvenor (pictured above) 30 became the 7th Duke of Westminster upon the death of his father Gerald Grosvenor (pictured left) aged 64 in 2016.

“These changes will help us shape our long-term success building on our international growth of the past 50 years and meeting the many and varied challenges of the next 50” the billionaire millennial aristocrat said.

“I am confident we will continue to adapt and change as we have many times in the past to make a sustainable and meaningful impact on the communities we support and work alongside.”

The duke personally gave £10 million ($13.8 million) in April 2020 following an initial donation of £2.5million ($3.4 million) in March 2020 to support the United Kingdom’s health service medical research and development and charities to help the country’s long-term recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL21hci8yNy9leHBlcnRzLXNlZS1vcHRpbWlzbS1pbi12aXJnaW4taG90ZWxzLW9wZW5pbmctaW4tbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts see optimism in Virgin Hotels opening in Las Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) - Opening a new casino resort during a pandemic isn’t ideal but Virgin Hotels Las Vegas may have found a sweet spot with the timing of its launch.

After delaying its opening twice the off-Strip property opened Thursday.

Industry watchers say Las Vegas casino operators still face pandemic-related challenges but the operating environment today is much better than where Las Vegas stood just weeks ago.

“The prospects for summer look increasingly positive - with vaccination levels increasing and plenty of pent-up demand from people looking to put the pandemic behind them” Jonathan Day an associate professor of hospitality and tourism management at Purdue University told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “It’s a sign of optimism in the recovery that Virgin is committed to opening.”

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas initially planned to open in the fall after a $200 million renovation of the former Hard Rock Hotel. Plans were pushed back to January and delayed once again before Thursday’s opening date was announced.

Now Las Vegas is starting to show significant signs of recovery.

In recent earnings calls heads of casino operators Caesars Entertainment Inc. and MGM Resorts International revealed that bookings were increasing. Foot traffic on the Strip is on the rise. Casino floor operators can now operate at 50% capacity for the first time in months. And various surveys show that Americans are itching to take a leisure trip again as COVID-19 case numbers drop and vaccines roll out.

“Considering we had opening dates scheduled for late 2020 and early 2021 ultimately we feel good about our March 25 official opening date” said Richard “Boz” Bosworth president and CEO of J.C. Hospitality owner of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

“There are positive signs pointing to another great Las Vegas comeback” he said. “No city does it better than Las Vegas and we are excited to open our doors once again to our team members and welcome locals and tourists back to the city.”

Industry watchers expect to see Las Vegas tourism take off this summer after more than a year of lockdowns and strict operating restrictions.

“I think we’re going to have a killer summer. There’s pent-up demand to travel especially domestically” said Finley Cotrone an assistant professor in residence at UNLV’s college of hospitality. She called Virgin Hotels’ opening “really good timing.”

UNLV assistant professor of hospitality Amanda Belarmino said it didn’t make sense to open a new property back in the fall. At that time operators were closing amenities and some properties closed midweek because of lack of demand. Those properties have just started returning to full-week operations.

“There’s still a lot of uncertainty but we’re in the most optimistic place we’ve been since it started. So it makes sense (to open) now” Belarmino said.

She added that the reopening timeline is good for the city as well as the property. A new property going online should help drive foot traffic and bring back hundreds of workers.

Bosworth said Virgin Hotels is putting about 2000 local hospitality employees back to work. Some used to work at the Hard Rock.

Day thinks March will still be a challenging month to open a hotel but that the timing will allow Virgin Hotels to prepare for an influx of summer travelers.

“Opening now will give the opportunity to come up to speed as demand increases” he said in an email.

David Givens vice president of hotel operations for Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said he was looking forward to the opening.

“Everyone just wants to open” he said citing a busy recent weekends on the Strip. “It makes sense to get it open and then with the restrictions easing I think we’ll do OK.”

The property’s opening date does have downsides industry experts say.

For one Virgin Hotels’ doors opened a week after the initial weekend of this year’s NCAA Tournament one of the biggest annual events in Las Vegas.

“I would have opened early March. I would have wanted to get all of those kinks out for the first week of March Madness” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive. “The demand for that week is going to be tremendous and that March Madness crowd fits right in with Virgin.”

While the increased foot traffic during the first weekend of March Madness may have been a boon for Virgin Hotels it’s unclear how many travelers would have made a stop at the off-Strip property.

Sports betting partner Betfred is not yet licensed in Nevada and the property’s sportsbook isn’t set to open until the summer pending regulatory approval.

Cotrone also pointed out that while case numbers are down Virgin Hotels is still opening in the midst of a global pandemic. She voiced concern for some front-line workers especially knowing that some travelers will fly in from states that have dropped mask mandates.

“I do worry about our front-line employees as our guests come in (from) different states (and some are) convinced that the pandemic has passed” she said. “We still need to have these precautions with masks. Our front-line employees carry the brunt of that challenge.”

Bosworth told the Review-Journal that the safety of Virgin Hotels’ staff partners and guests is a top property.

“We would like to have brought all our team members back sooner but with the increase in COVID-19 cases and the restrictions that were in place it simply was not safe or profitable for us to open the doors at those earlier dates” he said.

“So after everything has been said and done I think everything worked out the way it was meant to be” he said. “The resort is primed and ready to kick off the recovery of the Las Vegas economy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vSGF3YWlpLVRyYXZlbC9KZWZmcmV5LVllZGxpbi1uYW1lZC1ob3RlbC1tYW5hZ2VyLWF0LUhpbHRvbi1IYXdhaWlhbi1WaWxsYWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeffrey Yedlin named hotel manager at Hilton Hawaiian Village,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Hawaii-Travel/Jeffrey-Yedlin-named-hotel-manager-at-Hilton-Hawaiian-Village on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vSGF3YWlpLVRyYXZlbC9KZWZmcmV5LVllZGxpbi1uYW1lZC1ob3RlbC1tYW5hZ2VyLWF0LUhpbHRvbi1IYXdhaWlhbi1WaWxsYWdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

Need for Chips Sales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Automotives Computing Revenue $500B Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Note: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February. Figures for Samsung include its System LSI unit; for Globalfoundries include the manufacturing unit acquired from IBM; for PSMC its foundry business only. Source: TrendForce

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The best cloud storage offers a refreshing way for modern businesses to manage their data both conveniently and cost effectively.

Of course there’s more than one company offering cloud storage services to businesses that need it. Depending on things like storage space data encryption and server infrastructure your choices will vary greatly. The two largest contenders in the cloud storage space Google and Microsoft are household names to anyone acquainted with the modern tech industry. But which among these two packs the most bang for your buck?

In this article we pit Google Drive against Microsoft OneDrive in a one-on-one showdown to find out which can be considered among the best cloud storage providers. We’ll examine their features performance support and pricing in order to come to our decision.

Google Drive: high-performance integrated storage

Google Drive's wealth of useful tools elevate it beyond cloud storage. Slick apps and tight integration with Google Workspace's products make it easy to fit into workflows while seamless integration with third-party apps and swift performance make it an easy sell to businesses.



Microsoft OneDrive: collaborative storage and software

Microsoft OneDrive provides tight integration with Windows and Microsoft 365 allowing for real-time file collaboration and automatic backups. Its straightforward and intuitive interface requires little guidance and the comprehensive and responsive support available is able to assist with anything more complex.



Google Drive vs Microsoft OneDrive: Features

Google Drive is the heart and center of Google Workspace the online productivity suite (Image credit: Google)

Google Drive is a cloud-based storage platform that forms the heart and center of Google Workspace the company’s online productivity suite for businesses. It offers file sharing and synchronization features with the added ability to create store manage and share various types of documents across the entirety of Google Workspace.

Google Drive serves as a unified interface to access much of the company’s online service infrastructure allowing you to store and manage files across apps such as Docs Sheets and Slides. You can even code your own apps to use with Drive.

Google Drive also offers a downloadable client that can be used to sync a specified folder right from your desktop. Conversely you can also sync files across the cloud storage to your desktop for offline access which is useful in areas with spotty internet access. Drive is a multi-platform service with downloadable apps for smartphones tablets laptops and desktops which can be used to sync files back and forth between these devices.

While it’s every bit as solid offering as Microsoft OneDrive Google Drive does lack in familiarity. Users who have been taking advantage of Microsoft’s own productivity suite including such programs as Word Excel and Powerpoint will find it much easier to just stick to OneDrive.

OneDrive works in conjunction with Office for collaborative file sharing (Image credit: Microsoft)

OneDrive offers very much the same file syncing and collaboration features as Google Drive but it has been designed to work in conjunction with the former’s own productivity suite Microsoft Office.

Users who are more familiar with an offline work atmosphere will feel right at home with Office what with the company’s productivity platform offering downloadable apps across Windows and macOS. This is unlike Google Workspace whose applications can only be accessed through a web browser window on desktop computers.

Contrary to popular misconception Microsoft OneDrive offers real-time collaboration features that work just as well as Google Drive’s. Users can have their documents across Office synced in real-time with various devices and collaborate on projects with several other users at once.

At the end of the day Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive offer similar features across their cloud storage platforms. Even in terms of security their offerings are mostly similar with two-factor authentication and restricted file-sharing options across the two platforms.

For users the only deciding factor here seems to be which of the two companies’ productivity platforms they are most familiar with. Microsoft Office takes the cake on raw processing power. Google Workspace on the other hand is the best for real-time office collaboration with up to a hundred users.

Performance

Microsoft OneDrive is an offline productivity suite with a slightly larger footprint than Google Drive (Image credit: Microsoft)

In terms of performance and speed Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive leave the same footprint on your system which is next to negligible. Both of them offer downloadable clients that can be used to sync a specified folder on your computer to the cloud while also offering downloadable apps for smartphones and tablets. These clients and applications are really lightweight with no storage or processing requirements to speak of.

One thing worth noting however is that Microsoft Office - being a largely offline productivity suite with software that needs to be installed on your computer’s hard drive - takes up slightly more resources when compared to Google Workspace whose applications are online-based and can be accessed through your preferred web browser.

Support

Google Drive claims the upper hand on support (Image credit: Google)

Google Drive comes packed with a state-of-the-art multilingual support system that can be contacted via phone chat or email. You will also have access to a knowledge center with guides and how-tos to help get you started. There’s even a community forum where you can ask questions of other members and Google staff should the need arise.

The typical response time for company support is less than one business day. With a paid subscription to Google Workspace this waiting period is reduced even further.

Microsoft OneDrive support can be contacted through the company website: either via the community forums the chatbot or the general support hotline. While queues are slightly longer and you can expect to have to wait a little here a paid subscription does guarantee that your query will be addressed sooner.

The community forum is particularly active and frequented by members of the company’s customer service team.

When it comes to customer service Google Drive claims a slight upper hand over Microsoft OneDrive with its tier-based support system and faster response time. However both cloud storage services do a pretty good job providing support to their customers.

Pricing

OneDrive offers more options in terms of pricing (Image credit: Microsoft)

You can upgrade your free plan with Google Drive by purchasing a subscription to Google One or Google Workspace. Either service comes with worthwhile enhancements to your cloud storage experience with higher storage space more features and priority support.

Google One is an all-in-one subscription service for individual users that increases your storage space with Gmail Photos and Drive. It costs $2.99 per month for 200GB of storage; $9.99 for 2TB; $99.99 for 10TB; $199.99 for 20TB; and $299.99 for 30TB. These plans also come with premium support and the ability to share your subscription with family members.

Google Workspace on the other hand is a cloud-based productivity enhancement platform for workplaces. It is primarily meant for businesses and consists of Gmail Drive Meet Chat Docs Sheets Slides and more. Subscriptions start at $6 per user a month for the Business Starter plan and go up to $20 per user a month for Enterprise Standard.

With Microsoft OneDrive there are a lot more options when it comes to pricing. OneDrive Basic which comes with free storage worth 5GB is free. This is followed by 100GB of storage for $1.99 per user per month.

A subscription to Microsoft 365 which also includes the company’s entire productivity suite for individuals offers 1TB of storage for $6.99 per month and 5TB of storage for $9.99 per month. There is also Microsoft 365 Business Standard which allows you to have multiple users per plan for $15 per month per user with 1TB of storage per user.

Finally there’s OneDrive for Business. It offers two separate plans that allow your business to access the company’s cloud storage service but not its productivity platform. They cost $5 per user a month for 1TB and $10 per user a month for unlimited storage respectively. These prices allow unlimited users on the same plan.

Google Drive vs Microsoft OneDrive: Verdict

There’s no clear winner between Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. It all comes down to your company’s workflow (online or offline) and your preferred software ecosystem (Google or Microsoft). Depending on the nature of your business and the familiarity of your workforce either solution may be the best choice for your team.

If you're wondering which one you should buy we don't blame you. The Surface Pro 7+ was released after the Pro 7 and is undeniably an upgrade. But there is a catch: it is only being sold to business users through IT sites like CDW Staples Advantage and Verizon. That might turn the everyday consumer off and make them consider getting the aging Surface Pro 7 at their local Best Buy or on Amazon.

While it's already a year old the Surface Pro 7 remains a good option if you need a portable tablet that can be used as a laptop. Better yet unlike the Surface Pro 7+ the consumer model can be found at a heavy discount at various retailers. So do you go with value or raw performance? We're going to break down the similarities and differences between these tablets then help you decide which one to buy.

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Similarities

This won't be a typical face-off where we go through each round looking at how the two systems fare against each other. That's because the Surface Pro 7+ and Surface Pro 7 share many features and components.

So before we go through the differences let's talk about the similarities between these tablets. First the Surface Pro 7+ and Surface Pro 7 use the same accessories: the Type Cover keyboard and Surface Pen stylus. These aren't included with the purchase of either unit (you can however find Surface Pro 7 bundles) so put aside about $200 if you intend on buying both accessories.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The designs of these tablets are almost identical; we'll spotlight the few differences between them below -- just know that the Surface Pro 7+ isn't much of a redesign. These Surface models also have the same front and rear-camera setup and dual speakers. They even share the same ports (USB-C Surface Connect USB Type-A headphone jack) though the Surface Pro 7+ has a SIM card slot for 4G LTE .

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Value

Having been on the market for more than a year the Surface Pro 7 has enjoyed considerable price drops and deals. As I write this the Surface Pro 7 with an Intel Core i5 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD costs $699 or $200 below its retail price. Opting for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $899 or $300 off the list price.

Still the Surface Pro 7 can get pretty expensive. The tablet costs $1299 (originally $1499) when configured with a Core i7 CPU 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Pushing the storage up to a 512GB SSD brings the price to $1699.

You won't find much in the way of deals for the Surface Pro 7+. Whereas the Surface Pro 7 is sold at well-known retailers like Amazon Best Buy and B&H Photo Video the Surface Pro 7+ can be purchased directly through Microsoft or at IT stores like CDW Connection or Staples Advantage.

The base Surface Pro 7+ costs $899 and comes with an Intel Core i3 CPU 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. We recommend spending at least another $100 on the Core i5 model (adding LTE costs another $150).

The Wi-Fi version of the Surface Pro 7+ with a Core i5 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD costs $1299 or $400 more than the equivalent Surface Pro 7. You will need to spend $1599 to get a Core i7 CPU 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Again this is $300 more than the consumer version. Upgrading to a 512GB SSD raises the price to $1999.

Winner: Surface Pro 7

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Design

These two tablets look identical from afar. Get close and you'll spot minor differences that give the Surface Pro 7+ an edge. The newer tablet has a door under the kickstand for accessing the SSD .

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

You can easily swap the storage drive out using a SIM tool (those little needles that come with your smartphone). Speaking of SIM tools the Surface Pro 7+ also has a SIM slot because it supports 4G LTE whereas the Surface Pro 7 relies on a Wi-Fi connection.

That's it. Those are the only exterior differences between the Surface Pro 7 and Pro 7+. They're both slim lightweight magnesium tablets with a flexible kickstand and a connection for the optional Type Cover keyboard attachment. The chunky bezels on the Surface Pro 7+ are no thinner than they are on the Pro 7 so let's hope the upcoming Surface Pro 8 gets a visual refresh.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Display

There isn't much to say here. The Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 7+ both have 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824-pixel touchscreen displays . Based on our testing Microsoft is using similar panels on these systems.

That's a good thing because the screens are bright vivid and detailed. They're as good for watching movies and TV shows as they are for crunching numbers so you'll be happy using these slates for business and leisure alike.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Our testing spotted a few differences between the screens. Covering 75.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamut the Surface Pro 7+ is more vivid than the Surface Pro 7 (68.7%). Conversely the Surface Pro 7+'s display reached a maximum average of 358 nits of brightness making it dimmer than the Surface Pro 7 (395 nits).

It's possible Microsoft is using the same panels and that these differences are within the margin of error to account for any manufacturing variances. Whatever the case you're getting a really nice display regardless of which tablet you choose.

Winner: Draw

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Performance

The biggest difference between the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 7+ is the engine powering these tablets. The Surface Pro 7+ uses upgraded 11th Gen (Tiger Lake) Intel Core CPUs that deliver faster speeds than the 10th Gen chips in the Surface Pro 7.

Scoring a 4825 on the Geekbench 5.3 overall performance test the Surface Pro 7+ topped the Surface Pro 7 (4443) by around 8.5%. Both tablets beat the premium laptop average (4160) so you can expect zippy speeds from whichever tablet you're using.

(Image credit: Future)

In our real-world test the Surface Pro 7+ needed 23 minutes and 41 seconds to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution using the Handbrake app. That is a full 10 minutes faster than the Surface Pro 7 (32:47).

The 256GB SSD in our Surface Pro 7+ unit is sluggish compared with other products in this price range. That said it topped the Surface Pro 7. The Pro 7+'s storage drive took 1 minute and 17 seconds to convert a 25GB file equating to a 348.3 megabytes per second transfer rate. The Surface Pro 7's 256GB SSD puttered at a lowly 267.9 MBps. Both are far slower than the 606.1 average for premium laptops.

With integrated Iris Xe graphics  the Pro 7+ will be fine for basic 3D modeling or to run older games. It gets a nice boost over the Iris Plus graphics in the Surface Pro 7 but as we found in our testing neither tablet is meant for running graphics-demanding apps.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Battery life

Another area where the Surface Pro 7+ topples its consumer sibling is battery life . We were relieved to see some improvements considering the Surface Pro 7 struggled on our endurance test lasting only 7 hours and 30 minutes.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The Surface Pro 7+ does better powering down after 8 hours 49 minutes but that is still less than what we expect from a modern premium device and it's considerably worse than the 10 hour and 5-minute category average.

Winner: Surface Pro 7+

Surface Pro 7 vs. Surface Pro 7+: Which is best?

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The Surface Pro 7+ is the better of these two tablets but that doesn't mean we would recommend it. Price should be a major factor in deciding between these two slates. As it stands the Surface Pro 7 is up to $400 cheaper than a Surface Pro 7+ with comparable specs. Unless you absolutely need a swappable SSD or 4G LTE connectivity we recommend saving some money and going with the Surface Pro 7.

Yes the Surface Pro 7+ brings faster performance but you probably won't notice much of a speed boost in your day-to-day workflow. And while the business-oriented tablet has longer battery life the extra hour or so of runtime isn't worth the added cost in our book. If money isn't a factor and you're deciding between these two go with the Surface Pro 7+ for various albeit minor advantages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L3doYXRzLW5leHQtZnJvbS1taWNyb3NvZnQtd2luZG93cy0xMC1hbmQtc3VyZmFjZS1pbi0yMDIxL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L3doYXRzLW5leHQtZnJvbS1taWNyb3NvZnQtd2luZG93cy0xMC1hbmQtc3VyZmFjZS1pbi0yMDIxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's next from Microsoft Windows 10 and Surface in 2021,"In 2021 Microsoft is planning to release exciting new Surface products and software updates for Windows 10. This includes Windows 10X Windows 10 Sun Valley Update Windows Cloud PC Surface Laptop 4 Surface Duo 2 and more.

Windows 10 21H1

The first update of the year is Windows 10's Spring 2021 Update ""21H1"" and it's essentially based on version 2004 and version 20H2 and it'll be delivered via an enablement package. It's not a massive release and it does not contain any noticeable changes.

This update comes with quality improvements that should improve the overall user experience. For example you can expect improvements to Windows Hello and Group policies.

There's a possibility that some of the existing features will be improved using 'Windows Feature Experience Packs' which is a new way to update and improve the OS without major feature updates.

If you're interested you can download and install the update today. Version 21H1 is currently available to those in the Insider program. The easiest and safest way to download and install the next feature update is to join the Windows Insider program and enroll in the Release Preview Channel.

If you're a member of the Windows Insider Program head to the Windows Update page click on the Windows Insider program settings and select the ""Release Preview channel"" to install the update.

While the first update of the year will be a minor release the second update is said to ship with significant improvements.

Windows 10 21H2 'Sun Valley'

After the Spring update Microsoft is planning to launch Windows 10 21H2 update for Windows 10 and it's currently scheduled to land in the fall of 2021 with a new user interface refresh codenamed ""Sun Valley.""

According to people familiar with the company's this update will bring rounded corners to the Start Menu Action Center and other areas of the operating system.

In addition to these new fancy features you will now see a ""Paste as plain text"" option alongside pin and delete. This new feature will allow you to paste the clipboard's text content without its original formatting (font color size etc.).

Windows 10 Paste as Text clipboard feature

With version 21H2 Microsoft is also slowly migrating legacy apps or tools into modern versions found in the Settings.

For example Microsoft is working on a new Disk Management tool to simplify the disk partition and volume management process.

Modern Disk Management feature

Other new features coming to Windows 10 21H2 Sun Valley include DNS-over-HTTPS new Battery settings improved GPU performance settings and new Task Manager information columns.

Windows 10X

Windows 10X was originally scheduled to launch in Spring but new reports suggest that the operating system has been delayed again and it's not expected until the second half of the year.

Windows 10X

As you may be aware Windows 10X is a new streamlined version of Windows designed for security and performance. In addition to a new user interface this version of Windows also comes with new security features including ""Anti-theft protection"" designed to prevent thieves from wiping and re-using stolen devices.

Cloud PC

Microsoft has been busy working on a new virtualized Windows PC experience called 'Cloud PC' that will allow users and enterprise customers to run their personal desktop in the cloud and access it remotely using their devices such as Windows Android iOS and web browser.

Cloud PC tiers

Cloud PC is likely to be a part of Windows 10X to enable Win32 apps streaming support for enterprise customers.

It's important to note that Cloud PC has been designed for enterprise customers and it will be offered as a paid service at least initially.

Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro 8

In addition to the new Windows 10 versions Microsoft is also planning to announce the Surface Laptop 4 with Intel and AMD options. Surface Laptop 4 would come with AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors and Intel Tiger Lake-U CPUs according to leaked benchmarks.

Unfortunately Microsoft is not planning to change the Surface Laptop lineup's design with the next update. The design improvements are now expected in 2021.

Surface Pro 8 on the other hand is expected to use a new design and up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of internal SSD storage but it won't hit the shelves until autumn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2xhcHRvcHMtcGMvbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8tc3RvcC1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtZnJvbS11c2luZy11cC1hbGwtdGhlLXJhbS1vbi15b3VyLXBjLTcxNjE2OTMyNTY2OTU1Lmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbGFwdG9wcy1wYy9uZXdzL2hvdy10by1zdG9wLW1pY3Jvc29mdC10ZWFtcy1mcm9tLXVzaW5nLXVwLWFsbC10aGUtcmFtLW9uLXlvdXItcGMtNzE2MTY5MzI1NjY5NTUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to stop Microsoft Teams from using too much RAM on your PC,"As the pandemic began to spread and more offices opted for a remote working environment last year collaboration and communication tools became the norm. Some older players like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet that existed before the pandemic also opened up access to the public. While there's no official app for Meet so far Microsoft Teams has apps for almost every modern platform.

Like most modern cross-platform apps built to work on Windows macOS and Linux Microsoft Teams is based on the open-source Electron project. Electron is based on Chromium which means every app that runs on Electron needs to also load the Chromium code and associated libraries in order to function properly.

However Electron apps can sometimes suffer from severe memory issues similar to the complaints that have plagued Chrome users over the years. However there are ways to mitigate the memory consumption issue on Teams and you can use these tips for other Electron-based apps that have memory usage issues too.

1. Uninstall and reinstall the Teams app for desktop

Unlike apps like WhatsApp that currently only work on one device Teams stores all of your chats on Microsoft's servers so they can be accessed from multiple devices and from the web. This means that even if you uninstall and reinstall Teams all your chats will still remain available when you log in again. You can uninstall Teams from the Windows ‘Add and Remove Programs' section and reinstall by downloading the latest version from Microsoft's site.

2. Clear the Teams' app's cache

Performing an uninstall and then reinstalling Teams may only be a temporary fix. If the memory usage issues are back after re-installing and rebooting your PC then you can shut down the Teams app and navigate to the C:\\ drive and open your AppData folder. Open the Microsoft folder and then enter the teams folder. You must delete the folders titled Cache GPU Cache blob_storage databases IndexedDB and Local Storage. You can then reboot your PC and check if the app continues to use up RAM.

3. Disable GPU acceleration

Depending on what sort of computer you have at home Microsoft Teams can make use of features like graphics acceleration by loading some user interface elements with a dedicated graphics card. While this can come in handy it can also cause issues on hardware that has not been configured properly (for e.g. lack of proper drivers) so it is worth disabling GPU hardware acceleration in the Microsoft Teams settings section.

A new entry in the company’s product roadmap describes an imminent upgrade to the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center which will allow administrators to train classifiers that “detect threat targeted harassment and profanities”.

These trainable classifiers will be able to detect abuse in a range of languages including English French Spanish German Portugeuese Italian Japanese and Chinese.

The new feature is still technically under development but is set to arrive within the next handful of days.

Toxic working environment

While the use of swear words in jest is a relatively harmless foible many employees have suffered genuine abuse at the hands of colleagues.

The arrival of collaboration tools has made it easier than ever to communicate at work but they have also created another avenue (beyond email ) by which staff can abuse one another often without the knowledge of management or fellow co-workers.

This problem has likely only been exacerbated by the rise of remote working  which has practically eliminated all face-to-face interaction between employees in favor of virtual forms of communication.

The Microsoft 365 Compliance Center is designed primarily to help businesses manage their compliance needs in relation to information governance. However with the new trainable classifiers the Compliance Center can be put to work to identify and address improper conduct as well.

“A classifier learns how to identify a type of content by looking at hundreds of examples of the content you’re interested in classifying” explains Microsoft in a blog post . “The classifier then makes predictions as to whether any given item falls into the category you’re building.”

The harassment classifier is designed to detect abuse targeted at an individual or group based on race ethnicity gender sexual orientation age and disability. The profanity and threat classifiers are a little simpler built to detect common swear words and aggressive language.

However Microsoft is keen to emphasize that the new filters should not comprise the entirety of a business’ efforts to stamp out abuse.

“While the classifiers may assist your organization in monitoring offensive and other language used the classifiers do not address consequences of such language and are not intended to provide your organization’s sole means of monitoring or responding to such language” said the firm."

The below interview transcript has been edited for clarity.

Lauren Richardson: Hi I'm Lauren —

Hanne Winarsky: — and I'm Hanne and this is Bio Eats World our show where we talk about all the ways biology is technology.

Richardson: This week in place of Journal Club we have a very special episode featuring Stéphane Bancel CEO of Moderna in conversation with you Hanne and a16z General Partner Jorge Conde. And we're talking about the COVID-19 vaccine right?

Advertisement

Winarsky: Yep that's exactly right. The conversation is a really incredible dive into how they developed one of the world's most awaited vaccines. Bancel describes everything from the moment he first realized they could make a COVID-19 vaccine with their technology to the day he heard the first data on how effective it was in humans.

In this episode which is airing just after the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting makes its recommendation to the FDA Stéphane tells the story of not just how the vaccine got made but everything about the machine behind this vaccine: the fundamentally new platform and mRNA technology behind the vaccine's development.

Richardson: This vaccine is really one of the first medicines that is part of a bigger transformation from a world of pipettes and lab benches to a world of industrialized machines making medicines. We used to grow our vaccines but now we can print them — getting them to patients faster and more efficiently than ever.

Winarsky: Bancel describes what it took to go from pathogen to design to clinical grade product; how mRNA works (in a chocolate mousse metaphor!) and what makes it different from old vaccine technology; why exactly this is such a transformative shift in the world of drug development; and where this technology will go next.

Jorge Conde: Stéphane could you have imagined a year ago that mRNA as a concept would be a household name?

Stéphane Bancel: No and we had a lot of things going on in vaccines in cancer in autoimmune disease in cardiology in rare genetic disease but I had no idea that 2020 was going to look that way.

Conde: So if we flashback to January of 2020 can you talk a little bit about the process that you went through to realize that you potentially had a technology that could be a solution for this emerging pandemic?

Advertisement

Bancel: Yes. So I've been working in infectious disease all my career and I've developed an eye for outbreaks. So one of the things I do is read The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times every morning as I get up. And between Christmas and New Year of last year I noticed an article saying that there is a new pathogen agent in China giving pneumonia-like symptoms — that's all it says.

And so I sent an email to somebody working for Tony Fauci Barney Graham who we've been collaborating with for years designing several vaccines together. And I say ""Hey Barney have you seen the new pathogen in China? What is it? Is it a bacteria or is it a virus?"" And he replied to me a few hours later and he says ""It's not a bacteria it seems to be a virus but we don't know which one yet.""

And a day or two after Barney sent me an email and said ""We learned from our contacts in China it's not flu it's not RSV we don't know what it is yet."" And then another day goes by and he says ""It's a coronavirus but it's not SARS and it's not MERS it's a new coronavirus. Within a day or two the sequence should be put online by the Chinese."" And so on January 11 the Chinese put the sequence online and our team at Moderna used the sequence to design a vaccine. Barney's team did the same thing. And when they shared notes after around 48 hours they'd designed exactly the same vaccine.

Conde: A couple things that are fascinating about this. Number one the fact that the digital copy of this virus came from China before the biological version reached our shores. That's remarkable in and of itself — that we knew what we were dealing with at least digitally in a matter of days thanks to all of the advances of genomic sequencing technology. But the other remarkable advancement in technology here is that from what you just described you were able to design a vaccine based on the digital version of the virus also in a matter of days is it?

Bancel: So right Jorge and this is a piece that I think most people in pharma don't appreciate yet about the power of mRNA technology: In 48 hours we designed and locked down the entire chemical structure of a vaccine.

Hanne Winarsky: Unbelievable.

Bancel: We thought it up in silico we never had access to a physical virus. And we designed the vaccine and we got the two teams at NIH and Moderna because we were so worried about making a mistake in the vaccine design as you can imagine. So we were super happy when the team literally compared notes after two days with exactly the same design for our vaccine. Because it was an outbreak and we knew every day mattered at the same time we started to make clinical grade product to go into a Phase 1.

And what's really remarkable is that the vaccine that was reviewed by the FDA on December 17 it's exactly the same vaccine that our guys designed in January in silico. We never changed one atom it's exactly the same molecule.

Winarsky: So it's the same vaccine that took 48 hours to design?

Bancel: That's going to help hundreds of millions of people next year yeah.

Winarsky: Can we take a moment to just get really simple and talk about how you would define this messenger RNA technology and what you wish the public understood about how mRNA works?

Bancel: Right. Yes so it's a molecule that exists in every one of your cells that is basically the Xerox copy of an instruction of your genome for one gene at a time to make protein in your cell. So the way I would describe it to my two young daughters is: Think about DNA like the hard drive of life where all the instructions of all your 22000-ish genes are stored. And think about it a bit like this is a recipe book that your grandma gave to you before she passed away all your favorite recipes — that's the hard drive that's DNA.

Advertisement

And when you want to make let's say chocolate mousse if you go with your grandma's precious book into the kitchen you're going to damage your book a lot. There's going to be flour and eggs and sugar and after a few times you might not be able to read the recipe anymore. So what evolution has done which is beautiful is to protect the integrity of the instruction in the hard drive in the book.

When the cells want to make one protein like let's say insulin what it is it makes a copy of instruction only of insulin in the book — like my example of chocolate mousse — a Xerox copy and texts it into the kitchen in the cell to make little machine called the ribosome that I described to my kids as little 3D printer that reads the message with the instruction of mRNA and makes a protein by adding one amino acid at a time. So it's a natural molecule that basically carries genetic information to make proteins.

Winarsky: But using mRNA as a tool in the way you've been doing it that wasn't always an obvious approach. So can you talk a little bit about where that began that idea and what it first looked like?

Bancel: Yeah so it's actually very interesting. When mRNA and DNA were discovered actually people in a lot of universities tried to make medicines out of mRNA because it was a very logical use of mRNA. Just copy nature make a synthetic mRNA inject it into animals before humans and it should make a protein. Because of what was known about science at the time — including immunology all the analytical tools that did not exist as part of manufacturing purity and so on — when they injected the mRNA in animals animals would have flu-like symptoms of fever vomiting diarrhea (because mRNA if we remember most viruses in life including COVID-19 is made of mRNA).

Advertisement

And so for evolution mammals have developed mechanisms to recognize foreign mRNA and of course when you inject the mRNA as an idea for a drug that would be a foreign mRNA. And so actually people abandoned and just quit trying to make mRNA as a drug.

What happened in the 2010-2011 timeframe here in Boston is you had a set of academic at Harvard and MIT who started to play with mRNA again because there had been some new discoveries made in the immune system that they believed at the time that if you modify uridine which is one of the four letters of mRNA you can make an mRNA that's immunosilent.

Conde: In some ways when you think about it Moderna doesn't make therapies right? You make constructions that the cell uses to make its own therapies.

Bancel: Yeah correct. We don't give you a vaccine we give you instruction for the cells of healthy people in that case to read the instruction to make one protein of a virus to make it as well as if they had been infected by the real virus to show it to the immune system so their immune system can make a neutralizing antibody and mature it.

So that if later if they get infected by the real virus their immune system is ready to prevent the virus from replicating in their body and getting them sick. What gets people sick in infectious diseases is you have too many copies of a virus.

Conde: Yeah and so I think this is a remarkable thing for a couple of reasons. What you're essentially doing is you've looked at the virus's you know genome and you said ""Okay if I take certain pieces of code from this virus and encode them in mRNA and deliver them to human cells I am basically giving the human cells the instructions to make pieces of the virus that the immune system will train itself on recognize and eventually neutralize."" And in this particular case that target was the spike protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus is that accurate?

Bancel: That's 100% correct Jorge. And the reason that mRNA in my opinion is so powerful is that you totally mimic in a human cell the natural biology of an infection without giving it the virus. We never give a virus to people we give as we said a piece of a virus. In the case of corona because it's a pretty simple virus we believed (and the clinical data have shown in the Phase 3 that we are correct) that one protein of a virus — a very important one the spike protein — if you're able to get a high quality of or a high quantity of neutralizing antibodies you should be protecting people if they become infected with the real virus.

Winarsky: Why is it better to have the cell mimic this natural process than in the old technology?

Advertisement

Bancel: When you think about it when you get an infection by an mRNA virus in your body what happens? The virus of mRNA gets in your cell uses your own cell machinery to make the proteins to basically self-replicate inside yourself and then it escapes your cell and this is what your immune system sees. So if you think about it the old technology of vaccines where you make an E. coli cell or CHO cell protein that then you inject in a human and that just circulates in your blood that's not mimicking natural biology.

In our case the spike protein we designed the vaccine so it's made inside the cell — so in the human cell not in the E. coli cell — and then we designed it to be transmembrane meaning to stay attached to the cell and to be presented to the immune system that basically patrols you know in your blood in your body and will see that things sticking out of a cell that is not self. If you think about the 3D configuration of a B cell coming on to that protein it's exactly like if it were a natural infection. Which is why if you look at the data across the nine vaccines we put in the clinic the antibody level is so high. Because it's perfectly mimicking nature.

Winarsky: How did you know which protein and that one was enough? How did that process work?

Bancel: That's a very good question and as Mr. Pasteur would say and of course he has a big role in vaccinology ""Only the prepared mind.""

One of the things we were doing with Dr. Fauci's team for the last couple of years was collaborating on studying viruses that could become outbreaks. None of us thought we would see in our lifetime a global pandemic. The last one we were all aware of as students of infectious diseases is of course the Spanish flu.

And so one of the things we got lucky with was that we'd been working for a few years together with Dr. Fauci's team as part of that project for outbreak readiness on the MERS vaccine the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome which if I'd used those words a year ago nobody would have known what I was talking about but now they already know it's another coronavirus.

We worked to provide to them mRNA for research grade so animal testing antigen design and picking the protein that makes sense.

Because mRNA is so easy to make once you industrialize it we were able to send to NIH to the team working on MERS all the different vaccine designs they wanted to try in animals. They would vaccinate the animals and then they would challenge them by giving them a high dose of a virus. The one that was the most protective was always the spike protein. They tried a lot of combinations but spike by itself was always the best.

Advertisement

Conde: So that theory I assume is because you're essentially putting neutralizing antibodies around the spike and the spike is what the virus uses to get into cells in the first place.

Bancel: Correct. A full-length spike protein was always the best. Some companies went into the clinic with three four or five candidates and there were different hypotheses they were testing. We didn't have to do that because we had tried it for a couple of years; we knew that with mRNA our best guess was going at the full-length spike protein.

Conde: At a very high level you are essentially printing these vaccines versus growing a version of virus or denatured virus. So you can design it you can print it and then you can you know obviously get this into people very quickly as a result. That's a remarkable part of this entire story that's probably somewhat under-appreciated that allowed you and collectively us to move so quickly. When did you know Stéphane that ""All right this is going to work"" this is going to work for COVID?

Bancel: I had a very high belief that this should work from the beginning so since January. This was the tenth vaccine we were working on so I've seen the human data of the previous ones. And in infectious disease unlike in oncology where the animal models tell you nothing in infectious disease if you look at a lot of data there's extremely high translation from animals into humans. I saw the mouse data before we started of course dosing in humans. So I knew the data in mice looks great so because we had the nine vaccines before I knew it was going to look great in humans which we've learned all of us in May.

Conde: Can you describe Stéphane when you first saw the interim Phase 3 data and what your reaction was?

Bancel: So it was a Sunday in November I knew that the independent NIH-lead Safety and Data Monitoring Board were going to meet at 10 a.m. on Sunday. I told my wife and my kids I'm going to be a wreck that whole morning.

I tried to pretend to work but I was so distracted I checked my email every two minutes my phone every two minutes for text messages and so on. Maybe a bit before 1 p.m. I got a text from my team saying ""Hey get on WebEx we're going to get the data.""

There wasn't even a slide made it was just somebody talking and literally reading to us the data. And so I learned about the close to 95% efficacy. It was already a big n and the p-value was very very low very very low so this was real. And the piece that was the most exciting to me and my team was the severe case of disease — which there were I think eight or nine on the interim data we have now 30 on the final analysis — and there was zero on the vaccine they were all on placebo.

And if you think about what this means when you connect those two datasets together it means if you get our vaccine you have a 95% chance of having zero symptoms if you get infected by the virus. You will not even know you are sick you just go live your normal life with zero symptoms. And in the 5% case where you will get a disease it will be mild disease you will get no severe disease.

And when you think about what has happened to our society the elderly people with high comorbidity from hospitalization when it gets bad it leads to death and the total impact on the economy the loss of jobs in so many industries and some that will cascade. If you could have a vaccine where most people 95% get no symptoms and the 5% that do get mild symptoms never go and walk into a hospital that will be a total game-changer. So we listen to the data and then I've talked to my team for a few minutes you know I don't think we were processing it. And then I left my home office and I called my wife she was in the house and I told her and she just started crying in the house.

Winarsky: I think that's what it felt like for all of us hearing it too it felt like you know normal life could return and it was the promise of something like that.

Bancel: The human toll is gigantic but then the piece that I don't think is talked about enough is the mental health toll happening to people at every age. All the young people especially in more disfavored communities are living in small apartments where mom is trying to work and kids trying to learn remotely without a computer or a good internet line — (we don't know) the impact this is going to have in terms of equality.

And then of course so many industries have been totally destroyed … I have not walked into a restaurant indoor since March and I won't go until I'm vaccinated.

Conde: So as amazing as I think the COVID vaccine story is I think it's also worth talking about the machine that made the vaccine the technology platform that you've built over the course of 10 years that allowed you in January of 2020 to say like ""Hey we need to develop a COVID vaccine.""

I remember coming to visit Moderna in Kendall Square that first facility you had. And what was interesting about it is you walked in it didn't look like your typical biotech company it was a row of machines a row of printers a row of robots. And that's very different than what your traditional biotech company looks like and it looked a lot more like an assembly line in some ways where you can order something up and out the other end would come the mRNA medicine that you had ordered.

Bancel: Yes and this goes back to this incredible property of mRNA which I'm surprised that so many have missed is that this is an information-carrying molecule that you can industrialize. When you are in an analog business which is what I think all pharma and all biotech is in my book because every molecule is a different chemical entity you cannot industrialize the making of a lot of it at the research grade.

Advertisement

You have to literally have chemists and pipettes and so on you know doing like what we all did in chemistry class and writing the synthetic route to get to a molecule that they want to do the biological effect that they want. And then they have to design that chemical equation and then all the pipette and test tubes to do that and when it's another molecule they have to invent another synthetic route. So it's really an analog world where you invent everything once at a time for one product. Because if every product is different you have to re-optimize every time and sometimes it's very complicated because of a very complex biological system.

So sometimes it will take you six months 12 months 18 months to get ready from preclinical data to be making a clinical-grade product that you need to file to the FDA so that they give you a green light to go into testing this in humans.

It's a highly regulated as it should be process to protect people's safety. But in our case it's always the same thing because mRNA is always made of four same letters the four letters of life like zeros and one in software it's the same manufacturing process. This is like software or Legos this is an engineering problem it's an engineering technology it's a platform.

The only difference between all Zika vaccines or all CMV vaccines and the COVID vaccine it's only the order of a letter the zeros and ones of life. The manufacturing process is the same the equipment is the same with the same operators it's the same thing and so this is why we could go so fast. It took us 60 days to go from a sequence of a virus by the Chinese to dosing a human. The first SARS SARS-CoV-1 it took the NIH 20 months to go from sequence to starting the Phase 1 study. So you went from 20 months to two months.

Conde: Which is remarkable. Are we in the plug and play future for vaccines?

Bancel: Oh 100%. We're going after making a seasonal flu vaccine because as we all know still 10000 Americans die every year on average of seasonal flu. We believe we should be able to make a big bet on flu. And today we have six vaccines in development we're going to have many more soon because for 10 years you know Jorge we hoped that mRNA vaccines were going to work.

We believed scientifically they were going to work. But until you have a Phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled study where you test really the prevention of the disease you don't know. Now we know.

Winarsky: Are there limits right now to how sophisticated these instructions can get or can we essentially give them as sophisticated instructions as you know the human body is capable of?

Advertisement

Bancel: It's when the mechanism of a disease is not well understood. So we spoke about the vaccine and we said ""Look coronavirus"" as I said ""is actually a simple virus we as a society got lucky."" Think about HIV. HIV has been discovered 40 years ago but still to this day no approved vaccine against HIV.

Now think about the awful world we'll be in right now if Dr. Fauci had to be standing on the presidential podium back in the spring and told everybody ""Folks I'm sorry to tell you but this is awfully complex virus we have no idea when we might have a vaccine."" Think about the state of mind we'd all be in now.

The biology of rare genetic disease is very well understood. Why? Because kids got bad genetic information from their parents that they cannot make a correct protein and that's what caused their disease. They have a wrong instruction in their DNA if you can get them an mRNA from our technology coming in their cells with the right instruction then they will have the right protein and they won't get sick.

If we think about cancer on the other hand or spectrum or Alzheimer's now if the disease mechanism is not understood we cannot drug it easily. We can try things of course we could make an mRNA behind that hypothesis and we could try it in the clinic but a lot of things will fail because you are guessing.

And so the piece where I think we have an incredible tailwind is basically all the labs doing academic biology work around the world are helping us. Because if tomorrow there is a paper published by a lab in the US or in China or anywhere in the world that says protein XYZ is the root cause of that disease or those five proteins in this ratio are the root cause of that disease then we can actually turn on the computer and we can now design a drug to go test that hypothesis in an animal.

Conde: Basically the power of this approach works when you know what you want to make and then you just need to deliver the instructions to make that. Where it doesn't work as well is when you're not quite sure what it is that you need to make.

Bancel: This is basically biology complexity or biology risk. The other dimension for us is the ability to deliver the mRNA in the right setting. We actually have become a delivery of nucleic acid company.

We realized that what would allow us to maximize the impact we could have on disease by helping as many people as we can over the next five 10 20 years is the ability to bring mRNA to different cell types.

So a good example today if you say ""Look there is this university that published the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease."" If it happens in the brain and we don't know how to bring mRNA in the brain safely we cannot drug it so the biology will be understood but the delivery technology will not be there.

An example where we're making a lot of progress right now is the lung. We have been working with Vertex around how to deliver mRNA via an aerosol via your mouth into your lungs because they know the biology very well and we work together to develop a delivery system to bring mRNA safely into your lungs and to bring enough mRNA at a safe dose to get the biological effect and we're getting very close now.

Once we can prove in the clinic that that delivery system works then the next morning you can make any other drug you want that you need to get into the lung because it's getting another set of zeros and ones coded differently with the same delivery system into the lung. And that's the power of the technology which is why with vaccines we are able to go so fast.

Conde: Yeah the instructions have gotten so sophisticated over time that now the next sort of horizon is you've got to get the vehicle for delivery equally sophisticated.

Bancel: We're adding vertical after vertical after vertical they bring mRNA into a new cell type. So the vaccine is one vertical getting mRNA into a tumor is another vertical. We have a very cool drug where we inject mRNA in people's hearts after a heart attack and here we got a protein called VEGF. For the biology geeks on the podcast V-E-G-F that is a protein that we all have the instruction in our DNA which basically tells your body to make a new blood vessel. You use that protein every time you cut yourself.

Winarsky: Stéphane you've mentioned you know kind of the fast design of the vaccine and then you mentioned even robots printing medicines. Can we get your version of what that machine assembly line looks like?

Bancel: So the robotics farm we have in our factory is basically just an assembly of robots that get instruction coming directly from computers there's no human interaction and basically you start from a piece of DNA that is basically your template you put that in the reactor with water. There is no cell it's a cell-free manufacturing process which is why it's so fast.

And you put enzymes and basically what the enzymes will do they attach to the DNA and they read the DNA template and they put little pieces of nucleic acid i.e. the zeros and ones the four letters of life they bind them next to each other to make an mRNA molecule. Then the robot goes to the next step which is you add the cap thing at like the nose of the molecule that you add again with another enzyme. Then what you do is you purify the mRNA so basically you pick the mRNA from all that water and enzyme and nucleotides nucleic acid and so on.

And then when you have a pure mRNA molecule after purification you mix it with a lipid i.e. fat and that fat basically goes around and packaged like in a little bowl the mRNA. to protect the mRNA in your blood and to get the mRNA inside your cells. When it's inside your cells the lipid the fat falls apart the mRNA is released inside the cell and the little ribosome the little 3D printer of your cell is going to read that message make the protein on-demand and here you go the patient the human is making his own medicine.

Conde: I remember from the earliest days you were obsessed with the operations you were obsessed with turnaround time with throughput with you know cost per output. And the benefit of that approach is that it obviously is compounded over time. The benefit of the technology as you're describing it is that you have a machine that prints the instructions that go into the cell that uses the cells' machine to make the medicine or to make the vaccine. And that's this incredibly powerful paradigm you know to taking therapeutics or vaccines from being very bespoke efforts to being truly industrialized designed efforts.

Bancel: That's what's really so powerful is that the whole drug process is all about information. The piece that is remarkable is you have this very modular technology because what happens in our cell is actually extremely logical.

We start from the sequence information of a virus like in the case of our COVID vaccine or we use the human genome we put into a technology genetic base cassette and then you click order on the computer and you go again. And that's the vision I always had since day oned and a lot of people at the beginning thought I was crazy because this industrialized engineer-driven approach to drug discovery has never happened.

Advertisement

Winarsky: So Stéphane you've described this process which is you know much more efficient industrialized in nature incredibly fast compared to the old process is there a world in which that gets even faster? Are there other things other you know increases in technology that would speed this up even more?

Bancel: Yes so it took us 42 days to go from sequence to shipping the human grade virus to Dr. Fauci's team. The big bottleneck is sterility testing a very important quality control test that is done for any injectable pharmaceutical. To make sure that there is no bacteria in the product the test takes two weeks because what you do is take a sample of your vaccine and you wait enough time.

Even if there's only one copy of a bacteria by the time you have enough multiplication of bacteria through a detection at the assay of the test that you will see it and you will not miss it. It's very important for people's safety. Well if there was a technology developed where you could do sterility testing in one day with high sensitivity then you could take our process down to two weeks.

Conde: So we've talked about the vaccine we've talked about the machine that made the vaccine. I'd love to take a second to talk about the company that built the machine. So from the moment that you started this company you took a very different approach and you've described it as having an engineer's mindset. Can you talk a little bit about what you did and how you thought about the early company build?

Advertisement

Bancel: I had never built a company in hypergrowth. You know I worked at Eli Lilly I ran bioMerieux which is a big diagnostic company but I had never built myself a company building very very quickly. We decided to do something very atypical because most biotech companies are one drug company at a time. What was very clear to us because mRNA is an information molecule is it made no scientific sense that this will be a one drug company. It will be zero because we run out of money before we can safely get the drug approved or it would be a company with thousands and thousands and thousands of drugs because of our platform.

And so once we realized that in the first hours of talking about Moderna we started to become very worried and paranoid about ""Geez we don't know what we don't know about this technology because it's new it has never been approved."" And ""Geez if we pick one drug if we are wrong and it doesn't work in the clinic everybody will believe what people have believed for 50-plus years which is mRNA will never be a drug and we most probably are going to go bankrupt.""

But if mRNA could work we will have failed society because if we find a way to make this work this will be dozens and dozens of drugs that are undoable using existing technology like the VEGF in the heart. Then we will shortchange society and shortchange the patients and that was just unbearable. And so we spent a lot of time thinking about ""Okay what are all the things that could make us fail?""

We ended up zooming on four risks that we say ""If we can manage and reduce those risks we will have the best chance to be the best version of Moderna."" Those risks we've talked about very publicly especially when we went public. It's a technology risk around the mRNA technology so of course if you do new technology you don't know what you don't know and there's going to be a lot of risks there are things not working as you expect.

Two is the biology risk. You can have an incredible risk that your scientific hypothesis on the biology is incorrect and the drug will fail not because the technology wasn't working but because the scientific hypothesis on the biology is incorrect. Then there was going to be a lot of execution risk and then of course financing risk because we said ""Like you know asset managers build the portfolio"" we said ""picking one drug is crazy it's like buying only one stock.""

And so we said ""Let's build a portfolio of drugs"" and after many many months of discussion we designed basically a pipeline of 20 drugs that we said we're going to take all those drugs in parallel to the clinic so it will not be a binary event that the company makes it or not on one drug. So we diversify the technology risk on six different technology applications—from vaccine to drug in the heart to a drug in the liver for rare genetic disease—and then for every application we took several drugs to diversify the biology risk.

And we launched that crazy experiment with you know 17 drugs in the clinic so far which then created incredible execution risk because it's harder to do 17 at the same time than 1. And incredible financing risk because you need a lot of capital. But we traded those risks with our eyes wide open because the other risk could kill us with much higher probability the technology and the biology risk.

Conde: It's very difficult in this industry to take that bounce on platform versus programs. And you know what tends to be the case very quickly as most companies when they have to choose where to put an incremental dollar or an incremental head they put it on the programs because those are the golden eggs and they want to move those forward to create value inflection and as a result the platform ends up getting starved.

Advertisement

Bancel: Yes.

Conde: You started the other way around. You actually fed the platform and you fed the goose and then you let the goose lay its eggs.

Bancel: Yeah exactly the goose is more valuable than any egg. If you really believe you have a goose that's going to be making thousands and thousands and thousands of eggs you don't want to kill the goose on the first or second egg.

Conde: Although most geese are not that fertile in biotech.

Advertisement

Bancel: Correct. And that's why I told the board that I was not interested to go public early because the capital market was going to force me to not invest in the goose. Because biotech funds like to bet on eggs not on the goose because there have not been a lot of geese before in this industry so they're not used to it.

Conde: I mean the record will show that you did a lot of things right. As you built the company over the last 10 years can you talk a little bit about the things you did wrong and if you could get them back you would do it over?

Bancel: The easiest one given the COVID situation is it took us three years to start working on vaccines. So think about how the world would be different and Moderna would be different if we started working on vaccines from day one we might have been able to go even faster for COVID. So that's the thing I regret and that's on me. I made quite a lot of mistakes hiring people because I underestimated how intense our company is because I live it every day.

I thought initially that it was obvious that this is a small company fighting for its life so people are going to work hard it's brand new cutting edge science so it's going to be complicated because every other thing is not going to work. So being able to manage uncertainty people having a lot of great collaboration because making a drug it's a team sport. A drug is a system of so many capabilities the biologist the toxic people the chemist the engineers to make the drug. And a lot of the time people coming from Big Pharma are used to working in silos and people who come from academia don't know how to develop drugs. It's a system and like any system you get the best outcome if you really optimize the system working together.

Conde: So the last question I would ask you what advice would you give to the engineer that wants to get into biotech?

Bancel: So first you need to learn a bit about biology. I mean I have a chance to spend my entire career in biology so I've learned a lot on the go. I've learned a lot by reading I'm a curious guy so I read a lot. You can get biology books later on. And I think it's understanding enough of biology so that you can be part of the conversation so that you can you know have an impact on decisions and scientific choices that happen and then you can go from there.

Winarsky: That's wonderful. Thank you so much for joining us on ""Bio Eats World"" Stéphane we're so grateful for your time.

Which vaccine will I get? What about side effects and efficacy comparison?,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines so far. We compare the different available shots and several still in the approval process for use in the United States.

Which vaccines are approved already?

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been available to Americans since December.

A vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals a Johnson & Johnson company was authorized in late February.

AstraZeneca working in collaboration with Oxford University is expected to request authorization from the FDA for their vaccine within a few weeks and Novavax is expected to follow with its application later in April or May.

What technology does each vaccine use?

Many vaccines use weakened or inactivated versions or components of the disease-causing pathogen to stimulate the body’s immune response. However the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna take advantage of messenger RNA (mRNA) which instructs cells to produce a protein on the surface of the virus. The immune system recognizes those vaccine-triggered spike proteins as invaders and creates antibodies to block future attacks of the virus that causes COVID-19.

More: How mRNA vaccines work

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine takes the more traditional approach. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause colds or flulike symptoms. The J&J team used a modified adenovirus that can enter cells but can’t replicate inside them or cause illness. The vaccine contains this modified virus that delivers a spike protein activating the immune system.

The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine also uses an adenovirus in this case a monkey virus that the human immune system doesn't recognize. It delivers the gene that encodes the spike protein to human cells rather than the protein itself.

Novavax's vaccine works by delivering lab-grown spike proteins along with a compound that attracts immune cells to the site of the injection.

Where is each vaccine developed?

Moderna Pfizer Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are all US-based companies. The J&J vaccine was developed by researchers at Harvard University and in Leiden Netherlands. Moderna based in Cambridge Massachusetts developed its vaccine in collaboration with U.S. government scientists. The AstraZeneca vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford and its spin-off company Vaccitech. BioNTech a biotechnology company based in Mainz Germany partnered with Pfizer to test and produce its vaccine.

How many shots do I need to get?

All the vaccines except the one from Johnson & Johnson require two shots to train the immune system well enough to fight the coronavirus.

After one dose of the Pfizer vaccine for example its effectiveness against illness reached up to 52% after 12 days and up to 95% a week after the second dose according to a study. That's why it's important for people who have received only one dose to keep practicing the usual precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests getting the second shot as close to the recommended dose schedule as possible but not earlier.

The J&J vaccine is a one-dose vaccine. However the company is also testing a two-dose regimen with the two shots given eight weeks apart.

How much do vaccines cost per dose?

Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech so far have been selling the majority of their doses to high-income countries including the U.S. Canada and the European Union. These are also the most expensive vaccines.

AstraZeneca-Oxford has the cheapest of the five vaccines. The company has committed not to profit from it while the pandemic lasts.

There have been reports of different prices being paid by governments in different parts of the world.

How much has the U.S. spent on each?

Overall the U.S. government has made vaccine deals totaling more than $9 billion with multiple private companies but the deals vary in size.

The pharmaceutical giant Merck will also receive $105 million from the government to help produce the J&J vaccine.

How many doses of each will the U.S. get?

President Joe Biden said in March that the U.S. will have enough vaccines for every adult in the U.S. by the end of May. The main challenge will now be to distribute the doses and to convince hesitant people to take them.

Do we have enough vaccine to go around?

The U.S. has purchased over 1 billion doses of vaccine for a population of 330 million.

According to a ONE's Policy team study the world’s richest countries have collectively bought 1 billion more doses than their citizens need. The rest of the world has been able to secure only 2.5 billion doses - not enough to vaccinate their populations.

The excess doses purchased by rich countries alone would be sufficient to vaccinate the entire adult population of Africa. In many developing countries widespread vaccination coverage might not be achieved before 2023 unless countries like the U.S. share their surplus.

Do temperature and storage requirements differ between vaccines?

The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require a complicated cold chain to safely distribute them. During each part of the process the vaccine boxes must be kept at exactly the right temperature. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be used within five days after the transfer to refrigerator. Moderna vaccine can last in the refrigerator for a month and the J&J vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 3 months.

The Novavax and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines can be stored in normal refrigerators for up to six months.

What about safety and side effects?

Serious side effects allergic reactions or adverse incidents stemming from the vaccines are rare though in clinical trials mild to moderate side effects were common. The most common complaints were pain at the injection site fatigue and aching muscles and joints. People with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions should inform health professionals before they are vaccinated and anyone with an allergy to one of the vaccine's ingredients should consult a healthcare provider before getting vaccinated.

The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are recommending the U.S. pause on using the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after reports of blood clots in six of 6.8 million individuals who received the vaccine so far.

All six recipients were women between the ages of 18 and 48 with symptoms occurring 6 to 13 days after vaccination according to the statement. One woman died and one has been hospitalized in critical condition.

The health agencies released a statement on April 13 recommending the pause “out of an abundance of caution” saying blood clots still seem to be “extremely rare.” So far the CDC and FDA are reviewing six reported cases in the U.S.

The type of blood clot reported in individuals who have received the J&J vaccine is called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). As of April 12 more than 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been administered in the U.S. and approximately 9 million more has been shipped out to states according to the CDC.

The University of Oxford previously reported pausing administration of the vaccine it developed with AstraZeneca in a U.K. study to test the shot in children pending review of rare blood-clotting issues seen in adults after receiving the shot.

Do some vaccines work better than others?

Public health experts emphasize that all the vaccines are effective particularly at preventing serious disease.

Because trials were conducted differently at different times effectiveness figures cannot be directly compared.

In its large-scale trial the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was shown to prevent 95% of symptomatic COVID-19 just 1 percentage point more than Moderna's. Both vaccines appear to be equally protective across age groups and racial and ethnic groups.

The J&J vaccine was shown to be 72% effective in moderate to severe disease and 85% effective in preventing the most severe disease.

AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 two weeks after the second dose and was 100% effective in stopping severe disease and hospitalization in a U.S.-based clinical trial according to the company.

In a trial in the U.K. two doses of the Novavax vaccine were shown to be nearly 90% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 though just 50% effective in a smaller South African trial.

What do we still need to know?

It remains unclear how long any of these vaccines will continue to protect people. While the small number of early trial participants have maintained levels of protective antibodies for nearly a year companies will continue to follow volunteers for two years to see if their immunity begins to wane. Periodic booster shots to extend immunity and/or protect against new variants of the virus might be needed.

And although a growing body of research suggests that vaccines will also protect people from passing on the virus – even if they don't have symptoms – that remains to be confirmed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdGhldmFyc2l0eS5jYS8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L2dvLWFmdGVyLXVubWV0LW5lZWRzLW1vZGVybmEtY28tZm91bmRlci1kci1kZXJyaWNrLXJvc3NpLW9uLWV0aGljYWwtZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Go after unmet needs”: Moderna co-founder Dr. Derrick Rossi on ethical entrepreneurship,"As a co-founder of Moderna a retired Harvard University professor and one of Time’s top 100 influential people of 2011 it’s fair to say that Dr. Derrick Rossi has had an exceptional career.

After graduating from high school in Scarborough Rossi earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in medical and molecular genetics at U of T. Graduating in 1993 Rossi went on to earn his PhD at the University of Helsinki before performing postdoctoral research at Stanford University and landing a professorship at Harvard.

He commercialized his research in manipulating pluripotent stem cells with modified RNA by founding Moderna in 2010 — the name a contraction of ‘modified RNA.’ Rossi has always been a scientist first and foremost and his work with the company now supplying 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccines to Canada was firmly related to research instead of revenue. His first chief executive officer (CEO) role was at Convelo Therapeutics a biotech startup he joined in 2018.

Rossi is now semi-retired having left Moderna in 2014 and Harvard in 2018 while remaining at Convelo. He spends his time bonding with his three daughters and consulting with the media on fighting COVID-19 misinformation.

The Varsity sat down with Rossi to discuss his academic experiences hear his thoughts on ethics in ‘Big Pharma’ and canvas his advice for the next generation of biotech entrepreneurs.

The Varsity: Recalling back to your time at U of T are there any fond reminiscences that have stuck with you?

Derrick Rossi: Well I first applied to U of T out of high school — and I actually got admitted to Trinity College — but I ended up going to Western University in London for my first few years of undergrad. So then I transferred back to U of T for the third year of my undergrad and I went into Victoria College.

Even though I was a science major — I was in the molecular genetics department — I did a minor in cinema studies. Funny thing for a science major to take away but my minor in cinema studies was maybe my most fond memory of undergrad.

I do remember also being in the lab. I was really into music and rock and roll at the time and I remember all the lab members of the Bernstein lab were very very tolerant of me playing my music all the time — incredibly tolerant. I’d be playing it loud and nobody ever said a peep. It was a testament to the other lab people that they probably were not into what I was listening to yet they recognized that it was a big part of my identity and they totally tolerated the sonic hell that I put them through.

You know you can be a scientist and you’ve got to be good at your science but you shouldn’t be restricted. Whenever you box yourself in one field and you don’t take inspiration from other fields it’s a mistake. Art has always been a big part of my life.

TV: Speaking of your diverse experience while the companies you’ve been associated with have all roughly been in the biotech umbrella they cover such a wide range of research. How are you able to apply yourself to so many different areas of medical and biotechnical research?

DR: I would never be adverse to going into anything in biomedical sciences that was of interest to myself or anybody in the lab. I never said “I’m a molecular biologist and we only do molecular biology.”

I would have a large pool of money that I got from various grants and various funding agencies and I never restricted us to working on what we said we were going to work on. Usually you write a grant and it’s a five-year grant and you’re supposed to chart out what you’re going to do in year one two three four and five. To me that’s an absurd scientific exercise. You should be doing in year two what the data from year one informed you to do which might not necessarily be what you wrote in your grant for year two.

So I never adhere to what I wrote in the grants. Rather we pursued what we were interested in what we were passionate about and where the data led us. Grants are dumb.

TV: Is there any particular field right now you would say to pay the most attention to — not necessarily as an investor but just as someone really interested in science?

DR: Artificial intelligence (AI) as applied to biological systems. I’ve recently seen some data from the New York Stem Cell Foundation — they got a large robotic array for handling cell-based assays. So they’ve removed all of the noise that comes from human handling the cells — and that’s a lot of noise.

All of that can be eliminated by automation miniaturization and robotics. Then when you’ve cleaned up that noise now you can bring in AI to analyze the data that you’ve generated. It has the ability to process information at orders of magnitude better than the human eye or the human brain can do it.

You could argue that it takes some of the humans out of it. And you don’t want to take out human creativity by any stretch of the imagination — you absolutely need that. But biological systems are highly susceptible to noise and if you can get rid of the noise and use sophisticated systems for analyzing data you can get to meaningful biological endpoints that we wouldn’t have been able to get to prior to that.

TV: As the CEO of a biotech company could you speak to how you make ethical decisions?

DR: So first and foremost I want to only be involved in working on things that address a medical need for which there isn’t a good solution right now. Why waste my time on doing something that there’s already an answer for? Making money is not interesting at all to me.

When a medicine is developed — like a COVID-19 vaccine — it’s made by for-profit companies and so obviously they take advance orders from countries that can pay for the research and development and pay for the product. So first-world companies and wealthy companies are lining up whereas countries that have less financial resources have not placed orders because they can’t.

For example Canada — who’s placed an order of massive surplus for vaccines — they made various bets on different technologies. I think there’s like four times the number that they actually need. Well once everybody in Canada gets vaccinated they will start donating those vaccines to countries that don’t have the financial ability to purchase their own.

Canada would do that anyhow — because it’s the morally correct thing to do — but you could argue that that would have been the only way to get vaccines to these nations. If you just left it up to the bottom line to dictate that it wouldn’t have been successful. And it’s necessary: anybody who’s smart enough recognizes that it’s a ‘pandemic’ and that you have to stamp it out globally or it’s going to persist.

I’ve heard the argument that it’s not moral that the rich countries are lining up and they purchase their vaccines at the expense of countries with less resources. I actually would argue that it’s going to work out and it is the only way it would have worked out because otherwise how do those nations that don’t have the financial resources pay for a product from for-profit companies to vaccinate their people?

TV: If you were fresh out of your PhD — or earlier — and looking to found a biotech company to make a difference in the world what would you do? What would you advise people in that situation to do these days?

DR: It’s two things in biomedicine. It always starts with the science — the science has to be superb and unequivocal. I’ve seen multibillion-dollar companies in biotech start with nothing but money and people and I think that’s a terrible idea. Success is making products that are meaningful for patient health — in biotech that’s the only measure of success. I don’t care how much money the initial public offering makes.

People are important people that have ‘seen the movie before.’ Back to cinema again: if you’ve seen the movie before you know what scene is coming next and so you can prepare for that. If you haven’t seen the movie before when the scene changes all of a sudden there’s a plot twist to your business. Mentorship experience is really important.

To tie it back to your moral question: go after unmet needs because there are unmet needs and people are suffering. So if you make a solution there you can help patients which is the real objective of this whole thing.

Those are the things I would say. Whatever you’re starting with it’s got to be a great concept. It’s got to reach an unmet need and hopefully address that in a significant way. And gather people around you that have seen the movie before who can help you navigate your way through it.

The Moderna vaccine will arrive in the UK by the end of April culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said.

Speaking on Sunday the cabinet minister sought to reassure Brits shipments of the new jab were still on course to reach the health service after reports last week that the UK vaccine rollout could slide.

He also confirmed all people would get their second jab of the Covid shot within 12 weeks of their first.

Dowden cast doubt over whether people could begin booking summer holidays abroad however as a third wave of the pandemic appeared to be taking hold in mainland Europe.

Ministers have insisted they will meet the target of giving a jab to all adults by July but supplies have been affected by issues in India and a row with the European Union over exports has raised concerns.

Dowden insisted that the vaccination programme remains “on course” telling BBC One’s Andrew Marr: “We expect that in April Moderna will come.”

The US vaccine has been approved for use in the UK and would be the third to be rolled out after Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

The culture secretary said he could guarantee that everyone will get a second dose of a coronavirus vaccine within 12 weeks of their first after doubts were raised by French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

“Yes of course we’ve been planning that all the way through. It’s one of the most important considerations as we’ve rolled out the vaccine” Dowden told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

He said that “we clearly don’t currently have a surplus of vaccines” when asked about suggestions the UK was planning to offer 3.7 million jabs to Ireland.

Professor Mark Woolhouse who advises the government on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) said he was “a little bit nervous about a full relaxation” planned for June 21.

He told the BBC the road map to easing restrictions in England must be “guided by the data” particularly on vaccines adding: “The idea that we can suddenly emerge from this in one great bound I think is a little over-optimistic.”

Dowden said another lockdown “is the last thing in the world we would want to do” but acknowledged dates in the road map may slip if things worsen.

“Of course they could be delayed if the situation deteriorates but at the moment we’re on track” he told Marr.

Travel abroad is currently illegal other than for a few reasons but a government taskforce will on April 12 detail a review on whether foreign holidays can return.

Dowden said “all options” are being considered when asked about a possible system that could allow shorter quarantine periods with greater testing for countries deemed less risky."

They were locked out on Feb. 20 after rejecting the company’s contract offer.

The bosses are pushing to institute a third tier with fewer benefits and with a starting wage only 2 Canadian dollars ($1.60) above Ontario’s minimum of CA$14 an hour. This is roughly half the top-tier wage now.

Weeks before the vote Molson hired 60 temporary workers telling them to vote for the contract if they wanted to keep a job Ron Westeneerj a millwright with 30 years seniority told the Militant on the picket line March 13. “We explained to them if we lose and you do keep your job you’ll be in the third tier” he said. “Seeing how we got a 70% vote against the contract the company’s effort was in vain.”

“They have tiers within tiers. There are different benefits for people who started at different times. It should be the same for everyone “ John Moreel a millwright with 31 years seniority said.

“They thought they could break the union” said Kevin Galway chief steward in the brewing department. In 2017 workers won a 46-day strike pushing back concessions demands including a 7% wage cut.

Workers are also fighting bosses’ demands to impose a 12-hour shift operating all seven days on the can line. There would be no rotations so the same workers would have to work weekends every week. “The younger workers would be forced into this schedule. Molson does it to avoid paying overtime on the weekends. It’s unfair” said Moreel.

Area workers are extending support helping the brewery workers keep up their fight. Two United Steelworkers members brought donuts and coffee to the line while this Militant worker-correspondent was there and a group of elementary-school teachers joined the picket with their union flags. Members of Sheet Metal Workers and Roofers Local 30 workers from Ontario Power and other union members have brought their union flags and walked the line too.

You can join the picket line or send solidarity messages and contributions to Local 325 at 1 Carlingview Dr. Toronto Ontario Canada M9W 5E5.

Betty is set to star in the Cadbury Clucking Bunny national TV commercial this spring the company said in its news release.

Venture capitalist Bill Gurley was on Masters in Business with Barry last week and talked about why it’s so hard to pull off a long-term holding in a company like Amazon:

GURLEY: The power of compounding for some of these platforms is so so huge that you know if you invest in an Amazon or whatever the hardest thing to possibly do is just close your eyes and forget it.

And the only thing analysis that’s going to cause you to do is sell the stock. You know you — you’re not going to run analysis you know for the fourteenth time and go hmmm I should keep holding like that. And that is so hard so so hard to implement — easy to say very hard to implement.

Basically you can’t overthink these things. But overthinking is what we humans do.

The reason it’s easy to overthink these things is because the ride can be so rocky:

The near-95% crash following the tech bust is the one most people point to. The stock was underwater from 1999 to 2009!

But there was a 54% crash from 2005-2006 a 58% dive in 2008 and 5 separate losses of 25% or worse since 2009.

The problem with such regular bone-crushing losses is you never know if your stock is going to come back or not.

Since 1980 more than 40% of all companies in the U.S. stock market have experienced a decline of 70% or worse without recovering.

And those enormous declines aren’t just for the companies that don’t come back from the dead.

Microsoft is another good example:

The stock fell nearly 75% following the dot-com debacle and it took 17 years for the price to make it back to the levels of late-1999. Microsoft also fell 56% in the 2008 crash and has experienced six double-digit corrections since 2009 (including three drawdowns of 20% or worse).

Monster Beverage is one of the best-performing stocks of the past few decades no one has heard of. The stock is up 125000% since the turn of the century. Apparently people really like energy drinks.

Look at the drawdowns the stock has experienced to earn those ridiculous returns:

It’s fallen 60% or more four times and two of those times it was down 90%.

Tesla is another stock that has seen unbelievable growth in its share price while also exhibiting painful losses on its journey to becoming one of the best-performing stocks of the past 10 years or so:

Tesla was up more than 730% in 2020 alone. But it also had its worst drawdown since becoming a public company falling more than 60% during the Corona Crash. I counted 10 bear markets for the stock since its IPO and 3 of those bears were crashes of 40% or worse.

Or how about Netflix:

In 2012 you could have bought the greatest streaming company of all-time for an 82% discount. And there have been 4 losses in excess of 25% since it became the streaming juggernaut we know it as today.

When you look back at the returns of stocks like this it’s easy to think to yourself I knew I should have owned that stock.

But drawdowns are always far easier to deal with in the past than in the present. You know the length and duration of past losses. When stocks are down in the present you never know how bad the losses will get or if/when they will come back from those losses.

Think about a stock like Peloton.

This was an $8 billion market cap company going into 2020. By early January 2021 it was close to $50 billion. Then out of nowhere many of the pandemic darlings got shellacked. Pelton fell nearly 40% and is now closer to $30 billion.

I could see Peloton growing into the biggest fitness brand in the world. I personally love the experience.

Or they could be a niche/fad company that never reaches the heights of other growth companies. I wouldn’t be surprised by either outcome.

This is what makes picking these winners so difficult. It’s a constant tug of war between expectations and possibilities.

I could come up with a plausible scenario that many of the growth stocks that went vertical during the pandemic were massively overpriced and can’t possibly live up to the nosebleed valuations they were given.

I could also come up with a plausible scenario that a handful of these stocks are going to be much higher someday and every time they fall 20% 30% 40% 50% or more it presents an unbelieveable buying opportunity.

I’m no good at predicting these things but if I had to guess the two companies that have the best chance of becoming as big as Amazon or Microsoft or at least hitting market caps a level below these behemoths would be Shopify and Airbnb.

Each company is currently sporting a market cap in the low one-hundred billions.

So they’re already large but what if they could someday hit $800 billion $900 billion or even $1 trillion in market cap?

There would still be plenty of growth ahead.

Whether Shopify or Airbnb grow to these heights or not the stocks will likely get crushed along the way. You have to plan on seeing your money evaporate in stocks like this every few years.

A number of people think Shopify could become a threat to Amazon at some point. In some ways maybe it already is. Look at the company’s drawdown profile since going public in 2015:

I spot a 50%+ crash in the early days of being public along with four other instances of crashes of around 30% or worse.

This includes the current 28% losses which have occurred while the S&P 500 and Dow continue to hit new all-time highs.

The stock market is constantly switching back and forth between making people feel like a genius or an idiot depending on its mood.

Growth stocks do the same thing but even more often.

Picking the winners is hard. Holding onto them might be even harder.

The visual is directed by Weston Allen. Check out the full lyrics below.

After the track first teased in a virtual DJ set fans have been clamoring for the release of Laura Les' new single ""Haunted"" and at long last the wait is finally over.

The artist's first solo single since 100 gecs' meteoric rise to fame with 1000 gecs and last year's follow-up remix album as well as her first to hit major streaming services Laura Les is bringing us the same Monster energy drink-fuelled hyper pop we've come to expect but with a spooky twist. A cross between Art Angels-era Grimes and a chiptune cover of the Five Nights at Freddy's theme ""Haunted"" is a flurry of giddy electro-pop and hair-thrashing emo jammed into a bite-sized one minute-and-44-second morsel.

Full of gothic imagery like ""Everybody's evil and there's bugs inside the carpet/ Monsters in the trash can/ Ghosts inside the doorway"" the track almost feels like a scene out of a horror movie with ""blood all over"" and new terrors seeming to hide around every corner. Feelings of anxiety and paranoia continue to mount as Les bats the listener around her sonic funhouse leaving them disoriented and full of adrenaline as they come out on the other side.

Ahead of the release of ""Haunted"" PAPER caught up with Laura Les to dive into the inspiration behind the track and trade some ghost stories.

The song is mostly just about a feeling. Getting overwhelmed by a feeling and how it changes things around you. That sort of stuff lol idk it's not that deep but that sort of idea Paper cites.

Full lyrics of ""Haunted"" - Laura Les

""Am I going insane?

Running running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Insane running running through the back alley

Blood all over

You know I've had enough

Am I going insane?

Running running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Insane running running through the back alley

Blood all over

You know I've had...

Yeah do you think it's cute that

I'm so fucking stupid

Tell me that it is 'cause I'm tired of being useless yeah

I've been up for three days

Everything is haunted

Everybody's evil and there's bugs inside the carpet

Do you think I'm frightening? Organ chords and lightning

If I show my fangs will you tell me that they're cool?

Mirrors shatter when I'm passing broken glass and crashing…""

Private lender Five Star Business Finance on Friday closed a $234-million funding round that values it as around $1.4 billion.This round by the small business lender was a combination of primary funding from investors including KKR and TVS Capital and a secondary sale by existing investor Morgan Stanley Having first invested in the 35-year-old NBFC in 2016 Morgan Stanley has made a full exit with its share (around 12%) being bought out by new investors KKR and TVS Capital.Existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners also invested in the round.Currently promoters hold around 20% external investors 65% and friends and family circles have roughly 15% stake in the closely held entity.Five Star plans to use the capital to expand its business to meet the funding needs of the small business community who were looking at unorganised money lenders.Taking control of the NBFC in 2002 from a relative computer science engineer and first-generation entrepreneur D Lakshmipathy steered the company’s focus to SME lending from its core business of auto financing.The company thus became a pioneer in the small business lending space when it was a rarity — a rarity back then — providing collateralised loans based on assessment of borrower’s business and household cash flows.Bringing in a group of finance and banking professionals subsequently Five Star said it has doubled its asset under management (AUM) for every year in the past four years till Covid hit. Even during the pandemic the lender said it managed to achieve 100% collections in the month of September even with the moratorium.Five Star lends for all needs of the small business community fully backed by security making it a profitable enterprise with a strong asset quality. As of December 2020 the company’s asset under management stood at around Rs 4000 crore and with a return on asset of around 6% it is one of the best-performing players in the segment.“As of December our gross NPAs stood at around 1.3% and we hope to close the March quarter with an even better position” Lakshmipathy said. “Our underwriting model has seen various business cycles in the past 15 years making us uniquely positioned in ground level analysis of small business owners and providing them with funding alternatives” he added.“The strength of the founder and the management team along with the credit processes are visible in how the company has navigated several small and large disruptions including demonetization GST and now Covid-19 related challenges” Sequoia India MD G V Ravishankar said.Norwest India MD Niren Shah said Five Star has managed to reach 10x of the scale compared to when they first invested in 2017.TVS Capital MD Gopal Srinivasan said “Five Star has positioned itself as the best-in-class MSME lender in India’s missing middle with supreme operational efficiency appreciating the on ground realities faced by self-employed own-account enterprises.” The NBFC has scaled to 262 branches across eight states in a completely offline model. It has around 4000 employees.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3Mvbm9tdXJhLXNoYXJlcy1zbHVtcC0xNy13YXJucy0wNTU1MzU0MzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nomura Shares Slump About 17% as it Warns of $2 Billion Loss,"Nomura Holdings warned that it possibly occurred a loss of nearly $2 billion at one of its U.S. subsidiaries sending its shares down about 17% to a 7-week low on Monday.

“Nomura is currently evaluating the extent of the possible loss and the impact it could have on its consolidated financial results. The estimated amount of the claim against the client is approximately $2 billion based on market prices as of March 26” Japan’s biggest securities firm said in the release.

“As of the end of December 2020 Nomura maintained a consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of over 17 percent which is substantially higher than the minimum regulatory requirement. Accordingly there will be no issues related to the operations or financial soundness of Nomura Holdings or its US subsidiary” it added.

Following this Nomura shares which fell over 3% in 2020 plunged about 17% to JPY600.8 on Monday in Tokyo.

Analyst Comments

“The news is negative in the short term. Assuming $2bn as its losses in the March quarter we estimate most of its 2H FY3/21 PBT will be wiped out which could affect its DPS and the other capital return program at the FY-end. But $2bn is a 7-8% hit to its capital (without giving any tax benefit). As long as these losses are one-off in nature 1H FY3/22 should be the timing of recovery thus the impact on the longer-term outlook is relatively limited in our opinion” noted Hideyasu Ban equity analyst at Jefferies.

Nomura Stock Price Forecast

Morgan Stanley gave the base target price of JPY670 with a high of JPY800 under a bull scenario and JPY380 under the worst-case scenario. The firm gave an “Equal-weight” rating on the largest domestic brokerage’s stock.

“In the short term the stock is likely to outperform Daiwa thanks to ongoing structural reform effects both in the Retail and Wholesale businesses and due to rising market expectations that share buybacks will be announced in 4Q” noted Mia Nagasaka equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“For us to become bullish Nomura Holdings would need to make private areas as well as public areas profitable over the medium term thereby increasing the visibility of the company heading towards generating mid-double-digit ROEs in a stable manner.”

The round was led by existing investors ﻿Sequoia Capital India﻿ with participation from ﻿Norwest Venture Partners﻿ as well as new investors led by KKR with participation from ﻿TVS Capital Funds﻿. The investment values the company at US$1.4 billion (INR103 billion).





Five Star plans to use the capital to expand its lending business to provide much-needed financing solutions to more of India’s small businesses which comprise a large and growing segment of the country’s economy.

The investment will be made through a combination of primary infusion in the company and secondary shares sold by existing investor Morgan Stanley Private Equity. The company’s other existing investors - Matrix Partners and TPG Capital - continue to stay invested.





Speaking on the investment round raised D Lakshmipathy Chairman and Managing Director of Five Star Finance said





“In our mission of ‘Funding the unfunded’ we have created a niche for ourselves empowering small businesses and the self-employed across corners of India by providing them with reliable and responsible funding alternatives. We aim to achieve this social goal through grassroot efforts without compromising on the pillars of asset quality and profitability that are needed to build a sustainable institution of scale.”





“We are grateful to our existing investors - Sequoia Capital India and Norwest for further reposing their faith in us and we are particularly excited to welcome our new investors – KKR through its Global Impact Fund which shares our mission of financial inclusion – and TVS Capital backed by one of the most respected business houses of South India. We are greatly thankful to Morgan Stanley Private Equity fund and specifically Arjun Saigal for having been one of our earliest backers and it is immensely satisfying to have been able to provide them with an excellent financial return” he added.





The investment sees existing investors Sequoia Capital India and Norwest strengthen their commitment to the Company.





G V Ravishankar Managing Director Sequoia India remarked





“Sequoia Capital India is delighted to be investors in Five Star and is strong believers in their business model that bridges the large credit gap that exists for small and micro-enterprises. The strength of the founder and the management team along with the credit processes are visible in how the company has navigated several small and large disruptions including demonetisation GST and now COVID-19 related challenges.""





The firm is happy to strengthen its partnership with Five Star as the company embarks on its next leg of growth - from being successful to becoming significant in the industry"" he added.





Niren Shah Managing Director Norwest India remarked “We are delighted to be deepening our partnership with Five Star as they reach 10x of the scale compared to when we first invested. Five Star has executed exceptionally towards its goal of funding and empowering micro-business entrepreneurs across India in a scalable way. Five Star is well-loved by its customers and continues to have the finest asset quality together with strong growth and robust profitability.”





KKR’s investment is part of its Global Impact Strategy and marks KKR Global Impact Fund’s second investment in India and fifth in the Asia Pacific. The Global Impact Fund is focused on generating risk-adjusted returns by investing in companies that contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”).

An international team of scientists from Tanzania Kenya South Africa and the United States have made a breakthrough in identifying first-ever genetic markers associated with resistance to two deadly cassava viral diseases in two varieties from Tanzania.

Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) are among the greatest constraints to cassava production crop in East Central and Southern Africa where cassava is a major crop for both food and income for millions of small-holder farmers as nearly all cassava varieties grown by farmers are susceptible to either one or both diseases.

An expert with the Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries Ms Esther Masumba said Namikonga and Albert which are grown by farmers in Tanzania able to withstand the devastating CBSD and CMD respectively while other varieties cannot Namikonga and Albert which are genetically related have been grown by farmers in areas that are hotspots for the two viral diseases for many decades and have shown high resistance despite being subjected to the diseases for a long period.

“Namikonga is tolerant to CBSD but highly susceptible to CMD while in contrast Albert is highly susceptible to CBSD but resistant to CMD” she said.

She said in Tanzania the second largest producer of cassava in East Africa after Uganda the diseases have reduced cassava yield by over a half from 10.5 tonnes per hectare to only 5.5 tonnes per hectare in the last twenty years.

She further said the scientists crossed the two Tanzanian varieties and studied a large population of the progeny over two seasons in two disease hotspot areas in the country.

They detected the main resistance to CBSD on chromosomes 2 and 11 and that of CMD on chromosome 12. Several other genomic regions in different chromosomes had a minor influence on the expressed resistance.

“The studies have enabled us to better understand the location of genes we suspect are associated with resistance to CBSD in the DNA of the farmer-preferred cassava variety Namikonga and CMD in the variety Albert” she said.

She said that once validated it will help speed up breeding through marker-assisted selection (MAS) which shortens the breeding cycle and reduces the offspring population that breeders have to work with.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MH370 'shot down by US Air Force to seize electronic equipment on the way to China'

The author of a book on the missing flight MH370 claims the plane was shot down by the US Air Force in a doomed bid to seize electronic equipment bound for China.

The Boeing 777 vanished in 2014 with the loss of all 239 passengers on board. Its disappearance has become one of the greatest mysteries in modern aviation and has sparked dozens of conspiracy theories.

Now a French investigative journalist believes she has solved the puzzle.

Florence de Changy who has been investigating and reporting on the MH370 for many years argues that the American military used signal jamming technology to wipe the plane from radar screens – before shooting it down after a failed attempt to re-direct it.

She argues the US sought to seize sensitive electronic gear on its way to Beijing as The Daily Mail reports.

De Changy makes the case in her new 400-page book 'The Disappearing Act: The Impossible Case of MH370'.

Over 14 chapters she dismisses theories already put forward including the idea that there was a fire on board and that the plane was hijacked.

According to de Changy's hypothesis the US was trying to keep hold of 2.5 tonnes of its ""poorly documented Motorola electronics equipment"" that had not been through the correct security screening.

She writes: ""The shooting down could have been a blunder but it could have also been a last resort to stop the plane and its special cargo from falling into Chinese hands.""

Earlier this year it was reported that wreckage believed to be from flight MH370 indicated the passenger jet crashed into the sea in an uncontrolled high-speed dive.

Independent experts analysed part of a wing spoiler and argued the damage indicated it was torn from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777.

De Changy concedes that her own hypothesis is far-fetched. But she believes she is right to dismiss other theories.

She writes: ""I have established that MH370 did not U-turn did not fly over Malaysia and to cut a long story shot never crashed in the Southern Indian Ocean. Many more clues point to a covert interception attempt that went terribly wrong with a fatal accident happening at 2:40 a.m. between Vietnam and China.""

On one point she is absolutely certain: 'It was not possible […] for a Boeing 777 to have simply disappeared.'

The Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8 2014. It should have landed in Beijing later that day but instead disappeared less than an hour after take-off.

There has been no trace of the passengers or cabin crew. More than three years after the plane vanished debris began to wash up on beaches across the Indian Ocean

The hunt for the missing jet – the most costly and far-reaching search in the history of aviation – was called off in 2018.

There are many theories but still no conclusive answers in the search for the missing Flight MH370.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Current role Graduate Aerospace Engineer

Current employer Rolls-Royce plc

What was your career path after graduating? I started on the Rolls-Royce Engineering Graduate Scheme a couple of months later in September. It was exciting being able to return to Rolls-Royce following a 10-week summer internship I did there in 2019!

What would you like to do next? The Graduate Scheme is 18 months long and in this time I rotate through four different roles. After this I hope to move into a substantive role in the company doing some analytical work where I will hone my skills perhaps as an aerodynamicist. I am also working towards becoming a Chartered Mathematician and in doing so am able to further my mathematical understanding and ability.

How did your degree prepare you for this job? The Applied Maths I specialised in during my degree has given me a strong understanding of fluid dynamics and mechanics which I can now apply to exciting real-world applications in my work. The modules I took on numerical analysis and methods have been especially useful in my job when running computational simulations and having to grasp how they work behind the scenes. I’ve found the rigorous mathematical way of thinking to be a valuable transferrable skill for tackling engineering problems.

What did you enjoy most about your time studying? You can easily find a rhythm when studying a course like Maths so I found I could achieve a good work-life balance. An often-overlooked aspect of the course is the flexibility it gives you; having full reign over what units to take meant I could specialise in the ones that I enjoyed the most and ones which would help towards my career aspirations.

Do you have any advice for prospective students? Whether or not you have an idea of what your career aspirations are Maths is a great degree to have to help you stand out. The detail you go into on a Maths course proves an in-depth understanding and gives you a strong specialism. The one thing that you need alongside this is some realisation of the real-world applications of your work. Definitely try to get an internship or some industry exposure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2wuYWMudWsvbWF0aHMvdW5kZXJncmFkdWF0ZS95b3VyLWNhcmVlci9hbHVtbmktcHJvZmlsZXMvbGlhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liam Holmes | School of Mathematics,"Current role Data Scientist

Current employer LVGIG

What would you like to do next? My current plan is to stay with LV for the near future – opportunities are great in the team and my goal is to reach senior level this year.

How did your degree prepare you for this job? Mathematical problem solving/reasoning skills are directly applicable to the role and ability to read research literature is also useful for staying up to date with the latest techniques.

What did you enjoy most about your time studying at the School of Mathematics? I’m someone who enjoys solving problems and getting into the ‘deep work’ state where you’re highly focused on one problem for an extended period of time. Naturally mathematics provided many opportunities for this and luckily my current role does also!

Do you have any advice or tips for prospective students looking to study Maths at Bristol? Study units you will enjoy – but also think about which ones will add extra value to employers e.g. courses that include; statistics group work presenting coding.",,,,,,,,,

The deal values Cazoo at $7 billion and will also include an extra $1.6 billion in new financing: $805 million cash from AJAX I itself and an $800 million PIPE led by the AJAX sponsors and Cazoo backer D1 Capital Partners with a mix of new and previous investors also participating including Altimeter BlackRock Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley) Fidelity Management Marcho Partners Mubadala Capital Pelham Capital Senator Investment Group and Spruce House Partnership. The deal has already been approved by the boards of Cazoo and AJAX I.

“This announcement is another major milestone in our continued drive to transform the way people buy cars across Europe” said Alex Chesterman OBE Cazoo’s founder and CEO in a statement. “We have created the most comprehensive and fully integrated offering in the largest retail sector which currently has very low digital penetration. This deal will provide us with almost $1 billion of further funds to fuel our growth and I am delighted to be partnering with Dan and his team at AJAX to rapidly expand and deliver the best car buying experience to consumers across Europe.”

Chesterman — who already had a high profile before founding Cazoo (he had also founded LoveFilm acquired by Amazon and used as the first step in its move into building its Netflix competitor Amazon Prime Video; and the property sales site Zoopla) — will remain CEO of the company.

The company plans to use the proceeds of this to continue expanding across Europe after a bumper year. It said it saw sales grow by over 300% and is on track for 2021 revenues to approach $1 billion with annual run rate revenues of $600 million in the first quarter with a business model based mostly around used-car sales but also diversifying for example with a car subscription service.

Cazoo’s deal is a clear marker of how ubiquitous SPACs have become as an option for privately held companies with a lot of money already on their cap tables to take the next step short of a more classic IPO on their own steam — a lengthy process that might not fit their financials or time constraints — or getting acquired. It’s also a sign of how companies based outside of the U.S. are also taking this route to list on the country’s public markets which in the case of Cazoo will give it access to a wider group of investors than listing in the U.K. would have done.

It shows some leverage on the part of investors to bring in their own financing and strategic control to direct the companies as more than just financial backers and indeed Dan Och will be joining Cazoo’s board.

“We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to partner with Alex and the exceptional team at Cazoo. Alex has proven to be one of Europe’s most successful serial entrepreneurs and we are proud to be supporting the growth of this world-class team brand and platform” said Ochs in a statement. “With their constant focus on innovation data and customer satisfaction I have no doubt that Cazoo is going to continue to lead the way in this massive untapped market opportunity and am looking forward to joining the Board of Cazoo and working with Alex and his team.”

But it also represents another way for them to get in on what appear to be strong businesses in the long term at a time when technology continues to be a huge business opportunity.

“As a long-term investor in Cazoo and believer in its leadership team we are pleased to continue supporting Cazoo’s growth as a public company” said Daniel Sundheim the founder of D1 Capital Partners in a statement. “While Cazoo had many options for funding its strategy its decision to merge with AJAX and join with Dan Och and other renowned partners was a good one that will have positive implications for the company and its future.”

In the case of Cazoo the company has been in the right place at the right time it seems.

In a COVID-19 pandemic year where people stayed away from in-person shopping in the the U.K. — and also to reduce contact with others opted to use their own private vehicles rather than public or liveried transportation to get around — Cazoo sold and delivered 20000 cars over its digital platform.

Cazoo plans to expand both that sales portal and other businesses lines such as a car subscription service it runs which currently has 6000+ subscribers in the U.K. Germany and France. The company was founded in 2018 and in the midst of the pandemic last year raised $427 million in funding first $116 million in March 2020 and then a further $311 million in October. The latter round valued Cazoo at just over $2.5 billion meaning that this latest SPAC represents a big price hike.

SPACs have quickly become a well-trodden alternative as the number of startups that have already raised a lot of money from private backers continues to multiply. In a few cases SPACs have come after testing the waters for IPOs did not go anywhere fast: Witness WeWork last week announcing a $9 billion SPAC last week coming on the heels of a major restructuring after its attempt to IPO in 2019 valued at $47 billion ended up in flames.

Others represent exit options for companies that have been around for years but haven’t fit the bill for a more traditional IPO. Indeed eToro a 14-year-old Israeli trading platform that has been doubling down on digital and crypto currencies earlier this month also announced a merger with a SPAC valuing it at $10.4 billion.

Others (and it seems Cazoo falls into this third category) are using them as a faster way of listing publicly and fundraising through those channels to bypass some of the longer and expensive processes of a more standard IPO. Grab southeast Asia’s big on-demand rides provider that has expanded into a plethora of other services as a “super app” is also reportedly considering a SPAC to speed up its plans to publicly list in the U.S.

Ultimately while billions in valuations continue to be created through these and many more SPACs that have hit the market it remains to be seen how SPAC’d companies will fare longer term on the public markets and specifically whether those public market investors prove to be as interested in backing these highly scaling but perhaps not profitable (yet?) models longer term as those private investors were when they put in hundreds of millions for shorter-term gains. (And of course it also remains to be seen what direction these companies will now take as public entities.)

In fact the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 61.9%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.

Apple’s Big Run: One company that has been a good investment in the last year has been iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Apple recently unveiled its family of iPhone 12 models which are the first to be compatible with 5G mobile networks.

Analysts are expecting 5G iPhones to trigger yet another massive global upgrade cycle among existing iPhone users.

When iPhone sales growth began to slow in recent years Apple made a massive pivot to a recurring services model a transition that is ongoing to this day.

As of the fiscal first quarter of 2021 Apple said it now has a massive installed user base of more than 1.65 billion active devices. Apple’s Services segment is all about further monetizing that user base and services revenue generates an impressive gross profit margin of about 68%.

Fortunately for Apple investors the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 didn’t negatively impact its business much at all.

In fact the iPhone 12 helped generate 5.5% revenue growth for Apple in fiscal 2020. Net profit was also up 3.9% to $57.4 billion on the year.

At the beginning of 2020 Apple shares were trading at around $296. By the beginning of March the stock was down to $282 after news of the coronavirus spreading in China prompting concerns about a U.S. pandemic.

Apple ultimately bottomed at $212.61 during the pandemic-driven March sell-off. Fortunately for Apple investors the dip did not last long.

By June Apple shares were back at new all-time highs above $330 and was as high as $514.14 in August prior to a four-to-one stock split.

Apple In 2021 Beyond: The stock eventually made it back up to new split-adjusted highs of $145.09 in January 2021.

In recent days the stock has pulled back from its highs settling back down to $120.

Still Apple investors who bought one year ago and held on have generated a big return on their investment. In fact $1000 in Apple stock bought on March 26 2020 would be worth about $1968 today assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead analysts are expecting even more upside for Apple in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 37 analysts covering the stock is $155 suggesting a 28.5% upside from current levels.

Now that's turning to fear,"CNN Business —

Screenwriter and director Ruchi Narain struggled for decades to find steady work in the Indian film industry.

Even with two major critically acclaimed films under her belt — “Kal: Yesterday and Tomorrow” a thriller she wrote and directed and “Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi” a political drama that won Bollywood’s equivalent of an Academy Award — the work just wouldn’t come.

“I struggled a lot because I am an outsider and a woman” Narain told CNN Business. “I was meeting people every week but it all went nowhere.” That changed when Netflix (NFLX) arrived in India in 2016.

Since then the Mumbai-based filmmaker says she has “been inundated with work.” Her film “Guilty” — a social issues drama about a rape investigation — was released by the streaming giant in 2020. In the same year Disney+ Hotstar released her 8-part comedy series “Hundred.”

Now increasing government scrutiny of these more provocative projects and other groundbreaking stories is worrying Narain and many other creators in Mumbai the home of India’s film industry.

Original shows on Amazon Prime and Netflix have lately drawn ire from Indian politicians and regular citizens who consider these films and TV shows insensitive to cultural and religious beliefs.

Police complaints have also piled up against creators and company executives and some of the offenses they have been accused of — including committing “deliberate or malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings” — carry prison terms of up to three years a fine or both. And in recent months Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has announced new rules and guidelines for streaming services though no explicit bans on particular themes.

India’s creative community now fears that streaming services may buckle under the pressure and refrain from touching stories that are even remotely controversial. It’s a troubling sign for an industry that had just begun experimenting with new forms of storytelling and producing shows capable of worldwide appeal. Just last year Delhi Crime a Netflix drama series based on the real rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in India’s capital won an international Emmy.

Start of a new era

The arrival of Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix in India has been a boon to directors and writers like Narain who had long languished on the fringes of Bollywood — an industry often accused of nepotism. Several filmmakers told CNN Business they thought the international streaming services introduced a degree of professionalism.

“I co-directed a film called ‘House Arrest’ which was released on Netflix in 2019 and everyone on set was thrilled just because they were getting paid on time” said Samit Basu novelist and filmmaker. He added that the culture changed to one where rigorous research and development were commonplace.

“A lot of book rights were auctioned and writers’ rooms started happening” Basu added. “Earlier people in the film industry hardly ever read books.”

More importantly these companies made it possible for storytellers to explore subjects that had previously been untouched.

Bollywood films are hamstrung by the Central Board of Film Certification which forces filmmakers to remove everything from kisses and swear words to shots of drug abuse — once even from a film about drug abuse. Indian TV which is also regulated by the government is dominated by often regressive stories about housewives and mothers-in-law.

Streaming content broke that mold because it was until recently unregulated by the government. “Sacred Games” Netflix’s first original series in the country shocked Indian viewers by casting well-known actors in a show that liberally made use of abusive language violence and nudity. The program was compared to “Narcos” Netflix’s hit American drama about Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar.

Amazon’s first series in the country meanwhile was “Inside Edge” — a show about the dark underbelly of cricket a sport that is worshipped in India. Both “Inside Edge and “Sacred Games” were nominated for International Emmy awards.

Several other shows on the platforms have also taken an unflinching look at subjects ranging from politics to female sexuality which Bollywood and Indian TV have typically shied away from. “I am glad I did my film for Netflix because they did not dilute anything” said Narain referring to her project “Guilty.”

When a kiss offends

Politically-fueled uproar over shows on these international video platforms isn’t new. “Sacred Games” which was released in 2018 managed to offend lawmakers from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress Party. In 2019 a politician from the BJP filed a police complaint against the creator of the show for a “scene which disrespects Sikh religious symbol Kada.”

But lately the political and public outrage has reached a crescendo.

Netflix faced boycott calls in November over “A Suitable Boy” an adaptation of the award-winning novel of the same name by author Vikram Seth. Some viewers and BJP politicians were angered by a scene that depicts a Hindu man and a Muslim woman kissing in a temple which led to complaints against Netflix executives. The company did not respond to CNN Business’s request for an update on these complaints.

In January Amazon’s political drama “Tandav” — which has been likened to the Netflix series “House of Cards” — faced a backlash from politicians who said they complained to the police about the company and the show’s creators for depicting Hindu Gods in a derogatory way. Aparna Purohit the Head of India Originals at Amazon Prime Video was questioned by police for several hours.

Both Amazon and the show’s creators issued an apology. “We respect our viewers’ diverse beliefs and apologize unconditionally” Amazon said in a statement.

That same month an Indian journalist filed a police complaint against Amazon’s crime series “Mirzapur” for “showing the city of Mirzapur in a bad light” according to media reports. And this month the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights asked Netflix to stop streaming “Bombay Begums” a drama about five ambitious women because of its “inappropriate portrayal” of children who were shown sniffing cocaine.

The government has also taken official action to rein in streaming services and the content they provide. Last November the Information and Broadcasting Ministry brought the previously unregulated services within its scope.

Three months later the government announced new rules for online content including a requirement for video platforms to classify their content into age-based categories. They also have to appoint a “grievance redressal officer” in India who has to address every complaint made against the company within 15 days.

While activists have criticized these rules the government said the video streaming services must be “responsible and accountable” for their content.

“India is tolerant and will remain tolerant” India’s technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Thursday. “But the limits of tolerance and standards of tolerance should not be judged on the creating freedom or abuse of a particular producer of an OTT platform.”

The new rules do not explicitly ban any type of content — but the vague scope of the regulations is also exactly why filmmakers who spoke to CNN Business were troubled. A wide range of topics have already been targeted with complaints and outrage leaving creators second-guessing and self-censoring.

“In India anyone can have a problem with anything. In India people confuse what a character is saying with what the writer believes” said Sumit Purohit who wrote for “Inside Edge” and “Scam 1992” a web series on Sony’s streaming service SonyLiv. “How can you make a series like the ‘Mindhunter’ here?” he asked referring to a Netflix show about serial killers.

Purohit also described the impact of self-censorship on a writer saying that it “makes you angry frustrated” because “that is not how any art is created.”

The backlash from all sides — politicians journalists national agencies and even regular citizens — is hard for American services to fight in India a key overseas market as they are wary of getting on the wrong side of the government.

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in 2018 his “next 100 million” users would come from India. In Dec 2019 he said his company would spend 30 billion rupees ($413 million) on original content over the next two years in India. And Amazon’s Jeff Bezos has said that “it [Prime Video] is doing well everywhere but there’s nowhere it is doing better than in India.”

A chilling effect

There are already some signs that the industry might be regressing. Earlier this month Reuters reported citing unnamed sources that “companies like Amazon’s Prime Video and Netflix are inspecting planned shows and scripts with some even deleting scenes that could be controversial.”

A few days later the Indian financial newspaper Mint reported citing anonymous sources that Amazon had canceled the second season of the crime series “Paatal Lok” which was praised for its portrayal of corruption and caste discrimination.

Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on the reports.

“Nothing that has politics in it is being touched [commissioned] right now” said Josy Joseph an investigative journalist whose media platform is collaborating with the creator of “Sacred Games” to make a series about Tihar Jail India’s largest prison.

“There is a massive depression that has set into the creative minds of Mumbai” he said. “They are scared and writers are winding down to mediocrity. They are going back to telling saas-bahu stories or conservative romance.” (Saas-bahu means “mother-in-law and daughter-in-law” in Hindi.)

While production isn’t slowing down — Netflix has announced 40 new shows and movies from India — Basu worries that production houses in the future may go for content that is “unambiguously safe” and “assumes that the audience’s intelligence is zero.”

Just weeks after Prime Video executive Purohit was questioned by police the platform announced it would produce its first film in Bollywood the stronghold of traditional Indian movie making. “Ram Setu” will “highlight our Indian heritage” said Vijay Subramanium the head of content at Amazon Prime Video India in a statement.

Some filmmakers are less pessimistic about their creative freedom.

Karan Anshuman one of the creators of “Mirzapur” and “Inside Edge” said he felt it was “too early to react” to the heightened scrutiny adding that he would rather “wait and watch.”

But film writer Arpita Chatterjee said it is too late to rein in the Indian filmmaking community now.

“We can’t just go back 20 years” Chatterjee said. “The world is at a different place and storytellers are at a different place. You can’t just put the genie back in the bottle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1hc2lhLWluZGlhLTU2NTIzMTQ40gE2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWFzaWEtaW5kaWEtNTY1MjMxNDguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Netflix show putting the spotlight on menopause,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ2FtZS10aHJvbmVzLXdlaXNzLWJlbmlvZmYtbmV0ZmxpeC1zaG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Upcoming Netflix Show From Game Of Thrones Creators Weiss & Benioff,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ2FtZS10aHJvbmVzLXdlaXNzLWJlbmlvZmYtbmV0ZmxpeC1zaG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXNob3dzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcy13ZWVrLXRoZS1sb3N0LXBpcmF0ZS1raW5nZG9tLTIwMjEtM9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXNob3dzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcy13ZWVrLXRoZS1sb3N0LXBpcmF0ZS1raW5nZG9tLTIwMjEtMz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top shows on Netflix this week: 'The Lost Pirate Kingdom',"""Ginny and Georgia"" was Netflix's most popular series for the third week in a row.

Kere to Country specialises in the provision of fresh meat to Aboriginal communities in a sustainable and cost-effective way both in Alice Springs and surrounding communities where food quality and affordability remains a significant issue.

It is estimated that 1.2 million people cannot regularly provide themselves with a culturally appropriate safe and nutritious food supply from a non-emergency source.

According to Kere to Country CEO Jessice Wishart Alice Springs and its surrounding areas are in desperate need of this kind of support.

“Food insecurity is a massive issue in our communities particularly in remote Aboriginal Communities. Kere to Country look forward to working with Foodbank in this space ensuring accessibility and culturally appropriate service delivery for all.”

The Foodbank Food Hub will allow low income families a place to access items at an affordable price thanks to Newmont Australia’s recent donation of $250000 donation as part of the Newmont Global Community Support Fund.

The Food Hub will enable Foodbank to distribute up to an additional 250000 kg for those in need in the region in the first 12 months of operation.

This is equivalent to an additional 500000 meals for families in need and there are hopes to increase this number every year.

The Foodbank Food Hub will be set up like a general store where those in need can have a dignified shopping experience and purchase items at a significantly reduced cost.

In addition to this all fruit and vegetables will be free of charge to promote a balanced diet.

“At present the CEO of Kere to Country Jessica Wishart and I are meeting with agencies servicing Alice Springs to consult with community elders ministers the business community and other charities” said Greg Pattinson CEO Foodbank South Australia.

“The Alice Springs Food Hub will enable agencies to refer their clients who are in need of food relief reducing the burden placed on agencies caused by the rising level of need.”

Recognising it’s continued growth in 2016 Nathaniel Anthony and Chris Anastasi started selling and packaging clothing out of their small bedroom. Now the duo are planning to move into a 4000sq m warehouse before the end of the year.

Speaking to News Corp Mr Anastasi said the pair struggled in coming up with ways to turn their small business into a large-scale money maker in the early stage of production.

“The biggest challenge was the cash flow” he said to News Corp.

“We would sell a lot but the next order would have to be big enough to fulfil growth so we were reinvesting money from the sales and we weren’t really able to get ahead until a few years down the track.”

Anastasi added that ‘Muscle Nation’ managed to bring the fitness community and athletes on board and promote their workouts and nutrition advice.

“Having a lot of eyes and feedback on social media we expanded really quickly into fashion and these days we have to stay on trend.”

“We worked really hard on style and bringing out new collections designs and colours every four to six weeks and it meant we didn’t over commit to stock as we wanted to bring collections out more frequently.

“We worked out demand in the market for cuts style length and types of design through trial and error but this helped us pivot fast to where demand is.”

The company’s success sprouted most notably in the 2020 Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales which saw them gain nearly $10 million across those two days. The duo said they are on track to make $50 million by the end of the financial year.

Revealing the secrets to their success Mr Anthony said anyone can sell activewear but it’s their customer service that sets them apart.

Warren Buffett is widely considered the greatest investor of all time. And rightfully so. His company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.05%) (BRK.B 0.06%) has handily outperformed the market since its inception. However Berkshire has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years -- largely because Buffett didn't own many of the growth stocks that drove the market's return.

Out of the 48 companies Berkshire Hathaway owns none of them are renewable energy stocks. Let's break down the reasons why Buffett has steered clear of renewables and why now might be the best time to alter his course.

Explaining Berkshire Hathaway Energy

It's important to first understand Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) and how it fits into Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway owns 91.1% of BHE. Buffett considers BHE part of his ""big four"" along with insurance companies 100% ownership of the largest U.S. railroad by freight volume (BNSF) and 5.4% ownership of Apple (AAPL 0.28%).

BHE is a leading U.S. energy operator meaning it's in a similar business as other utilities and energy infrastructure companies. BHE is huge owning over $100 billion in assets and generating $3.4 billion in 2020 net income. The vast majority of its holdings are regulated electric and natural gas utilities transmission and distribution businesses dealing mainly with fossil fuels. BHE Renewables is the primary exception.

As of 2020 year-end BHE Renewables has interests in 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power projects and has invested over $6 billion in 32 third-party wind energy projects. In 2020 BHE Renewables generated $936 million in revenue and $521 million in net income. For comparison Brookfield Renewable Corporation -- which is valued at $7.7 billion and owns and operates similar renewable assets to BHE -- has 18.8 GW of renewable capacity and generated $3.09 billion in 2020 revenue. So yes Buffett likes energy. But BHE doesn't own that many renewable energy assets for its size.

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio

Now that we have a better handle of how BHE fits into Berkshire Hathaway as a whole the remainder of our discussion will focus on Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies (not its subsidiaries).

Berkshire's portfolio has changed a lot over the last five years most notably with the purchase of Apple in 2016. Since then Apple has ballooned to become Berkshire's largest holding. Worth over $108 billion Apple stock comprises a staggering 38% of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded companies. Buffett has also added Snowflake and StoneCo two hyper-growth stocks that go against his traditional value investing bent. Since Buffett owns so much Apple his portfolio is actually double the tech concentration of the S&P 500. Buffett is also overweight financials and consumer staples and underweight every other sector. In fact Buffett's portfolio looks nothing like the S&P 500. The following charts compare the two.

Buffett has had a concentrated portfolio for decades -- so Berkshire's starkly contrasting allocation compared to the market isn't all too surprising. However what is surprising is that he hasn't added any renewables stocks given his openness to growth industries.

Why Buffett has avoided renewable energy stocks

The most likely reason Buffett has avoided renewables is profitability and valuation. Despite the growth trajectory the industry tends to be cyclical and can even be unprofitable. It seems like a distant memory now but 2016 was a downturn in the solar industry. The average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF lost 45% of its value in just one year. Fast forward to 2020 and the average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF went up over 230% and the average stock in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF gained 59%.

The narrative has flipped in 2021 as renewables are heavily underperforming the market. Although there are valid reasons why renewables are selling off right now discounted prices could give Buffett a more attractive entry point into a new sector. Renewables remain cyclical but costs have come down and established players have shown they can better manage profits throughout market cycles.

Renewable energy stocks worth consideration

Renewable energy stocks would fit perfectly in Berkshire's portfolio. Despite the sell-off the long-term tailwinds for renewable energy are brighter than ever before.

There are plenty of different ways to invest in the sector. As a utility operator BHE is already investing in a big part of the renewable supply chain. However a well-run utility like NextEra Energy (NEE 0.83%) stands out as a good buy. NextEra Energy Resources the company's renewable division had over $5 billion in 2020 revenue and a renewable capacity of over 27 GW at 2020 year-end. NextEra's overall business has a track record for earnings and dividend growth and is the largest U.S. utility by market cap.

Buffett could also invest in an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) like General Electric or Siemens. These companies design specifications and manage renewable energy projects. GE in particular has been targeting some big-time renewable growth.

Finally Buffett could go for a more pure-play renewable energy stock. Market leaders like Enphase Energy that ran too far too fast in 2020 have since come down in price and could be a good fit. If Buffett was feeling particularly adventurous smaller companies like wind blade manufacturer TPI Composites could be worth a look.

Takeaways

BHE is a core part of Berkshire Hathaway but its renewable assets are minor given the size of Buffett's holdings. Aside from utility operators Buffett lacks significant exposure to other aspects of renewable energy. If Buffett is open to investing in Snowflake and StoneCo then he could stand to benefit from adding some growing renewable energy stocks as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rating: About this rating Mixture What's True Lil Nas X partnered with MSCHF to create a limited edition ""Satan shoe"" that MSCHF says contains a drop of human blood. The shoes are Nike Air Max 97s. What's False Although the shoes are Nikes a Nike spokesperson told us the company has nothing to do with the creation or sale of the ""Satan shoes.""

Rapper Lil Nas X released the music video for his song ""Montero"" on March 25 2021 and the internet took note. The video features the musician whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill seducing Satan and stealing his horns.

Shortly after viral company MSCHF announced via the website satan.shoes that it would be offering infernal Nike sneakers. According to the website the shoes will contain a drop of human blood mixed with ink in the sole and only 666 pairs will be made available.

Because the shoes in question are Nike Air Max 97s readers asked Snopes whether the brand Nike was partnering with Lil Nas X to create the Satan shoes. ""Nike did not release nor design these shoes"" a spokesperson for Nike told us in an email.

According to a January 2020 profile published by Business Insider the seller of the Satan shoes MSCHF has become known for ""creating some of the most absurd cynical and viral projects and products that have spread across the internet."" Business Insider described MSCHF as a ""seven-person company"" that has made products that ""range from an astrology-based stock trading app to a toaster-shaped bathbomb to Holy Water-filled sneakers.""

Indeed while internet users can locate ""Satan shoes"" at satan.shoes they can also find ""Jesus shoes"" at jesus.shoes (but those are sold out).

MSCHF founding team member Daniel Greenberg told Snopes in an email that the ""Satan shoes"" leaked early on Twitter but won't be available until 11 a.m. on March 29. He added that Lil Nas X did indeed collaborate with MSCHF on the product and that the blood in the shoes comes courtesy of the MSCHF team.

Greenberg explained that MSCHF buys the shoes from Nike then MSCHF artists make their own creative modifications before selling them.

Nike on Sunday denied collaborating with rapper Little Nas X on his controversial “Satan Shoes” — which feature a drop of human blood and demonic imagery according to a report.

“We do not have a relationship with Little Nas X or MSCHF” Nike told NBC in a statement. “Nike did not design or release these shoes and we do not endorse them.”

The “Old Town Road” singer raised hell over the weekend when he released a devilish version of Nike’s classic Air Max ’97 sneakers featuring the symbol “x/666” red ink and a single drop of human blood.

The $1018 kicks made in collaboration with the company MSCHF also display Bible scripture from Luke 10:18 which references Satan’s banishment from heaven.

But Little Nas X and Nike caught heat for the fiery fashion statement on Palm Sunday prompting the firm to distance itself from the product NBC reported.

On Sunday the hip hop artist defended the shoes tweeting “Y’all gotta admit… the shoes hard! u cannot sit here and lie.”

In his new video “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” Lil Nas X falls into hell and gives the devil a lap dance after leaving the Garden of Eden.

It all happened when the multi-media account @Saint broke the news of an alleged collaboration between rapper Lil Nas X and MSCHF dubbed “Satan Shoes” which is said to feature a custom pair of Nike Air Max 97s with 60cc ink one drop of human blood and a $1018 price tag. And because they are being called Satan Shoes after all the sneaker is said to be limited to 666 pairs when it’s expected to drop on March 29. The shoes naturally have quickly caused controversy — and Nike wants nothing to do with them the company tells Input.

“We do not have a relationship with Little Nas X or MSCHF” a Nike spokesperson said in a statement sent to Input. “Nike did not design or release these shoes and we do not endorse them.” The company did not say whether it plans to send a cease and desist to Lil Nas X and MSCFH though if that were to happen the rapper and the brand could make the argument that the shoes are simply an art project — which could offer some legal shielding. Of course this isn’t the first time MSCHF a creative label based out of Brooklyn has worked on a religion-themed sneaker following the drop of its “Jesus Shoes” back in 2019 — which came with holy water inside the Nike Air bubble.

(Update: Nike has sued MSCHF over its Lil Nas X Satan Shoes.)

Bible script — Aside from the human blood and 666 ties Lil Nas X and MSCHF’s Satan Shoes come with a graphic religious detail on the upper that says “Luke 10:18” an excerpt from The Bible that reads “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” There’s also a charm on each shoe of a Pentagram AKA The Devil’s Star and a packaging full of artwork that includes a drawing of Satan walking up to Jesus according to product photos acquired by Saint.

So why would this shoe be coming out right now? Well Lil Nas X of “Old Town Road” fame has just launched a music video called “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).” In it he can be seen giving Satan a lap dance before snapping his neck killing him and taking over his evil powers. That falls right along with the aesthetic of the Satan Shoes done in partnership with MSCFH and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Nike would condemn the use of one if its most iconic silhouettes to get Lil Nas X’s religious message across.

A drop (of blood)? — The question now is whether the sneakers will actually release on March 29 or if Nike has a last-minute plan to stop them from ever seeing the light of day. Given the controversy the Satan Shoes have already caused all over Instagram and Twitter — where conservative people who aren’t aware that Nike did not actually design or make the shoe are calling for the brand to be boycotted — someone at the sportswear giant’s headquarters right now is likely going over what its next steps should be.

Whatever Nike decides to do the story of Lil Nas X and MSCHF’s devil sneakers hasn’t even officially begun and it didn’t take long for a hype around them to be created — good or bad. That means that if MSCHF does launch them as it supposedly plans to the 666 pairs priced at over $1K retail are only going to skyrocket in the secondary market where collectors will see them as more of a piece of art now that Nike has come out against them. But will anyone trying to buy a pair um pray to god they can get one?

Update: MSCHF gave Input the following statement about its demonic Lil Nas X collab: “We confirm that we did not work with Nike. They had zero involvement with the shoe.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9saS1uaW5nLWNoYWxsZW5nZS1uaWtlLXhpYW8temhhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Li Ning Ready To Challenge Nike In China?,"What happened

On March 26 the Chinese sportswear giant Li Ning announced boy band X NINE member Xiao Zhan as its global ambassador for trendy sports products. In its campaign post the idol wears a full Li Ning look which sold out in under twenty minutes online. The hashtag #LiNingofficiallyannouncesXiaoZhan gained over 1 billion views as a shopping frenzy took hold. With consumers desperate to buy the collection the company released a full list of the 83 offline boutiques that offer its products where they were quickly snapped up as well.

The Jing Take

Li Ning’s appointment comes at a time when enraged netizens want substitutes for Western brands that have been embroiled in the Xinjiang cotton controversy. Amid the current backlash faced by international competitors chiefly Nike and Adidas Li Ning's shares jumped to 10.74 percent indicating a surge in support from local patriotic consumers.

Yet support for the domestic group had already been steadily building. In 2020 Li Ning saw its revenue increase 4.2 percent year-on-year to 2.2 billion. Native brands are clearly benefitting from China's rising appetite for “guochao” (国潮) among the younger generation and the “Made in China” label is no longer considered poor quality but rather a source of pride.

In recent years the affordable sportswear brand has started to rebrand itself by showcasing its fashions on an international stage and evolving with the middle-to-high-end sportswear market allowing it to compete with Western sportswear brands. The current “guochao” trend is advantageous for the brand and Zhan’s 28 million followers will surely help boost Li Ning’s image. For the moment it will be hard to estimate the long-term impact of the Xinjiang controversy on international players. But the rise of local brands will undoubtedly continue to derail global brands in the Mainland.

By Todd Miller / TomDispatch

In late February I drove to see the Trump wall in Sasabe Arizona. As soon as I parked a green-striped Border Patrol vehicle stationed a quarter of a mile away began to creep down the dirt road toward us. Just ahead a dystopian “No Trespassing” sign was flapping in the wind. It was cold as I stepped out of the car with my five-year-old son William. The wall ahead of us 30-feet high with steel bollards was indeed imposing as it quavered slightly in the wind. Through its bars we could see Mexico a broken panorama of hills filled with mesquites backed by a blue sky.

The Homeland Security vehicle soon pulled up next to us. An agent rolled down his window and asked me “What are you doing? Joyriding?”

After I laughed in response to a word I hadn’t heard in years the agent informed us that we were in a dangerous construction zone even if this part of the wall had been built four months earlier. I glanced around. There were no bulldozers excavators or construction equipment of any sort. I wondered whether the lack of machinery reflected the campaign promise of the recently inaugurated Joe Biden that “not another foot” of Trump’s wall would be built.

Indeed that was why I was here — to see what the border looked like as the post-Trump era began. President Biden had started his term with strong promises to reverse the border policies of his predecessor: families torn apart would be reunited and asylum seekers previously forced to stay in Mexico allowed to enter the United States. Given the Trump years the proposals of the new administration sounded almost revolutionary.

And yet something else bothered me as we drove away: everything looked the same as it had for years. I’ve been coming to this stretch of border since 2001. I’ve witnessed its incremental disfigurement during the most dramatic border fortification period in this country’s history. In the early 2000s came an influx of Border Patrol agents followed in 2007 by the construction of a 15-foot wall (that Senator Joe Biden voted for) followed by high-tech surveillance towers courtesy of a multi-billion-dollar contract with the Boeing Corporation.

Believe me the forces that shaped our southern border over the decades have been far more powerful than Donald Trump or any individual politician. During the 2020 election it was commonly asserted that by getting rid of Trump the United States would create a more humane border and immigration system. And there was a certain truth to that but a distinctly limited one. Underneath the theater of partisan politics there remains a churning border-industrial complex a conjunction of entrenched interests and relationships between the U.S. government — particularly the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) — and private corporations that has received very little attention.

The small border town of Sasabe and its surrounding region is a microcosm of this.

The cumulative force of that complex will now carry on in Trump’s wake. Indeed during the 2020 election the border industry created through decades of bipartisan fortification actually donated more money to the Biden campaign and the Democrats than to Trump and the Republicans.

The Complex

In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dolled out 105000 contracts or a breathtaking average of 24 contracts a day worth $55 billion to private contractors. That sum exceeded their $52 billion collective budgets for border and immigration enforcement for the 28 years from 1975 to 2003. While those contracts included ones for companies like Fisher Sand and Gravel that built the 30-foot wall my son and I saw in Sasabe many of them — including the most expensive — went to companies creating high-tech border fortification ranging from sophisticated camera systems to advanced biometric and data-processing technologies.

This might explain the border industry’s interest in candidate Biden who promised: “I’m going to make sure that we have border protection but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it.”

Behind that bold declarative sentence lay an all-too-familiar version of technological border protection sold as something so much more innocuous harmless and humane than what Trump was offering. As it happens despite our former president’s urge to create a literal wall across hundreds of miles of borderlands high-technology has long been and even in the Trump years remained a large part of the border-industrial complex.

One pivotal moment for that complex came in 2005 when the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Jackson (previously Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer) addressed a conference room of border-industry representatives about creating a virtual or technological wall. “This is an unusual invitation” he said then. “I want to make sure you have it clearly that we’re asking you to come back and tell us how to do our business. We’re asking you. We’re inviting you to tell us how to run our organization.”

Of course by then the border and immigration enforcement system had already been on a growth spurt. During President Bill Clinton’s administration (1993-2001) for example its annual budgets had nearly tripled from $1.5 billion to $4.3 billion. Clinton in fact initiated the immigration deterrence system still in place today in which Washington deployed armed agents barriers and walls as well as high-tech systems to block the traditional urban places where immigrants had once crossed. They were funneled instead into dangerous and deadly spots like the remote and brutal Arizona desert around Sasabe. As Clinton put it in his 1995 State of the Union address:

“[O]ur administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.”

Sound familiar?

The Clinton years however already seemed like ancient times when Jackson made that 2005 plea. He was speaking in the midst of a burgeoning Homeland Security era. After all DHS was only created in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. In fact during George W. Bush’s years in office border and immigration enforcement budgets grew from $4.2 billion in 2000 to $15.2 billion in 2008 — more that is than during any other presidency including Donald Trump’s. Under Bush that border became another front in the war on terror (even if no terrorists crossed it) opening the money faucets. And that was what Jackson was underscoring — the advent of a new reality that would produce tens of thousands of contracts for private companies.

In addition as U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq began to wane many security and defense companies pivoted toward the new border market. As one vendor pointed out to me at a Border Security Expo in Phoenix in 2012 “We are bringing the battlefield to the border.” That vendor who had been a soldier in Afghanistan a few years earlier smiled confidently the banners of large weapons-makers like Raytheon hanging above him. At the time (as now) an “unprecedented boom period” was forecast for the border market. As the company VisionGain explained then a “virtuous circle… would continue to drive spending in the long term based on three interlocking developments: ‘illegal immigration and terrorist infiltration’ more money for border policing in ‘developing countries’ and the ‘maturation’ of new technologies.”

Since 9/11 border-security corporate giants became big campaign contributors not only to presidential candidates but also to key members of the Appropriations Committees and the Homeland Security Committees (both House and Senate) — all crucial when it came to border policies contracts and budgets. Between 2006 and 2018 top border contractors like General Dynamics Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Raytheon contributed a total of $27.6 million to members of the House Appropriations Committee and $6.5 million to members of the House Homeland Security Committee. And from 2002 to 2019 there were nearly 20000 reported lobbying “visits” to congressional offices related to homeland security. The 2841 visits reported for 2018 alone included ones from top CBP and ICE contractors Accenture CoreCivic GeoGroup L3Harris and Leidos.

By the time Donald Trump entered the White House in 2017 the border-industrial complex was truly humming. That year he would oversee a $20-billion border and immigration budget and have at his disposal nearly 20000 Border Patrol agents (up from 4000 in 1994) 650 miles of already built walls and barriers billions of dollars in border technology then in place and more than 200 immigration-detention centers across the United States.

He claimed he was going to build his very own “big fat beautiful wall” most of which as it turned out already existed. He claimed that he was going to clamp down on a border that was already remarkably clamped down upon. And in his own fashion he took it to new levels.

That’s what we saw in Sasabe where a 15-foot wall had recently been replaced with a 30-foot wall. As it happened much of the 450 miles of wall the Trump administration did in the end build really involved interchanging already existing smaller barriers with monstrous ones that left remarkable environmental and cultural destruction in their wake.

Trump administration policies forced people seeking asylum to wait in Mexico infants to appear in immigration court and separated family members into a sprawling incarceration apparatus whose companies had been making up to $126 per person per day for years. He could have done little of this without the constantly growing border-industrial complex that preceded him and in important ways made him.

Nonetheless in the 2020 election campaign the border industry pivoted toward Biden and the Democrats. That pivot ensured one thing: that its influence would be strong if not preeminent on such issues when the new administration took over.

The Biden Years Begin at the Border

In early January 2021 Biden’s nominee to run DHS Alejandro Mayorkas disclosed that over the previous three years he had earned $3.3 million from corporate clients with the WilmerHale law firm. Two of those clients were Northrop Grumman and Leidos companies that Nick Buxton and I identified as top border contractors in Biden’s Border: The Industry the Democrats and the 2020 Election a report we co-authored for the Transnational Institute.

When we started to look at the 2020 campaign contributions of 13 top border contractors for CBP and ICE we had no idea what to expect. It was after all a corporate group that included producers of surveillance infrastructure for the high-tech “virtual wall” along the border like L3Harris General Dynamics and the Israeli company Elbit Systems; others like Palantir and IBM produced border data-processing software; and there were also detention companies like CoreCivic and GeoGroup.

To our surprise these companies had given significantly more to the Biden campaign ($5364994) than to Trump ($1730435). In general they had shifted to the Democrats who garnered 55% of their $40 million in campaign contributions including donations to key members of the House and Senate Appropriations and Homeland Security committees.

It’s still too early to assess just what will happen to this country’s vast border-and-immigration apparatus under the Biden administration which has made promises about reversing Trumpian border policies. Still it will be no less caught in the web of the border-industrial complex than the preceding administration.

Perhaps a glimpse of the future border under Biden was offered when on January 19th Homeland Security secretary nominee Mayorkas appeared for his Senate confirmation hearings and was asked about the 8000 people from Honduras heading for the U.S. in a “caravan” at that very moment. The day before U.S.-trained troops and police in Guatemala had thwarted and then deported vast numbers of them as they tried to cross into that country. Many in the caravan reported that they were heading north thanks to back-to-back catastrophic category 4 hurricanes that had devastated the Honduran and Nicaraguan coasts in November 2020.

Mayorkas responded rather generically that if people were found to qualify “under the law to remain in the United States then we will apply the law accordingly if they do not qualify to remain in the United States then they won’t.” Given that there is no climate-refugee status available to anyone crossing the border that meant most of those who finally made it (if they ever did) wouldn’t qualify to stay.

It’s possible that by the time I went to see that wall with my son in late February some people from that caravan had already made it to the border despite endless obstacles in their path. As we drove down Highway 286 also known as the Sasabe Road there were reports of undocumented people from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Mexico all traveling through the rugged Baboquivari mountain range to the west of us and the grim canyons to the east of us in attempts to avoid the Border Patrol and its surveillance equipment.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans against what he dubbed “the military-industrial complex” in 1961 he spoke of its “total influence — economic political even spiritual… felt in every city every statehouse every office of the Federal government.” Sixty years later something similar could be said of the ever-expanding border-industrial complex. It needs just such climate disasters and just such caravans (or as we’re seeing right now just such “crises” of unaccompanied minors) to continue its never-ending growth whether the president is touting a big fat beautiful wall or opting for high-tech border technology.

For my son and me the enforcement apparatus first became noticeable at a checkpoint 25 miles north of the international boundary. Not only were green-uniformed agents interrogating passengers in any vehicle heading northwards but a host of cameras focused on the vehicles passing by.

Whether they were license-plate readers or facial-recognition cameras I had no way of knowing. What I did know was that Northrop Grumman (which contributed $649748 to Joe Biden and $323014 to Donald Trump in the 2020 election campaign) had received a valuable contract to ensure that CBP’s biometric system included “modalities” of all sorts — face and voice data iris recognition scars and tattoos possibly even DNA sample collection and information about “relationship patterns” and “encounters” with the public. And who could tell if the Predator B drones that General Atomics produces — oh by the way that company gave $82974 to Biden and $51665 to Trump in 2020 — were above us (as they regularly are in the border regions) using Northrup Grumman’s VADER “man-hunting” radar system first deployed in Afghanistan?

As we traveled through that gauntlet Border Patrol vehicles were everywhere reinforcing the surveillance apparatus that extends 100 miles into the U.S. interior. We soon passed a surveillance tower at the side of the road first erected by the Boeing Corporation and renovated by Elbit Systems ($5553 to Biden $5649 to Trump) one of dozens in the area. On the other side of that highway was a gravel clearing where a G4S ($49233 to Biden $33019 to Trump) van usually idles. It’s a mobile prison the Border Patrol uses to transport its prisoners to short-term detention centers in Tucson. And keep in mind that there was so much we couldn’t see like the thousands of implanted motion sensors manufactured by a host of other companies.

Traveling through this border area it’s hard not to feel like you’re in a profitable version of a classic panopticon a prison system in which wherever you might be you’re being watched. Even five-year-old William was startled by such a world and genuinely puzzled asked me “Why do the green men” as he calls the Border Patrol “want to stop the workers?”

By the time we got to that shard of Trump’s “big fat beautiful” wall it seemed like just a modest part of a much larger system that left partisan politics in the dust. At its heart was never The Donald but a powerful cluster of companies with an active interest in working on that border until the end of time.

Just after the agent told us that we were in a construction zone and needed to leave I noticed a pile of bollards near the dirt road that ran parallel to the wall. They were from the previous wall the one Biden had voted for in 2006. As William and I drove back to Tucson through that gauntlet of inspection I wondered what the border-industrial world would look like when he was my age and living in what could be an even more extreme world filled with ever more terrified people fleeing disaster.

And I kept thinking of that discarded pile of bollards a reminder of just how easy it would be to tear that wall and the world that goes with it down.

The United States Navy and defense contract giant Boeing have launched a five-year modification program that will keep the EA-18G Growler fleet flying high for years to come.

The defense contractor started its program with the induction of the first jet at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island this month and the modifications are focused on updating the aircrafts' structural and mission systems architecture which enable future capability growth for the Navy's 160 Growler jets.

The variant of the combat-proven F/A-18F Super Hornet the Growler serves in a critical role in jamming radar and communications signals of threat forces disabling their ability to detect and track U.S. and allied military forces. It is the most advanced airborne electronic attack (AEA) platform and is the only one in production today.

""We're excited to have the Growler industry team here working on capabilities that will bring the fleet enhanced electronic surveillance enhanced data link and the ability to carry the Next Generation Jammer pod"" said Capt. Chris 'Needles' Bahner commander Electronic Attack Wing U.S. Pacific Fleet via a statement from Boeing. ""We look forward to being a cooperative partner with PMA-265 and PMA-234 at Naval Air Systems Command and the Growler industry team on this exciting work.""

Boeing announced that it will upgrade the entire fleet over the next five years which suggests a target of about thirty per year. Full rate modification is expected to start in June 2021 and the company announced that it has positioned people on-site at Whidbey; following state local customer and corporate Covid protocols to ensure the program is fully staffed to support the workflow.

The upgrade will expand the EA-18G's information pipeline and enhance the aircrafts' ability to transfer data more rapidly and more securely to other aircraft and platforms. It will also improve the speed of the data processing while the upgrade will also prepare the Growler for the Next Generation Jammer which greatly improves its electronic attack capability.

Following the contract awards from October 2020 and February 2021 for materials and labor the modification work will include various upgrades for Growler mission systems. The aircraft's Northrop Grumman ALQ-218 receiver system will receive the Airborne Electronic Attack System Enhancements modification enabling the Growler to operate in increasingly complex electromagnetic environments.

""As the world's premier electronic attack platform we’re starting this program for the EA-18G Growler in solid partnership with the Navy"" said Mark Sears Boeing vice president of Fighters & Strike Product Support. ""These modifications will position it to meet the threats of today and those in the future.""

Flight Global reported that Boeing initiated design work related to upgrading the EA-18G in May 2019 and at that time the defense contractor said the upgraded aircraft would be designated Growler Block II and include features such as the advanced cockpit system and conformal fuel tanks as well as improved sensors and an upgraded electronic attack package.

The United States Navy is the main operator of the aircraft while the only other operator of the Growler is the Royal Australian Air Force which currently has eleven in service – a twelfth aircraft was lost in a January 2018 engine fire.

But as the floating research laboratory ages the space agency is turning to private companies to build and deploy new free flying habitats in low Earth orbit.

NASA this past week unveiled the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) project with plans to award up to $400 million in total to as many as four companies in the fourth quarter of 2021 to begin development on private space stations.

The agency is seeking to replicate the success of its Commercial Cargo and Commercial Crew programs. Those programs saw three companies take over for NASA as its means of sending cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station.

NASA commercial LEO director Phil McAlister said he thinks about the domain of low Earth orbit as having three main activities: ""Cargo transportation crew transportation and destinations."" NASA has transferred over responsibility of the former two activities to private companies with the agency paying SpaceX and Northrop Grumman to send cargo spacecraft to the ISS as well as SpaceX and Boeing to launch astronauts. McAlister highlighted that previously NASA had full ownership of all three activities.

""If it were to always remain that way our aspirations in low Earth orbit would always be limited by the size of NASA's budget"" McAlister said in a briefing on Tuesday. ""By bringing the private sector into these sections and into these areas as suppliers and users you expand the pot and you have more people in low Earth orbit.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZXVyby1zZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy9hcnRpY2xlcy9leGNsdXNpdmUvMjIwMTQvYWVyb3Zpcm9ubWVudC1lYXJucy1pc28tMTQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AeroVironment Earns ISO 14001,"AeroVironment has earned International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 certification for its Environmental Management System.

HardwareLuxx member discovered that this GeForce RTX 3090 features a new GPU silicon.

NVIDIA Ampere GA102-250 GPU was originally meant for the upcoming GeForce RTX 3080 Ti that is till NVIDIA changed its mind and decided to use a different GPU silicon instead.

As we mentioned in our previous story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti the unreleased high-end graphics card has already gone through various configurations internally but so far none have been used in the actual product – the graphics card has still not reached the market. The new RTX 3080 Ti model has been rescheduled five times each time receiving a slightly different specification. Till late January the graphics card was planned to use GA102-250 GPU but those plans have been scrapped and the new specs for the upcoming card now mention GA102-225 GPU instead.

Earlier this week we received information that NVIDIA has begun remaking GA102-250 GPUs for RTX 3090. This GPU was rumored to offer just as many cores as RTX 3090 but it would be attached to fewer memory modules. The rumored RTX 3080 Ti specs from January only mentioned a memory size of 20GB. NVIDIA apparently decided to put a different label on this chip and enable the full 384-bit memory bus instead. The original and apparently now scrapped ‘250’ would only support 320-bit. Our source had no further information and we were unable to confirm it with other sources:

“All GA102-250 GPUs are being remarked to GA102-300 by NVIDIA to be used on RTX 3090” — VideoCardz’s Source

As it turns out NVIDIA is indeed already remaking GA102-250 GPUs for RTX 3090. HardwareLuxx member ‘iso0’ bought a Founders Edition of the flagship NVIDIA SKU with plans to install a water block. To his surprise the graphics card had laser engraving mentioning GA102-250 GPU later changed to GA102-300:

NVIDIA RTX A5000 & RTX A4000 Workstation Ampere Graphics Cards Spotted Laptop Variants Also Coming

The NVIDIA RTX A5000 and RTX A4000 graphics cards are based on the Ampere GPU architecture and are siblings to the flagship RTX A6000. Both graphics cards were submitted for the OpenCL 1.2 validation to Khronos Group. Currently the NVIDIA RTX A6000 uses the full GA102 GPU so one can assume that the RTX A5000 and RTX A4000 would also come with the full configurations of NVIDIA's Ampere GA104 and GA106 GPUs respectively.

That would give the NVIDIA RTX A5000 a total of 6144 CUDA cores and considering that we will be looking at a 256-bit bus we can expect either 16 or 32 GB GDDR6 memory. The NVIDIA RTX A4000 would get the full GA106 GPU with 3840 CUDA cores and could end up with up to 12 GB of GDDR6 memory running across a 192-bit bus interface.

In addition to the submission the NVIDIA RTX A5000 workstation graphics card has been spotted within a workstation laptop comprising of an Intel Core i7-11600H CPU. The laptop was tested in the Ashes of The Singularity benchmark and while we don't get any new details regarding the GPU itself the CPU tested here is surprising as it is the first time we are seeing since the 8th Gen parts that a Core i7 SKU is getting 6 cores and 12 threads. Of course this is a Tiger Lake-H laptop CPU but it looks like it would feature a base clock of 2.90 GHz and 9 MB of L3 cache.

No other details for the laptop are confirmed and the score should be dismissed as it is slower than the RTX 3060 due to un-optimized drivers. All we can tell is that NVIDIA is indeed preparing more affordable workstation graphics cards based on its Ampere GPU architecture and we can expect them to launch in the coming months in both desktop and laptop discrete flavors.

That feature of course is Resizable BAR (Base Address Register) a PCI Express technology that promises to give gaming a boost in framerates on supported platforms.





In simple terms Resizable BAR allows the CPU and system to tap into a graphics card's full memory frame buffer over the PCIe bus instead of capping it to 256MB increments. The technology has actually been around for several years but was not really utilized until AMD introduced its Radeon RX 6000 series  with Smart Access Memory (SAM) support. The caveat is that AMD's implementation only works with its own CPUs.





NVIDIA's implementation however is CPU agnostic—it works with both AMD and Intel platforms. You do need a compatible motherboard and graphics card either or both of which might require a BIOS update depending on the vendor.









""As you move through a world in a game GPU memory (VRAM) constantly transfers textures shaders and geometry via many small CPU to GPU transfers. With the ever-growing size of modern game assets this results in a lot of transfers. Using Resizable BAR assets can instead be requested as-needed and sent in full so the CPU can efficiently access the entire frame buffer. And if multiple requests are made transfers can occur concurrently rather than queuing"" NVIDIA explains.

GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards Support Resizable BAR With A BIOS Update

NVIDIA kicked off the Resizable BAR party with its regular (read: non-TI) GeForce RTX 3060  which shipped with a BIOS already supporting the feature. Anyone who purchased one of those cards need only pair it with a compatible motherboard and motherboard BIOS and the latest Game Ready GPU driver to take advantage of the feature.





Other GeForce RTX 30 series cards however require a BIOS update and both Gainward and Galax have begun rolling them out. There are some things to keep in mind though. One is that updating a graphics card's BIOS can be a little scary if you have never done it before. Just as with updating your motherboard BIOS you want to be sure not to power off your system in the middle of the process. Your best bet is to utilize a battery backup just to avoid a power outage bricking your GPU in the middle of a BIOS update.





You also have to be sure you are grabbing the correct BIOS for your precise graphics card model. The BIOS updates being served up at the moment apply to certain models offered in China and not international SKUs.

Your GPU renders a number of frames each second and put together those frames give the impression of smooth motion. Similarly your monitor refreshes a certain number of times each second clearing the previous image for the new frames your GPU is rendering. To keep things moving smoothly your GPU stores upcoming frames in a buffer. The problem is that the buffer and your monitor’s refresh rate may get out of sync causing a nasty line of two frames stitched together.

V-Sync emerged as a solution. This software-based feature essentially forces your GPU to hold frames in its buffer until your monitor is ready to refresh. That solves the screen tearing problem but it introduces another: Input lag. V-Sync forces your GPU to hold frames it has already rendered which causes a slight delay between what’s happening in the game and what you see on screen.

Nvidia’s first alternative to V-Sync was Adaptive VSync. Like the older technology Nvidia’s driver-based solution locked the frame rate to the display’s refresh rate to prevent screen tearing. However when the GPU struggled Adaptive VSync unlocked the frame rate until the GPU’s performance improved. Once stable Adaptive VSync locked the frame rate until the GPU’s performance dropped again.

Nvidia introduced a hardware-based solution in 2013 called G-Sync. It’s based on VESA’s Adaptive-Sync technology which enables variable refresh rates on the display side. Instead of forcing your GPU to hold frames G-Sync forces your monitor to adapt its refresh rate depending on the frames your GPU is rendering. That deals with input lag and screen tearing.

However Nvidia uses a proprietary board that replaces the typical scaler board which controls everything within the display like decoding image input controlling the backlight and so on. A G-Sync board contains 768MB of DDR3 memory to store the previous frame so that it can be compared to the next incoming frame. It does this to decrease input lag.

On the PC end Nvidia’s driver can fully control the display’s proprietary board. It manipulates the vertical blanking interval or VBI which represents the interval between the time when a monitor finishes drawing the current frame and the beginning of the next frame.

With G-Sync active the monitor becomes a slave to your PC. As the GPU rotates the rendered frame into the primary buffer the display clears the old image and gets ready to receive the next frame. As the frame rate speeds up and slows down the display renders each frame accordingly as instructed by your PC. Since the G-Sync board supports variable refresh rates images are often redrawn at widely varying intervals.

G-Sync system requirements

For years there’s always been one big caveat with G-Sync monitors: You need an Nvidia graphics card. Although you still need an Nvidia GPU to fully take advantage of G-Sync — like the recent RTX 3080 — more recent G-Sync displays support HDMI variable refresh rate under the “G-Sync Compatible” banner (more on that in the next section). That means you can use variable refresh rate with an AMD card though not Nvidia’s full G-Sync module. Outside of a display with a G-Sync banner here’s what you need:

Desktops

GPU – GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST or newer

GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST or newer Driver – R340.52 or higher

Laptops connected to G-Sync monitors

GPU – GeForce GTX 980M GTX 970M or GTX 965M GPU or newer

GeForce GTX 980M GTX 970M or GTX 965M GPU or newer Driver – R340.52 or higher

Laptops with built-in G-Sync displays

GPU – GeForce GTX 980M GTX 970M or GTX 965M or newer

GeForce GTX 980M GTX 970M or GTX 965M or newer Driver – R352.06 or higher

G-Sync vs. G-Sync Compatible vs. G-Sync Ultimate

Because G-Sync is a hardware solution certified monitors must include Nvidia’s proprietary board. Fortunately most major monitor manufacturers like Asus Philips BenQ AOC Samsung and LG offer G-Sync displays.

Nvidia currently lists three monitor classes: G-Sync Ultimate G-Sync and G-Sync Compatible. Here’s a breakdown of each:

G-Sync Compatible

24 to 88 inches

Validated no artifacts

G-Sync

24 to 38 inches

Validated no artifacts

Certified +300 tests

G-Sync Ultimate

27 to 65 inches

Validated no artifacts

Certified +300 tests

Best quality HDR

1000 nits brightness

For G-Sync Ultimate displays you’ll need a hefty GeForce GPU to handle HDR visuals at 4K. They’re certainly not cheap but they provide the best experience.

As for G-Sync Compatible it’s a newer category. These displays do not include Nvidia’s proprietary G-Sync board but they do support variable refresh rates. These panels typically fall under AMD’s FreeSync umbrella which is a competing technology for Radeon-branded GPUs that doesn’t rely on a proprietary scaler board. Nvidia tests these displays to guarantee “no artifacts” when connected to GeForce-branded GPUs. Consider these displays as affordable alternatives to G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate displays.

Overall resolutions range from Full HD to 4K while refresh rates range from 60Hz max to 240Hz max. Nvidia provides a full list of compatible monitors on its website. Prices range from about $100 to well over $1000 like the Asus’ ROG Swift PG279Q 27-inch monitor selling for $698.

G-Sync TVs

Since G-Sync launched in 2013 it has always been specifically for monitors . However Nvidia is expanding. Last year Nvidia partnered with LG to certify recent LG OLED TVs as G-Sync Compatible. You’ll need some drivers and firmware to get started which Nvidia outlines on its site. Here are the currently available TVs that support G-Sync:

LG BX 2020 (50- 65- and 77-inch)

LG CX 2020 (50- 65- and 77-inch)

LG GX 2020 (50- 65- and 77-inch)

LG B9 2019 (50- and 65-inch)

LG C9 2019 (50- 65- and 77-inch)

LG E9 2019 (50- and 65-inch)

FreeSync: the G-Sync alternative

As we pointed out earlier AMD’s FreeSync derives from VESA’s Adaptive-Sync technology. One of the main differences is that it doesn’t use proprietary hardware. Rather FreeSync-certified displays use off-the-shelf scaler boards which lessens the cost. The only AMD hardware you need for FreeSync is a Radeon-branded GPU. AMD introduced AdaptiveSync support in 2015.

FreeSync has more freedom in supported monitor options and you don’t need extra hardware. So FreeSync is a budget-friendly alternative to G-Synch compatible hardware. Asus’ MG279Q is around $100 less than the aforementioned ROG Swift monitor.

No matter which you choose each technology has advantages. There are also numerous graphics cards and monitors to up your gaming experience. FreeSync covers graphical glitches caused by monitor and GPU synchronization issues.

Some downsides

One downside is the price. Whether you’re looking at a laptop or desktop G-Sync requires both a capable monitor and graphics card . While there are many G-Sync compatible graphics cards giving you plenty of budgetary options G-Sync monitors are almost always more expensive than their AMD Freesync counterparts. Compatible laptops may be even more expensive.

In addition users point to a lack of compatibility with Nvidia’s Optimus technology. Optimus implemented in many laptops  adjusts graphics performance on the fly to provide the necessary power to graphics-intensive programs and optimize battery life. Because the technology relies on an integrated graphics system frames move to the screen at a set interval not as they are created as seen with G-Sync. One can purchase an Optimus-capable device or a G-Sync-capable device but no laptop exists that can do both.

While Nvidia is pretty good about making sure players have the drivers they need to run today’s games at high frame rates it’s also pretty bad at advertising its newer settings for older games. That’s the case in 2021 with CSGO where a new setting can make a huge difference in CSGO’s FPS. There are also some new default settings players should turn off.

Without further ado here is 2021’s definitive CSGO FPS guide for Nvidia card owners.

Boost CSGO FPS for 2021 with these Nvidia driver settings

The biggest change from CSGO’s usual Nvidia driver settings is the addition of Nvidia Reflex the company’s ultra-low latency technology. Players may be familiar with these fancy graphs from Riot Games’ Valorant but they may not know that the tech is available on Nvidia’s 20 and 30 series cards.

The graphs are essentially just for show. The technology behind Reflex is baked into Nvidia’s drivers meaning that users only have to turn on the setting in the Nvidia control panel. We’d recommend setting it to “On” instead of “Ultra.” It makes a massive difference.

Other new options available include “Negative LOD Filtering” a setting that sharpens non-moving scenes at the expense of introducing jagged edges while the image is moving. Setting this to “Clamp” should be players’ next move. CSGO is about bomb sites not screenshots.

Finally there is Nvidia’s “Antialiasing – Transparency.” If this isn’t already set to “Off” players should switch it over now. CSGO doesn’t feature many transparency effects but it may in the future. For now setting it to “Off” makes little difference in the game’s visuals.

How do you turn on CSGO’s FPS counter?

CSGO actually offers two different ways for players to turn on the in-game FPS counter. The first is by turning on the game’s net graph which also shows a whole host of information including the game’s FPS. Enter the following command in CSGO’s console to turn on the setting and see CSGO’s FPS as well as the game’s ping server lag and tickrate.

Fabian Pertschy spoke to Lars Reger chief technology officer (CTO) at semiconductor maker NXP about the importance of components in today’s vehicles and what long-term effects the current semiconductor crisis may have

You have been the CTO at NXP since 2012. How has your job changed in recent years?

The job changed even before I was Group CTO when I was still Automotive CTO. This change came with the merger with Freescale in December 2015 [Freescale Semiconductor was originally a Motorola spinoff that NXP bought from Blackstone Group for $12 billion]. When I started at NXP 12 years ago we were a component supplier. We went to customers with data sheets and we presented our products.

As a result of the merger with Freescale the microprocessor portfolio was added to our competences and we suddenly had a very broad almost complete portfolio for nearly all smart connected devices – from smart watches to connected cars.

From then on customers started to ask us to build a complete system rather than what components we had on the shelf. That brought us a long way forward as a company because from then on we could have discussions at a higher level about topics such as data security functional safety and reference system issues

Does NXP still see itself primarily as a semiconductor manufacturer or has your business model changed too much?

We are very careful not to tread on the toes of our customers the tier one suppliers and system providers. Biting the hand that feeds us cannot be our business model. So to be absolutely clear: we are a semiconductor manufacturer. However we want and need to display our chips chip bundles and solutions in the best way possible highlighting their full potential and we do that by using reference designs demos and evaluation boards.

Among our customers there are the established companies they mainly just want our chips at the best possible price. On the other hand those that are new to the market are usually more interested in our reference designs and as much training material as possible to industrialise and build up know-how quickly. We cater to both types of demand.

Chips are becoming a fundamental building block of the modern automobile. To what extent do chip manufacturers have a unique role in the car industry?

What was mechanical 20 years ago is increasingly electronic today. The estimate that around 90-95% of all vehicle innovations are driven by electronics is often quoted. For example at six to seven kilometres in length the wiring harness is now the second heaviest component in the car. Semiconductors help optimise connections and save weight. Another example is the hundreds of control units in the vehicle and the huge amount of associated hardware and software that needs to be robust and safe – this is another fundamental role of semiconductors. With between 200m and one billion lines of code some people now talk about the ‘software-defined car’.

However if the roles and interactions of these electronics are not clearly defined they can interfere with each other. Ideally we would like to clean this up using new semiconductor concepts and separate systems with the help of domain-based architectures. [That would mean] for instance a connectivity system no longer interacts directly with a system controlling autonomous driving or the drivetrain. Instead this is then done via a gateway. Given this is largely a question of software we have had such vehicle architectures in development and in series rollout for five to eight years. In short yes: chips are indeed a fundamental building block of the automobile these days.

The current supply chain bottleneck for semiconductors highlights how fundamental chips are. How do you see the situation developing in the next few years?

The automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time throughout the supply chain. However semiconductors are not available off the shelf as a commodity in such a way that they can be installed immediately. Chip production is time-consuming as manufacturing a complex chip involves hundreds of individual steps often in different factories around the world. Depending on the complexity of the component it normally takes four to six months from order to delivery.

The industry has widely underestimated the long production times and the added complication that it is not possible to quickly increase production or create additional capacity. That is now leading to bottlenecks and the disruption in multiple industries is so severe that I assume that some things are going change. At the very least the auto industry will have to build up a certain level of inventory for volume products and central components and will need to deviate somewhat from just-in-time in order to secure strategic reserves. In the event of disruptions such as environmental disasters that would ensure a certain amount of stability until the complex supply chain can adapt. I estimate that one production cycle worth of stock would be a good place to start.

At the same time we assume that car manufacturers will in future communicate more directly with semiconductor manufacturers about medium- and long-term volume planning. There are also political initiatives in Europe the USA and China to make the supply chain more independent and secure.

NXP recently announced a new data management project. What is the Fusion Project about?

This is one of the key topics where the idea of a supply chain system or network becomes really important. Ten years ago there was still a very hierarchical value chain from tier two to tier one to the OEM and then the end customer. That has turned into a value network where the car manufacturers are also looking further up the value chain for strong innovation partners.

This results in partner networks like the recently announced Fusion Project which includes NXP Airbiquity Cloudera Teraki and Wind River and centres around the use of vehicle data. With a jointly developed platform we can help car manufacturers collect analyse and manage the data from the rolling sensor platform that is the modern car. Some of this data can be managed on-board in the edge which is very fast and efficient. Other kinds of data are more suited to be moved to the cloud to share with others and learn together. These are topics that require a very broad ecosystem to explore them properly.

How important are partnerships to NXP?

Bringing an ecosystem together and creating a partner network helps immensely with the challenges that the car of the future will bring. This network gives us the strength to answer the overarching questions of the OEMs. Not everything becomes a common good right away though. It’s like a football field where each player works within their role to complement the rest of the team as best as possible flexibly and openly but always with an eye on their own career and with a clear idea of what the market needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTI4L2hlcmUtcy1ob3ctdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1pcy1wbGF5aW5nLW91dC1mb3Itc3RvY2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How the World's Chip Shortage Is Playing Out for Stocks,"A global semiconductor shortage has upended the supply of everyday devices from smartphones to gaming consoles to tech-dependent cars.

With the game tied 9-9 in the top of the third inning ODU added three runs highlighted by a Kenny Levari home run to break away from FIU at the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex.



""We do a great job of getting up early. It's 9-0 in the first inning but before you can blink all of the sudden it's 9-9. That can just be college baseball when the ball starts rolling down the hill it can be hard to stop"" said ODU head coach Chris Finwood. ""We made a few mistakes defensively that inning. Ryne Moore didn't have his best performance today but the bullpen came in and our young guys gave FIU a bunch of zeros the rest of the way. I thought that was a fantastic job by those guys.""



Kyle Battle led off the first with a single in ODU's highest-scoring inning of the game. Kenny Levari reached base off a hit by pitch. Carter Trice knocked one out of the park to bring home three runs. ODU (17-5 3-1 C-USA) kept its foot on the pedal with six more runs in the first to lead 9-0.



FIU (9-12 1-3 C-USA) added one run in the second off a solo homer from Justin Farmer. The Panthers erupted with eight runs off six hits in the third inning.



ODU quickly responded in the bottom of the third. Tommy Bell led off with a single and Battle followed with a triple to bring home Bell. With Battle on third freshman Levari knocked one out of the park to record his first collegiate home run.



The Monarchs kept the Panthers off the board the rest of the way. ODU added a run in the fourth and three insurance runs in the bottom of the eighth to run away with the game to pick up its third-consecutive win.



Joey Rodriguez notched his first win of the season on the hill fanning one batter in 1.1 innings of action. Joey DeChiaro Brad Dobzanski and Jacob Gomez pitched 5.0 innings of scoreless baseball for ODU putting together six strikeouts in relief.



Levari ended the afternoon with five RBIs while Trice added four RBIs to lead the team. Five Monarchs recorded multi-hit performances on Sunday. For the four-game series ODU compiled a whopping 45 runs.



""We have a lot of good things happening by young players without a doubt they are improving and getting better"" Finwood concluded. ""The main thing about the game was that when FIU tied the game 9-9 we won the rest of game 7-0. We didn't quit we kept grinding adding on and wore them down.""



Up Next

ODU will open its lengthy road stint with a four-game series at Marshall on Friday April 2.

Alessia Sgherza led ODU in kills knocking down five. Hailey Duncan put together three kills to lead the Monarchs defensively.



""We didn't show well today but that had a lot to do with the intense pressure WKU put us under from the first serve"" said ODU head coach Fred Chao. ""They had access to power from the service line and every attacker. Yesterday we put up a better serve and pass game and that allowed us to rally and win points. Today we weren't able to earn those points. Overall the series showed us how well we can competent times and also showed us the gap our new program has to bridge.""



The first set went in favor of the Hilltoppers 25-6. An 18-0 run early in the first frame provided the difference for WKU. A Hilltopper attack error put ODU back on the board to trail 19-2. WKU closed the first game with a 6-4 run to lead the match 1-0.



ODU played the second set much closer 25-16. The Monarchs played from behind most of the set trailing 9-2 early on but ODU clawed back compiling a 10-5 scoring run to cut the deficit to two. The Hilltoppers responded with a kill to spark a 5-2 scoring run and force an ODU timeout as WKU led 19-14. The Hilltoppers dominated the rest of the way holding ODU to just two more points.



The Hilltoppers opened the third set with a 4-1 lead. After a 7-3 WKU scoring run ODU utilized a timeout. Coming out of the break Sgherza delivered a kill to close the deficit to six but WKU collected four unanswered points to lead 15-5. The Hilltoppers closed out action with a 10-5 run which was too much for ODU to overcome.



With Saturday's defeat the Monarchs did not qualify for the C-USA Tournament. The top four teams from the East Division and West Division earned trips to the tournament hosted by Southern Mississippi.

Everett Stadium. It was the 125th edition of ""The Game"" as the visiting Yellow Jackets (4-0 4-0 ODAC) led 21-0 at halftime before adding a late touchdown in the fourth quarter against the host Tigers (3-1 3-1 ODAC).

R-MC got on the scoreboard near the end of the first quarter when Egbers found Ricky Mayfield for a six-yard touchdown pass with just 21-seconds remaining in quarter. Chris Vidal added the first of his four PATs to give the visitors the 7-0 advantage after the nine-play 58-yard drive.

The Yellow Jackets added two scores in the second quarter getting a one-yard touchdown run at 9:43 and a three-yard touchdown run at 2:38—both by Egbers—with the two PATs by Vidal for the 21-0 halftime margin. The first scoring drive covered 98 yards on eight plays while the second scoring drive covered 29 yards on five plays. The nearly length-of-the-field drive resulted from a collegiate-best 63-yard punt by freshman George Langhammer (Patrick Henry HS) while the short scoring possession was set-up by an interception made by the visitors.

H-SC took the ball deep into R-MC territory on its second possession of the third quarter driving 52 yards on 11 plays before a second interception stopped it at the Yellow Jacket four-yard line. The key play offensively on the drive was a 30-yard pass from junior transfer quarterback Tanner Bernard (Brookville) to freshman wide receiver Braeden Bowling. The margin remained at 21-0 through three quarters following the scoreless third.

R-MC added its final touchdown with 6:55 left to play when Egbers connected with David Wallis on a 19-yard scoring play. Vidal added the PAT after the quick four-play 40-yard drive to provide for the final margin in the rivalry game that has been played 125 times between the two schools.

Bernard a transfer from NCAA Division II UVA Wise passed for 62 yards (7-18) with two interceptions. Junior running back Kaleb Smith (Franklin Co. HS) rushed for 31 yards on seven carries. Senior captain and wide receiver Dillon Costello had two catches for 20 yards while Bowling added one reception for 30 yards. Langhammer punted seven times for an average of 39.0 yards including the 63-yarder that was downed inside the 20 at the two-yard line.

Freshman defensive back Will Pickren finished with a game-high and career-high 14 tackles including one for loss. Senior defensive end Tyler Lohman had nine tackles including one sack while senior linebacker Brendan Weinberg/Apex NC and junior linebacker Peyton Carneal each added eight tackles—Weinberg with 0.5 tackles for loss and Carneal with one tackle for loss. Junior cornerback Jordan Fields had seven tackles while freshman cornerback Tobias Lafayette and junior defensive tackle Michael Harris each contributed six tackles—Lafayette getting a pass breakup and Harris with one tackle for loss.

Egbers passed for a game-high 212 yards (16-20) with two touchdowns and no interceptions adding 10 rushes for 11 yards and two touchdowns on the ground for R-MC. Nick Hale rushed for a game-high 90 yards on 22 carries. Wallis finished with game-highs of seven receptions for 105 yards and one touchdown while Mayfield had one catch for six yards and one touchdown for the Yellow Jackets. Tyler DeBerry had 10 tackles including two tackles for loss and one interception while Matthew Vergara and Jacob Hutchinson each added five tackles—Vergara with one sack among 3.5 tackles for loss and Hutchinson with two sacks among 2.5 tackles for loss. Cade Jones had one interception.

H-SC continues to lead the Oldest Small School Rivalry in the South 60-54-11; however the Yellow Jackets have now won seven-straight and nine of the last 10 games played between the two storied programs.

H-SC will play at home again next Saturday April 3 at 1 p.m. against visiting Ferrum in the ODAC third-place game on Fulton Field at Lewis C. Everett Stadium."

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

Need for Chips Sales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Revenue $500B Automotives Computing Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Chips built for: Automotives Computing Revenue $500B Consumer electronics Industrial military aerospace Wired communications Wireless communications 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2015 2020 Note: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLWJlaWppbmctZ2xvYmFsLXRyYWRlLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLWNoaW5hLWRkODEzZjRkMmVkZTAxZjhkYjZmOWQ5YzEzZDdkNDdi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China cuts taxes to spur semiconductor development,"BEIJING (AP) — China announced tax breaks Monday to spur growth of its semiconductor industry following U.S. sanctions that alarmed the ruling Communist Party by cutting off access to American processor chips for tech giant Huawei and some other companies.

Leaders declared accelerating efforts to transform China into a self-reliant “technology power” to be this year’s top economic priority after the tariff war with Washington highlighted its reliance on U.S. components for smartphones and other industries Beijing wants to develop.

Chipmakers can import machinery and raw materials tax-free through 2030 the Finance Ministry and other agencies announced. They did not say how large a subsidy to manufacturers that might represent.

Beijing has spent heavily over the past two decades to build up a Chinese chip industry but its makers of smartphones and other technology still rely on the United States Europe and Taiwan for their most advanced components.

Then-President Donald Trump cut off Huawei Technologies Ltd.’s access to U.S. processor chips and other technology in 2019 in a fight over Beijing’s industrial ambitions.

Last year Trump tightened curbs by prohibiting global suppliers from using U.S. technology to make chips for Huawei. That threatens to cripple its smartphone business which was the No. 1 global seller in early 2020 but has dropped out of the top five brands.

Political analysts expect little change in the U.S. position under President Joe Biden who succeeded Trump in January. The Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said in February it is “very unlikely” sanctions will be lifted.

Processor chips and other semiconductors are China’s biggest single import totaling more than $300 billion a year.

Under the latest measure machinery and raw materials “that cannot be produced or whose performance cannot meet demand” will be exempt from import tax the government said.

That applies to photoresists masks polishing pads and liquids silicon crystals and wafers materials to build clean rooms and other production equipment according to the announcement.

The semiconductor chip shortage could affect your selection and price,"Send this page to someone via email

If you’re thinking of buying a new car or light truck in the near future you may want to check the latest news on the global semiconductor chip shortage that has sent automakers across the world scrambling.

In your car-shopping experience this spring and summer you may run into lower inventories slightly less fuel-efficient vehicles and auto dealers who may be less inclined to haggle over price says Shawn DuBravac chief economist at IPC an electronics manufacturing trade association.

“If there’s only one model one car that you really want the dealer may be apprehensive to really mark that car down” DuBravac says.

The reason?

Several of the world’s largest automakers are running short on semiconductors an essential component of electronic devices that have are also vital for new vehicles’ infotainment modules engines and fuel management systems.

“It isn’t uncommon to see upwards of 50 semiconductors in a vehicle today” DuBravac says.

The problem is auto manufacturers are having trouble getting their hands on enough of these chips lately.

How the chip shortage came about

The chip shortage has its roots in the precipitous collapse in auto sales that followed the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 according to DuBravac.

In Canada light vehicle sales volumes in April 2020 were less than one-third of what they were during the same month in 2019 according to data from DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.

In response automakers around the globe rushed to scale down production which included dialing back their orders of semiconductors DuBravac says. At the same time as millions of people heeded lockdown and stay-at-home orders the demand for tablets laptops and cloud-computing services soared quickly filling in the semiconductor demand gap left by the auto sector he adds.

But auto sales rebounded very quickly according to DuBravac.

“We saw that the auto sector in particular experienced a V-shaped recovery” he says.

By September sales in Canada slightly surpassed their level in September of 2019 although they subsequently dipped back below 2019 volumes according to figures from DesRosiers.

Automakers rushed to increase production in response to the quick consumer bounce-back ramping up orders to all their parts suppliers. The problem though is that there are often lead times of between 12 and 20 weeks for semiconductors DuBravac says.

Fewer vehicles and fewer chips

General Motors Ford Honda Volvo Volkswagen and Stellantis — the car company born out of the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler — are among the automakers that said they’ve had to slow or suspend some production due to the chips supply crunch.

GM has announced downtime on all shifts at three of its production plants including its CAMI facility in Ingersoll Ont. located about 30 km east of London.

The Brampton Stellantis plant which builds the Chrysler 300 Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger has also had to temporarily idle production.

Auto manufacturers are trying to shield pickup trucks and full-size SUVs from the effects of the shortage as much as possible as those are their most popular and profitable vehicles DuBravac says. GM for example has said it has not paused or reduced shifts on any of its truck plants.

On the other hand consumers might run into low inventories for smaller vehicles.

“The Nissan Kicks the Toyota Corolla Honda Accords — those are some of the areas where you’re most likely to see an impact” DuBravac says.

But truck lovers may also find some of their favourite models are a little different this year.

GM said on March 15 it is building certain 2021 light-duty full-size pickup trucks without a fuel management module due to the semiconductor shortage.

The lack of the module means affected models equipped with the 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine with both six-speed and eight-speed automatic transmission will have lower fuel economy by one mile per gallon spokeswoman Michelle Malcho told Reuters.

Malcho emphasized all trucks are still being built. The change would not have a major impact on the Detroit automaker’s U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) numbers she added.

The modification runs through the 2021 model year which typically ends in late summer or early fall Malcho said.

Ford has said the scarcity of chips coupled with other weather-related part shortages is forcing it to build F-150 trucks and Edge SUVs in North America without certain inputs. The automaker says it will build and hold the vehicles for a number of weeks and ship them to dealers once modules with hard-to-find semiconductors become available.

Tight inventories shouldn’t affect new vehicle sticker prices but they may make auto dealers leery of negotiating on price especially if they see solid consumer demand DuBravac said.

Still not all automakers have been caught off-guard by the chips shortage. Toyota which pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy surprised rivals and investors in February when it said its output would not be disrupted significantly by chip shortages.

The auto manufacturer made the decision to stockpile key vehicle components years ago after experiencing the Fukushima disaster of 2011 Reuters reported.

After the catastrophe severed Toyota’s supply chains on March 11 2011 the world’s biggest automaker realized the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.

“Toyota was as far as we can tell the only automaker properly equipped to deal with chip shortages” a person familiar with Harman International which specializes in car audio systems displays and driver assistance technology told Reuters.

QTerminals envisioned a modern suite of best-in-class ERP applications that would enable it to enhance and automate its internal processes gain a competitive advantage while improving employee productivity.

After careful evaluation QTerminals selected Oracle ERP Cloud which has allowed it to seamlessly extend its onpremises applications to the cloud and establish a modern business platform that can be scaled to support its international expansion plans and roll out new technology innovations. Mannai InfoTech the software division under Mannai Trading Company W.L.L. led the deployment of the Oracle Fusion Cloud to modernize and digitize various manual processes in the departments of Procurement Finance and Human Resources while improving reporting user experiences and data integration.

Marco Ramirez showrunner of Marvel‘s The Defenders on Netflix will be penning the script while Angel Manuel Soto will be behind the camera. Further details of the movie remain scarce besides the fact that the new movie will not be based in the same universe as the earlier Transformer films.

Now it seems the classic Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants is being targeted for such reasons as well. According to a new report two episodes from SpongeBob SquarePants are being removed from circulation. One of the episodes Mid-Life Crustacean had already stopped airing on television by 2018. While it was still available digitally Nickelodeon has officially taken it away completely.

According to a representative that spoke to IGN:

“‘Mid-Life Crustacean’ has been out of rotation since 2018 following a standards review in which we determined some story elements were not kid-appropriate” they stated.

While it’s unclear exactly why that particular episode was removed there are some reasons more obvious than others. For example towards the end of the episode SpongeBob Patrick and Mr. Krabs go on a “panty raid.” Undoubtedly this is a perfect reason to consider the episode problematic for today’s audience. Or as more specifically stated above “not kid-appropriate.”

Meanwhile the other removed SpongeBob SquarePants episode was titled Kwarantined Krab. The episode was intended for the show’s previously aired twelfth season. While it doesn’t seem to have aired or been made available in any way it seems that there’s certainly no way it will be released in the future. As for why it appears the episode’s virus plot was a little too real. While it was written and animated before 2020 a representative said the following:

“The ‘Kwarantined Crab’ [sic] centers on a virus storyline so we have decided to not air it due to sensitivities surrounding the global real-world pandemic” they concluded.

So while the majority of the series remains complete and can be streamed on the newly released platform Paramount Plus it looks like these two episodes will no longer be associated with the show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29uc2VxdWVuY2UubmV0LzIwMjEvMDMvc3BvbmdlYm9iLXNxdWFyZXBhbnRzLWVwaXNvZGUtcmVtb3ZlZC1mcm9tLXBhcmFtb3VudC1wbHVzLWluYXBwcm9wcmlhdGUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZXF1ZW5jZS5uZXQvMjAyMS8wMy9zcG9uZ2Vib2Itc3F1YXJlcGFudHMtZXBpc29kZS1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tcGFyYW1vdW50LXBsdXMtaW5hcHByb3ByaWF0ZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes Removed From Paramount+ for Inappropriate Plotlines,"Two episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants have been removed from Paramount+ for content that Nickelodeon has deemed inappropriate. One is an episode about a “panty raid” involving Mr. Krabs and another is about a dangerous flu outbreak that involves a quarantine scenario.

The beloved kids cartoon is one of the big-ticket items on the new streaming service that launched earlier this month but apparently the catalog that they’re framing as comprehensive is missing a couple items. The more glaring of the two is a notable season three episode in which Mr. Krabs tries to reignite his youthful spark by spending an evening with SpongeBob and Patrick Star.

After a few boring activities that feel more like chores than fun to the middle-age restaurant owner the boys suggest a “panty raid”: sneaking into a woman’s house and rifling through her underwear drawer. Mr. Krabs is delighted by the salacious act but it takes a turn for the worse when the owner of the undergarments catches them in the act: Mr. Krabs’ own mother. Cringey hilarity ensues and businessman is banished to his childhood bedroom for the night but apparently the show’s parent network has decided that this slightly raunchy plotline which originally aired in 2003 isn’t fit for streaming in 2021.

A Nickelodeon representative confirmed with IGN that the episode in question titled “Mid-Life Crustacean” has been blacklisted by the company for almost three years now. “‘Mid-Life Crustacean’ has been out of rotation since 2018 following a standards review in which we determined some story elements were not kid-appropriate” the rep told IGN.

Nickelodeon declined to comment on the specific storyline elements that led to their censorship decision nor did they comment on why the episode was removed altogether instead of being slapped with a content warning which is how competing services like Disney+ and HBO Max have treated content that they’ve deemed problematic by today’s standards.

According to IGN the episode was still available on Amazon Prime when they initially published the story but was taken down shortly after the article went live. They also confirmed that “Mid-Life Crustacean” is included in the DVD box set titled SpongeBob: The First 100 Episodes which was most recently copyrighted in 2020. However Nickelodeon once again declined to comment on whether it will be removed for future DVD releases.

The other episode that fans will have trouble (legally) watching right now is an eerily prescient 2019 ep called “Kwarantined Krab”. The basic plot is that a healthy inspector finds a case of “Clam Flu” at the Krusty Krab and all of the patrons and staff are forced to quarantine together in the restaurant. Like most virus outbreak stories the characters begin to lose their marbles and distrust one another banishing those who are suspected to be infected to the kitchen’s freezer.

“The ‘Kwarantined Crab’ [sic] centers on a virus storyline so we have decided to not air it due to sensitivities surrounding the global real-world pandemic” the Nickelodeon rep told IGN. It’s unclear if it will be released again once the pandemic is in the rearview but IGN reported that some Reddit users are claiming it’s not available on the recently-released Season 12 DVD.

Spongebob Squarepants has become the latest media property to fall victim to censorship as two episodes of the beloved children’s series have been pulled for ‘inappropriate’ and quarantine-related content respectively.

As of March 27th both the season 3 episode Mid-Life Crustacean and the season 12 episode Kwarantined Krab have been removed from Paramount Plus and Amazon Prime. During the writing of this article the episodes were also pulled from YouTube TV.

According to a Nickelodeon spokesperson who spoke to IGN “‘Mid-Life Crustacean’ has been out of rotation since 2018 following a standards review in which we determined some story elements were not kid-appropriate.” When asked which specific story element was “not kid-appropriate” the spokesperson offered “no comment”.

However it has been assumed that the story element in question was the episode’s ‘panty raid’ which saw Spongebob Patrick and Mr. Krabs embark on a panty raid in order to help Mr. Krabs snap of his mid-life crisis only for the trio to discover that they had accidentally raided the underwear drawer of Mr. Krabs’ mother.

The other episode Kwarantined Krab was pulled out of sensitivity for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as the representative explained “”The ‘Kwarantined Crab’ [sic] centers on a virus storyline so we have decided to not air it due to sensitivities surrounding the global real-world pandemic.”

In the episode after discovering a supposed outbreak of ‘Clam Flu’ at the Krusty Krab a health inspector quarantines the staff and patrons in side the restaurant.

As time progresses the quarantined begin to become paranoid and distrustful eventually taking turning on anyone they believe to have the flu and locking them away in the restaurant’s freezer.

At the end of the episode it’s discovered that though the outbreak of Clam Flu was a false alarm the patrons have actually become sick as a result of their times in the freezer leading the entire restaurant to be “ultra mega quarantined!”

Kwarantined Krab was previously excluded from the physical release of the Spongebob Squarepants: The Complete Twelfth Season DVD set for similar reasons.

As of writing it is unknown whether either episode will ever see release again.

PayPal Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.46 which which ranks better than 69% of the companies in Credit Services industry.

PayPal Holdings Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 73% of the companies in Credit Services industry. PayPal Holdings's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 30.2% which ranks better than 80% of the companies in Credit Services industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months PayPal Holdings's return on invested capital is 17.09 and its cost of capital is 8.66. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of PayPal Holdings is shown below:

If you've been using your credit card to pay others through cash payment apps you may want to consider changing your habits. That's because Chase cardholders may soon pay more for cash-like transactions when using a Chase credit card. Chase has recently announced updates to its cardmember agreement terms and these changes will go into effect in early April 2021. A portion of the updated cardmember agreement discusses cash-like transactions and notes changes to how these transactions will be treated.

Cash-like transactions will be treated as cash advances

Cash-like transactions can include the following:

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Purchasing traveler's checks foreign currency money orders wire transfers cryptocurrency and other similar virtual currency

Purchasing lottery tickets casino gaming chips race track wagers and similar online and offline betting transactions

Person-to person money transfers and accounting funding transactions

Making payments using a third-party service including bill payment transactions not made directly with a merchant or service provider

It's worth noting that this is not an exhaustive list and may include other similar transactions.

Since cash advances come with an added cost you can expect that these cash-like transactions will soon come with fees. Cash advances are not cheap. Most card issuers charge a fee for cash advances and these transactions also have a high APR interest rate. Because of these costs it's recommended you never get a credit card cash advance unless you're out of other options.

That means if you've been doing the following you may soon pay more:

Using a Chase credit card to pay friends or family members through payment apps such as PayPal or Venmo

Using a Chase credit card to pay bills through an outside payment processing system

Using a Chase card to bet online through gambling apps or at casinos

What will happen if you keep making these choices? You can expect to be charged cash-advance fees and expect to pay higher interest on these types of activity once the updated cardmember agreement terms go into effect. Wondering how much you might pay? It's best to check your own card agreement but Chase lists an example cardmember agreement on its website and these are the fees listed:

Cash-advance fee: Either $10 or 5% of the amount of each transaction whichever is greater

Cash-advance APR: 24.99%

You can avoid these fees by no longer using your credit card for cash-like transactions. It's best to consider your spending habits and make adjustments as needed so that you can avoid unwanted extra fees.

The exact date that these changes go into effect depends on the Chase card that you have. If you're unsure when to expect these changes you can contact Chase's customer service team or search your email inbox for a message with the subject line ""Important information regarding changes to your Chase account"" to read your updated agreement.

How to avoid cash-advance fees

If you want to ensure that you avoid cash-advance fees and accidental cash-like transactions from posting to your account contact Chase. You can adjust your cash-advance limit. You may want to make this limit zero or as low as possible so that you avoid accidentally paying more.

The bottom line

The Capitol riot extremists and others are engaging these companies in a game of cat-and-mouse as they spring from one fundraising tool to another utilizing new sites usernames and accounts.

In one case a crowdfunding website set up in late 2020 has been adopted by a defendant charged with storming the Capitol who used it to raise almost $180000. His was one of eight fundraisers on the site as of last week and his donations accounted for 84% of the money raised on the platform.

The trend isn't limited to extremists connected to Jan. 6. Neo-Nazi Paul Miller has crowdfunded legal fees through Cash App and asked for Bitcoin donations even after federal authorities arrested him this month for being a felon in possession of a firearm.

""It's so predictable and it's never going away"" said Megan Squire a computer science professor at Elon University who has studied how extremists raise money online. ""Whenever there's money involved it's never going to stop; there will always be something new that pops up.""

Bouncing from one fundraising site to the next

In the wake of the insurrection the popular crowdfunding site GoFundMe said it banned fundraising for travel to political events that have a ""risk for violence.""

After Jan. 6 payment processors such as PayPal and Stripe which handle credit and debit card payments for millions of online businesses found themselves in a seemingly never-ending shell game. Extremists involved in the insurrection worked to circumvent their systems by switching payment accounts and methods and hopping from one fundraising platform to the next.

Crowdfunding websites that were less squeamish about extremists stepped into the breach. CNN reported that the website GiveSendGo which bills itself as the ""#1 free Christian crowdfunding site"" became a refuge for insurrectionists hoping to raise a buck.

Unlike GiveSendGo most fundraising platforms take a small cut of the money donated.

In August GiveSendGo featured a campaign for Kyle Rittenhouse who shot and killed two people in Kenosha Wisconsin during a protest against police brutality. Rittenhouse's lawyers said he acted in self-defense.

As of last week 10 people accused in the Capitol riot were fundraising for legal fees on GiveSendGo according to a USA TODAY analysis.

GiveSendGo didn't respond to requests for comment.

Proud Boys Hawaii chapter founder Nicholas Ochs started a fundraiser for legal fees on GiveSendGo shortly after he was arrested on federal charges for entering the Capitol. On the encrypted messaging app Telegram Ochs briefly advertised his GiveSendGo page to plead for money before telling his followers the fundraiser had been removed. The fundraiser page which remains on the site shows Ochs raised almost $20000 in that brief window.

A week later Ochs found a new site to host his fundraiser: GoGetFunding. As of March 19 he had raised about $1300 on the site.

Texas Proud Boy Nick DeCarlo who was photographed grinning next to Ochs inside the Capitol also set up a GoGetFunding page for legal fees. He has raised more than $7000.

In an interview with USA TODAY GoGetFunding CEO Sandip Sekhon said the site discontinued Ochs' campaign for breaching its terms but it will allow DeCarlo's campaign to continue. He didn't explain why.

""We appreciate and understand this may not be agreeable in many cases but stand firm in allowing supporters of such individuals the ability to offer financial support towards the cost of impending trial"" Sekhon said.

DeCarlo and Ochs did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

The next big fundraising platforms for the far-right?

Brandon Straka a supporter of Donald Trump who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the insurrection has reportedly raised almost $180000 for his legal fees on the crowdfunding platform AllFundIt.

AllFundIt was created last fall by conservative blogger and Trump supporter Joe Dan Gorman as a ""Christian conservative alternative to GoFundMe"" according to his blog.

In an anonymous article in The Beltway Report titled ""Go Fund Me BANS Trump Supporters Campaigns While AllFundIt Welcomes All W/ Open Arms"" AllFundIt is referred to as ""the fundraising site created by patriots for everyone."" The article encourages those associated with the events Jan. 6 to use the platform to raise money.

Gorman and Straka did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Another website hosting crowdfunding for defendants in the Capitol riot Our Freedom Funding featured two fundraisers for members of the Proud Boys Joe Biggs and Dominic Pezzola. Both face federal charges in relation to the attack Jan. 6.

As of Wednesday afternoon the Biggs fundraiser was listed as having received $52201. Pezzola had received $730. Biggs' campaign disappeared from the site shortly after USA TODAY inquired about it.

Biggs did not respond to calls seeking comment. A representative of Our Freedom Funding contacted a USA TODAY reporter and defended the fundraisers for the two Proud Boys saying the site doesn't discriminate against customers for political reasons. The representative refused to provide his name.

Fundraising tech companies ramp up moderation efforts

For years hate groups used mainstream technology platforms to organize spread their message recruit members and raise money.

Time and again the platforms largely resisted calls to cut off these groups arguing these tools should be available to anyone as long as they were not engaged in illegal activities.

After the death of peace activist Heather Heyer in 2017 at the white nationalist “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville Virginia the tech sector confronted its role in enabling hate groups.

Crowdfunding and payment apps were among a wave of companies that set more stringent rules resulting in the removal of white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups as well as individuals who spouted hate and threatened violence.

GoFundMe shut down campaigns supporting the man accused of killing Heyer. PayPal put out a statement saying its “services are not used to accept payments or donations for activities that promote hate violence or racial intolerance.”

Yet even after tech companies tightened policies poured resources into policing their platforms and booted bad actors hate groups and their members slipped through the ramparts.

Research released in October showed that PayPal Stripe Facebook and Amazon continued accepting payments to hate groups in the USA.

According to the analysis by the anti-extremism think tank Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the nonprofit research group Global Disinformation Index 73 U.S.-based hate groups had access to at least 54 means of raising money online including crowdfunding and online payment tools.

PayPal cut all ties with GiveSendGo but PayPal and Stripe have taken a different approach with GoGetFunding AllFundIt and Our Freedom Funding. Rather than cut them off the companies stopped processing payments for individual fundraisers that violate their rules.

PayPal monitors these fundraising sites for ""adherence with our acceptable use policy"" spokesman Justin Higgs said.

Wednesday a USA TODAY reporter was able to donate $10 to Biggs' fundraiser on Our Freedom Funding using Stripe to process the payment.

A few hours later his campaign disappeared from Our Freedom Funding.

Friday a USA TODAY reporter donated to Pezzola's fundraiser using Stripe. Stripe told USA TODAY it does not comment on individual users.

A USA TODAY reporter was able to make a $1 donation to Pezzola's fundraiser using Venmo a payment app owned by PayPal. After being alerted by USA TODAY Venmo removed the account.

Soon a PayPal account took its place. PayPal caught that and removed it too.

“Any attempt to circumvent account closures is not permitted and the company will ban these accounts when detected” PayPal's Higgs said.

A Neo-Nazi on Cash App

This month Miller known to his thousands of fans as Gypsy Crusader used the messaging app Telegram to ask for donations through Cash App which is owned by Square.

In a statement the company said ""We have several teams that partner with compliance to continually monitor accounts for prohibited activity based on account use and transactional activity and if we find such activity we take appropriate action pursuant to our established policies.""

After being alerted by USA TODAY Cash App removed the account benefiting Miller but a new one soon popped up in its place.

By Monday morning that account had also been removed.",,,,,,

The transition of Fritolay’s Modesto plant fleet is nearly completed including infrastructure and nearly 60 vehicles. These include tractors box trucks yard trucks or forklifts which are either battery-electric or “natural gas with renewable attributes”.

Now the only remaining missing vehicles are the 15 electric tractors that are expected to be deployed later this year. These vehicles are the first Tesla Semis ordered in 2019 alongside 38 Volvo ultra-low carbon renewable natural gas trucks 12 battery-electric BYD forklifts 6 Peterbilt e220 battery-electric straight trucks and 3 battery-electric BYD yard trucks.

FritoLay says that the infrastructure for these vehicles is already installed and includes an adjacent natural gas station with “renewable attributes” along with solar carports battery storage truck charging systems and employee electric vehicle charging stations.

The project has required a total investment sum of $30.8M and is the result of a partnership with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) that was awarded a grant from California Climate Investments (CCI) which is a statewide program to reduce GHG emissions.

For its part CCI funding is awarded by several state agencies including the California Air Resources Board (CARB). These funds were matched with investments from Frito-Lay and American Natural Gas (ANG).

“We applaud the progress Frito-Lay has achieved thus far with its Modesto site project despite the current landscape implications with the pandemic” said Sydney Vergis chief of CARB’s Mobile Source Control Division. “This project is so important to the Valley as it will improve air quality and reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions.”

Indeevs points out that Pepsi and Fritolay will benefit from being some of Tesla’s first customers for the new Semis since new Tesla products attract a lot of media attention. Be that as it may residents in the surrounding areas should notice the difference in air quality.

Tesla Semi the automaker’s electric semi truck program has already seen several delays since it was first supposed to hit the market in 2019.

Recently it felt like things had changed and the Tesla Semi looked closer to production than ever before.

Last summer CEO Elon Musk told employees in an email obtained by Electrek that “it’s time to bring Tesla Semi to volume production” without updating the timeline.

This year Tesla has indicated that the electric truck would enter production by the end of the year with some deliveries to customers.

We have been seeing some evidence of that actually happening with new Tesla Semi prototypes being spotted for the first time since the original two prototypes unveiled in 2017.

Finally just last week PepsiCo one of Tesla’s biggest reservation holders for the Tesla Semi said that they expect 15 electric trucks from Tesla by the end of the year.

However despite all these recent indications that Tesla could produce a decent numbers of electric semi-trucks this year Musk threw some colder water on that this weekend in a new comment on Twitter:

We are too cell-constrained right now but probably ok next year — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 27 2021

Tesla’s electric truck production has been linked to the production of the new Tesla 4680 battery cell that the automaker unveiled during its ‘Battery Day’ last September.

The comment is vague enough that it doesn’t discard the possibility of Tesla producing some electric trucks this year but it does appear that the CEO has a less optimistic outlook on the Tesla Semi program than previous statements led us to believe.

Electrek’s Take

Again the comment is vague. The guy simply asked about how the Tesla Semi is coming along and Elon straight up says that there’s not enough cell but it will “probably be OK next year”.

We know that Tesla is currently only producing the new 4680 cell at its pilot plant in Fremont factory but even though it’s just a “pilot plant” Tesla apparently plans to ramp it up to several gigawatt-hours of production capacity.

It would be enough to produce a decent number of Tesla Semi electric trucks but Tesla also needs to use some of the production capacity to support the start of production of the Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin until Tesla can ramp up its local 4680 battery cell production there.

We didn’t expect high volume production of Tesla Semi until the automaker achieves volume production of battery cells at Gigafactory Texas.

Is this what Elon is referring to? Would there still be some Tesla Semi production in 2021?

Some have also linked delays in vehicle programs using Tesla’s 4680 cells like the Model S Plaid+ to potential delays in Tesla’s battery cell production plans.

What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below."

An initial investigation into the packaging of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine did not show any “obvious systemic factors” Hong Kong’s government said on Saturday days after use of the jab was suspended in the city and neighbouring Macau.

Authorities halted using the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Germany’s BioNTech and the US drugmaker Pfizer on Wednesday citing defective packaging in a move that triggered confusion in inoculation centres across the city.

The suspension came as Hong Kong faced a sluggish take-up of vaccines due to dwindling confidence in China’s Sinovac vaccine and fears of adverse reactions.

The city began its inoculation campaign with doses from Sinovac in February and began offering the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech in March. The latter is distributed in Hong Kong and Macau via a partnership between BioNTech and China’s Fosun Pharma while BioNTech partners with Pfizer in markets outside greater China.

In a statement published late on Saturday Hong Kong’s government said the results of the investigation carried out by BioNTech and Fosun did not rule out that the situation was “caused by environmental conditions during the long-haul transport process”.

It was not related to the cold-chain and logistical management of the vaccine and random testing of intact vials delivered to Hong Kong did not uncover any issue of leakage it said.

Both Fosun and BioNTech considered the vaccines to have no safety risks and people who have received them “do not need to worry” the government said.

The remaining part of the investigation will focus on “ascertaining the integrity of the intrinsic properties of the relevant batches of vaccine and that the batches are safe for use”.

The government said it was following up with Fosun and BioNTech to complete the investigation within a week to allow for a resumption of supplying the vaccines to the public.

Dr Lam Ching-choi member of a government task force overseeing vaccine distribution told the South China Morning Post that he expected the city to resume its inoculation programme next week after BioNTech and Fosun submitted their full investigation report.

“The findings currently show that more than one million remaining vaccines in Hong Kong are safe to use and it should be individual cases that some bottles with defects were found” Lam was quoted as saying.

“But the government will still ask the manufacturer to supply more batches of vaccines for the city to fulfil its order of 7.5 million doses. It will be better for us to wait for the full report although currently it is pretty certain that there are no safety concerns.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbi1kZXB0aC9ncmFwaGljcy8yMDIxLzAzLzI3L2NvbXBhcmluZy1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lcy82ODA2NjAwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparing the COVID-19 vaccines. Which vaccine will I get? What about side effects and efficacy comparison?,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines so far. We compare the different available shots and several still in the approval process for use in the United States.

Which vaccines are approved already?

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been available to Americans since December.

A vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals a Johnson & Johnson company was authorized in late February.

AstraZeneca working in collaboration with Oxford University is expected to request authorization from the FDA for their vaccine within a few weeks and Novavax is expected to follow with its application later in April or May.

What technology does each vaccine use?

Many vaccines use weakened or inactivated versions or components of the disease-causing pathogen to stimulate the body’s immune response. However the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna take advantage of messenger RNA (mRNA) which instructs cells to produce a protein on the surface of the virus. The immune system recognizes those vaccine-triggered spike proteins as invaders and creates antibodies to block future attacks of the virus that causes COVID-19.

More: How mRNA vaccines work

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine takes the more traditional approach. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause colds or flulike symptoms. The J&J team used a modified adenovirus that can enter cells but can’t replicate inside them or cause illness. The vaccine contains this modified virus that delivers a spike protein activating the immune system.

The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine also uses an adenovirus in this case a monkey virus that the human immune system doesn't recognize. It delivers the gene that encodes the spike protein to human cells rather than the protein itself.

Novavax's vaccine works by delivering lab-grown spike proteins along with a compound that attracts immune cells to the site of the injection.

Where is each vaccine developed?

Moderna Pfizer Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are all US-based companies. The J&J vaccine was developed by researchers at Harvard University and in Leiden Netherlands. Moderna based in Cambridge Massachusetts developed its vaccine in collaboration with U.S. government scientists. The AstraZeneca vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford and its spin-off company Vaccitech. BioNTech a biotechnology company based in Mainz Germany partnered with Pfizer to test and produce its vaccine.

How many shots do I need to get?

All the vaccines except the one from Johnson & Johnson require two shots to train the immune system well enough to fight the coronavirus.

After one dose of the Pfizer vaccine for example its effectiveness against illness reached up to 52% after 12 days and up to 95% a week after the second dose according to a study. That's why it's important for people who have received only one dose to keep practicing the usual precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests getting the second shot as close to the recommended dose schedule as possible but not earlier.

The J&J vaccine is a one-dose vaccine. However the company is also testing a two-dose regimen with the two shots given eight weeks apart.

How much do vaccines cost per dose?

Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech so far have been selling the majority of their doses to high-income countries including the U.S. Canada and the European Union. These are also the most expensive vaccines.

AstraZeneca-Oxford has the cheapest of the five vaccines. The company has committed not to profit from it while the pandemic lasts.

There have been reports of different prices being paid by governments in different parts of the world.

How much has the U.S. spent on each?

Overall the U.S. government has made vaccine deals totaling more than $9 billion with multiple private companies but the deals vary in size.

The pharmaceutical giant Merck will also receive $105 million from the government to help produce the J&J vaccine.

How many doses of each will the U.S. get?

President Joe Biden said in March that the U.S. will have enough vaccines for every adult in the U.S. by the end of May. The main challenge will now be to distribute the doses and to convince hesitant people to take them.

Do we have enough vaccine to go around?

The U.S. has purchased over 1 billion doses of vaccine for a population of 330 million.

According to a ONE's Policy team study the world’s richest countries have collectively bought 1 billion more doses than their citizens need. The rest of the world has been able to secure only 2.5 billion doses - not enough to vaccinate their populations.

The excess doses purchased by rich countries alone would be sufficient to vaccinate the entire adult population of Africa. In many developing countries widespread vaccination coverage might not be achieved before 2023 unless countries like the U.S. share their surplus.

Do temperature and storage requirements differ between vaccines?

The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require a complicated cold chain to safely distribute them. During each part of the process the vaccine boxes must be kept at exactly the right temperature. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be used within five days after the transfer to refrigerator. Moderna vaccine can last in the refrigerator for a month and the J&J vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 3 months.

More: How coronavirus vaccines will be shipped and distributed using 'cold chain' technologies

The Novavax and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines can be stored in normal refrigerators for up to six months.

What about safety and side effects?

Serious side effects allergic reactions or adverse incidents stemming from the vaccines are rare though in clinical trials mild to moderate side effects were common. The most common complaints were pain at the injection site fatigue and aching muscles and joints. People with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions should inform health professionals before they are vaccinated and anyone with an allergy to one of the vaccine's ingredients should consult a healthcare provider before getting vaccinated.

The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are recommending the U.S. pause on using the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after reports of blood clots in six of 6.8 million individuals who received the vaccine so far.

All six recipients were women between the ages of 18 and 48 with symptoms occurring 6 to 13 days after vaccination according to the statement. One woman died and one has been hospitalized in critical condition.

The health agencies released a statement on April 13 recommending the pause “out of an abundance of caution” saying blood clots still seem to be “extremely rare.” So far the CDC and FDA are reviewing six reported cases in the U.S.

The type of blood clot reported in individuals who have received the J&J vaccine is called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). As of April 12 more than 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been administered in the U.S. and approximately 9 million more has been shipped out to states according to the CDC.

The University of Oxford previously reported pausing administration of the vaccine it developed with AstraZeneca in a U.K. study to test the shot in children pending review of rare blood-clotting issues seen in adults after receiving the shot.

Do some vaccines work better than others?

Public health experts emphasize that all the vaccines are effective particularly at preventing serious disease.

Because trials were conducted differently at different times effectiveness figures cannot be directly compared.

In its large-scale trial the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was shown to prevent 95% of symptomatic COVID-19 just 1 percentage point more than Moderna's. Both vaccines appear to be equally protective across age groups and racial and ethnic groups.

The J&J vaccine was shown to be 72% effective in moderate to severe disease and 85% effective in preventing the most severe disease.

AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 two weeks after the second dose and was 100% effective in stopping severe disease and hospitalization in a U.S.-based clinical trial according to the company.

In a trial in the U.K. two doses of the Novavax vaccine were shown to be nearly 90% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 though just 50% effective in a smaller South African trial.

What do we still need to know?

It remains unclear how long any of these vaccines will continue to protect people. While the small number of early trial participants have maintained levels of protective antibodies for nearly a year companies will continue to follow volunteers for two years to see if their immunity begins to wane. Periodic booster shots to extend immunity and/or protect against new variants of the virus might be needed.

And although a growing body of research suggests that vaccines will also protect people from passing on the virus – even if they don't have symptoms – that remains to be confirmed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNzb25ldHdvcmsuY29tL2V2ZW50cy1zc28tZGlnaXRhbC13ZWVrLWV1cm9wZS9zcGVha2Vycy9uaWdlbC1jb2ZmZXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigel Coffey,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ssonetwork.com/events-sso-digital-week-europe/speakers/nigel-coffey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNzb25ldHdvcmsuY29tL2V2ZW50cy1zc28tZGlnaXRhbC13ZWVrLWV1cm9wZS9zcGVha2Vycy9uaWdlbC1jb2ZmZXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3V0YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS9taXJvLWxpdHRsZS10cmFuc2Zlci1wb3J0YWwtY29tbWl0bWVudC11dGFoLWJheWxvci1wZy10cmFuc2Zlci0tMjMxMzU1NDU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Four-star transfer PG Miro Little has committed to Utah,"On Tuesday Craig Smith and the Runnin' Utes picked up a very valuable transfer portal addition after former Baylor guard and four-star transfer Miro Little announced his commitment to the program. This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Hoggard has started at point guard for the Spartans the past two seasons recording 10.7 points and 5.2 assists per game this past year. He however elected to enter the transfer portal following the season instead of coming back for a fifth year at Michigan State.

Founded in the French Quarter in 1870 the Morning Call Coffee Stand is known around New Orleans for its beignets and cafe au lait. The business relocated to Metairie in the 1970s and expanded with a New Orleans location in City Park in 2012. By 2019 however both locations were closed and Morning Call was essentially homeless.

Now it's back in business and along with cravings for beignets and coffee many people will be returning with memories. These photos from our archives help tell the Morning Call story through the years.

In the heart of Leeds city centre stands the Pinnacle building.

The twinkly giant infrastructure that at 80 metres high was once the tallest building in Leeds and dominated the city’s skyline.

Even though it lost the prestigious title to Bridgewater Place in 2007 and other skyscrapers have since cropped up across the city the building can still be named as one glamorous buildings in West Yorkshire.

Now home to retail units and office space the eye-catching infrastructure which was first erected in 1973 wouldn’t look out of place in London’s Canary Wharf.

But behind the shiny exterior of the building lies a seedy and dark past.

The land where the building now stands was once home to one of the city’s most “notorious” brothels 200 years ago.

According to The Leeds Times a weekly newspaper that ran from 1833 to 1901 a “notorious brothel” was situated near to St James's church.

The city-centre place of worship was demolished more than 100 years ago but is now where the magnificent Pinnacle building is situated.

To get the latest email updates from LeedsLive click here.

Although not much is known about the particular brothel it may have gained notoriety for being one of the first of its kind.

It was in 1837 that the brothel was first named in the newspaper.

According to reports in the years that followed more brothels begun operating in the city centre largely around Boar Lane and Briggate.

Reports detail that five years after the newspaper reported on the “notorious brothel” there were an estimated 98 brothels in Leeds.

And by 1840 the city's ‘red-light district’ was rife – with 175 brothels believed to be scattered across the city and 1225 prostitutes working in Leeds.

In 1858 police launched a crackdown and arrested 35 sex workers on Boar Lane and Albion Street.

But by this point brothels had started appearing in other areas of Leeds.

By the late-1800s prostitutes were frequently seen in other parts of the city centre such as Park Lane the Dark Arches Swinegate and Whitehall Road.

It wasn't until the 20th Century that prostitutes began venturing a little further out making their way to the southern suburbs.

Nowadays the Pinnacle building sits in prime position nestled in amongst retailers in the shopping district.

According the building website the Grade A listed building is a place where many ""inspiring and innovative"" businesses reside.

The building's exterior and parts of the interior have also undergone a recent refreshment which allows for occupiers to enjoy an ""unrivalled"" working environment.

Many people pass by the shiny building and take a step back to admire the impressive infrastructure completely unaware of what once lay there.

It’s hard to know what exactly went on around Albion street all those years ago.

And even harder to imagine the seediness of the street when the Pinnacle building stands there in all its grandeur.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith II Georgia World Congress Center sold $440 million in municipal revenue bonds through a series of transactions last week according to regulatory filings.

The funding is for a new 975-room Hilton hotel next to the Mercedes Benz domed stadium. According to a presentation on the convention authority’s website the hotel is slated to have 75000 square feet of event space and parking for 490 cars. The high-rise structure will also have a glass exterior with extensive cosmetic lighting.

Most of the securities were unrated — often an indication that analysts aren’t sufficiently comfortable with long-term forecasts to predict the safety of a bond issue for investors.

Trade data posted online indicated one of the six groupings of bonds sold at a yield of 4.22 percent a high figure given current market conditions. Investors accept low yields when they are highly confident a bond will be repaid.

Bloomberg reported that the yield indicates investors are insisting on a “steep premium to compensate for the risk.”

The convention business has been pounded by the pandemic compelling officials in a number of states to resort to unusual measures to help convention authorities stay afloat.

“On the surface convention centers sound like a negative story because who’s going to a convention anytime soon?” Cooper Howard director of fixed-income strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research told Bloomberg. “But many of them have some other type of support.”

Bloomberg reported that the Georgia authority capitalized early interest payments on the bonds — borrowing the money necessary to make them and setting it aside — in a move to increase investor confidence.

Bloomberg quoted University of Texas at San Antonio professor Heywood Sanders as having said convention attendance was declining even before pandemic struck and he would be surprised if it were to bounce back anytime soon even after COVID-19 recedes given the rising comfort with online gatherings.

“Many of those virtual meetings will continue either fully virtual or in parallel with in-person events” he said according to Bloomberg. “Those will have the effect of reducing attendance at regular annual events. It’s inevitable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vaW5kaWEvcmFpbHdheXMtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS1sb2NvLXBpbG90LWd1YXJkLXRvLXByaXZhdGUtdHJhaW5zLTk2NzYwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railways to provide loco-pilot guard to private trains,Since these new trains will be over and above the existing ones operated on the network by railways there will not be any curtail of services in existing trains.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Today we share Blaine’s story.

Social worker and Whangārei mum Carolyn Procter always thought her son Blaine had ADHD.

His inability to sit still had him always getting in trouble even early on. When he was at daycare he was pegged as the “troublemaker”.

“He had no personal space. A couple of kids had some issues and Blaine was blamed and he wasn’t even there that day.

“Then we went to school we had teachers saying that he was being naughty and being grumpy at us.”

Procter said teachers would describe it as “typical boy” behaviour but she had a different view.

“I thought no this is not right. So we decided we were going to get him seen to.”

Blaine was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2020 at the age of 8.

“I was quite shocked actually that the diagnosis was autism.”

She went through a period of grief before the relief that Blaine could get the support required took over.

Procter describes her son as a “gap child”.

Blaine is too high functioning for a lot of support but she still has to keep an eye out to make sure there’s no support he is missing.

He was also diagnosed with dyslexia dysgraphia (difficulty with writing) attention deficit disorder and anxiety so she said that has opened more doors for help.

Now at intermediate her son is a passionate “justice warrior” something that can at times get him in trouble.

He’s struggled with bullying and fails to pick up on social cues and boundaries.

True to his ”justice warrior” label Procter described her son as someone with a lot of love and passion.

He loves horror movies and SCP’s - something the Advocate quickly grew to learn about during its visit where he gave an impassioned explanation as to what the monster alien creatures are.

“He will chat your ear off” Procter laughed.

Procter is a mother of three and jack of all trades. From chef work housecleaning and running craft markets she’s done a bit of everything.

More recently she decided to pursue a Bachelor of Applied Social Work at NorthTec.

She graduated in 2020 and after working in parent mentoring she was given the option to facilitate the Barnados Incredible Years Autism course.

She hasn’t looked back since.

“If I had that when I first had Blaine it would have been an absolute game changer” she said.

“You get parents coming along and you can see the changes. It’s about building relationships with our kids on the spectrum. How to engage with them.”

It’s a 14-week course one that she describes as pulling the layers “right back” for parents to create with a “child-led” mindset.

Procter is passionate about her work but said it’s also been a cathartic experience as a parent of an autistic child.

“It’s a bit of validation for me as well. I can say ‘oh hey I’ve been there I’ve done that. And I’ve tried this this is what works’.”

Her work aside Procter said her current focus is to get Blaine through his schooling.

“It’s the social and emotional wellbeing that worries me and his learning.

“Basically just his happiness is our goal.”

Blaine said he hoped people would educate themselves or their children and understand how autism works.

Ultimately he just wants to be included and treated with kindness.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over their criticisms of the company’s labor and business practices. But the discord reached new heights last week when Amazon aggressively went after both senators on Twitter in an unusual attack for a large corporation. With each new snarky tweet from an Amazon executive or the company’s official Twitter account insiders and observers alike asked a version of the same question: “What the hell is going on?”

It turns out that Amazon leaders were following a broad mandate from the very top of the company: Fight back.

Recode has learned that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos expressed dissatisfaction in recent weeks that company officials weren’t more aggressive in how they pushed back against criticisms of the company that he and other leaders deem inaccurate or misleading. What followed was a series of snarky and aggressive tweets that ended up fueling their own media cycles.

The timing was likely not coincidental. Bezos and other Amazon leaders are on edge as the company is facing the largest union election in its history at its Bessemer Alabama warehouse. Election results will be tallied early this week and Amazon officials understand that if a majority of the employees vote to unionize it could set off a chain reaction at other facilities — potentially forcing the e-commerce giant to overhaul how it manages its hundreds of thousands of front-line US workers.

There was terror inside the executive ranks of Amazon the last time a union election was held at a US Amazon facility — and that was only a small subset of a warehouse’s workforce the majority of whom voted against unionization. That vote happened in early 2014 and consisted of just 27 technicians and mechanics at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware. In Alabama though the stakes are much higher with nearly 6000 workers eligible to vote. Bezos knows all of this well.

So when news broke last week that Sanders was planning to visit Alabama in the final days of voting top Amazon executive Dave Clark fired off a Twitter thread that started with the following post.

“I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace” Clark’s account posted on Wednesday. “I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.”

1/3 I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9 — Dave Clark (@davehclark) March 24 2021

A few hours later the official “Amazon News” media relations Twitter account with more than 170000 followers snapped back against House Rep. Mark Pocan who had questioned Clark’s “progressive workplace” assertion by alluding to stories of Amazon’s pace of work being so demanding that workers have to “urinate in water bottles.”

“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you?” the official Amazon News account tweeted. “If that were true nobody would work for us.”

1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing do you? If that were true nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do and have great wages and health care from day one. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) March 25 2021

And after a back-and-forth with Warren that began with her criticizing the company’s tax payments the same Amazon account “quote-tweeted” Warren with this message:

This is extraordinary and revealing. One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she’s going to break up an American company so that they can’t criticize her anymore. https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g — Amazon News (@amazonnews) March 26 2021

An Amazon spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.

If Bezos wanted the news cycle off of the union drive for a bit it sort of worked. But instead of talking about the union media outlets and industry observers have been focused on the rarity and judgment of a trillion-dollar company sparring with powerful lawmakers on Twitter. Amazon’s pushback on Pocan’s comment about workers peeing in bottles also ignited another news cycle after the Intercept revealed internal Amazon communications acknowledging that contractors who deliver Amazon packages sometimes defecate in bags and urinate in bottles.

Amazon warehouse workers who’ve spoken to Recode over the years say it is indeed rare to hear of warehouse employees — as opposed to a delivery driver — urinating in bottles at work. But the bigger point many make is that it’s not uncommon for workers to take other measures such as limiting how much they drink to reduce their need to use the bathroom for fear of missing their production quotas or getting written up by supervisors for too much “time off task” as Amazon calls it.

Inside Amazon rank-and-file employees were also perplexed by the company’s Twitter approach. “Suspicious activity on @amazonnews Twitter account” was the title of one internal support ticket — called a trouble ticket inside the company — filed by an Amazon security engineer last week according to a screenshot viewed by Recode.

“Over the past two days there have been two threads by @amazonnews in response to comments made by US Government officials that have received considerable attention” the ticket reads. “The tweets in question do not match the usual content posted by this account.”

The security engineer noted that the tweets were posted using Twitter’s web app rather than Sprinklr the social media management software typically used by the Amazon News account to post tweets.

The tweets according to the security engineer “are unnecessarily antagonistic (risking Amazon’s brand) and may be a result of unauthorized access.”

The support ticket was closed without action according to a source.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vb3Rha3Vtb2RlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzYwNWYxODhkMjg5ZmQ3M2VlNTE3ZTY3My9Td29yZC1BcnQtT25saW5lLVByb2dyZXNzaXZlLUZpbG0tU2V0LUZvci1GYWxsLTIwMjEtUmVsZWFzZSHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sword Art Online Progressive Film Set For Fall 2021 Release! | Anime News,"Upcoming anime film Sword Art Online the Movie Progressive: Aria of a Starless Night is now set to premiere in Japan this fall!

Progressive bashing of evangelicals and Catholics is getting a little old as is the converse. It is pointless alienating and risks becoming an exercise in self-righteousness.

This is particularly so when the charge is that these groups are unloving and unaccepting without acknowledging that the meaning of the terms “love” and “acceptance” are part of the disagreement.

The most recent occasion for expressions of everything from progressive disappointment to progressive outrage was a statement by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith approved by Pope Francis declaring that “homosexual unions cannot be considered licit” and therefore cannot be blessed.

Catholics traditional evangelicals and Orthodox Christians find in the biblical narrative and the tradition of the church support for a particular understanding of the created order that they find intellectually coherent and emotionally satisfying. It appears in this document to be hierarchical and binary in its animal form gendered with regard to humans ordered by eternal laws and embraced in its entirety by God whose relationship with it gives it purpose and meaning.

The relationship of God to this created order is characterized by the word “love” and thus the maintenance and restoration of this order is the essential act of love. The life of Christ and particularly his death on the cross is the ultimate act of divine love to restore this order.

When love is defined in this way acts that discipline individuals into conformity with the created order are acts of love. They are human expressions of God’s relationship with God’s people over the millennia. There is no contradiction in saying that the Catholic Church loves LGBTQ persons and that it refuses to bless their marriages. The refusal to bless a particular homosexual behavior is an act of love intended to bring into or keep LGBTQ persons within the order of creation as taught by the church.

So as the full statement from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith says: “[it] is not intended to be a form of unjust discrimination. … The answer to the proposed dubium does not preclude the blessings given to individual persons with homosexual inclinations who manifest the will to live in fidelity to the revealed plans of God as proposed by Church teaching.”

For Roman Catholics (and Orthodox and evangelicals) this understanding of the created order leads to tension with the basic assumptions of contemporary society. The modern world is built on concepts of human freedom human self-responsibility continual change/evolution/progress and both personal and communal self-fulfillment. That quintessential modern document the U.S. Constitution tells us that “we the people” will take responsibility for the social order under laws that we will make.

In this modern context a distinctly progressive understanding of Christianity emerges. Similar movements emerged among other religions as well most obviously in Reform Judaism but also in Islamic modernism.

Progressive Christianity has broken from Catholic and evangelical views of how Scripture should be interpreted. It does not read the biblical narrative as a description of God’s unchanging order for creation. In Genesis 1 and 2 progressives find less a fixed order and more a process of ordering. That process is placed by God in the hands of human stewards. It is evolutionary as it responds to changing social situations and needs.

Not that progressives believe that humans are left on their own. They are not deists. Rather the scriptural narrative reveals the fundamental principles God has put in place to guide the continual progress of creation under its own natural laws and human stewardship. And it promises God’s spirit in guiding the progress of creation.

For progressives Jesus Christ then comes to heal a creation and humanity whose ability to progress has been broken by sin. Through his death and resurrection Christ by his spirit in the church restores humanity to its task overseeing the continual progression of the created order toward the reign of God as revealed in Jesus Christ’s own ministry.

Advertisement

While progressive Jews and Muslim don’t share this particular understanding of Jesus’ role they do share a focus on fundamental principles for ordering a society in the process of continual change and evolution rather than continuous reiteration of an eternal order.

And this leads to a progressive understanding of God’s love and thus human love that breaks sharply from the traditional view of love found in Roman Catholicism and evangelical Christianity.

For progressives God’s love revealed in Christ aims to fulfill as well as restore creation. Love accepts and embraces emerging forms of self-understanding and social relations so long as they move humanity and creation toward the ideals of God’s reign. Love accepts even as God does emerging ways of understanding and engaging in human relationships marked by faithfulness and fruitfulness; given that we still await the “full revealing of the glory of the children of God.” (Romans 7:19)

Perhaps put more sharply: For Roman Catholics and evangelicals humans advance toward the “glory of the children of God” through a restoration of the original hierarchical binary gendered human order while for progressives the movement is toward ways of being human too complex and diverse to be captured in that old order.

So ultimately there is little point in making accusations about who is or is not acting in “love.” Within their different frameworks for understanding progressives Catholics and evangelicals all love LGBTQ persons. What they do not have is a shared understanding of what the word “love” means.

Nor when it comes to it do we Christians have a fully shared understanding of what it means to “accept” LGBTQ persons.

Almost all Christians and no doubt Muslims Jews Buddhists Hindus Sikhs and other religious people would affirm that LGBTQ persons should be accepted as fully human and fully in possession of their rights as citizens. However progressives ask for more: that we accept LGBTQ experiences as giving an emerging insight into what it means to be fully human in God’s eyes. Only for progressives do those experiences offer a vision of God’s reign rather than exception to God’s rule.

In my wife’s language there is a saying “like chickens talking to ducks.” As if this is going to change anything. While my sympathies this may be clear in this essay it seems unlikely that religious people regardless of where they stand can make the fullest contribution to society by attacking one another without even grasping why they disagree. So instead of quacking and clucking we might consider trying to find the common language I believe exists or at least learn to be quiet long enough to hear and thus be heard.

The tweet came in response to criticism from Pocan who accused the company of putting on the facade of being a ""progressive workplace.""

""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust [and] make workers urinate in water bottles"" the congressman said.

AMAZON SWIPES AT SANDERS OVER MINIMUM WAGE WARREN OVER 'LOOPHOLES' COMMENT

Internal documents obtained by digital investigative news outlet The Intercept and retweeted by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez show that at least some Amazon management teams were aware of the fact that employees -- and in particular delivery drivers -- were urinating in water bottles and defecating in bags as a result of not having enough time to use a restroom.

One Pittsburgh-based Amazon employee sent a document labeled ""confidential"" to the outlet that lists behavior violations including ""public urination"" and ""public defecation.""

The same employee shared an email from an Amazon manager to employees with The Intercept condemning the third instance of a driver defecating in a bag in two months.

""This evening an associate discovered human feces in an Amazon bag that was returned to station by a driver"" the email reads according to The Intercept. ""This is the [third] occasion in the last [two] months when bags have been returned to [the] station with poop inside. We understand that [driver associates] may have emergencies while on-road and especially during Covid DAs have struggled to find bathrooms while delivering.""

The email continues: ""We’ve noticed an uptick recently of all kinds of unsanitary garbage being left inside bags: used masks gloves bottles of urine. By scanning the QR code on the bag we can easily identify the DA who was in possession of the bag last. These behaviors are unacceptable and will result in Tier 1 Infractions going forward. ... I know if may seem obvious or like something you shouldn’t need to coach but please be explicit when communicating the message that they CANNOT poop or leave bottles of urine inside bags.""

Another former Amazon delivery driver Halie Marie Brown told the outlet that the incidents happen because drivers ""are literally implicitly forced to do so otherwise we will end up losing our jobs for too many 'undelivered packages.'""

An email Brown shared with The Intercept warns employees to check their delivery vans ""thoroughly for garbage and urine bottle[s].""

""If you find urine bottle[s] please report to your lead supporting staff or me. Vans will be inspected by Amazon during debrief[ings] if urine bottle[s] are found you will be issue[d] an infraction tier 1 for immediate offboarding"" the email reads according to the outlet.

Yet another email from an Amazon manager that a Houston-based driver to The Intercept complains of ""several bad accidents a stolen van"" and ""drivers leaving piss bottles etc. in the vans.""

A number of reporters who have researched allegations of evidence working conditions at Amazon shared proof that employees complained of peeing in water bottles or not having enough time to use the bathroom on Twitter.

Amazon did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News.

Progressive politicians including Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. and Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. as well as conservative politicians including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. have increased pressure on Amazon to improve and be more transparent about worker conditions at its facilities. Their pressure comes as workers in Bessemer Alabama push a union vote that the company unsuccessfully attempted to delay.

Amazon's official brand account on Twitter has sparred with a number of lawmakers in recent days as the company attempts to vanquish the unflattering allegations.

The company has come under scrutiny after employees across the globe complained of poor working conditions amid COVID-19. On the other hand Amazon has employed 500000 global workers in 2020 including seasonal workers bringing its total workforce to more than 1.3 million the company announced during its fourth-quarter earnings call.

In 2020 Prudence Foundation launched “Cha-Ching Kid$ at Home” an e-learning version of the Cha-Ching program via  giving parents unlimited access to guides and daily challenges to help teach key money management concepts to their children at home amid the pandemic and social distancing measures.

Activities undertaken during the GMW celebrations included a TV interview a social media campaign that provided daily tips on money management and 30-second videos of young people speaking about money matters. Prudential Life JA Ghana the UK Ghana Chamber of Commerce and CAL Bank also collaborated to organize a webinar around the GMW theme. The webinar’s panellists discussed the importance of financial literacy amongst young people and the opportunities available for building financial resilience for families. In addition Young Ruler Magazines which feature Cha-Ching comics were distributed to eight children libraries and 20 basic schools across the country.

Emmanuel Mokobi Aryee CEO of Prudential Life Insurance Ghana said “Low literacy levels coupled with the low savings culture in Ghana negatively impacts households and ultimately national development. Prudential Life is passionate about improving the lives of young people through education and is happy to have the Cha-Ching program help with developing the right attitudes in young people towards money management”.

Abeiku Greene Executive Director of JA Ghana said “The need for financial literacy career counselling and job readiness training transcends political geographic and socio-economic barriers. Our partnership with Prudence Foundation and Prudential Life ensures that the Cha-Ching experience provides students with early exposure to skills needed to make wise financial choices in their day-to-day lives and in the future. JA Ghana believes that in order for children to grow up to be financially responsible adults they need early financially literacy”.

Around 5% of the flats are due to be provided with mobility scooter storage space and changes could be made to the adjacent roundabout to improve safety for cyclists.

The planned complex is also due to incorporate electric-vehicle charging points underground parking an internal courtyard garden as well as solar panels.

Although States Members on the committee will have the final say on whether the Andium Homes development gets the go-ahead the application has been recommended for approval by planning officers.

Meanwhile £12 million plans to demolish the former Jersey Evening Post offices at Five Oaks and replace them with a new Co-op Locale Le Gallais self-storage unit and four light-industrial units and offices are also due to be considered.

If approved the applicants Le Gallais have been asked to make a £31500 contribution towards the installation of new southbound and northbound bus shelters near the site the construction of a new pedestrian crossing and the ceding of a three-metre-wide strip of land to the government to facilitate future highway improvements. They must also contribute £40194 towards the bus service in the area.

The largest array of solar panels in the Channel Islands – capable of powering up to 15 homes – also forms part of the application as well as space for 58 cars and 26 bicycles.

JEP staff moved out of the ageing building in 2019 after 42 years and moved into the Le Gallais building in Bath Street.

The Five Oaks application has been recommended for approval by planning officers.

Meanwhile further west an application to extend and convert a redundant quarry-works building into a one-bedroom self-catering unit is also due to be considered.

The plans have been lodged by JAJ Properties a company owned by entrepreneur Jonathan Ruff. An application to install a three-bedroom ‘modular’ eco-house on the site was initially submitted but was later withdrawn amid a public backlash against the idea.

Details within the plans say traditional materials of stone slate and timber will be used to ensure the development harmonises with the surrounding landscape.

All three applications are due to be considered on 1 April during a virtual meeting.",,,,,,,,,

The Exynos 2100 joins Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 HUAWEI’s Kirin 9000 and Apple’s A14 Bionic as the brains behind early 2021’s flagship smartphones. So let’s take a look at what each of them has in store for our next-gen gadgets.

Before diving into the differences let’s start with two big similarities across all of these chips. First all four are manufactured on a cutting-edge 5nm EUV process. New manufacturing techniques at Samsung and TSMC foundries enable smaller transistor sizes than ever before resulting in greater density and improved energy efficiency. Both provide tangible improvements to chip capabilities performance and battery life.

The second common thread is the move to integrated 5G modems. With the exception of Apple’s A14 Bionic 2021 flagship smartphones benefit from an integrated 5G modem on the same chip as the processor and other components. Again integration is a boon for performance area size and energy efficiency. All four chipsets sport Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G network support. However there are other futureproof and cutting-edge feature differences. Combined with the move to 5nm next-gen smartphones already stand to receive some notable benefits for energy efficiency and battery life.

For a closer look at each of 2021’s flagship smartphone processors check out our individual coverage at the links below. Now let’s dive into a high-level comparison of these four flagship processors. Apple A14 Bionic

What to expect from next-gen performance One of the most obvious points of comparison is between the CPU setups in the Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon 888. Samsung and Qualcomm are both participants in the Arm CXC program netting them access to the powerhouse Cortex-X1 CPU core. Both chipsets also use three big Cortex-A78 cores and four small Cortex-A55s.

Samsung has clocked its CPU cores more aggressively however. This hints at a slight performance advantage for your day-to-day apps. Nevertheless there’s more at play than clock speeds such as core and system cache sweet spots which affect performance too. Regardless with Samsung’s custom Mongoose cores gone we can expect much closer performance and energy parity between Exynos and Snapdragon this generation. Benchmarks show the Cortex-X1 to be even beefier than Samsung’s last-gen M5 core so the Snapdragon catches up a lot in this regard.

We've seen much closer performance and energy parity between Exynos and Snapdragon this generation.

Turning to HUAWEI’s Kirin the older Cortex-A77 CPU cores offer an even higher peak clock which may help to close the last-gen performance deficit somewhat. Although the Cortex-X1 is by far the more powerful core for single thread scenarios. Likewise Apple’s custom Firestorm CPU cores remain even further at the front at least based on single-core benchmarks. However the other chipsets close the gap in multi-threaded environments just like previous generations.

There are bold performance claims to be had when it comes to graphics performance as well. Samsung claims a 40% GPU boost with the Exynos 2100’s 14-core Arm Mali-G78 implementation over last year’s 11-core Mali-G77 setup. However this setup is still much smaller than the Kirin 9000’s huge 24-core Mali-G78 configuration. Nevertheless performance doesn’t scale linearly with Mali GPU core counts so we don’t expect the Kirin 9000 to come close to doubling the Exynos 2100’s graphics performance. HUAWEI claims its GPU provides 52% more performance than Qualcomm’s 2020 powerhouse Snapdragon 865 Plus in the GFXBench benchmark. Although we haven’t seen this pan out in our in-house benchmarks thus far. 5nm chipsets: Snapdragon 888 vs Apple A14 vs Kirin 9000

Qualcomm is touting a 35% graphics performance improvement moving from the Snapdragon 865 to 888. In theory this should keep the chipset’s gaming performance out ahead of the Exynos 2100 and Kirin 9000 this generation. However as Samsung has closed the general performance this year we won’t see another heated debate over its Exynos and Snapdragon Galaxy handsets variants.

Apple’s A14 Bionic offers the smallest generational graphics improvement estimated to be in the region of 8% over last year’s A13 chip. However Apple had a healthy lead anyway so will remain competitive this generation. Regardless of which chipset powers your next phone Android gaming performance is set for a major boost compared to 2020 smartphones.

Benchmark results

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

So how do these theoretical improvements shake out in the real world? To check the claims we’ve grabbed a selection of smartphones powered by these new chips and run a selection of popular benchmarks.

We’ve tested Apple’s A14 and A13 Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 and 865 Plus the Exynos 2100 and 990 as well as the Kirin 9000 and 900. So we can also track the generation to generation performance gains from each chipset vendor.

Traditional benchmarks confirm the broad rankings based on paper specifications. Apple’s A14 Bionic keeps its head out in front for single-core CPU performance followed by the Cortex-X1 powered Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100. AnTuTu’s system performance score sees the Kirin 9000 climb the rankings while 3DMark shows that HUAWEI’s chipset ends up further down the list for graphics performance. What’s particularly interesting is that fast Snapdragon 865 Plus smartphones from the previous generation such as the ASUS Rog 3 remain very competitive with 2021 flagship smartphones.

For a closer look at system performance we’ve broken out our in-house Speed Test GX benchmark. The results pretty much confirm the trend from the legacy benchmarks. There’s a marginal lead for Apple’s chip followed by Qualcomm’s latest flagship then Samsung then HUAWEI.

In summary the Snapdragon 888 hasn’t quite matched the lofty performance expectations touted by Qualcomm but it’s not far off. It appears that the graphics performance improvements are somewhat muted over the previous generation Snapdragon 865 Plus unless the title benefits from variable-rate shading. Even so the Snapdragon 888 is the fastest chipset in the Android ecosystem and is just a smidgen behind the Apple A14 in our in-house benchmark.

Overall there’s a notable CPU performance boost to be had this generation whether you’re picking a Snapdragon Exynos or Kirin powered smartphone. The battle hasn’t been this close in years.

Breaking down the other major trends

Performance is a small part of the mobile SoC landscape these days. High-end chipset features also power AI photography multimedia networking and other essential aspects of our smartphones.

Without a much deeper look at each system architecture we can’t say a whole lot about AI performance based on the trillion operations per second (TOPS) metric that’s so often banded about. After all what does each of those operations actually do? Even so we can use the numbers provided to get a rough look at the landscape and how performance is improving this generation.

There's at least a 70% boost to AI performance across all four chips.

The Apple A14 boasts 11TOPs of AI inferencing performance which is an 83% boost over the 6TOPs in the A13. The Exynos 2100 has a new tri-core NPU capable of processing 26 TOPS up from 15 TOPS in the Exynos 990. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 boasts a similar 26TOPs of AI compute so another 73% increase from the Snapdragon 865’s 15TOPs. HUAWEI is bolder claiming a 2.4x performance win for AI processing capabilities via its NPU over Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865.

So big improvement claims all around. The key takeaway is that more demanding AI applications can run faster than ever before. As long as apps leverage the correct APIs for each platform.

More noticeable changes are found in the camera and multimedia departments.

The Exynos 2100 leads the charge with new ISP support for 200MP camera resolutions. Alternatively the ISP can process streams from four cameras simultaneously. You’ll find the same 200MP single shot support with the Snapdragon 888 or up to three 24MP cameras running at once. Samsung and Qualcomm both support up to 8K 30fps video capture but only the former sports 8K 60fps playback. Qualcomm does 8K at 30fps. We’ll have to see if smartphones end up implementing these 8K and multi-camera features. Snapdragon SoC guide: All of Qualcomm’s smartphone processors explained

Unfortunately we don’t have the same information about the A14 Bionic and Kirin 9000. But as these chips appear exclusively in devices from the same manufacturers we’ll have to make device-by-device comparisons. What we do know is that they’re tightly integrating photography and AI capabilities to produce better-looking images.

Huawei for example combines the power of its ISP and NPU in the Mate 40 series to color balance its RYYB image sensor offer digital image stabilization and power other parts of its XD Fusion suite. This includes portrait enhancements multi-frame HDR and real-time 4K bokeh blur. The iPhone 12’s “deep fusion” enhancements pitch in for low light portraits HDR frame blending and software zoom enhancements.

Each chip offers a different array of camera features but all support a growing number of sensors and integrated AI processing.

Samsung has its own bag of tricks too. The Exynos 2100’s multi-camera and frame processor (MCFP) takes data from up to four cameras to improve zoom and wide-angle performance. ISP and AI processors in combination also power scene facial and object recognition and enhancements. Qualcomm offers similar features with the Snapdragon 888. This includes AI autofocus auto-exposure and white balance as well as the ability to run object detection and segmentation directly on the ISP for 4K video. However it remains to be seen how many Snapdragon 888 smartphones will make use of these features.

Of course chipsets are only a part of the photography picture. Lenses and sensors matter just as much. 2021 is certain to see smarter more powerful smartphone cameras with a longer list of features. As such we should expect a wide range of capabilities and setups in the market as manufacturers pick and choose which features to best leverage ranging from 8K video prowess multi-camera image blending and AI enhances capabilities. 2021 will be another exciting year for mobile photography.

What to expect from 2021 mobile processors

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

5nm and 5G are the headline talking points for 2021 processors. Smaller more efficient 5nm processors lend themselves to some of the more notable performance gains we’ve seen in recent generations. Although gaming looks to be a big winner on paper it appears that Android smartphones actually stand to benefit more from single-core CPU uplift. At the same time denser chips pack in more AI image processing and networking features than ever before. All four of these SoCs will have you well covered for general performance and demanding apps.

If you’re buying a phone for the long term with an eye for 5G networking all four chipsets have you covered for the eventual transition to Standalone 5G networks down the line. However it’s worth mentioning that the Snapdragon X60 modem inside the Snapdragon 888 introduces 5G Voice-over-NR (VoNR) capabilities. It also has enhanced carrier aggregation across sub-6GHz and mmWave. So does the Exynos 2100 but you won’t find this tech with the Apple A14 Bionic’s Snapdragon X55 modem. Although again many 5G capabilities will come down to individual handsets and not just the chipset.

Great phones can be built from all four chips. It comes down to in-house versus third-party handset development.

What matters most is the final smartphones. Apple and HUAWEI both benefit from the close relationship between their handset and chipset design teams. They can make the most of what their respective chipsets have to offer. So does Samsung to some extent although it tends to aim for parity when mixing and matching chips within its Galaxy smartphone range. Qualcomm assists its partners but can’t make them embrace every little trick the Snapdragon 888 has to offer. Smartphone implementations therefore remain wide open.

Thanks to these premium-tier chipsets 2021 is poised to be another good year for smartphones. Especially for gamers and multi-media enthusiasts. The bigger unknown is whether these new SoCs and features will result in yet higher smartphone prices or if the move to integrated components will lessen the overall bill. Analysis of the iPhone 12 points to a big cost hike moving from 7nm to 5nm although Samsung has launched its most affordable Galaxy S21 series in years.

We’ll have to wait for a few more launches before we have a full overview of how 2021’s premium smartphone market will shape up.

The image highlights two features of the model: the slim body and the presence of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 780G SoC. But what is important here?

The fact is that the Snapdragon 780G is Qualcomm’s second SoC after Snapdragon 888 built using the norms of a 5-nanometer technological process. It also uses the “1 + 3 + 4” scheme: the CPU is divided into three clusters with one high-performance core three of the same cores but operating at a lower frequency and four energy-efficient cores. An important difference from the Snapdragon 888 is the lack of a Cortex-X1 super core – it is certainly very powerful but it is rumored to be the source of power consumption and heating issues for the Snapdragon 888.

Snapdragon 780G

The Snapdragon 780G will not have such problems as all four powerful cores are the well-known Cortex-A78. Why did Xiaomi give this SoC specifically to the Mi 11 Lite 5G? In this casethey didn’t have to innovative on expensive cooling subsystems like the Mi 11 Ultra while the Mi 11 Lite 5G is presented by the manufacturer as the thinnest and lightest Xiaomi smartphone from the current line which moreover will not have problems with autonomy. All in all moving to a 5nm process and dropping the Cortex-X1 from the SoC could be a very good combination.

The performance of the Snapdragon 780G is also complete. According to official data the CPU is 45% faster than its predecessor (that is the Snapdragon 768G CPU); and the Adreno 642 GPU is 50% faster than the Adreno 620 GPU in the same Snapdragon 768G. Judging by the data available on the Web the Snapdragon 780G risks repeating the success of the Snapdragon 750G; but only in upper mid-range smartphones.

Among other innovations of the Snapdragon 780G we should note the presence of an integrated 5G modem; and for the first time in the series the Spectra 570 image processor; which allows you to take photos from three cameras simultaneously. The Snapdragon 780G also benefits from updated GPU drivers and Snapdragon Elite Gaming features like the Snapdragon 8 Series platforms.

It is worth mentioning that recently Qualcomm announced the next Snapdragon 7 series processor named the Snapdragon 780G 5G. The new chipset will aim to provide better AI performance better camera experience and 5G support. Plus it comes with some advanced features.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0dmJoYXJhdC5jb20vZW5nbGlzaC9zY2llbmNlLWFuZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NjaWVuY2UtYW5kLXRlY2gtd2Vla2x5LXdyYXAvbmEyMDIxMDMyODA5MzAzMDEwOdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0dmJoYXJhdC5jb20vYW1wL2VuZ2xpc2gvc2NpZW5jZS1hbmQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zY2llbmNlLWFuZC10ZWNoLXdlZWtseS13cmFwL25hMjAyMTAzMjgwOTMwMzAxMDk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Science and Tech Weekly Wrap,"Hyderabad: Science and Tech stories of the week.

It makes the process more sustainable more effective and faster than ever before. The platform will produce the first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system to enable recycling and reuse of all water from the dyeing process.Every year trillions of litres of water is used for fabric dyeing alone generating around 20 per cent of the world’s wastewater. This untreated wastewater is polluting and traditionally required rigorous lengthy and costly treatment to make the water reusable. Designed to help address water scarcity and pollution caused by cotton dyeing Colour on Demand is a new system composed of a set of technologies that will enable the recycling and reuse of all water from the dyeing process establishing the world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system.

Ralph Lauren has unveiled Colour on Demand a new dyeing platform meant to transform how the fashion industry colours cotton. It makes the process more sustainable more effective and faster than ever before. The platform will produce the first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system to enable recycling and reuse of all water from the dyeing process.#

In addition to significant water savings Colour on Demand dramatically reduces the amount of chemicals dye time and energy used in the cotton dyeing process. Further for the first time in the industry Colour on Demand also provides a more efficient and sustainable way to colour cotton at any point in product manufacturing rather than at the outset. This will enable significantly shorter lead times for making product colour decisions.“Traditional colour dyeing is one of the most polluting practices in our industry and as a global brand we recognised the need to create a scalable solution” said Halide Alagöz chief product and sustainability officer at Ralph Lauren. “Colour on Demand significantly reduces the environmental impact of dyeing cotton and as an added benefit will enable us to better balance inventory and meet personalised consumer demands faster than ever before.”Ralph Lauren brought together four leading innovators in their respective fields - Dow a leader in materials science; Jeanologia a leader in sustainable solutions for garment and fabric finishing with high expertise in garment dyeing and close loop water treatment systems; Huntsman Textile Effects a global chemicals company specialising in textile dyes and chemicals; and Corob a global technology leader in dispensing and mixing solutions - to reimagine each stage of the colouring process and join this shared mission to create a more sustainable and efficient system for cotton dyeing.As part of the first phase of Colour on Demand Ralph Lauren optimised the use of Ecofast Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment a pre-treatment solution developed by Dow for cotton textiles. When used with existing dyeing equipment Ecofast Pure enables the use of up to 40 per cent less water 85 per cent fewer chemicals 90 per cent less energy and a 60 per cent reduction in carbon footprint compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. Ralph Lauren is integrating this process into its supply chain and will launch product using this technology later this year.“Water scarcity and pollution are important issues for the fashion industry and through our partnership with Ralph Lauren we are working towards addressing these challenges” said Sheila Bonini senior vice president Private Sector Engagement at World Wildlife Fund. “Technology has the ability to accelerate change at a scale that matters so it’s exciting to see Ralph Lauren establishing innovative new models that transform outdated practices and can deliver measurable outcomes for people and planet. This is exactly the kind of leadership we need to see from the fashion industry.""

Here are five takeaways from the Green team’s 31-21 win over White:

1. Cade Fortin looks like the Week 1 starting quarterback.

Coach Jeff Scott repeatedly has praised Fortin’s development this spring and it showed Saturday. Fortin finished 14-of-23 for 224 yards and two touchdowns in the first half for the Green team. Beyond the numbers he had one of the day’s best throws (a 50-yarder to Xavier Weaver on the first play from scrimmage) and one of the best runs (a 23-yard scramble).

USF’s other experienced option Miami transfer Jarren Williams was shakier as the White team’s starter. He finished 9-of-19 for 98 yards and a touchdown plus what would have been a fumble in a normal game.

Scott doesn’t see an advantage to naming a starter this early so expect the competition to continue into the fall. But Fortin looks like the Bull to beat heading into the offseason.

2. Timmy McClain is a name to know.

Scott has compared the three-star early enrollee to Michael Vick because of his athleticism. That’s a little lofty after one spring but the left-handed Sanford native can clearly be a dynamic weapon. He’s a shifty runner (six carries for 30 yards) and can zip passes into tight windows.

“He did not look like your typical freshman” Scott said.

But there were times when McClain did. He underthrew at least three open receivers in an 8-of-13 day. Still his flashes (one rushing touchdown one passing touchdown) are enough to show his sky-high potential.

3. The rushing attack remains a work in progress.

After rushing for slightly under 4 yards per carry last year — 81st nationally — USF’s run game still sputtered Saturday. The Bulls’ backs gained only 90 rushing yards on 24 carries (3.8 yards per attempt) in the first half with Yasias Young accounting for the only rush of at least 10 yards.

But don’t put too much stock in the performance. Scott said the Bulls were banged up along the offensive line forcing younger players into more action than they might have otherwise gotten. This remains an aspect to monitor — and one that will have to continue to grow if USF’s offense is going to click correctly.

4. The deep passing game still has room to develop too.

USF’s vertical passing struggled last season; the Bulls ranked second-to-last in the AAC and 106th nationally at 6.2 yards per attempt. Aside from Fortin’s game-opening bomb to Weaver USF didn’t have another successful deep attempt in the first half.

There were flashes in the second half though. Katravis Marsh completed a 67-yard pass to Bryce Miller and a 48-yarder to Garret Reynolds.

Although Scott wishes his offense had connected on a few more deep balls there was some progress. That’s crucial because Scott’s offense relies on stretching the field vertically to open up more run lanes.

5. The transfers are making early impacts.

USF’s push in the transfer portal for immediate contributors especially in the secondary looks successful.

Will Jones (Kansas State) led Green with six tackles and forced a first-half fumble with a jarring hit. Matthew Hill (Auburn) had a pair of tackles and Riverview High alumnus TJ Robinson (Rutgers) played well in red-zone coverage.

Last night Murphy tweeted out the following:

Wonna steal the show’s at #WrestleMania @WWEAleister ? 😉 — Buddy Matthews (@SNM_Buddy) March 27 2021

Aleister Black was last seen on WWE TV on October 2020. On the October 12th episode of Monday Night RAW Black lost a no DQ match against Kevin Owens. Aleister was then drafted to SmackDown in the October draft and has not appeared since.

It has been reported that the former NXT Champion is currently dealing with some minor injuries which may explain the lengthy absence. Aleister has also been quiet about his current status on social media. However in a recent tweet he did reference his time working with Andrade who was recently released by WWE:

.@AndradeElIdolo goes synonymous with my WWE career. My 1st opponent & the opponent I won the belt from. From start to finish a total pro and in my opinion few have his footwork ability to commit and execute in-ring techniques. Amigo thank you for everything. — Malakai Black (@malakaiblxck) March 23 2021

Murphy recently returned to WWE TV after an extended absence with an appearance on the March 5th episode of SmackDown. This will not be the first time that Black and Murphy have faced off in one on one competition. The two faced off in multiple matches throughout late 2019 and early 2020 with the striking man from Amsterdam picking up victories on every occasion. Murphy’s final loss to Black caused him to snap and join the Monday Night Messiah Seth Rollins as one of his disciples.

If the match ended up taking place at Raymond James Stadium next it will be the second singles match for each superstar at WrestleMania. Last year Black defeated Bobby Lashley on night 1 of WWE’s biggest event of the year. On the pre-show to WrestleMania 35 Buddy Murphy lost his Cruiserweight Championship to Tony Nese.

WrestleMania 37 will take place on Saturday April 10th and Sunday April 11th at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS93d2UvbmV3cy93d2UtdGh1bmRlcmRvbWUtcmVzaWRlbmN5LWVuZHMteXVlbmdsaW5nLWNlbnRlci1hdWd1c3QtMy1saXZlLWZhbnMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9jb21pY2Jvb2suY29tL3d3ZS9hbXAvbmV3cy93d2UtdGh1bmRlcmRvbWUtcmVzaWRlbmN5LWVuZHMteXVlbmdsaW5nLWNlbnRlci1hdWd1c3QtMy1saXZlLWZhbnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Long Will The WWE ThunderDome Stay at the Yuengling Center?,"✖

The WWE ThunderDome will be moving to its third location — the University of South Florida's Yuengling Center — after their residency at Tampa's Tropicana Field ends on April 2. That following week's lineup of programming will either be pre-taped episodes from ""The Trop"" or at Raymond James Stadium for WrestleMania 37 but WWE will go back to operating exclusively in front of virtual fans after that. The arena's official website now states that's the residency inside the building will last until Aug. 3 and specifically states that live fans will not be permitted to attend episodes of Raw SmackDown or pay-per-views.

""WWE takes great pride in providing our fans and network partners with cutting-edge production and one of the most interactive atmospheres in all of television every single week"" WWE executive producer Kevin Dunn stated in the website's press release. ""We look forward to the next iteration of the WWE ThunderDome at Yuengling Center as we continue to take the fan experience to a whole new level.""

As for when WWE can get back to touring in front of live crowds WWE Chief Financial Officer Kristina Salen stated during an investors' conference call back in February that WWE doesn't plan on having those events again until the second half of 2021.

The one exception to all of this is WrestleMania 37 which will reportedly have 25000 fans in attendance on each night. You can see the full cards for both nights below:

Night One

WWE Championship: Bobby Lashley vs. Drew McIntyre

Bobby Lashley vs. Drew McIntyre SmackDown Women's Championship: Sasha Banks vs. Bianca Belair

NVIDIA RTX A5000 & RTX A4000 Workstation Ampere Graphics Cards Spotted Laptop Variants Also Coming

The NVIDIA RTX A5000 and RTX A4000 graphics cards are based on the Ampere GPU architecture and are siblings to the flagship RTX A6000. Both graphics cards were submitted for the OpenCL 1.2 validation to Khronos Group. Currently the NVIDIA RTX A6000 uses the full GA102 GPU so one can assume that the RTX A5000 and RTX A4000 would also come with the full configurations of NVIDIA's Ampere GA104 and GA106 GPUs respectively.

That would give the NVIDIA RTX A5000 a total of 6144 CUDA cores and considering that we will be looking at a 256-bit bus we can expect either 16 or 32 GB GDDR6 memory. The NVIDIA RTX A4000 would get the full GA106 GPU with 3840 CUDA cores and could end up with up to 12 GB of GDDR6 memory running across a 192-bit bus interface.

NVIDIA Ampere Workstation Graphics Cards:

In addition to the submission the NVIDIA RTX A5000 workstation graphics card has been spotted within a workstation laptop comprising of an Intel Core i7-11600H CPU. The laptop was tested in the Ashes of The Singularity benchmark and while we don't get any new details regarding the GPU itself the CPU tested here is surprising as it is the first time we are seeing since the 8th Gen parts that a Core i7 SKU is getting 6 cores and 12 threads. Of course this is a Tiger Lake-H laptop CPU but it looks like it would feature a base clock of 2.90 GHz and 9 MB of L3 cache.

No other details for the laptop are confirmed and the score should be dismissed as it is slower than the RTX 3060 due to un-optimized drivers. All we can tell is that NVIDIA is indeed preparing more affordable workstation graphics cards based on its Ampere GPU architecture and we can expect them to launch in the coming months in both desktop and laptop discrete flavors.

And unfortunately there is no McDonald's color theme to compliment the name. With some graphics cards already equipped with a honey bee-theme on the market we bet someone out there would love a fast-food theme for a graphics card!

Seriously though we don't know why this card is called the Big Mac. It could a Chinese reference we don't understand.

For specs the card features the 3060's usual 3584 CUDA cores 12GB of memory and reference frequencies of 1320Mhz for the base clock and 1777MHz for the boost frequency. The card's TDP remains the same as the reference specs as well at 170W. But the card is no slouch. Even at stock speeds its still one of the best graphics cards you can buy in 2021 if you can find one close to MSRP.

The card's size is rather compact measuring at just 18.3cm and a width of 12.2cm. That means it's just two slots thick and a few centimeters over the standard height of the PCI-e bracket. So if you want to fit this card in a compact case make sure it has extra height clearance to fit the card.

For cooling the card features two fans of unknown size plus a fin array heatsink below the fans. However we don't know how many heat pipes the cooler has or how the cooler is set up.

For aesthetics the card is basically the definition of normal with no RGBs in sight and a plain matte-black shroud. The only hint of color is the ""M"" branded stickers on the fan hubs with a green-and-white theme. But at least you get a nice-looking matte-black backplate. Usually for cards that look this cheap you don't receive a backplate to keep costs low.

We don't know how much this card costs or if it will ever be shipped to the USA or other countries. But in a time when graphics card shortages are the norm it's nice to see more graphics cards being produced even if some models never make it out of China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvZW10ZWstZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA2MC1taXJhY2xlLWQ2LXN0aW5ncy1saWtlLWEtYmVlLWhvbmV5Y29tYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emtek GeForce RTX 3060 Miracle D6 Stings Like A Bee With Sweet Honeycomb Design,"



Emtek might not be a name that's familiar to HotHardware readers in the United States but the brand is quite popular in its home market of South Korea. The company's latest GeForce RTX 3060 offering has us a bit jealous of its design which doesn't go the boring ""reference card"" route.

The Emtek GeForce RTX 3060 Miracle D6 has a bee-themed design complete with a black and orangish-yellow color scheme. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the card is its honeycomb cutout design over one of the fans. A custom graphics card wouldn't be complete without RGB lighting so it's no surprise that the ""Miracle"" logo at the top of the card lights up. Muhammad Ali would be proud as this card certainly floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.

The Miracle D6's specs are a dead ringer for the rest of the GeForce RTX 3060 clan with 12GB GDDR6 memory a base clock of 1320MHz a boost clock of 1777MHz and 3584 CUDA cores. You'll also find a TDP of 170 watts and a single 8-pin power connector for the current entry-level GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics card.

The GeForce RTX 3060 is the first Ampere-based graphics card from NVIDIA with a built-in cryptocurrency (Ethereum) limiter which is supposed to reduce its appeal to the mining community. However the limiter -- which uses a combination of hardware BIOS and driver hooks -- was quickly defeated with a beta graphics driver. Miners later found another workaround using a dummy HDMI plug in multi-GPU mining rigs. The GeForce RTX 3060 may be the first but it likely won't be the last Ampere graphics card to feature an ETH limiter.

The GeForce RTX 3060 is currently in the entry-level position in NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 lineup. Still it will soon be undercut by the looming GeForce RTX 3050 Ti on the desktop side of the equation according to the latest update from AIDA64. The GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is rumored to include 2560 CUDA Cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory on a 12-bit memory bus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9haWRhNjQtZ2V0cy1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwLXRpLWFuZC1yYWRlb24tcngtNjYwMC14dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AIDA64 gets support for GeForce RTX 3050 (Ti) and Radeon RX 6600 (XT),"AIDA64 supports upcoming graphics cards

A new update to diagnostic and monitor tool AIDA64 brings support for multiple unreleased SKUs.

AIDA64 6.32.5659 Beta released yesterday received support for a long list of upcoming graphics cards. According to the changelog the software will support Radeon RX 6700 non-XT as well as Radeon RX 6600 series both the XT and non-XT variants. Interestingly the developer thinks that the RX 6600 series are based on Navi 23 GPU exclusively.

The changelog also appears to list support for various GeForce RTX 3050 series GPUs both mobile and desktop. It would seem that these cards will all feature GA107 GPU. Furthermore this version of the software also has RTX 3080 Ti support but this is not actually the first time AIDA64 has received ‘GPU information’ for this SKU.

The GPU information which appears in the changelog is clearly based on the public PCI Device ID list so it should not necessarily be treated as a confirmation of any of those SKUs. Neither NVIDIA nor AMD have confirmed launch dates for their mid-range/entry-level graphics cards.

BANGOR Maine — 16-year-old Vetri Vel who attends Bangor High School ended up placing sixth in the popular Regeneron Math and Science statewide competition. Winning 6th place from the 25 finalists also came with an $80000 prize.

Regeneron and Society for Science Talent Search is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors.

Vel created a deep learning system that combines a small computer and a thermal camera to detect heat signatures of a fallen person and immediately text for help.

His hands-free detection system was able to distinguish among competing images to identify a fallen person at an average accuracy of 98 percent. Vetri says he started his project after a neighbor collapsed alone at home and knew that was a popular problem many seniors in Maine and throughout the world were facing. Vetri tells NEWS CENTER Maine that falls among senior citizens are a leading cause of fatal injury among older adults the reason why he decided to focus his project on finding a solution to the wide-known problem.

ORIGINAL STORY

""One of the things I think the judges appreciated was that I kept continuously improving the system not the big test is testing it for a month in an actual senior living facility in a room and see what kind of false positives it gets and then I can use those to cut down on some of the common errors that it has"" said 16-year-old Vel.

“Congratulations to Vetri on winning a sixth place in the Regeneron Science Talent Search 2021” said Maya Ajmera President and CEO of Society for Science and Publisher of Science News. “He is a bright young scientist whose research has the potential to increase the safety and independence of elderly people living alone at home or in assisted living facilities and we are excited to see where his research takes him.”

Historically the competition and award ceremony is held in person in Washington D.C. but due to the ongoing pandemic the competition took place virtually to keep the finalists and their families safe.

More than $1.8 million was awarded to the finalists who were evaluated based on their projects’ scientific rigor their exceptional problem-solving abilities and their potential to become scientific leaders.

""These young people are the stewards of our future and I could not be more inspired by their hard work and pure grit"" said Ajmera.

The Regeneron Science Talent Search competition celebrates the hard work innovative thinking leadership qualities and creativity of students who are bringing a fresh perspective to solving significant global challenges through their own research and discoveries.

“Congratulations to this year’s winners of the Regeneron Science Talent Search. Your curiosity and passion for science – as well as your unique genius for it – has now been validated” said George D. Yancopoulos M.D. Ph.D. Co-Founder President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron who credits his experiences as a winner of the 1976 Science Talent Search for propelling him on a path that led his team to invent several of the world’s most important medicines including treatments for blindness allergic diseases Ebola and COVID-19. “I hope you now take on the responsibility of using your powers and ingenuity to help address some of the truly existential challenges facing humanity from disease to climate change.”

Vel tells NEWS CENTER Maine he will use all of those $80000 to help pay for his university education. He recently was admitted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. he said MIT was his dream school so he most likely will pursue a double major in physics and electrical engineering.

""I'd like to thank Regeneron and the Society for Science for setting this up because they did such a good job they sent us packages with everything we needed items for each day and it was fun doing that they scheduled events every day for us we played games and got to know each other and that formed a pretty big net with the rest of the kids"" said Vetri.

Vetri says about 18 of the new friends he made at Regeneron have been accepted to MIT so he is excited to potentially go to a school with some familiar faces!

These students will join the ranks of other Science Talent Search alumni many of whom have gone on to have world-changing careers in STEM fields and some of whom have earned the most esteemed honors in science and math including the Nobel Prize National Medal of Science and MacArthur Foundation Fellowships.

Each year around 2000 student entrants submit original research in critically important scientific fields of study and are judged by leading experts in their fields.

The Regeneron Science Talent Search focuses on identifying inspiring and engaging the nation’s most promising young scientists who are creating ideas that could solve society’s most urgent challenges.

In 2017 Regeneron became only the third sponsor of the Science Talent Search increasing the overall awards distribution to better reward the best and brightest young minds. Through its 10-year $100 million commitment which also supports a range of outreach and equity programs Regeneron nearly doubled the overall award distribution to $3.1 million annually increasing the top award to $250000 and doubling the awards for the top 300 scholars and their schools to $2000 each to inspire more young people to engage in science.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9Zb3UtZmVlbC1saWtlLXlvdS12ZS1kb25lLXNvbWV0aGluZy0xNjA1NzMyNi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'You feel like you've done something great:' Greenwich High students dominate state science competition,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/You-feel-like-you-ve-done-something-16057326.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9Zb3UtZmVlbC1saWtlLXlvdS12ZS1kb25lLXNvbWV0aGluZy0xNjA1NzMyNi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Before the most recent round of storms almost the entire state was experiencing extreme drought conditions and more than 80% of the state was at an even higher level — exceptional drought — something we typically only see in slivers of the state every few years.

And there’s not a lot of hope it will change. Spring and summer models from the National Weather Service are forecasting hotter temperatures and drier conditions than normal meaning an elevated risk of extreme fires low levels in rivers and reservoirs and potentially devastating impacts to farmers and ranchers.

As of March 1 reservoirs statewide were half empty (or half full if you’re an optimist) and Lake Powell was at just 40% capacity.

Utah’s leaders are not optimists.

Gov. Spencer Cox earlier this month declared a state of emergency and Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall issued an advisory last Wednesday urging residents to do what they can to conserve.

It is a dire situation — and one we should prepare to confront for years.

This map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Integrated Drought Information System shows that most of Utah is currently facing ""exceptional"" drought conditions the highest category in the agencies' scale.

For more than 20 years almost without exception Utah has experienced abnormally dry conditions. And for most of that time large swaths of the state have endured moderate to severe drought. Scientists refer to it as the “millennium drought” — pinning the start to about the year 2000 — and researchers at Utah State University wrote recently that thanks to climate change temperatures will continue to rise and drought and wildfire will become more common.

“To some extent I think this is a wake-up call to state government” Jack Schmidt director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University told me last week.

“The present condition right now is not unique. It’s not a surprise. It’s been the norm since 2000” he said. “Scientists and the majority of water managers in the West take it deadly seriously. Everyone projects into the future and says ‘This may be the way it will be or it may be worse than this.’ But we should not view this as a one-off situation.”

If scientists and western water officials are taking it seriously though Utah residents aren’t getting the message.

Utah is the second-driest state behind only Nevada yet residents use more water per capita than any other state but Idaho according to the most recent data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

According to the USGS data Utah residents use about 10% more water per capita than those in Nevada 18% more than Arizona and 33% more than Colorado.

“We’re among the biggest water-wasters” said Zach Frankel director of the Utah Rivers Council.

With one of the fastest-growing populations in the country you can see how that’s not tenable. (Utah officials caution against comparing data between states because Utah figures include more water uses than other states.)

How did we get here? The answer is decades of careless water policy that actually encourages extravagant use over careful conservation.

Consider this: Residents in most Utah cities pay less per gallon for their water than those in surrounding states. And unlike many places Utah’s rates don’t increase much if a user is using a lot of water or a little. That price signal sends a message that water is of little value and provides no incentive to be smart about how much water we use.

Almost all of the state’s secondary water untreated water used for irrigation is not metered at all so there’s no way to know how much is used and how much users should be paying. Most pay a flat rate.

On top of that water is heavily subsidized by property taxes paid to the various water districts. In some cases half to as much as 80% of the cost of operating a water district has traditionally been paid for out of property taxes.

The problem with that is again if you’re paying the same regardless of how much water you use there’s no incentive to use less.

On top of that the data we’re basing our decision-making on has been tenuous. In 2015 for example state officials mistakenly provided legislative auditors with the water usage data for Saratoga Springs N.Y. instead of Saratoga Springs Utah.

Now the state has taken baby steps to fix some of these problems. Data gathering has improved. A 2019 law requires some larger water districts to adopt tiered pricing said Rachel Shilton water basin planning manager with the Utah Division of Water Resources.

Another bill requires meters on some new secondary water delivery systems but leaves existing systems unchecked. It was an attempt to “stop the bleeding” the sponsor Sen. Jake Anderegg told me.

It’s a start but it’s not enough.

Utah’s conservation goal — recently revised to 16% statewide over 15 years — is timid compared to goals in surrounding states.

At the same time Utah is pushing to spend a few billion dollars on the Lake Powell Pipeline to stick another straw in a diminishing resource so Kane and Washington counties can have green lawns and golf courses.

The solutions will need to be sweeping and should be at the center of every decision we make. They’ll include more aggressive conservation putting an actual price on water revisiting our agricultural uses (which still consume roughly 80% of our water) expanding metering of secondary water and addressing our aging infrastructure — and a lot more. None of it will be easy.

But with our state adding 2 million people by 2055 and warming temperatures all but assured the nexus between water scarcity and climate change will be the single most critical issue Utah leaders face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZmxhZ3MtdG8tYmUtZmxvd24tYXQtaGFsZi1zdGFmZi10by1ob25vci1zbGFpbi1pb3dhLXByaXNvbi1zdGFmZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flags to be flown at half-staff to honor slain Iowa prison staff,"ANAMOSA Iowa (AP) — Iowa Gov.

Born to a father of Syrian-Jewish descent and a Canadian-Jewish mother Paula Abdul grew up in a practicing Jewish family but perhaps due to her aspirations of professional dancing and singing — and her time as a Lakers Girl — she didn't have time to complete Hebrew school or have a bat mitzvah.

Despite this Abdul is an observant Jew and dreamt for years of visiting Israel. In 2013 at 51 years old she finally made a religious pilgrimage to Israel and even completed her bat mitzvah.

""Beyond being Jewish I've always found myself to be very much in tune with spirituality"" Abdul told The Associated Press. ""I feel very grateful coming to Israel now where as a woman I know who I am a lot more than even 10 years ago.""

Abdul described the visit as ""the most magnificent trip I've ever taken.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5zaW5nc3RhdGVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjcvZWFzdC1sYW5zaW5nLWhvbGRzLW9mZi13YXZlcmx5LWQtMS1ib3lzLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtZGlzdHJpY3QtZmluYWwvNzAzMDkwNzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,East Lansing holds off Waverly in D1 Boys Basketball District Final,"East Lansing holds off Waverly in D1 Boys Basketball District Final

The pandemic has proven to be the biggest challenge and accelerator for smart manufacturing and the digital transformation of industry. Many manufacturers have accelerated their digital transformation journey by deploying new technologies such as AI tools edge data lakes new connectivity standards advanced analytics and robotics. However digital transformation goes beyond tools and technologies it includes people processes and things. Additionally manufacturers from different industries are leveraging the information and data from a wide range of manufacturing processes to structure new business models that improve operational efficiencies and lower costs.

Digital transformation is the transformation of business industrial products operations value chains and services that are enabled through the augmentation of people knowledge and workplaces through the expanded use of digital technologies. It's about the people in the workplaces the processes the technologies and services. Ultimately it’s about bringing value to the organization and solving business problems. Digital transformation is transforming plants into more autonomous plants with very few people required on-site. In some industries there will always be people on-site while in others the factory will be run completely autonomously depending on the industry company process products and a host of other variables; but the future lies in autonomous and optimized plants. Digital transformation includes the ability to use the knowledge and experience gained from subject matter experts (SMEs) – the operators engineers and other workers combined with data scientists and business managers’ expertise regarding the data and business. Digital transformation is also about the people the culture and the processes. It’s about taking newer disruptive technologies and integrating them or even replacing aging systems and business models and older work processes with connected systems connected data connected operations and connected supply chains in a connected enterprise.

Where Are You on the Digital Transformation Journey?

Over the past year ARC Advisory Group did a survey about where manufacturers were on their digital transformation journey regarding deployment of MES/MOM technology. The survey began at the ARC Industry Forum in 2020 and followed up with Automation.com.

The survey revealed that most manufacturers are deploying MES across plants and starting to connect data silos and plants. Survey participants indicated that the plant has some MES functionality some visualization and some integrated data across plants but data silos still remain. ARC also asked about their best production plant and found that most participants said they were proficient (using MES that was connected and interoperable with newer technologies such as analytics MI AI robotics virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) digital twins etc.). Ten percent of the participants indicated that they were “Best in Class” in terms of their production plant and achieved enterprise wide MES capabilities including autonomous and optimized operations. One manufacturer told ARC Advisory Group that as their digital transformation journey had begun before the pandemic it was easy for them to scale up when the pandemic struck. Twenty eight percent indicated that in their worst production plant they were not doing anything. Companies that have not started their digital transformation journey in all or some of their plants are not alone but it’s important to get started on this journey because there are a lot of benefits on the digital transformation journey that increase the company’s profitability and competitiveness.

MES and Cloud Deployments

Because cloud deployments play an important role in digital transformation the survey asked about MES/MOM production deployment by application specifically if the applications were being deployed on-premises in private clouds in public clouds or in both public and private clouds. What we found in terms of some of the more common MES/MOM applications is that companies are starting to move applications to the cloud. The most commonly deployed applications in the cloud were advanced applications performance management/KPIs and visualization. Although cloud deployment is increasing on-premises is still the most prevalent for applications as shown in light blue. Companies are moving such applications to the cloud for which they do not need the information immediately. This corroborates other ARC research where we are seeing a movement of data to the cloud. And we believe that cloud adoption for MES/MOM applications will accelerate due to COVID and the need for the remote connected worker to monitor plant data.

Digital Technologies Being Adopted in Manufacturing

Our survey asked what new technologies are being adopted for the digital transformation and found that the top technologies being adopted include cloud computing robotics artificial intelligence/machine learning/advanced analytics mobile computing digital twins and edge. ARC is seeing a lot of advanced analytics being embedded in some of the newer MES applications and rolled out across enterprises where a few years ago we were seeing pilots for proof-of-concept (POC). Ultimately all the digital transformation revolves around the data and having the right data for the right person at the right time. The data and what you do with it to make sure it is valid contextualized accessible scalable and secure becomes more important than ever. And in most manufacturing plants the speed of the data is important and depending upon the process can vary from less than a millisecond to ten minutes for accessibility. Compounding this is the amount of data that is increasing exponentially. But the key to using the data is making sure it's in a standard format or a structure or model that you can understand and obtain actionable insights.

Recommendations

The digital transformation journey generates a lot of valuable data for industrial operations. Quantifiable improvements are visible in these areas:

Real-time decisions

Quality energy usage unplanned downtime

Productivity and efficiency

Enhancing worker responsiveness and experience

Based on ARC research and analysis we recommend the following actions for owner-operators and other technology users:

Invest in new operational transformative technologies Become smart and connected and invest in new data platforms and architecture for easier connectivity data contextualization accessibility and scalability Ensure that the digital transformation encompasses and aligns with the corporate culture Measure the value of digital transformation align with corporate goals and vision and solve business problems

Throughout March Royal Caribbean has announced a string of ""fully vaccinated"" cruises for this summer. While these vaccine mandates have delighted some eager travelers they've also ignited calls from Twitter and Facebook users to boycott the cruise line.

However these boycott demands have been based on a ""misconception"" according to a Royal Caribbean spokesperson.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

On March 19 Royal Caribbean International uploaded a Facebook post about its new seven-night summer cruises from the Bahamas aboard its Adventure of the Seas ship. These trips set to sail from June to August will be cruising with a vaccine mandate: all crew members and adult guests must be vaccinated against COVID-19 while passengers under 18-years-old must test negative for the virus.

""The vaccines are clearly a game-changer for all of us and with the number of vaccinations and their impact growing rapidly we believe starting with cruises for vaccinated adult guests and crew is the right choice"" Michael Bayley president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International said in the press release announcing the new sailings. ""As we move forward we expect this requirement and other measures will inevitably evolve over time.""

Shortly after the cruising giant announced these new ""fully vaccinated"" sailings on Facebook the comment section was set alight. While some Facebook commenters praised the vaccine mandate others voiced their concerns and announced a personal boycott of the cruise line.

Jennifer Lindquist a former Royal Caribbean customer doesn't agree with any vaccine face masks and social distancing mandates and told Insider ""social distancing ruins the entire cruise experience"" in an interview over Facebook messenger.

""We will not be getting the vaccine anytime soon if ever"" she said. ""I do not agree with a company making it mandatory for their employees to be vaccinated with an experimental vaccine.""

However many of these Facebook comments and tweets have seemingly been based on a glaring mistake: Royal Caribbean never implemented a company-wide COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all of its future guests.

Ironically its Quantum of the Seas ship already resumed sailing in Singapore in December without a vaccine mandate.

""The misconception is that all of the cruises will be vaccinated and that decision has not been made yet"" a Royal Caribbean spokesperson told Insider in an interview. ""If you look at the countries that are doing fully vaccinated cruises it's mandatory by the government. We want to set sail and that's part of the deal to cruise again.""

Royal Caribbean currently has several health protocols in place ahead of its major return to sailing. These include social distancing mask-wearing and robust testing and quarantining guidelines for crew members.

But in regards to vaccines Royal Caribbean – including its Celebrity Cruises brand — has only announced five ""fully vaccinated"" summer cruises so far. While crew members are required to be vaccinated before sailings return the cruise giant has not implemented a sweeping COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all its future guests.

""We're following the science and medical advice and we want to do what's best for our passengers and crew and obviously the communities that we visit as well"" the Royal Caribbean spokesperson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly9jYXltYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMi1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tbGluZXMtcmVzdW1lLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jcnVpc2VzLWp1bmUtMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Royal Caribbean lines to resume Caribbean cruises in June | Loop Cayman Islands,"Two Royal Caribbean cruises will resume in June ending a yearlong hiatus but passengers 18 and older must test negative for COVID-19 before getting on a ship.

The company's Celebrity Cruises subsidiary said Friday that its Celebrity Millennium ship will relaunch on June 5 from St. Maarten. One itinerary will stop in Aruba Curacao and Barbados and another will stop in Tortola St. Lucia and Barbados.

Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo said returning to the Caribbean ""marks the measured beginning of the end of what has been a uniquely challenging time for everyone.""

Royal Caribbean Group's namesake line will start a week later with a voyage leaving from Nassau the Bahamas on the Adventure of the Seas.

In both cases passengers 18 and older will be required to test negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of boarding the ship.

With the Caribbean such a popular destination ""It's not entirely surprising to see both Celebrity and Royal Caribbean finding a way to return to the region"" said Colleen McDaniel editor or Cruise Critic a website that reviews cruises. ""But it is massive news for the cruise industry and for the Caribbean itself.""

Royal Caribbean first started up cruises this past December out of Singapore on Quantum of the Seas with new health protocols. Over the past four months over 50000 guests have safely sailed on the cruise ship proving that cruises can safely start back up.

There have been zero outbreaks on Quantum of the Seas and only 10 out of 50000 guests having tested positive for COVID during the cruise. The guests were quickly quarantined and there was no spread on board the ship. In addition to Quantum of the Seas here are four other Royal Caribbean ships that will soon return to service.

Adventure of the Seas will begin sailing weeklong cruises out of Nassau Bahamas on June 12. The cruises will visit Cozumel Grand Bahama Island and spend two days at the cruise line’s private island in the Bahamas CocoCay.

Vision of the Seas will start sailing from Bermuda on June 26. The seven night cruises will include an overnight in Bermuda as well as a stop in for The Perfect Day at CocoCay.

Royal Caribbean’s newest cruise ship Odyssey of the Seas will sail a combination of three to seven night cruises from Haifa Israel this summer.

Jewel of the Seas will homeport in Cyprus starting on July 10 offering cruises to the Greek Isles. Port stops include Athens Santorini Mykonos and Rhode.

All passengers 18 and over on Adventure of the Seas Vision of the Seas Odyssey of the Seas and Jewel of the Seas will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Guests under 18 will be required to show a negative test to board the ship.

After months of successful sailings in Singapore Royal Caribbean will be using the same health protocols that have proven to work for these newly announced cruises this summer.

Royal Caribbean currently has all other cruises canceled through the end of May. However cruises from U.S. ports can not resume until the CDC allows to them to sail. It is not known at this time when cruise lines will receive this approval.

Why is Royal Caribbean moving ships to Nassau Bermuda Cyprus and Israel this summer?

At the end of October the CDC replaced the No Sail Order with a Conditional Sail Order. However Royal Caribbean has repeatedly asked the CDC for instructions and guidelines for returning to service.

Royal Caribbean’s President and CEO Michael Bayley said during a press conference with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday that the CDC just tells them that it’s under review every time they ask for guidance.

Richard Fain CEO of Royal Caribbean Group said that science has moved past the CDC’s Conditional Sail Order that was issued five months ago. With the vaccine rollout and the cruise line’s successful cruises out of Singapore they have proven that cruises can safely operate.

Royal Caribbean MSC Cruises and Genting Cruise Lines are just a few of the cruise lines that have returned to service since last August without any outbreaks thanks to testing social distancing enhanced cleaning proper air filtration and other health protocols.

If the CDC continues to not let cruise ships sail from U.S. ports cruise lines will probably more sailings out of ports in the Caribbean for this summer.",,,

The Duke of Sussex has announced that he has accepted the role of chief impact officer at billion-dollar coaching and mental health company BetterUp.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco–based firm confirmed the news to BAZAAR.com adding that they are excited to have Harry officially on the team.

In a blog post Harry shared why he joined the business which has a network of more than 2000 coaches across the United States working with companies and organizations such as Hilton Worldwide Chevron NASA and Salesforce Ventures.

“My goal is to lift up critical dialogues around mental health build supportive and compassionate communities and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations. And my hope is to help people develop their inner strength resilience and confidence” he wrote. “I firmly believe that focusing on and prioritising our mental fitness unlocks potential and opportunity that we never knew we had inside of us. As the Royal Marine Commandos say ‘It’s a state of mind.’ We all have it in us.”

He continued “Being attuned with your mind and having a support structure around you are critical to finding your own version of peak performance.

“What I’ve learned in my own life is the power of transforming pain into purpose.

“During my decade in the military I learned that we don’t just need to build physical resilience but also mental resilience. And in the years since my understanding of what resilience means—and how we can build it—has been shaped by the thousands of people and experts I’ve been fortunate to meet and learn from.”

BetterUp’s mobile-first learning platform connects workers with professionals in coaching counseling and mentorship on a one-to-one basis via phone text or video chat. The duke revealed that he had connected with a BetterUp coach before officially taking on the role.

“I was matched with a truly awesome coach who has given me sound advice and a fresh perspective” he explained. “And because we believe in strengthening our own mental fitness our entire Archewell team also has access to BetterUp coaching.”

In his new role which he has already began work on Harry will drive advocacy and awareness for mental health guide BetterUp’s social mission and impact work on product strategies and help expand their global community of coaches and members. When travel is safe the duke will occasionally travel to the company’s San Francisco headquarters.

CEO Alexi Robichaux who was introduced to Harry last year via a mutual friend wrote in a statement “We are energized by his model of inspiration and impact through action. As a true citizen of the world he has dedicated his life’s work to bringing attention to the diverse needs of people everywhere and advocating for mental health initiatives: from founding the Invictus Games a platform for service personnel to use sport as part of their psychological and physical rehabilitation to launching Sentebale which supports the mental health and wellbeing of young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.”

The Wall Street Journal reported that though the duke won’t be managing employees or have direct reports he will participate in “all-hands meetings” and will be expected to appear at special company events. Last month BetterUp raised $125 million in a round of financing that pushed the value of the company which was founded in 2013 to just more than $1.73 billion.

It paid $24 million for E405 Euclid Shops a showroom retail complex just north of the San Diego (405) Freeway on 4.9 acres.



Now in its 22nd year Buchanan Street Partners has been on a leasing and buying spree as of late kicking off at the start of last year with its purchase of a two-building office property along Bristol Street in Newport Beach for $11.5 million.



That deal was the first local buy for Buchanan in the past six years.

Local Familiarity



A Southern California private f amily trust sold the property at 18225 to 18349 Euclid St. for about $262 per square foot; the complex includes tenants Sherwin-Williams Guitar Center Cort Furniture among others.



SRS National Net Lease Group’s Matthew Mousavi Patrick Luther and Rich Walter represented Buchanan Street as well as the seller also the original developer of the center.



“E405 was a significant multi-tenant retail center sale and is one of the few transactions of its type in Orange County since the onset of the pandemic” said Mousavi adding Buchanan “has a strategic business plan for the asset that will add value over the coming months and years.”



The retail center is about half a mile up the freeway from Costa Mesa’s SOCO and OC Mix shopping center. Buchanan Street was an investor in that property when it was initially built and operated under a different name the South Coast Home Furnishings Centre. Along with local partner Birtcher Development & Investments LLC it sold that development for about $100 million in 2007.

Efforts to woo back customers with amusement park features like mini-golf laser tag and Ferris wheels have been disrupted by pandemic-driven restrictions. These entertainment extravaganzas cost some malls billions of dollars and as bills are coming due malls are sitting in dire straits. It is now estimated that 25% – or roughly 1000 U.S. malls – will close by 2025 according to Coresight Research.

“Malls across the country are suffering as many had pivoted to amusement park-like entertainment centers with rides and attractions before Covid” FOX Business’s Lydia Hu told ""Your World with Neil Cavuto.""

CHINA WIPES H&M FROM INTERNET FOLLOWING WESTERN SANCTIONS OVER XINJIANG ABUSES

Two of the country’s more immense and impressive shopping centers – the Mall of America in Minnesota and American Dream in New Jersey – are banking on vaccines and more lax restrictions to compensate for their expenditure woes.

American Dream the mega-mall once deemed as the ""future of retail"" with attractions ranging from waterslides to indoor ski slopes to cinemas and multiple theme parks is now putting up nearly half of its ownership for sale in order to stay afloat.

TARGET DOWNSIZING MINNEAPOLIS OFFICE SPACE AMID SHIFT TO HYBRID WORK ENVIRONMENT

The owner of both operations Triple Five Group has accumulated debt at around $2.7 billion in loans and even defaulted on a loan for the New Jersey project. Just five months after the grand opening the coronavirus outbreak in March created a zero-revenue event without any insurance to protect the losses. As a result of the default lenders JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are taking a 49% stake in both the Mall of America the country’s largest shopping mall as well as the West Edmonton Mall in Canada.

Similarly Pyramid Management Group owner of Destiny USA in Syracuse N.Y. and Palisades Center in the New York City suburbs took on a large amount of debt to build grand spectacles and now have a cash flow crisis. In April the privately-held company became delinquent on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and later negotiated extensions and deferrals according to data provided by Trepp LLC a firm that provides real estate insights.

MALL GROUP SIMON PROPERTY DESPITE PANDEMIC RETAIL HIT SEES UPTICK IN RENT COLLECTION

Despite the financial struggles an ease of restrictions is offering a glimmer of hope for the West Nyack New York located Palisades Center as the state is now allowing indoor entertainment centers to reopen at 25% capacity.

Even though the mall has been open since July attractions like the Ferris wheel have been closed for over a year. Foot traffic has been down 20 to 25% according to Pyramid Management Group CEO Stephen Congel but optimism is up.

“It’s been difficult to navigate the closures and the occupancy reduction because the entertainment and recreation venues and the food and venues are big traffic drivers for our properties” Congel told FOX Business. “But we are encouraged because even with those venues being closed and limited with capacity we’re still seeing traffic at 75 to 80 percent of the numbers pre-Covid.”

With numbers trickling in from pent-up demand for the in-person shopping and entertainment experience malls could just make a comeback.

“The return of entertainment venues like the Ferris wheel here at Palisades [Center] is giving renewed hope to industry insiders” Hu said. “They’re hoping it’s going to bring back the foot traffic and the people in the malls to do their shopping.”

A year into working from my bedroom I thought I had reached an emotional equilibrium in which I could tolerate the multiple child interruptions throughout my day. But last week my older daughter was assigned a scavenger hunt in remote school.

She barged through my door – which I am sorry to report has no lock – four times in one hour looking for slippers something red (twice) and a hairbrush. On the fourth interruption I snapped. “You’ve got to get out of here” I said in a voice much harsher than I like to use with my children.

My daughter was upset and I felt bad that I yelled but I was also conflicted. Every time she came in I had politely asked her to look elsewhere in the apartment because I had a deadline to meet. She’s a third-grader which is old enough to understand and honour that request and I want to raise her to be empathetic to other people’s needs.

How do I walk that line between showing my children that I have feelings that aren’t always positive but not letting my irritation erupt uncontrolled?

Dr Pooja Lakshmin a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at George Washington University School of Medicine in the US says the first thing to know is that “all parents snap at their children” and doing so from time to time doesn’t make you a good parent or a bad one. It’s just a fact of life and she makes clear that she’s not talking about emotional abuse or physical violence which are never acceptable. Emotional abuse may include ridiculing a child constant criticism or withholding affection or comfort.

But raising your voice or losing your cool from time to time? That’s inevitable because we are human.

Jennie Hudson a professor of clinical psychology at the University of New South Wales in Australia says: “There is this kind of expectation that children should be protected from feeling any negative emotion but that’s toxic positivity. It’s not normal. It’s not OK. We have a range of emotions that include feeling frustrated anxious and worried.”

It’s also worth noting that the pandemic is exacerbating a lot of stress on parents both financial and emotional and even as things improve regarding the coronavirus many of us are under additional strain.

The most important thing is what happens after you snap at your children said all four of the experts I asked. Here’s their advice for coming back from saying things you regret how to empathise with your children and how to cut down on snapping when possible.

Acknowledge your mistake. After you’ve calmed down apologise to your child and talk to them in an age-appropriate way about your feelings Hudson says. You don’t have to go into the details of why you reacted the way you did but you can say something like: “I’m sorry I yelled. I got frustrated but it’s not your fault I lost my cool. Here’s how I could have handled it better.” Then you can talk about ways to calm down that you could have used like going for a walk taking a deep breath or walking away from the discussion. “It’s a learning opportunity for a child” Hudson says.

Give yourself a time-out. They aren’t just for kids; they’re for grown-ups too says Dr Alexandra Sacks a reproductive psychiatrist in New York: “If you’re so overwhelmed that you can’t think about what is developmentally appropriate.”

While it’s not always possible – especially if your child is so young they can’t be left alone and you’re the only parent in the situation – try to give yourself time to call a friend or scream into a pillow if you’re feeling emotionally overwhelmed.

She says: “When parents have too-high bars for perfection and flawlessness they feel they can’t walk out of the room or give the kid five more minutes of screen time” even if it would help the parent calm down. Don’t fall into this martyr trap.

When parents have too-high bars for perfection and flawlessness they feel they can’t walk out of the room or give the kid five more minutes of screen time

Remember children struggle to control impulses. Even though my daughter is eight she’s still got a developing brain and knowing that I’m on the other side of the closed door is just too enticing for her. Dr Sacks suggests putting a sign on the door when I really don’t want my children to come in that might remind them to stop and help them resist opening it.

Dr Alexa Mieses Malchuk a family doctor and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine says a timer could also help my daughter. If she’s finding it irresistible to interrupt I can set a timer for 30 minutes that can help her delay entering my room at which point the urge might pass.

If your snapping is frequent try to get help. With the caveat that there are so many situations in which this is not possible if you find yourself irritable all the time and lashing out frequently and these emotions are a marked change for you you “need support or relief” Sacks says. That could mean arranging extra child care or seeing a therapist.

On the evening of the scavenger hunt when I talked to my daughter after dinner about losing my temper she was understanding especially because I put it in terms with which she could empathise. I said: “It’s like how you feel when your little sister interrupts you during your school day” an event that happens a few times a week and causes my older daughter to absolutely uncork on her sibling.

I apologised and I think we both felt better afterwards. But I’m still planning to invest in a lock for my bedroom door.

The Lizzie McGuire actress 33 wrote from the perspective of her middle child while sharing a bathtub snap of her girl which was captioned: 'I'm a big sister....... marinating on how I feel about that!'

Duff is already mom to son Luca nine from her first marriage to Mike Comrie while Banks and baby number three are husband Matthew Koma's.

Famous friends and fans were quick to flock to the comments with congratulations.

The couple confirmed the happy pregnancy news with a sweet boomerang on Instagram last year writing: 'We are growing!!!' Mostly me ...'

Hilary chose not to learn the baby's sex ahead of birth. Earlier this month she admitted she was a 'little scared to have another girl' during an appearance on Dr. Elliot Berlin's Informed Pregnancy Podcast.

'I know the blue hair seems like we do know but we really don't' she mused after many thought her new bright blue tresses were part of a gender-reveal stunt.

She continued: 'I'm actually a little scared to have another girl because Banks was a tough — she was a tough cookie as a baby but she's so great now so I could see it.'

'But then I don't know in my mind I'm like ""Maybe she's my only little princess and she's going to have her rough-and-tumble brothers""' she said of her toddler with Koma.

Hilary and Matthew celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary in December after marrying in an intimate backyard ceremony in 2019.

The couple welcomed baby Banks Violet Bair via an intimate home water birth in October 2018 while Hilary shares co-parenting responsibilities of Luca with former professional hockey player Mike.

In a conversation with PureWow from January 2020 Hilary admitted that she initially was overcome with a feeling of 'guilt' after getting pregnant with Banks.

'The guilt that I felt for bringing her into the world was so big' as Luca had been an only child and the main beneficiary of her attention for six years at the time.

'It was just he and I for so long that he was like ‘Why? Why Mom? Why would you do this? I really just love the way it is' she remembered. 'And it wasn’t bratty it was just so sad.'

But everything was better once Banks finally arrived.

Mom: The actress 33 is already mom to daughter Banks two with Koma as well as son Luca eight who she shares with ex-husband Mike Comrie.

'He came in after I had her. I was just holding her and the look on his face was an absolute shock. He just said ""That’s my sister!"" And he had to sneeze so he ran out of the room and was like ""I'll be right back."" He let out this huge sneeze in the hallway and said ""I had to sneeze and I knew I couldn’t do it in here near her""' she recounted.

Hilary's whirlwind romance with Matthew began on a professional note during the recording of her 2015 album Breathe In. Breathe Out.

Matthew who's a singer–songwriter and producer co-wrote and produced multiple songs on her album.

It wasn't until January of 2017 that the two began a relationship and they announced in June 2018 that they were expecting their first child together before welcoming Banks in October.

They announced their engagement in May 2019 ahead of their December wedding.

In June 2019 the Younger star recounted the story of their engagement evening to The Talk and said she originally wanted to eat dinner in bed and watch Game Of Thrones but Matthew insisted they go for a walk near the home in Williamsburg Brooklyn.

Chloe Ferry accused of Photoshopping her pictures yet again as fans notice weird detail

Chloe Ferry has come under fire from fans after they noticed an odd detail in one of her latest Instagram posts.

The Geordie Shore bombshell 25 can be seen showcasing her surgically-enhanced frame in a chocolate coloured unitard in the post she uploaded on Sunday.

Allowing her peachy bottom to take centre stage in the form-fitting ensemble Chloe poses with her back to the camera as she turns her face towards the lens for the two cheeky snaps.

She penned alongside the offering: ""A man that can hold the door for you and smack your (peach emoji) after wearing @getitonme.""

But shortly after she posted the snap to her grid for her 3.6 million followers to see the comments were hit with messages from eagle-eyed fans who suspected that Chloe edited the image on Photoshop before pressing the upload button.

Social media users took aim at the reality TV personality by saying that the small box at the back of the snap was ""warped"" - which led to them accusing the star of tweaking the snap.

One penned: ""Shame it's another photoshop.. Seeing as the white box is bowed.""

A second follower penned: ""Photoshopped to death.""

Another urged Chloe to stop editing her snaps as they typed to another fan who defended Chloe's snap by writing: ""She photoshops her images which makes young girls feel that they aren't enough.. Young girls look up to people like chloe but to know that she photoshops herself makes people think they aren't good enough.. Body imagine is hard thing for many young girls always being made to feel they aren't enough and they don't look like how they should..""

Several of Chloe's fans showered praise on the curvy beauty below the post.

A loyal supporter typed: ""Yasss QUEEN you look so bloody amazing in that.""

""Unbelievable hunnyy"" and ""hot"" added others.

Earlier this week Chloe was accused of using technology to cleverly enhance her shape in photos that showed her posing in her garden.

The majority of Chloe's followers rushed to the comments section to compliment her but others had spotted what they believed was an awkward Photoshop fail.

In the photos Chloe is standing with both hands on her hips showing off her toned stomach and hourglass curves in a tiny crop top.

But some fans couldn't help but get distracted as they claimed her thumb looked distorted when they zoomed into the image.

Her thumb also appeared to blend into her hip which further puzzled her followers.

""Photoshopped as per"" one person wrote.

Another penned: ""The photo shop near the thumb"" alongside a laughing emoji.

And a third claimed: ""The only real thing are the jeans.""

Earlier this month Chloe was called out for manipulating a different image with fans claiming they could see a 'wonky' floor.

It was produced in partnership with Georgia Health News which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Mark Berry raised his right hand pledging to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The bespectacled mechanical engineer took his seat inside the cherry-wood witness stand. He pulled his microphone close to his yellow bow tie and glanced left toward five of Georgia’s most influential elected officials. As one of Georgia Power’s top environmental lobbyists Berry had a clear mission on that rainy day in April 2019: Convince those five energy regulators that the company’s customers should foot the bill for one of the most expensive toxic waste cleanup efforts in state history.

When Berry became Georgia Power’s vice president of environmental affairs in 2015 he inherited responsibility for a dark corporate legacy dating back to before he was born. For many decades power companies had burnt billions of tons of coal dumping the leftover ash — loaded with toxic contaminants — into human-made “ponds” larger than many lakes. But after a pair of coal-ash pond disasters in Tennessee and North Carolina exposed the environmental and health risks of those largely unregulated dumps the Obama administration required power companies to stop using the aging disposal sites.

Berry had spent nearly two decades climbing the ranks of Southern Company America’s second-largest energy provider and the owner of Georgia Power. By the time he was under oath that day company execs had vowed to store newly burnt coal ash in landfills designed for safely disposing of such waste. But an unprecedented challenge remained: Figuring out what to do with 90 million tons of coal ash — enough to fill more than 50 Major League Baseball stadiums to the brim — that had accumulated over the better part of a century in ash ponds that were now leaking.

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

Georgia Power would have to shut down roughly 30 ponds from the Appalachian foothills to the wetlands near the Georgia coast. After draining all the ponds the company would have two options for disposing of the highly contaminated dry ash left behind: It could either move the ash into a landfill fitted with a protective liner or pack the dry ash into a smaller footprint and place a cover on top — leaving a gaping hole in the ground that in some places would be larger than Disneyland. The former would cost more but vastly reduce the possibility of toxic leakage; the latter lowered expenses but would perpetually risk contaminating drinking water in neighboring communities.

As scientists had grown more aware of the threat posed by coal ash Southern states like Virginia and North Carolina had forced utilities to move ash into lined landfills. But Georgia was something of an outlier. The state historically was known as a coal ash capital a place where lawmakers touted their pro-business bona fides by denouncing regulations and Georgia Power had a track record of delaying or blocking efforts to regulate pollution. The company was lobbying hard for the cheaper option.

Of course the $7.3 billion price tag wasn’t all that cheap. Sitting on the Georgia Public Service Commission’s witness stand Berry and his top deputy spent hours arguing that the whopping costs of cleaning up Georgia Power’s coal-ash ponds should be passed along to its customers. If Berry could persuade the regulators that the costs were both “reasonable” and “prudent” the company could tack a monthly fee onto the bills of 2.2 million residential customers for decades to come which would work out to each customer footing $3300 of the bill to clean up the company’s mess. If he failed the commissioners could effectively force Georgia Power to eat those costs — a major blow to investors in a publicly traded company that has annual operating revenues of over $8 billion.

During Berry’s testimony PSC commissioner Tim Echols said he has concerns about putting ratepayers on the hook for the costs of cleaning up the ash ponds — and whether Georgia Power is spending more than it has to. “This is enormously expensive” he said.

Berry didn’t mention that the cleanup costs could increase by billions of dollars if Georgia’s environmental officials adopted the safer standards used by neighboring states. Anticipating Echols’ next question Berry said that Georgia Power’s $7.3 billion plan was the “most cost-effective way” to comply with coal-ash regulations.

“If we were to do something less” Berry added state environmental officials “would force us to go back and redo what we did not do right the first time.”

Had those five energy regulators swiveling in their chairs asked more pointed questions about Georgia Power’s waste-disposal practices Berry would have been pressured to tell a long-hidden story about ash and avarice. In the second half of the 20th century Georgia Power had saved money by building some of America’s largest coal-ash ponds without a protective liner underneath despite knowing some of the risks of contaminating residents’ drinking water. It had also sought to do as little as possible to protect drinking water that’s now believed to be tainted by coal-ash toxins.

A yearlong investigation by Georgia Health News and ProPublica has revealed that Georgia Power and its parent company have spent millions of dollars on lobbying tactics to dodge billions in environmental costs. Thousands of pages of previously unpublished documents obtained by the news organizations shed new light on how Georgia Power leveraged political tensions to reduce a massive financial liability that could decimate its bottom line — and how it pushed disinformation to distance itself from patterns of sickness among people who lived near its coal-ash ponds.

Georgia Power spokesperson John Kraft declined to answer most of the news organizations’ questions and to make Berry available for an interview. Kraft said in a statement that Georgia Power has worked to “quickly and safely begin closing all of our ash ponds” in a manner that complies with federal and state coal-ash regulations.

But at the hearing in April 2019 none of the energy regulators pressed Berry on the topic of coal-ash contamination. Because they didn’t ask Berry remained mum. His silence would make it easier for the regulators to stomach the idea of passing the cost of the cleanup on to customers — and easier for Georgia Power to avoid responsibility for the much more expensive fix. And it allowed Georgia Power to continue its longstanding efforts to cover up the hazards of coal ash across the state most notably in a tiny town where the company operates the largest coal-fired plant in the Western Hemisphere.

In the spring of 1974 as Atlanta Braves slugger Hank Aaron shattered Babe Ruth’s home run record and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson first forged a friendship with Governor Jimmy Carter ahead of his presidential campaign a towering attorney named Tommy Malone set his sights on a white two-story house in the sleepy central Georgia town of Juliette.

Malone would years later become one of the state’s most successful medical malpractice attorneys. At the time though he ran a firm that had hit a financial rough patch. To cover payroll he’d landed a gig representing Georgia Power which sought to buy thousands of acres for a new coal-fired power plant. Georgia law allowed the utility to condemn nearly any property it wanted. But the actual use of eminent domain spurred negative headlines and local resentment — both of which could undermine Georgia Power’s carefully cultivated corporate reputation. So Georgia Power dispatched Malone to convince residents of Juliette to sell their land. He’d been scouting properties along Luther Smith Road a winding two-lane street hugged by Georgia pines. The white house belonged to a retired cowboy named Brack Goolsby. Malone hoped Goolsby might willingly sell more than 300 acres.

The Goolsby family home had stood long before Brack rode his first horse before his hometown was established in the 1880s and even before General William Tecumseh Sherman’s troops passed through it on the infamous March to the Sea. Brack’s family had such deep roots in Juliette that the road he lived on was named for his Uncle Luther.

When Luther Smith died in the early 1950s he left the family home to his nephew. Brack and his wife Betty raised two sons Mark and Bob who grew up exploring the family’s untamed forests. Two decades later when Georgia Power announced its plans to build a 12000-acre plant site abutting Luther Smith Road some neighbors balked. They fought the company’s use of eminent domain. One farmer’s wife mailed a desperate letter to Carter writing that their land tended by them through good times and bad is “not for sale at any price. … We hold precious its beauty the quiet and peace.”

A small-town peanut farmer who frequently rafted down Georgia rivers Carter raised concerns to his aides about the plant’s environmental impact. The aides peppered Georgia Power Executive Vice President Harold McKenzie with questions about how much energy — and pollution — the plant would generate. When the conversation turned to a waste-disposal site nearly the size of Central Park one Carter aide asked McKenzie: What do you do when the ash pond fills up?

Clean it up McKenzie promised according to the Carter administration’s notes from that meeting.

Carter’s hands were ultimately tied: Georgia lawmakers had previously granted the utility immense power for an investor-owned company. (A spokesperson for President Carter did not respond to an interview request.) Not only could Georgia Power use eminent domain to condemn property without public hearings it had the authority to build new plants nearly wherever it wanted. Georgia Power quickly acquired the land for its new coal-fired plant site. The company would eventually name the plant after McKenzie’s boss CEO Bob Scherer who guided Georgia Power through a tumultuous period marked by the oil embargo of the 1970s.

In the midst of Georgia Power’s land-buying spree Brack Goolsby took Malone’s offer and sold 312 acres of land for $207524. Goolsby kept roughly 30 acres and his house which was on the other side of Luther Smith Road from the Plant Scherer site. Goolsby was relieved that the home would remain there for his kids and grandkids. For several years whenever he turned right out of his driveway Brack watched as the company felled trees and dug deep into the red Georgia clay to build a pit for all the ash left over from burning mountains of coal.

In late 1976 two years after Georgia Power bought the Goolsbys’ land Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act granting the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the disposal of waste including everything from household garbage to some radioactive materials. The EPA considered whether coal ash should be classified as a hazardous waste. The designation would have required electric utilities to install a protective liner under every existing or proposed ash pond to prevent contaminants from seeping into underground aquifers.

Roughly four out of five Americans get their household water from their city or county. That water is typically sourced from lakes and rivers tested for toxins treated and piped directly to homes. But 43 million people largely in rural areas rely on a private drinking well that pumps up groundwater from an underground aquifer.

By the time the act was passed scientists knew coal ash contained trace metals such as arsenic chromium lead and other chemicals recognizable from the periodic table all of which could slowly infiltrate groundwater. In 1979 Tennessee ecologist Robert Van Hook wrote in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health Perspectives that the trace metals in coal ash “may constitute human health problems” including increased risk of cancer. With utilities burning record levels of coal each year and thus producing more ash Van Hook called for an evaluation of the “potential for contamination of drinking water supplies by trace elements in leachates from settling ponds.”

Most ash ponds at that time had not been built with protective liners and America’s power company execs feared that retrofitting them would collectively cost more than $20 billion — $72 billion in today’s dollars. Coal ash’s designation as “hazardous” would not only impact Georgia Power but also Alabama Power Gulf Power and other utilities in the Southern Company system. Southern Company soon found an ally in Congressman Tom Bevill then a seven-term Alabama Democrat whose father had mined coal on the northwest outskirts of Birmingham where coal had burned at one of the system’s oldest plants since World War I.

During a speech in 1980 as lawmakers debated a bill to strengthen the EPA’s ability to enforce waste regulations Bevill told his colleagues he knew of no evidence that coal ash “has ever presented a substantial hazard to human health or the environment.” He proposed to exempt coal ash from hazardous waste regulations until the EPA conducted more studies. His amendment passed with minimal attention.

The Bevill Amendment ushered in an era during which Georgia Power and other utilities could keep dumping coal ash into unlined ponds — despite emerging evidence of contamination. That same year an EPA study described how trace metals in coal-ash ponds could seep deep enough into the ground to come into contact with groundwater. Recognizing the threat some utilities changed their coal-ash practices absent any federal mandates including the Northern Indiana Public Service Company which installed a $2.3 million liner under an ash pond that was leaking wastewater. And while some states like Maryland and Louisiana created tougher regulations for coal-ash disposal other states such as Georgia and Ohio did not.

By the early 1980s Southern Company execs knew that storing coal ash in ponds without a protective liner could contaminate groundwater. Internal corporate filings obtained by Georgia Health News and ProPublica from multiple state archives show that an in-house research and development company called Southern Company Services Inc. was established to design plant sites for utilities in the Southern Company system. In the 1970s Florida environmental regulators denied an SCSI-designed ash pond proposal for Plant Crist in Pensacola which was owned by Southern Company’s Gulf Power because the plans lacked a “suitable liner … constructed to prevent leaching” according to the records. In response from 1977 to 1982 SCSI developed a $20 million waste-disposal system to hold dry coal ash with a liner underneath.

Simultaneously SCSI designed Plant Scherer in Juliette where it could have included a liner like it did at Plant Crist. However Georgia Power claimed in filings that a protective liner at Plant Scherer was “not economically feasible.” Indeed the installation of a liner at Plant Scherer’s ash pond could have cost as much as $95 million according to industry estimates from the time.

When Georgia Power fired up Plant Scherer’s first unit in late 1982 water and ash flowed into a giant hole buttressed by an earthen berm that stood 100 feet tall. Engineers had designed the pond to be large enough to accept waste into the next century. With each week that passed tiny contaminants in the ash pond seeped through soil under the pond and into an underground aquifer according to company filings. And as weeks turned to years water in the aquifer slowly carried those contaminants closer to Luther Smith Road.

Water is part of Andrea Goolsby’s earliest memories of her grandparents’ home. She watered her father’s tomatoes sipped from her grandfather’s garden hose and ate fresh strawberries washed by her grandmother. The idea that Brack and Betty Goolsby’s water might be contaminated by the nearby power plant never figured into family conversations back then. It hadn’t crossed the minds of Andrea’s grandparents parents or sisters nor those of her aunts uncles or cousins who also lived near Plant Scherer.

“I’d see the ash pond” Andrea later recalled. “It just looked like a big lake.”

Bevill had indicated back in 1980 that two years of EPA research would definitively rule out the possibility that coal ash could be harmful to human health. But the agency didn’t issue a report for another eight years informing Congress in 1988 that while coal ash had caused some cases of groundwater contamination the agency had insufficient evidence to reclassify coal ash as a hazardous waste. That same year investigators with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division collected groundwater samples from several older Georgia Power plant sites that revealed evidence of contamination. Groundwater at Plant McManus in Brunswick contained chromium at levels 16 times higher than Georgia deemed safe for drinking. And at Plant Mitchell in Albany groundwater contained levels of lead that exceeded federal drinking water standards. The investigators who estimated that thousands of residents near the plants relied on private wells for drinking water recommended further examination of groundwater contamination. (Current EPD spokesperson Kevin Chambers said the division has no records indicating that officials followed up with subsequent investigations; Georgia Power declined to elaborate on the findings of the reports.)

Georgians who lived near coal-ash ponds including ones at newer plant sites like Scherer told GHN and ProPublica they were never informed by the EPD or Georgia Power that their drinking water might be contaminated. As a child Andrea had played at Plant Scherer cookouts held for hundreds of employees including her father and uncle. As a teenager she benefited from Georgia Power’s tax dollars that helped fund one of the state’s best public school systems. Many of Andrea’s neighbors believed that Georgia Power had revived Juliette a place that after serving as the backdrop for the 1991 Kathy Bates film “Fried Green Tomatoes” became a quaint symbol of small-town America.

Andrea loved her small town. Juliette felt safe a place untouched by tragedy. She had experienced little in the way of loss until one windy Thursday in November 2002. Andrea then a 15-year-old high school student watched her grandfather writhe in pain on the living room couch. Earlier that week Brack had been diagnosed with late-stage cancer in his bile duct a tube that connects the liver to the small intestine. She hugged him tight worried it might be the last time. Indeed it was. Brack died the next day.

Three days later Andrea stayed home from school to say goodbye to her grandfather who was buried at the Juliette United Methodist Church cemetery two miles north of Plant Scherer’s front gates. His death would be first in a string of nine cancers among her extended family members who lived near the plant. At first no one suspected that the sicknesses that came next — a great aunt diagnosed with breast cancer two distant relatives who died from leukemia — were anything but coincidental.

But then Andrea’s family noticed changes around the family’s land: Their plants and animals were dying more often than usual. The Goolsby family began to wonder why after years of good health a wave of sickness and death had descended on Luther Smith Road.

In December 2008 four months after Andrea’s second relative died of leukemia more than a billion gallons of coal ash slurry broke through a dike at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston Fossil Plant. A wave of dark gray sludge spread over 300 acres as deep as 6 feet downing power lines pushing a home off its foundation and filling a nearby river with toxins. As the hidden dangers of coal ash flooded into plain sight and workers began cleaning up the waste environmentalists swiftly called for stricter regulations including a liner mandate to prevent toxins from seeping out of unlined ash ponds.

Until the Kingston spill devastated the 6300-person town of Harriman located 250 miles north of Juliette air pollution from coal-fired power plants had long overshadowed the peril of groundwater contamination caused by coal ash. Around the turn of the millennium U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno had filed an epic lawsuit against Southern Company and other utility giants for allegedly violating the Clean Air Act. Plant Scherer was one of more than two dozen coal-fired plants that according to the EPA had “illegally released massive amounts of air pollutants.” (Southern Company wrote in an annual report that “the action against Georgia Power has been administratively closed.”) As Reno’s lawsuit grabbed headlines Southern Company quietly partnered with its allies to quash a stricter coal-ash regulation.

In the late 1990s nearly two decades after the Bevill amendment exempted coal ash from being classified as a hazardous waste (and after Bevill promised that a definitive analysis of coal ash’s danger would be available in two years) the EPA finally wrapped up its coal-ash studies which determined that coal ash posed “significant risks to human health and the environment when not properly managed.” The agency cited 11 cases where coal ash contaminants were found in ground or surface water at levels that exceeded health standards as well as dozens of other newly reported cases of water contamination. Communities from Faulkner Maryland to Velva North Dakota were grappling with the consequences of coal ash. Regulators forced utilities in Wisconsin and Virginia to pay to hook homes up to a public water supply after contaminating their private drinking wells. Beyond these cases the EPA determined that utilities had installed well networks to monitor groundwater quality at only 38 percent of the nation’s ash ponds and installed protective liners at just 26 percent of them. Given those low percentages and the limited oversight by states EPA officials recommended tougher coal ash regulations — ones that stopped short of reclassifying coal ash as a hazardous waste.

Medical experts say that over a dozen trace metals in coal ash can lead to health ailments ranging from mild (nausea) to serious (organ damage). The type and extent of health problems can vary greatly depending on the amount of contaminants entering the body the duration of the consumption and even where the coal was originally mined. Of those dozen toxins several — including arsenic and hexavalent chromium — are considered to be carcinogenic if consumed even in small amounts over a long period of time. The list of cancers linked to coal ash contaminants include ones in the liver and lungs prostate and bladder and stomach and skin.

In 2000 as the EPA proposed tougher coal-ash regulations Southern Company fought those efforts. Georgia Power Alabama Power and Gulf Power were all dues-paying members of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group an industry association of over 100 utilities. Led by a lobbyist named Jim Roewer USWAG had previously recruited power company employees to testify against the hazardous waste designation and attack environmental studies that were being considered by the EPA. (Roewer did not respond to multiple interview requests.) On behalf of Southern Company and other utilities USWAG lobbyists aggressively pressured the Clinton administration to stop the EPA proposal citing the billions of dollars it would take to clean up toxins from the ash ponds. They argued against the regulation in letters and in-person meetings. Ultimately the Clinton administration backed off from the tougher coal ash regulations.

But the risks the EPA tracked remained hidden from the public. During the George W. Bush administration EPA officials had produced internal reports that showed people who lived close to unlined coal-ash ponds were more susceptible to cancer. The EPA report found that nearby residents had as much as a 1 in 50 lifetime risk of developing cancer from drinking water with high levels of arsenic one of the most common coal-ash contaminants. That’s 200 times higher than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s recommended risk level for limiting worker exposure to any carcinogen. When environmental advocates tried to obtain those records officials delayed their release for years; they were made public by the Obama administration only after the Kingston spill.

Georgians rarely heard about problems with Georgia Power’s ash ponds. In 2002 local journalists covered the story of a 4-acre sinkhole at northwest Georgia’s Plant Bowen which released over 2 million gallons of arsenic-laced ash and water into a nearby creek. From 1988 to 2008 GHN and ProPublica found that Georgia Power had disclosed to state regulators dozens of other unpermitted discharges at its coal plants. The vast majority which were logged by state environmental officials were not publicized by those officials or the media.

After chilling images of toxic Tennessee ash circulated in 2008 Obama’s EPA administrator Lisa Jackson vowed that environmental disasters like the one in Kingston “should never happen anywhere.” When EPA officials sought further information from the records of coal-ash pond safety inspections after the Kingston spill Georgia Power initially moved to prevent the release of that information claiming those records contained trade secrets. The EPA rejected that argument. Ultimately the EPA found that over a quarter of the country’s 559 coal-ash ponds were rated “poor” in a safety assessment and required remedial action to correct their flaws. (One of Georgia Power’s ash ponds at Plant Hammond was rated poor; most were deemed “satisfactory.”)

During a 2009 meeting with EPA officials Southern Company CEO David Ratcliffe and other utility execs urged then-EPA Administrator Jackson not to impose liner mandates for coal-ash ponds. Jackson told the utility execs that she “understands all sides of the argument” regarding coal-ash regulations but did not comment specifically on the issue of liners according to an EPA readout. (Jackson who is no longer with the EPA did not respond to a request for comment.) Southern Company’s top environmental affairs executive Chris Hobson followed that 2009 meeting with a letter that claimed its unlined ash ponds were “safe and functioning.”

Five years passed without new regulations. Then in February 2014 a pipe ruptured at a Duke Energy coal-fired plant flooding North Carolina’s Dan River with 39000 tons of ash. The Dan River spill finally pushed the EPA to enact America’s first-ever federal coal-ash regulations in 2015. The rule sought to lower the risk of catastrophic failures protect groundwater and outline best practices for shuttering ash ponds. Under those regulations Georgia Power would be required to publicly disclose the results of groundwater monitoring tests near its ash ponds.

But the industry’s fierce lobbying campaign defanged stronger protections originally proposed by the EPA. Once again utilities escaped the hazardous waste label for coal ash. Georgia Power could still dump the ash into unlined ponds so long as the utility proved that large amounts of contaminants were not leaking beyond a pond’s edges. Environmentalists criticized the rule for squandering a historic opportunity to pass strict regulations including mandated liners.

“The coal-ash rule was a compromise” said Avner Vengosh professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University who is one of the nation’s leading experts on coal ash. “Instead of declaring it as a hazardous waste they were reluctant to do so for political reasons.”

In 2011 nine years after Brack’s death (and three years before the EPA finalized the coal-ash rule) Andrea noticed that her grandmother had stopped drinking water from the kitchen tap. She’d started to worry after word had spread that something might be wrong with the groundwater that supplied her drinking well. Suspicions grew that summer after Georgia Power purchased the 2-acre lot next to the family’s property for $218750 a stunning price considering the average acre in the area sold for four figures. The property belonged to Gloria Dorsett Andrea’s great-aunt the one diagnosed with breast cancer. Georgia Power required that Dorsett sign a nondisparagement agreement razed her home and sealed off the drinking well preventing future testing of its groundwater. (State law requires the utility to seal unused wells within three years to protect against accidents and illegal dumping.)

Andrea couldn’t help but think about all those summer days in her childhood drinking from the garden hose. After switching to bottled water herself she searched for news articles that mentioned groundwater contamination near coal plants. She then turned to scientific studies to better understand the effects of coal ash on human health.

From 2014 to 2018 Monroe County had one of Georgia’s highest rates of cancer incidence at 522 cases per 100000 people which was 12 percent higher than the statewide average and 17 percent higher than the national one. Juliette with 3000 residents accounted for about a tenth of Monroe County’s population. Andrea wondered if Juliette’s cancer rate was even higher than Monroe County’s — it would take just 16 new cancer incidences in an average year for Juliette to exceed the county rate. But no formal cancer-cluster study had been conducted to determine if coal-ash toxins had contributed to their sicknesses.

Dr. Alan Lockwood a neurologist who wrote “The Silent Epidemic: Coal and the Hidden Threat to Health” says that it’s “really difficult” to establish a link between the health outcomes reported by an individual — or even a single family like the Goolsbys who’ve had numerous cancer incidences — and trace metals found in groundwater. To establish that link epidemiologists must study data collected from private wells in an entire community over time and review the medical histories of residents to determine if a place is a cancer hotspot. Because of the costs time and expertise needed Lockwood said “the deck is stacked in favor of the company because of how difficult it is to show a cause-and-effect relationship.”

To prove such a thing in court residents must rely on deep-pocketed lawyers to fund class-action suits. If all the stars align a company will be pressured into a settlement. More often than not big corporations with seemingly endless resources can evade responsibility. Despite the long-shot odds of holding Georgia Power accountable Andrea felt there was no other choice but to seek answers about the water. To her the pursuit was not just a question of sickness or health contaminated or not: It might reveal a greater unsettling truth about the unintended consequences of a tightknit town placing its faith in the hands of a corporation that pledged to do right by its residents.

In 2013 three of Andrea’s relatives were among more than 100 current and former Monroe County residents who sued Georgia Power claiming the utility had knowingly released toxins contained in coal ash into the air and groundwater. The lawsuit contended that contaminants from Plant Scherer caused a “loss of potable water supply and increased risk of diseases.” In court filings Georgia Power denied the claims. But before the case proceeded to discovery one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs abruptly dropped out prompting the suit to be dismissed without prejudice in 2014 — a disposition that allowed for the filing of future claims. In a moment of despair Andrea looked up the email of Erin Brockovich the environmental activist who had uncovered evidence that Pacific Gas and Electric Company had contaminated drinking wells with hexavalent chromium in Hinkley California a tiny town more than 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Hundreds of Hinkley residents alleged that tainted drinking water had caused miscarriages cancers and a scourge of chronic illnesses. After a three-year legal battle PG&E agreed to pay a record-setting $333 million settlement in private arbitration. Andrea pasted into the email a news article about Juliette residents’ fears over contamination followed by a brief urgent message.

“What can we do about this?” Goolsby wrote.

Brockovich promised to look into the matter. But when Goolsby didn’t immediately hear back her family looked for help closer to home. (Brockovich did not respond to a request for comment.) In the summer of 2016 Andrea’s father Mark — who’d left Georgia Power the mid-’90s to become a funeral home director — learned of an environmental nonprofit called the Altamaha Riverkeeper that had called for his former employer to safely close its ash ponds. During a conversation with the organization’s executive director Jen Hilburn Mark Goolsby explained his concerns about potential groundwater contamination along Luther Smith Road. In response Hilburn told a story about nearby Lake Sinclair in Milledgeville. Earlier that year heavy rains had threatened to send water pouring over the top of an ash pond’s berm at Plant Branch which could have caused a major breach. Hilburn received an anonymous tip that the plant had pumped wastewater into the lake avoiding a violation of its permit but polluting that 24-square-mile body of water. She flew a camera drone overhead sent her photos to state officials and publicized the risks. Residents and lawmakers successfully pressured Georgia Power to move the ash out of the plant’s pond and into a lined landfill. (Georgia Power said in a statement that the decision was about “more than compliance” and reflected its commitment to “protecting water quality every step of the way.”)

One afternoon that August Hilburn traveled up Luther Smith Road to the Goolsby family home. Mark showed her the dying trees and the surface water on his property that had a sheen of oil. After walking over to a small roofed structure that housed the well that supplied water to Goolsby’s taps Hilburn pulled on gloves broke the seal of a sterile plastic bottle and filled it with water. She collected several bottles and shipped them to a lab in North Carolina. The lab would determine if the contaminants found in Goolsby’s well were the same ones found in coal ash — and whether they were present at high enough levels to be harmful.

When the results came back a couple weeks later Hilburn called Goolsby to explain that the well water sample confirmed the presence of several heavy metals such as boron considered one of the DNA fingerprints of coal ash and cobalt a trace metal confirmed to be leaking out of Scherer’s ash pond at levels that exceeded federal groundwater-protection standards. She also said that the samples contained worrisome levels of hexavalent chromium: 2.3 parts per billion 33 times higher than what North Carolina public health guidelines deem safe and 115 times higher than what California ones do. (California and North Carolina are the only two states to establish public health guidelines for hexavalent chromium in water.)

Georgia does not regulate hexavalent chromium specifically in water — only the broader category of “chromium” which includes both chromium III a naturally occurring trace metal and hexavalent chromium which can be naturally occurring or produced by industrial processes. But while relatively high levels of chromium III is considered safe in drinking water experts say hexavalent chromium can be dangerous at much lower levels. Some scientists warn that hexavalent chromium not chromium III can lead to a higher risk of cancer. Georgia’s local public health departments offer a $122 well test that can detect a limited number of toxins but not hexavalent chromium. If someone can’t afford to pay more for a private lab to test for that toxin former EPA official Betsy Southerland says they’re “totally unprotected.”

In the fall of 2016 weeks after Mark Goolsby received the test results from his well water Georgia Power purchased a string of properties along Luther Smith Road part of a quiet buying spree in which the company ultimately paid more than $15 million for nearly 1900 acres of land near five of its 12 coal-fired power plant sites according to a previous investigation by Georgia Health News and ProPublica. A year later in 2017 Andrea’s grandmother passed away after a stroke and Andrea noticed the company had erected “no trespassing” signs along Luther Smith Road and knocked down more homes. More than four decades after attorney Tommy Malone pressed Brack Goolsby to sell most of his family’s land Georgia Power returned with another offer — this time for the last of their property and the home that had belonged to the Goolsbys for more than 150 years. The company which still wielded the power of eminent domain said in a statement that its purchases of land near Plant Scherer would reduce the “short- and long-term inconvenience for our neighbors” during the process of shutting down the nearby ash pond.

On a windy day in March 2019 Andrea Goolsby then 31 pulled down a gravel driveway toward the white two-story house on Luther Smith Road. Her father and uncle were just days away from handing it over. The terms of the sale prevented them from speaking publicly about the well tests that found hexavalent chromium in their drinking water. (Citing a nondisparagement agreement Mark Goolsby declined to speak for this story. A spokesman for Georgia Power noted that confidentiality clauses are routinely inserted in its contracts but declined to comment regarding any purchases of individual properties off Luther Smith Road.)

As she walked inside memories flooded back: the taste of her grandmother’s biscuit dough the smell of fresh-tilled dirt in the garden the sound of the blues playing from her daddy’s truck. She had recently helped her father clear out the house sorting through her late grandmother’s old letters church bulletins and photographs. She’d even stripped century-old wood off the walls of a bedroom in hopes of repurposing it someday. Tears fell past her straight blonde hair as she stepped into each room one final time. She felt like her grandparents had died once again.

“I had to say goodbye to a place where my son nieces and nephews won’t be able to experience” Andrea wrote in her journal that day. “I had to say goodbye to a piece of my heart.”

Two weeks after Andrea’s final visit to her family home Mark Berry faced one of his toughest challenges as Georgia Power’s top environmental lobbyist: persuading five fiscally conservative energy regulators to allow his employer to offload more than $7 billion in coal-ash cleanup costs onto its customers.

Georgia Power along with the Public Service Commission has fought GHN and ProPublica’s attempts to obtain information about how much money the company is saving by not adopting the more protective measure of moving all of its coal ash into lined disposal sites. Last year at a town hall meeting in Monroe County PSC commissioner Tim Echols said that at Plant Scherer alone moving millions of tons of ash out of its current pond and into a disposal site with a protective liner would cost $1 billion. (Georgia Power did not dispute Echols’ estimate when asked if it’s accurate.) Industry cost estimates obtained by GHN and ProPublica indicate that Georgia Power could have originally installed a liner at Scherer back in the early 1980s for $95 million or less — $270 million in 2020 dollars far cheaper than the $1 billion it would take to fully fix the problem today.

The Georgia Public Service Commission does not allow the public to see the projected costs of shutting down ash ponds at each of Georgia Power’s plants because the company claims those figures are a “trade secret.” Georgia Public Service Commission

Getting approval for the cheaper plan from the five energy regulators on the state’s Public Service Commission would not be Georgia Power’s final hurdle. Even with the PSC’s rubber stamp state environmental officials could reject the company’s plans to keep dry ash in unlined ponds at Scherer and five other plants. That would mean that Georgia Power’s $7.3 billion price tag could skyrocket to over $10 billion potentially lowering the chances that the company would be able to get its customers to pick up the full bill. (A year after Berry took the stand Georgia Power would disclose in a filing that its ash pond cleanup cost estimates increased by 11 percent to $8.1 billion.) PSC Commissioner Tricia Pridemore said the agency recently hired a consultant to review Georgia Power’s future coal-ash expenses. The other four commissioners declined to comment.

In the spring of 2019 the EPA’s administrator former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler authorized Georgia to become one of America’s only states to take over the process of approving how utilities could clean up their ash ponds. Left to work with the state’s cash-strapped environmental agency (the EPD) Georgia Power pressured regulators to narrowly interpret the coal-ash rule in a way that would increase the chances of leaving its waste in unlined ponds according to records obtained by GHN and ProPublica. Georgia Power did not respond to questions about lobbying tactics. But in his 2019 PSC testimony Berry said Georgia Power is “actively involved in both federal and state rulemaking.” EPD spokesperson Kevin Chambers who did not make any agency officials available for an interview said in a statement that the EPD “does not provide deferential treatment” to Georgia Power.

In a closed-door meeting in early 2020 EPD Land Branch Chief Chuck Mueller met with a small group of Juliette residents including Andrea and several members of the Goolsby family. Mueller explained that if the company could show its contaminants had not migrated beyond its property lines the company would satisfy the state’s environmental requirements according to a recording of the meeting obtained by GHN and ProPublica.

One Juliette resident John Dupree asked Mueller why the EPD hadn’t independently tested nearby Juliette residents’ wells for the presence of contaminants. Dupree recently tested his drinking well finding levels of hexavalent chromium above the health standards set by California and North Carolina. He was concerned that coal ash would move off-site for years to come perpetually jeopardizing his family’s drinking water.

“What I’ve got to determine is is it coming from the ash pond or is it naturally occurring or is it from another source?” Mueller told the residents. “I don’t know.”

Berry assured residents that Georgia Power is “working hard to make things better.” But what he left unsaid was that Georgia Power’s recent purchase of over 1000 acres of land near Scherer’s coal-ash pond would extend its property lines and limit its liability. Simply reducing the number of private wells in operation near the ash pond is far cheaper than installing a liner that would prevent further spread of contaminants.

After the conversation meandered into technical jargon one of Andrea’s neighbors Karl Cass — whose son and niece had survived two different kinds of childhood cancer — directed the conversation back toward Berry.

“I appreciate your commitment based on what you’ve shared that you want to do the right thing — did I hear that correctly?” Cass asked Berry.

“Yes sir you did hear that correctly” Berry said.

“I appreciate your commitment” Cass continued. “Why the resistance on the liners?”

Berry said the company had “really studied” this site and concluded that burying the waste in an unlined pond was a viable option to comply with state regulations. The company’s groundwater modeling predicted that contaminants wouldn’t move out enough to warrant a liner. Because of that he said the residents didn’t need to worry. Georgia Power declined to comment on Berry’s remarks.

“If something is happening EPD is going to ask us to fix it and we’re going to fix it” Berry said.

In the months after Georgia Power purchased the Goolsby home more family members got sick or died. One of Andrea’s cousins Gloria Hammond believed the prostate cancer that recently had killed her husband Cason was linked to toxins in the water. Two of Andrea’s other relatives a retired grocery store owner named Tony Bowdoin and car bumper repairman named Mike Pless were diagnosed shortly thereafter with colon and throat cancer respectively. Few of the cancer-stricken family members were related by blood to the Goolsbys — some had married into the family — which to Andrea ruled out the possibility that the cancers were caused by a genetic predisposition. All three of her recently diagnosed family members lived close to Plant Scherer’s ash pond. The Altamaha Riverkeeper now overseen by a former paratrooper named Fletcher Sams had recently tested all three of their homes’ wells. Each one contained hexavalent chromium levels between 30 and 140 times higher than drinking-water guidelines in North Carolina and between 100 and 490 times higher than those in California.

In early 2020 residents’ concerns about Plant Scherer’s coal-ash pond prompted a bill from Democratic state lawmakers that would force all of Georgia’s coal ash to be moved into lined disposal sites. One night in February 2020 the same month as the closed-door meeting with Berry Andrea joined Hammond Bowdoin Pless and dozens of other Juliette residents inside a tiny Presbyterian church with stained-glass windows. They’d gathered to learn more about the ongoing groundwater test campaign conducted by the Altamaha Riverkeeper. For months Sams had steered his red pickup truck down driveways near Plant Scherer and to homes farther away from the plant collecting water samples from anyone who’d asked for their well to be tested. Now he was finally revealing the full results of what he’d found so far.

Standing before the crowd Sams explained that almost all of the more than 30 wells he’d tested so far at homes near Plant Scherer had contained worrisome contaminants often present in coal ash that could be harmful to humans if consumed at high enough levels. The wells closer to Scherer’s ash ponds — including along Luther Smith Road — generally had levels of hexavalent chromium higher than those farther away. Pointing to a projector screen near the altar Sams showed a Georgia Power filing certifying that parts of the ash pond are so deep that they’re below the water table which meant those contaminants are in constant contact with the groundwater in the aquifer. He then pulled up an aerial image of Scherer’s ash pond circled by red dots signifying locations of Georgia Power’s own groundwater monitoring wells where tests had exceeded federal protection standards for cobalt a trace metal leaking out of Scherer’s ash pond.

Sams then rattled off other coal-ash contaminants that the tests had found words most residents had only ever heard while studying the periodic table during chemistry class.

Residents had grown visibly uncomfortable by the end of Sams’ presentation. Afterward some people suggested that Georgia Power should pay for county water lines to be built to their homes so they wouldn’t have to drink from the wells anymore. Hammond one of the few Luther Smith Road homeowners who refused to sell to the company said she doubted that would happen; doing so might signify an admission of guilt.

Incredulous Andrea doubled down on the call for Georgia Power to fix the problem. She said the company was already “purchasing property and paying people hush money” so they would not discuss contamination. (Georgia Power did not respond when asked about Goolsby’s comment.)

At one point Andrea noticed a man in a suit near the front of the church. When someone shouted a question his way he walked toward the altar to grab the microphone from Sams. The man PSC Commissioner Echols explained that he and his colleagues had approved Georgia Power’s request to pass $7.3 billion in ash pond cleanup costs on to customers adding that “we authorized a lot of money — billions of dollars.”

Listening closely Andrea grew outraged as Echols — who had voted two months earlier to allow Georgia Power to start collecting money from its customers — shifted the responsibility for reining in Georgia Power to EPD inaccurately claiming that the environmental agency had the sole authority to stop the company’s unlined pond proposal. (The Sierra Club’s Georgia chapter would later sue the PSC for unlawfully granting the bill surcharge; the company is approved to recoup a first round of $525 million though it is expected to return to PSC for permission to recover the remainder of the cleanup costs in future rounds. The case could soon go before the Georgia Court of Appeals. Echols declined to answer GHN and ProPublica’s questions but said in a brief statement “I am confident we are on the right track.”)

“I wasn’t even born when the problem started but I have to pay for this mess?” Andrea later said. “It’s hypocritical. They’re the ones doing this but we have to pay for it when it would have cost a lot less to do it right the first time or fix it when they knew it was a problem.”

As COVID-19 spread across Georgia Berry’s team submitted more than 25000 pages of filings to the EPD to prove how its plan to bury 48 million tons of coal ash in ponds without a protective liner was in fact legal and safe. But in corporate filings dated as recently as 2020 Georgia Power acknowledged that Plant Scherer’s ash pond was susceptible to a catastrophic dam failure that could mirror the Kingston spill potentially sending a wave of ash toward homes injuring or killing Juliette residents and contaminating a span of at least 15 miles of the nearby Ocmulgee River. Parts of the ash pond had grown unstable enough that in 2017 one contractor nearly died after a sinkhole larger than a basketball court suddenly opened up in the pond causing part of the shoreline to collapse according to photos of the incident and eyewitness accounts. (Georgia Power did not respond when asked about the sinkhole.)

On top of that the company faced a growing number of hurdles related to coal-ash contaminants. Georgia Power had to notify a homeowner near Plant McManus in Brunswick of its discovery of levels of arsenic in groundwater that exceed federal and state safety limits. During a recent legislative hearing state Rep. Mary Frances Williams told one of Berry’s deputies that she was “concerned” to discover contaminants had migrated off-site from Plant McDonough’s ash pond over to property owned by Cobb County in suburban Atlanta. “I’m not clear how you can prevent that from happening without liners” she told the Georgia Power lobbyist.

Plant Scherer however posed the biggest challenge for Georgia Power. EPD scientists said last year that they would need more information before the agency could allow the company to move ahead with leaving dry ash in Scherer’s unlined pond. Georgia Power had disclosed to EPD the data from several dozen groundwater monitoring wells near Scherer some of which detected the presence of contaminants often found in ash ponds at levels higher than groundwater-protection standards. The data also showed that contaminants were migrating toward the properties the company had purchased on Luther Smith Road. The EPD is now seeking to determine the speed at which groundwater flowed through and under Scherer’s ash pond and to what degree the contaminants posed a threat to remaining neighbors. (Chambers the EPD spokesperson said permits to leave coal ash in unlined ponds will not be issued to Georgia Power if its plans fail to comply with the coal-ash rule.)

The company downplayed the concerns from outside experts. Back in 2019 Berry testified that “advanced engineering methods” would allow Georgia Power to clean up its ash pond at Scherer in a way that complies with environmental regulations but he has refused to disclose the methods because the company claims they are confidential. In January Georgia Power submitted filings that claimed further risk evaluations of groundwater were no longer warranted because the ash pond’s contaminants “are not expected to pose a risk to human health or the environment.”

In another recent filing Georgia Power claimed that contaminants such as hexavalent chromium at Plant Scherer come from “naturally occurring” sources instead of its operations. Researchers in North Carolina led by Vengosh of Duke University have found that high levels of hexavalent chromium found in drinking wells in the central part of that state are in fact naturally occurring. (A similar study has not been conducted to determine the source of the hexavalent chromium in Juliette’s drinking water wells.) On the other hand Vengosh also has conducted research showing that ash from Wyoming-sourced Powder River Basin coal — the coal that Georgia Power uses at Plant Scherer — contains high levels of hexavalent chromium. Last year Vengosh wrote in an email to Monroe County officials that “even if the hexavalent chromium found in drinking water wells is not derived from coal ash contamination” other coal ash metals could pose a “constant risk” to homeowners’ drinking water.

Residents’ fear of that constant risk has revived a legal battle against Georgia Power. Brian Adams the Macon attorney behind the lawsuit that fizzled in 2014 found a powerful new partner in Atlanta attorney Stacey Evans. A state lawmaker who once ran for governor Evans was looking for her next big case after winning a $495 million whistleblower settlement against DaVita an international dialysis chain. Last July Evans and Adams filed a new lawsuit on behalf of 45 residents who alleged that Plant Scherer is “poisoning” their community’s water. Their claims extend beyond those of the previous case: The lawsuit alleges that Georgia Power not only constructed and operated Plant Scherer in a way that led to contaminated drinking water but also that the company built a network of monitoring wells at an elevation so high that their groundwater testing “evades representative results.” Georgia Power has denied those allegations in court filings.

One of the plaintiffs Andrea’s cousin Tony Bowdoin said last summer that he’s seeking damages to offset the six-figure costs of treatment for Stage IV colon cancer. Another plaintiff Karl Cass whose son is a survivor of childhood cancer hopes a jury trial might deliver clarity in a saga that so far has offered no clear answers.

“I don’t want to see my kids have to fight this fight against Georgia Power” Cass said. “And I hope their children won’t have to live in fear about what’s happening to their health.”

Asked what would make things right Andrea explained that the answer is both simple and complicated. Driving around Juliette in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election Andrea saw one type of yard sign more than any others. It wasn’t in support of President Donald Trump as one would have expected in deep-red Monroe County where 70 percent of voters cast ballots for him last year. It was one with a clear call to action: Georgia Power: Clean up your trASH.

At a hearing expected to be held in late 2021 Andrea intends to urge the EPD to reject Georgia Power’s plans to bury coal-ash waste in unlined ponds. If she and other Georgians get their way state officials would force the company to submit a new plan to either retrofit the ponds with a liner or move the ash to a lined disposal site and begin the yearslong process of reducing the immediate threat to the groundwater.

Andrea said Georgia Power should also cover the costs of Monroe County’s $16 million project to extend water lines to the homes of about 850 Juliette residents who currently rely on drinking wells. (Those residents still would need to pay — as much as thousands of dollars — to have the line connected to their homes; Andrea says Georgia Power should pay for that too.) Georgia Power has instead mailed residents packets touting the company’s environmental track record and accusing the Altamaha Riverkeeper of making “false claims” about contamination. To find the truth Andrea said there should finally be a cancer-cluster study to figure out whether coal-ash contaminants are linked to more than 40 cancer cases compiled by her and others in the community.

The more complicated solution as Andrea explained is compensating Juliette residents for “what they lost.” She’s thinking of her cousin Hammond who rejected recent offers by the company to buy her land on Luther Smith Road in part because her well may hold answers to the question of why her husband died. Then there’s Mike Pless another of her relatives who after surgery and two rounds of radiation therapy has reckoned with his uncertain future and what that might mean for his family. “No easy choices no guarantees” he wrote on Facebook. “Welcome to the crucible.”

In late February Andrea was once again reminded of all she has lost. A mile north of Luther Smith Road she walked up a gravel path in a black funeral dress past her grandparents’ tombstones to find a sunflower-topped wooden casket holding her cousin Tony Bowdoin who had just died from colon cancer at age 58. In front of more than 100 mourners Reverend Mark Goolsby Andrea’s father gave a moving eulogy honoring his nephew as an avid hunter and hardworking storekeeper a serial gift-giver and a morbid joke-teller. Andrea thought of all the death since her grandfather Brack had passed nearly two decades earlier. How much more would her family lose? she wondered. What would Georgia Power’s ultimate cost be?

“They took things families can’t get back” Andrea said. “There’s no amount of money that can ever give those things back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXNhZGVuYW5vdy5jb20vd2Vla2VuZHIvc291dGhlcm4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1nYXMtY29tcGFueS1wcmVzaWRlbnQtd2lsbC1kaXNjdXNzLWN1cnJlbnQtZW5lcmd5LWlzc3Vlcy13ZWRuZXNkYXktaW4tb3Blbi10by10aGUtcHVibGljLXJvdGFyeS1tZWV0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern California Gas Company President Will Discuss Current Energy Issues Wednesday in Open-to-the-Public ...,"Maryam Brown President of Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) will be guest speaker on Wednesday March 31 at the Rotary Club of Pasadena’s weekly online meeting which begins at 12 p.m. The meeting is open to the public.

Calls for Coca-Cola to be boycotted in its home state of Georgia have been triggered by plans for new voting restrictions that President Joe Biden has condemned as ""Jim Crow in the 21st century.""

The drinks' giant's boycott is being led by the AME Sixth Episcopal District of Georgia which includes over 500 Black churches. Coca-Cola's headquarters is in Atlanta.

Bishop Reginald Jackson told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution on Friday: ""Coca-Cola wants Black and brown people to drink their product; then they must speak up when our rights our lives and our very democracy as we know it is under attack.""

Republican lawmakers have put forward two bills in the State Senate which would repeal 'no-excuse absentee voting' impose new voter identification requirements ban out-of-precinct voting limit the use of ballot drop boxes make it illegal to approach voters in line to give them food and water and shorten the absentee voting window.

Stacey Abrams a Georgia Democratic power broker said they would disproportionately affect historically marginalized voters including young people the disabled community and other minority groups.

Civil rights and voter advocacy groups believe Black voters who account for 30% of Georgia's electorate would be particularly affected by the proposals especially regarding 'souls to the polls' events used heavily by Black churches to encourage Sunday voting.

Black voters and voters of color were key to helping Joe Biden win the presidential election in November and two Democratic senators in the state's January run-offs Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.

The groups also took out several full-page ads in local newspapers urging Coca-Cola Delta Southern Company Home Depot UPS and Aflac to stop the donations to politicians backing voting restrictions and support federal voting rights reform instead.

According to the independent newsletter Popular Information since 2018 companies have donated $7.4 million including $34750 from Coca-Cola at least $41600 from Delta Airlines $34500 from UPS $38700 from Southern Company and $7250 from Aflac.

Coca-Cola said it paused political donations after the Capitol riot Reuters reported while Delta added that it had not made any contributions to Georgia House or Senate candidates in 2020.

Republicans say the proposed changes to the voting system are required for election integrity following the Capitol riot.

The proposed $29 billion merger between Canadian Pacific (NYSE: CP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) aims to capitalize on an expected increase in the flow of trade among the U.S. Canada and Mexico.

The merger would create the first company with a rail network spanning all three countries and enhance the facilitation of the movement of goods across the three nations.

“The new competition we will inject into the North American transportation market cannot happen soon enough as the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement among these three countries makes the efficient integration of the continent’s supply chains more important than ever before” Keith Creel CP president and CEO said in a statement announcing the proposed merger.

The proposed CP-KCS merger comes against the backdrop of Kansas City Southern’s $167 million investment in Mexico last year.

Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM) KCS’ Mexican operations include railways serving northeastern and central Mexico as well as key port cities including Veracruz Tampico and Lazaro Cardenas.

One of KCS’ major projects was the completion of part of a 12.11-mile double-track line that connects Mexico’s port of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico.

KCSM ran the first revenue train over the new double-track access into the expanded Port of Veracruz in February company spokeswoman Doniele Carlson told FreightWaves.





“This new rail infrastructure is anticipated to make the port more competitive and productive for imports from the U.S. South America and Europe” Carlson said. “The project was completed in coordination with the Integral Port Administration of Veracruz (APIVER) to improve rail and ship asset utilization efficiency and connectivity. Before the bypass KCSM did not have direct access into the Port of Veracruz.”

The 12.11-mile rail connection starts at KCSM’s Santa Fe connection point in the state of Veracruz which is already covered by the company’s rail network and extends to the expanded Port of Veracruz.

The Mexican government invested over $19 million to build two new terminals at the Port of Veracruz last year. Veracruz is a key strategic point for trade on Mexico’s east coast as well as the largest seaport located near Mexico City.

“KCSM’s new rail connection is part of a large expansion carried out by the [Veracruz] port authority including the construction of new intermodal refined products grain automotive and general merchandise terminals” Carlson said. “Direct access into the new terminal complex will allow KCSM to grow its business between central Mexico and the historically important port of Veracruz.”

Carlson said KCS will continue to focus on more capacity projects during 2021 including beginning construction on a second international rail bridge at the Laredo Texas-Nuevo Laredo Mexico border crossing.

After dipping in late February from the winter storm Laredo outbound domestic intermodal volume (ORAILDOM.LRD) have risen above year-ago levels.

(Chart: FreightWaves SONAR. Using a seven-day moving average domestic loaded intermodal container volume outbound from Laredo is shown for 2021 2020 and 2019 in blue green and orange respectively.)

KCS’ route through Laredo connects to Mexico City as well as the ports Veracruz Tampico and Lazaro Cardenas.

“Today KCS processes an average of 26 trains in a 24-hour period. Adding the second bridge will enable the Laredo gateway to accommodate 65 to 80 trains per day” Carlson said. “KCS continues working with relevant government entities on permitting while doing preliminary design work toward a second cross-border bridge at Laredo.”

In fact it totally slipped my mind (perhaps it was the cocktails). By the time I remembered their website was down for service so I had to call customer service. I was granted the dire boarding position of C22.

Anyone who flies Southwest knows that group C is an aggravating situation to be in especially when flying carry-on only. It is the very last boarding group which means the entire plane less 38 or so people would find their seats before me. I am not a fan of unassigned seating to say the least.

I wouldn’t care about a middle seat in the back of the plane if I had time to check my luggage. But in this case I had to get off the plane as soon as humanly possible and head straight home in order to make my daughter’s Girl Scout meeting. San Diego International Airport’s baggage claim is notoriously slow and I didn’t have a minute to spare.

I was surprised by how much stress the C22 boarding position caused me but it was likely due to a sub-par flight on the way up to Las Vegas that was delayed among other things.

At McCarran Airport the Southwest Airlines gate agent made an announcement that early boarding positions were available for $40. If the Business Select seats are all sold in advance on a flight this isn’t an option.

The flight from Las Vegas to San Diego is scheduled for just over an hour but is less than that in reality. Did I really need to spend $40?

I was the only one who paid the $40 for early boarding on the entire plane despite the declaration that our flight was full. I paid with a credit card at the gate and a new boarding position was stapled on my existing ticket — A6. Cue the huge sigh of relief. The A7-A15 boarding positions behind me were empty.

Boarding the plane was obviously easy and I slipped my carry-on bag in wheels first just like I did on the way up to Las Vegas and pretty much like I do on every flight. Strategically I took the aisle seat in the second row and settled in to catch up on email before the plane left the gate.

During boarding someone jammed their carry-on and other stuff in a manner that prevented our overhead bin from closing. My bag was moved a number of rows back before I could protest.

This means that I’d have to fight the stampede trying to disembark the plane in order to get my stupid carry-on that should have been in the second row in the bin above me. Believe me it was awkward but I held my ground after the plane landed. I had to leave my other bag in my seat in order to do it and over my shoulder I heard a passenger report a “lost bag” to the flight attendant and had to scream across the plane that it was mine and to not touch it.

Early Boarding on Southwest Airlines is worth it if you:

are in a major hurry.

have a tight connection.

forgot to buy Early Bird Check-in.

checked in late and have a terrible boarding position.

prefer the first few rows of the plane.

don’t mind spending $40 (obviously).

Keep in mind that early boarding isn’t always available at the gate so you can’t count on it. Have you purchased early boarding on Southwest Airlines?

The unidentified pilot was apparently sharing his personal views with his fellow pilot on a hot mic as the flight prepared to depart San Jose Mineta International Airport for Seattle on March 12. At one point a ground controller advised of the hot mic but there were a few more pointed remarks after that followed by a crisp and professional series of readbacks and acknowledgements as the 737 took off for the Northwest. The recorded rant taken from LiveATC can be heard here.

Although there was some initial confusion about the source of the transmission Southwest later claimed the pilot as one of their own and said his comments were an “isolated incident involving a single employee and not representative of the nearly 60000 hardworking respectful people of Southwest Airlines.” He was not identified and his fate is unknown but in addition to the offensive nature of the comments they were also in violation of the sterile cockpit policy for critical phases of flight and that caught the attention of the FAA. “FAA regulations prohibit airline pilots from talking about subjects that are unrelated to safely conducting their flight while taxiing and while flying below 10000 feet altitude” FAA spokesperson Ian Gregor said in a statement. Gregor also said that it was the FAA that reported the incident to the airline.

By the way we looked it up and the reference to “rolling coal” in the clip concerns reprogramming the engine control computer in diesel pickup trucks to allow more fuel to enter the engine so that when the throttle is depressed the truck emits large clouds of black smoke.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK -1.47%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

For the times when you want to switch up your usual coffee though you'll want to know what you'll be getting in the caffeine department. If you're looking to go from hot to cold Starbucks has a whole slew of cold brew options with varying amounts of caffeine depending on your preferences. Here are the 13 strongest cold brew drinks at Starbucks when you're looking for something new to help you get energized.

Cold brew is always a popular menu item for customers looking for a chilled pick-me-up at Starbucks. To get the signature smoothness of cold brew the coffee chain uses a special method that combines cold water with ground coffee before steeping for 20 hours.

With 13 cold brews in total you have plenty of options to choose from at Starbucks. Overall Starbucks Cold Brew has a bit less caffeine than the company's hot brewed coffee. The chain's line of nitrogen-infused cold brews feature the most caffeine content though classic cold brews still pack plenty of punch. To help you decide which sip you'd like to pick up for your next coffee run check out the strongest cold brew drinks at Starbucks. Caffeine counts for the drinks are all based on a grande size which is 16-fluid ounces.

1. Starbucks Honey Almondmilk Nitro Cold Brew

Honey Almondmilk Nitro Cold Brew is a plant-based sip at Starbucks. It features honey and is finished off with almond milk for a subtly sweet concoction.

Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew features the chain's classic cold brew infused with nitrogen. The final result is a smooth and sweet flavor and it has 280 milligrams of caffeine.

3. Starbucks Reserve Nitro Cold Brew

4. Starbucks Salted Caramel Cream Nitro Cold Brew

6. Starbucks Irish Cream Nitro Cold Brew

Irish Cream Nitro Cold Brew is a festive sip that Starbucks has released every holiday season since its debut in 2019. It's a combo of Starbucks' classic Nitro Cold Brew with Irish cream syrup finished off with vanilla sweet cream foam and cocoa. There are 265 milligrams of caffeine in a grande.

Warren Buffett one of the greatest value investors of all time is turning 90 this year. Operating from his hometown of Omaha Nebraska Buffett lives in a modest house drives a modest car and enjoys the simple pleasures of life like an ice-cold Coke.

After sticking to the same investing game plan for years Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.09%) (BRK.B 0.04%) portfolio has gotten a fairly considerable revamp over the last few years. For instance trusting the wisdom of his closest Berkshire money managers the company began buying shares of tech growth stock Apple in 2016. Technology a sector that Buffett used to mostly avoid now comprises about 40% of Berkshire's portfolio.

So it's clear that Buffett is willing to go in new directions if the right opportunity comes along. With this in mind perhaps Buffett should consider Starbucks (SBUX 1.32%) Honeywell (HON 0.60%) and United Parcel Service (UPS 0.12%). These companies offer a great combination of market leadership dividends and value.

Here's why Buffett would love all three companies and why they would fit nicely into Berkshire's portfolio.

1. Starbucks

Berkshire Hathaway owns over $30 billion in shares of consumer staple stocks Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. Although Starbucks technically falls in the consumer discretionary category its product line has arguably become more of a staple for consumers than many offerings from Coke and Kraft Heinz. The shift in consumer sentiment away from sugar and preservatives toward healthier options hinders the growth prospects of soda and processed-food companies. Yet Starbucks manages to have a similar level of recession resilience as these companies (with a much brighter future in the forecast).

Starbucks was hit hard by the pandemic but has since reopened nearly all of its stores. Its revenue and earnings are close to pre-pandemic levels with U.S. same-store comps down just 5% year over year as of its most recent quarter. This is impressive considering 60% of its U.S. company-operated stores are still offering limited seating.

Starbucks leaned heavily on grab-and-go ordering and its mobile app during the pandemic. And it worked. Customers are using the app and spending more money per transaction than ever before which bodes well for Starbucks' future.

Since issuing its first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in April 2010 Starbucks has raised its annual payout every single year. Its quarterly dividend is now $0.45 per share which is a yield of 1.7% at today's prices. Starbucks has plans to build new stores focused solely on grab-and-go ordering -- which should help it grow earnings and its dividend for years to come.

2. Honeywell

Just over 2% of Berkshire's portfolio is dedicated to industrial stocks. If Buffett was looking for an industrial to add then Honeywell deserves to be a top contender.

Like most industrial stocks Honeywell suffered revenue and earnings declines last year. As results improved toward the end of the year management said it is now confident that the company can return to growth.

The same factors that hurt Honeywell's 2020 results should help it in 2021. Commercial aviation could rebound as air traffic improves. Higher oil prices and industrial production will help its performance materials and technologies segment. Honeywell's customers delayed building solutions projects in 2020. But in its fourth-quarter conference call Honeywell management announced orders were piling in putting its backlog in a good position for 2021. And finally safety and productivity solutions (SPS) -- the only segment that grew in 2020 -- should continue to benefit from warehouse automation and productivity solutions. SPS ended 2020 with a $4 billion backlog -- double the backlog at the end of 2019. Simply put Honeywell is seeing business pick up in all of its segments.

Aside from an optimistic outlook Honeywell has many qualities that Buffett would love. The company's strong balance sheet history of dividend increases and growth prospects give it long-term value. Despite last year's challenges Honeywell was able to generate tons of free cash flow that more than doubled its dividend payments.

Excess free cash flow continues to give Honeywell the dry powder needed to limit how much debt it adds to its balance sheet. Today its balance sheet remains one of the best of the major industrials.

3. UPS

Ranking 48 out of 48 on Buffett's list of holdings is UPS. So yes Buffett owns the stock. But at 0.003% of Berkshire's portfolio the company's UPS shares could double and it would hardly make an impact.

UPS rival FedEx reported encouraging earnings and guidance on March 18 that showed a strong recovery in business-to-business (B2B) sales and e-commerce growth. This is good news for UPS which would like its B2B volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.

UPS has the makings of a perfect Buffett stock. With 70% higher net income and double the market cap of FedEx UPS is the market leader in its industry. Its adjusted 2020 EPS of $8.23 per share gives it a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of around 19. UPS has a dividend yield of 2.6%. The company just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.02 per share more than double what it was 10 years ago.

UPS has plenty of growth prospects as well. It's leading the distribution process for COVID-19 vaccines a trend Buffett can appreciate seeing as he's been buying healthcare stocks. UPS was also one of the few industrial stocks that crushed earnings throughout 2020 not to mention notching its best quarter ever at the end of the year.

E-commerce is a booming trend that benefits UPS. The company has been expanding its fleet and laying the groundwork for what it expects to be years of e-commerce growth. The pandemic accelerated that trend which was a big part of UPS' strong 2020 performance. However there's reason to believe it will retain much of the business it gained while adding more in the years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2phcGFudG9kYXkuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L2ZlYXR1cmVzL25ldy1wcm9kdWN0cy9zdGFyYnVja3MtamFwYW4tY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1zYWt1cmEtc2Vhc29uLXdpdGgtYS1mdWxsLWJsb29tLWNoZXJyeS1ibG9zc29tLWJlcnJ5LWZyYXBwdWNjaW5v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Japan celebrates sakura season with a full bloom cherry blossom berry Frappuccino,"By grape Japan

Starbucks Japan likes to keep their customers on their toes with a constant stream of seasonally exclusive Frappuccinos and Japan's celebrated cherry blossom season is perhaps one of the highlights of the year in that regard.

After taking a brief break to release their first ever almond milk Frappuccinos Starbucks Japan is returning to the theme of sakura sweets by upgrading their previously released floral and fluffy Sakura Fuwari Berry Frappuccino with a new Sakura Blooming Berry Frappuccino that doubles down on strawberry flavoring.

The milk-based Frappuccino is mixed with sakura strawberry sauce as well as a velvety sweet and sour raspberry panna cotta. The drink also contains freeze-dried strawberries mixed in in powder form and is topped with sakura and vanilla crumbs as well as more freeze-dried strawberries to recreate fallen sakura petals.

The Sakura Blooming Berry Frappuccino will be available at Starbucks throughout Japan for 590 yen (tall size only) until Tuesday April 13.

The Eagles jumped out to a 1-0 lead early on but St. Cloud carried the play for the last 40 minutes and BC wasn’t able to do much of anything.

The two teams started the first period with almost nine full minutes of non-stop hockey setting a great pace early on. After BC came up empty on a power play chance Matt Boldy opened the scoring for the Eagles scoring with about five and a half minutes left in the period. After some strong work along the boards from linemates Mike Hardman and Alex Newhook Boldy picked up a loose puck and found himself all alone with St. Cloud goalie David Hrenak. Boldy fired a quick shot the beat Hrenak between his legs to give BC a 1-0 lead. The goal was originally listed as unassisted but Hardman and Newhook were eventually credited with assists. Spencer Knight was the main story for BC for the remainder of the period coming up with a few tough stops to keep the Eagles up a goal after 20 minutes of play.

St. Cloud tied things up about halfway through the second period scoring off a rebound to level things at 1-1. St. Cloud controlled much more of the play in the second period and the goal came after they spent a number of shifts primarily in BC’s defensive zone. The Eagles immediately killed a penalty after St. Cloud tied things up with Knight making a big stop just as time expired on the man advantage but they didn’t flip any momentum as St. Cloud took the lead just a few minutes later. A scramble out in front of Knight ended up in a few chances on net and the last one got past Knight and gave St. Cloud a 2-1 lead. They made it 3-1 with 44.7 second left in the period scoring on a goal that created some controversy. A St. Cloud player snuck a puck past Knight on a play in tight that ended with some contact. The original call on the ice was for no goal and and goalie interference but a lengthy review overturned that and gave St. Cloud a 3-1 lead after 2.

St. Cloud state closed out the game with a textbook third period clogging up the neutral zone and giving BC nothing on the rush. They added a late empty net goal to ice things and BC‘s season came to an end with a 4-1 defeat.

St. Cloud was the better team for the majority of this game plain and simple. BC was thoroughly outplayed for the last 40 minutes and didn’t seem to have any response to St. Cloud’s second period push. It was a frustrating game to watch as the Eagles just couldn’t get anything going for extended periods of time including a stretch in the third period where they went almost eight minutes without a shot on goal. This feels like it’s going to be a long offseason with the last two games leaving a particularly bad taste in everyone’s mouth.

We’ll have more over the next few weeks as players make decisions to go pro or return to school but for now this is a tough way to have the season come to an end.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJjaGVpZ2h0cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9iYy1lbmRzLXNlYXNvbi13aXRoLW5jYWEtdG91cm5hbWVudC1sb3NzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eagles Crash Out of NCAA Tournament With Loss to St. Cloud State — The Heights,"ALBANY N.Y. — For practically the entire last three minutes of the game Spencer Knight sat dejected on the corner of his bench having been pulled for an extra attacker.

Even without seeing his face it was clear his heart had broken.

Boston College men’s hockey’s dream season has come to an end. If you couldn’t tell from Knight’s sinking shoulders you could see it in captain Marc McLaughlin slamming his stick into the plexiglass behind Knight’s net. Or you could see it in Michael Karow BC’s only remaining senior staying on the ice just a couple extra seconds taking in what were likely his last moments as a collegiate player.

BC’s road stops in Albany as the Eagles jumped to a 1-0 first-period lead in the NCAA Tournament Regional Final but St. Cloud State (19-10) responded with four unanswered goals—including one on an empty net prompting McLaughlin’s frustration. Ending a near-perfect season on a broken-down second period is heartbreak in its purest form.

“We were all fighting [the] pandemic and it was such an unusual year for all college teams but for us to get to our regional final you know one step away from going to Pittsburgh it’s frustrating for us right now so we’re very disappointed” BC head coach Jerry York said.

BC (17-6-1) strung together a miracle of a season in beyond difficult circumstances spending over one full month atop the national polls. The Eagles lost one of their 2019-20 leading scorers to injury they never played a non-conference game and the vast majority of BC’s roster is made up of freshmen and sophomores.

“Tonight after tonight’s game you know for a young team I think [we] matured a lot playing a game like this” York said.

With such a young group including a sophomore class that has never seen postseason action before this season the Eagles were forced to jump to a new level without much preparation.

Youth however has not been an obstacle for BC this season particularly in its standout sophomore class of Matt Boldy Alex Newhook Mike Hardman Marshall Warren Drew Helleson and Knight.

Boldy opened the Eagles’ scoring with his 11th goal of the season with just over five minutes left in the first. After a pileup on the wall in BC’s offensive zone the sophomore took the puck at his stick and buried a backhander behind St. Cloud State goaltender David Hrenak.

But the narrow lead didn’t last.

In high-pressure situations this year BC has frequently fallen apart and Sunday’s game was no different. The wheels fell off for the Eagles in the second period starting with a goal from Luke Jaycox around the middle of the period.

Jaycox’s score to tie it up was a rare misstep for Knight as he made the initial save before Jaycox fired it over his left shoulder. In the second frame St. Cloud State outshot BC 20-7 most of which Knight turned away or gloved with little issue.

It was two fluke goals that sent the Huskies into the final break ahead by two. The first came on a wild scramble in front of Knight’s net when Will Hammer fired one from the top of the crease that snuck by Knight.

The second of the two was even more of an enigma as it underwent a seven-minute-long review. Nolan Walker crashed the net with the puck at his stick and the puck crossed the goal line mere seconds before Walker slammed into Knight and dislodged the net. Walker went to the box for charging the goaltender but the officials returned to the ice signaling a goal for St. Cloud State.

“They said that the goal was scored one frame before the penalty was taken so it was clear to the referee” York said. “But that was a big play for us because we were going to go on a power play and wondering—we didn’t think it was a goal.”

The three second-period goals marred an otherwise stellar performance for the Hobey Baker finalist. Though Knight had struggled on his blocker side in the Hockey East Tournament semifinals against UMass Lowell he looked much improved against St. Cloud State. Especially considering St. Cloud State’s offensive barrage in the second period Knight put on a stunning performance.

With 9:11 left in the second period and the game still tied at one apiece the Eagles found themselves a man down on the power play. In typical BC fashion—the Eagles led the nation in shorthanded goals for the second year in a row this season—BC spent more time in its offensive zone on the penalty kill than St. Cloud State did.

As the power-play clock wound down however the Huskies showed signs of life and put pressure on Knight the sophomore goaltender made back-to-back saves as BC returned to even strength including one diving save with his left pad to finish off the kill.

The Huskies effectively shut down every chance BC had at cracking the offensive zone. The few times the Eagles got within striking distance of Hrenak the Huskies threw themselves in front of the puck finishing the game with 26 blocks. St. Cloud State was a defensive force to be reckoned with in the neutral zone as well.

“We just did the same thing we normally do but we did better than we normally do” St. Cloud State head coach Brett Larson said in his postgame press conference.

Perhaps the greatest turning point in the game came less than a minute into the second period as Easton Brodzinski went down with an apparent leg injury. Larson said he does not know Brodzinski’s status.

“The guys wanted to play for Easton [Brodzinski]” Larson said. “He’s a guy that’s been here for four years and been a huge part of this program.”

BC locked back down in the third period and fought to claw its way back in but St. Cloud State was practically impenetrable. The Eagles tested Hrenak nine times in the second period but the Huskies were the only ones to find the net as Knight had vacated it in favor of a 6-on-5 chance.

“Well I think that it’s gonna be a while before they can reflect back on it you know talk about the year they had and some of the significant accomplishments they have” York said.

The road may have hit a dead end two games earlier than BC had hoped and though the Eagles hung their heads as they departed the ice in Albany for all but Karow there is plenty more collegiate hockey to be played.

Within the radio spectrum are varying levels of frequency bands some of which are used for this next-gen technology.

With 5G still in its early stages of implementation and not yet available in every country you might be hearing about the 5G bandwidth spectrum spectrum auctions mmWave 5G etc.

Don’t worry if this is confusing. All you really need to know about 5G frequency bands is that different companies use different parts of the spectrum to transmit data. Using one part of the spectrum over another impacts both the speed of the connection and the distance it can cover. Lots more on this below.

Defining the 5G Spectrum

Radio wave frequencies range anywhere from 3 kilohertz (kHz) up to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Every portion of the spectrum has a range of frequencies called a band that go by a specific name.

Some examples of radio spectrum bands include extremely low frequency (ELF) ultra low frequency (ULF) low frequency (LF) medium frequency (MF) ultra high frequency (UHF) and extremely high frequency (EHF).

One part of the radio spectrum has a high frequency range between 30 GHz and 300 GHz (part of the EHF band) and is often called the millimeter band (because its wavelengths range from 1-10 mm). Wavelengths in and around this band are therefore called millimeter waves (mmWaves). mmWaves are a popular choice for 5G but also has application in areas like radio astronomy telecommunications and radar guns.

Another part of the radio spectrum that’s being used for 5G is UHF which is lower on the spectrum than EHF. The UHF band has a frequency range of 300 MHz to 3 GHz and is used for everything from TV broadcasting and GPS to Wi-Fi cordless phones and Bluetooth.

Frequencies of 1 GHz and above are also called microwave and frequencies ranging from 1–6 GHz are often said to be part of the ""sub-6 GHz"" spectrum.

Frequency Determines 5G Speed & Power

All radio waves travel at the speed of light but not all waves react with the environment in the same way or behave the same as other waves. It's the wavelength of a particular frequency used by a 5G tower that directly impacts the speed and distance of its transmissions.

Higher Frequency Faster speeds.

Shorter distances. Lower Frequency Slower speeds.

Longer distances.

Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency (i.e. high frequencies have shorter wavelengths). For example 30 Hz (low frequency) has a wavelength of 10000 km (over 6000 miles) while 300 GHz (high frequency) is just 1 mm.

When a wavelength is really short (such as the frequencies at the higher end of the spectrum) the waveform is so tiny that it can become easily distorted. This is why really high frequencies can't travel as far as lower ones.

Speed is another factor. Bandwidth is measured by the difference between the highest and lowest frequency of the signal. When you move up on the radio spectrum to reach higher bands the range of frequencies is higher and therefore throughput increases (i.e. you get faster download speeds).

Why the 5G Spectrum Matters

Since the frequency used by a 5G cell dictates the speed and distance it's important for a service provider (like Verizon or AT&T) to use a part of the spectrum that includes frequencies that benefit the job at hand.

For example millimeter waves which are in the high-band spectrum have the advantage of being able to carry lots of data. However radio waves in higher bands are also absorbed more easily by gases in the air trees and nearby buildings. mmWaves are therefore useful in densely packed networks but not so helpful for carrying data long distances (due to the attenuation).

For these reasons there isn't really a black and white ""5G spectrum""—different parts of the spectrum can be used. A 5G provider wants to maximize distance minimize problems and get as much throughput as possible. One way to get around the limitations of millimeter waves is to diversify and use lower bands.

A frequency of 600 MHz for example has lower bandwidth but because it’s not affected as easily by things like moisture in the air it doesn't lose power as quickly and is able to reach 5G phones and other 5G devices further away as well as better penetrate walls to provide indoor reception.

For comparison low-frequency (LF) transmissions in the range of 30 kHz to 300 kHz are great for long-distance communications because they experience low attenuation and therefore don't need to be amplified as often as higher frequencies. They're used for things like AM radio broadcasting.

A service provider might use higher 5G frequencies in areas that demand more data like in a popular city where there are lots of devices in use. However low-band frequencies are useful for providing 5G access to more devices from a single tower and to areas that don't have direct line-of-sight to a 5G cell such as rural communities.

Here are some other 5G frequency ranges (called multi-layer spectrum):

C-band : 2–6 GHz for coverage and capacity.

: 2–6 GHz for coverage and capacity. Super Data Layer : Over 6 GHz (e.g. 24–29 GHz and 37–43 GHz) for high bandwidth areas.

: Over 6 GHz (e.g. 24–29 GHz and 37–43 GHz) for high bandwidth areas. Coverage Area: Below 2 GHz (like 700 MHz) for indoor and broader coverage areas.

5G Spectrum Usage by Carrier

Not all service providers use the same frequency band for 5G. Like we mentioned above there are advantages and disadvantages to using any part of the 5G spectrum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbW1hanVua2llLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL3VmYy0yNjQtbmV3cy1kdXN0aW4tcG9pcmllci12cy1jb25vci1tY2dyZWdvci10cmlsb2d5LWRhdGUtbG9jYXRpb24tdmVudWUtZGFuYS13aGl0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dana White targets Dustin Poirier vs. Conor McGregor trilogy for UFC 264; Poirier reacts,"LAS VEGAS – All signs point to the trilogy bout between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor taking place at UFC 264 this summer.

UFC president Dana White has said for several weeks that the plan is to book the rubber match between Poirier (27-6 MMA 19-5 UFC) and McGregor (22-5 MMA 10-3 UFC) next. Saturday he provided additional details including a timeline location and potential venue for the marquee lightweight matchup.

According to White the fight is targeted to go down at UFC 264 which is tentatively slated to take place July 10 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

“That’s the plan” White told reporters including MMA Junkie at the UFC 260 post-fight press conference. “I hope so (that it’s Poirier vs. McGregor 3). We all hope so.”

Poirier who chose to pursue another clash with McGregor rather than fight for the vacant lightweight title in the aftermath of Khabib Nurmagomedov’s retirement appears to be completely on board with the potential date. At least according to his post on social media which included the date with an emoji of a diamond – his nickname – but no other information (via Twitter):

July 10th 💎 — The Diamond (@DustinPoirier) March 28 2021

After McGregor scored a first-round knockout of Poirier in their initial meeting at UFC 178 in September 2014 “The Diamond” earned his revenge in the rematch when he TKO’d McGregor at UFC 257 in January.

Nothing is official at this point but things appear to be moving in the right direction for the definitive clash in the series to be finalized for the UFC’s July pay-per-view that’s routinely one of the promotion’s biggest events of each calendar year."

And what to do with...,"Forgive me for asking questions which have probably been asked already but I can't find the specific answers to!



1. I am a US citizen residing and working in the UK since mid 2016. I didn't even know what an FBAR was until 2019 and so filed delinquent FBARs for 2017-2019. Other things consumed my life last year and I again forgot to file an FBAR for 2020. Should I file a delinquent one? At one point my checking account did have >$10000 because I had my house deposit saved. Am I going to penalized for filing late? I haven't been penalized for the previous late filed FBARs and just chose the 'I didn't know I had to file' for my reason but I am afraid of incurring penalties now because I did know but forgot this time! As for FATCA isn't this something I am supposed to receive from the bank or do I have to go and file that myself? I received one from my bank once but don't recall receiving it annually.



2. I have most of my accumulated wealth in US based mutual funds and stocks one traditional IRA and one SIMPLE IRA all of which I had before moving to the UK. I also still have a US checking account with a large bank. Thus far I have basically just kept all the money where it is and reported any investment income or money withdrawn when I file my US taxes. I use a family members' address for all these accounts. I was under the impression I could still keep all these accounts using a family members' address but that it is 'questionable' to make further contributions to them while I live abroad. For clarity I am not withdrawing from any retirement accounts yet. Can I transfer money using services like TransferWise to my US bank account and contribute money to the traditional IRA or mutual funds I have in the US if I want to or is this not legal in some way? Should I be reporting these accounts to the UK? (I wouldn't even know how)



3. I have a UK employer sponsored pension plan since 2018 (I think?). From what I can tell the contributions to this are not treated as income for the FEIE and it is not treated as a PFIC. Do I need to report this pension/retirement account on the FBAR? I don't think I did on the previous FBARs - so if I am supposed to be reporting this do I then need to go back and amend the previous years?



4. My spouse is a UK citizen that has thus far remained completely outside the US tax system. We may decide to move back to the US in the future and I have read I need to demonstrate 5 years' tax compliance for him to get a green card. I have filed every year using turbo tax to the best of my ability though I'm sure I have made mistakes because of ignorance in addition to probably not filing FBARs correctly.

That’s how much Los Angeles-based ServiceTitan a startup founded just eight years ago is worth now thanks to some massive tailwinds around homebuilding and energy efficiency that are serving to boost the company’s bottom line and netting it an unprecedented valuation for a vertical software company according to bankers.

The company’s massive mint comes thanks to a new $500 million financing round led by Sequoia’s Global Equities fund and Tiger Global Management.

ServiceTitan’s backers are a veritable who’s who of the venture industry with longtime white shoe investors like Battery Ventures Bessemer Venture Partners and Index Ventures joining the later-stage investment funds like T. Rowe Price H.I.G. Capital Dragoneer Investment Group and ICONIQ Growth.*

In all the new $500 million round likely sets the stage for a public offering later this year or before the end of 2022 if market conditions hold.

ServiceTitan now boasts more than 7500 customers that employ more than 100000 technicians and conduct nearly $20 billion worth of transactions providing services ranging from plumbing air conditioning electrical work chimney pest services and lawn care.

If Angi and Thumbtack are the places where homeowners go to find services and technicians then ServiceTitan is where those technicians go to manage and organize their own businesses.

Based in Glendale California with satellite offices in Atlanta and Armenia ServiceTitan built its business to solve a problem that its co-founders knew intimately as the children of parents whose careers were spent in the HVAC business.

The market for home services employs more than 5 million workers in the U.S. and represents a trillion-dollar global market.

Despite the siren song of global expansion there’s likely plenty of room for ServiceTitan to grow in the U.S. Home ownership in the country is at a 10-year high thanks to the rise of remote work and an exodus from the largest American cities accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

A focus on energy efficiency and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a surge in residential and commercial retrofits which will also boost new business. Indeed these trends were already apparent in the statistic that home improvement spending was up 3% in 2020 even though the broader economy shrank by 3.5%.

“We depend on the men and women of the trades to maintain our life support systems: running water heat air conditioning and power” said Ara Mahdessian co-founder and CEO of ServiceTitan. “Today as both homeownership rates and time spent at home reach record highs these essential service providers are facing rising demand from an increasingly tech-savvy homeowner. By providing contractors with the tools they need to deliver a great customer experience and grow their businesses with ease ServiceTitan is enabling the hardworking men and women of the trades to reach the level of success they deserve.” *This article has been updated to include H.I.G. Capital which made the third largest commitment to the new funding round for ServiceTitan.

With mounting job losses pervasive wage cuts and diminishing unemployment benefits compounded by the rising cost of education and medical expenses there’s newfound urgency around the politics of debt.

Students are launching tuition strikes tenants are organizing and pushing back against landlords medical industry insiders are offering loopholes to get out of medical bills on TikTok and leftist politicians are calling for total student debt cancellation while moderates like Chuck Schumer and President Joe Biden offer meager means-tested debt relief programs.

At the same time poor and less powerful nations have also gone into record levels of sovereign debt (i.e. debt that a national government takes on) in an attempt to keep their economies and people alive. Countries like India Zambia Ethiopia Costa Rica Egypt Argentina and Ecuador among dozens of others are struggling with mountainous debts to public and private lenders. The suffering—on both a personal and societal level—caused by those debts is causing waves of social upheavals.

As consumer debt pressures individuals to twist their lives around repaying it sovereign debt contorts nations in a similar way. Just as indebted Americans often forgo medical treatment for fear it will only rack up monthly bills poor nations slash their own public health spending in the name of repaying debt. Sovereign debt pushes governments to drastically cut public services of all kinds and open their country up to predatory investors leading to mass unrest.

The end result is the same for both: a rise in preventable illnesses general deprivation impoverishment instability and death.

And while international campaigns for sovereign debt cancellation exist this issue has received relatively little attention inside the U.S. compared to our own consumer debt woes. These two conversations around debt are taking place in relative isolation from one another.

But consumer debt in the U.S. and the sovereign debt of nations around the world are morally and politically linked.

Sovereign debt is a moral atrocity pushing nations slowly into death spirals. It is indefensible for the same reasons student and medical debt in America is indefensible and struggling to abolish one implicitly relies on the same broad liberatory vision which includes the other.

At its core to be hopelessly indebted whether as a person or as a nation is to be shackled. Those shackles must be broken and the U.S. is in a unique position to do it.

Dying of COVID Buried in Debt

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown poorer and less powerful countries to a ravenous global finance system one that is indifferent to human welfare and dignity. In 2020 global South nations dramatically ramped up public spending to try and offset the losses in the private sector due to COVID taking on so much debt that some are already on the verge of defaulting or failing to repay.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects debt-to-GDP ratios to rise by 7-10 percent in low and middle-income countries a rapid acceleration of rising debt triggered by the 2007-09 recession. Despite this increased spending the fallout from COVID has pushed 130-500 million people into extreme poverty meaning more public spending will be needed to provide basic services for them. Instead of helping governments bolster these services powerful lenders like the IMF insist that countries should be cutting down on them. Because there’s only a handful of governments and organizations wealthy enough to lend governments money debtor countries are forced to abide by the loan conditions laid out for them—or risk being blacklisted from international financing entirely. This is a recipe for a human disaster in the coming years when the mounting sovereign debts will begin tearing apart state budgets eviscerating countries’ social fabrics in the process.

Ethiopia’s ongoing debt crisis is a helpful case to understand how this dangerous dynamic is playing out in global South nations generally.

Though much of its growth in the past decade occurred thanks to state-led programs which helped to reduce poverty Ethiopia accepted a $2.9 billion loan from the IMF in 2019 with the express purpose of undercutting public investment and redirecting power to the private sector. At this time Ethiopia’s unequally developing economy had been forcing rural villagers into urban slums for years where they were forced to work informal or wage-labor jobs. Harsh and unhealthy living conditions in the slums of Addis Ababa and other cities were contributing to a rise in non-communicable ailments like cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes. Scientists advocated for robust universal health care. But Ethiopia with few options but austerity made good on its agreement with the IMF and cut spending while keeping health care expenditures stagnant. Overall now Ethiopia is spending about twice the money to pay its outside debts than to its own public health sector. Poor Ethiopians are dying so that the IMF can have a tidier spreadsheet (and greater leverage for extracting resources from the country).

This is the norm in the global South where most countries are entrapped into spending more in a futile attempt to repay external debts than to support their own public health institutions even as their people are pushed into toxic slums. A predictable result has been that over-stretched under-funded health care centers leave out those suffering with preventable diseases like measles and polio leading to yet more death. For COVID specifically global South countries are so paralyzed by debt and austerity that a vaccine apartheid is beginning to form which could kill hundreds of thousands in the next year.

The Ethiopian government began openly criticizing sovereign creditors when the pandemic hit in early 2020. As the death toll mounted and its economy plummeted Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pleaded for debt relief. “The dilemma Ethiopia faces is stark” Ahmed wrote in a New York Times op-ed in April 2020 around the same time the G20 announced temporary debt relief for the world’s poorest countries including Ethiopia. “Do we continue to pay toward debt or redirect resources to save lives and livelihoods? Lives lost during the pandemic cannot be recovered; imperiled livelihoods cost more and take longer to recover.”

Canceling Ethiopia’s debts would mean it could use a huge chunk of its revenues to re-invest domestically in order to shore up its flailing health care system instead of sending billions of dollars each year to already-rich creditors. “Increasing health care spending is essential irrespective of debt levels but we have less money on hand and much of it is due to creditors” Ahmed writes.

Seven days after his op-ed was released Moody’s downgraded Ethiopia’s sovereign credit rating for “its stated intention to seek official sector debt service relief” as if to punish the poor country for ever asking for help. This means Ethiopia is likely going to pay more in interest rates and bond yields edging it toward a debt spiral—and thus closer to a social crisis that could kill even more people than the country has already lost to COVID-19. Moody’s has also downgraded the credit rating of El Salvador as well as the banking systems of South Africa Nigeria and Morocco. India’s credit rating is now beginning to hover around “junk” status thanks to its respective downgrade. These downgrades are ticking time bombs that could explode in the next three to four years slowly suffocating a nation’s economy until it hits a breaking point.

As Ethiopia sinks deeper into debt more people are leaving the country seeking work opportunities abroad. Many travel to the Middle East. In 2018 alone about 150000 Ethiopians smuggled themselves into Yemen in the hopes of eventually finding work in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. With a similar rate of emigration in 2019 this has made the maritime route between the Horn of Africa and Yemen one of the busiest and most dangerous in the world. To make this life-threatening voyage Ethiopians are often forced to give away all their possessions to human traffickers who demand exorbitant fees for services. They must then navigate the war in Yemen which itself is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on Earth braving warring parties who torture them and throw them into inhumane detention centers. If they survive this and make it into richer neighboring countries their best-case scenario involves them being treated as indentured servants by employers which includes a barrage of exploitation and threats from governments.

At each step in this perilous journey Ethiopians accrue debt they are unable to pay either by the human trafficking middlemen or by tyrannical bosses who demand fees to process “paperwork.” The national indebtedness of Ethiopia and the resultant suppression of its economy cascades into worlds of personal debt and yet more powerlessness for the Ethiopian people.

It’s a vicious cycle that leads to mass death and immiseration and it’s found all over the globe. Global South nations drowning in debt see their economies slowly collapse under the pressure which drives their populations to seek work opportunities abroad. In effect the loans made to finance the government become ways for powerful firms to exploit that global South as a workforce and keep them ever-vulnerable sacrificing more and more of themselves to paying endless debts.

One anonymous Ethiopian reported the brutal treatment the traffickers went to extract money from him while he was in Yemen:

They demanded money but I said I don’t have any. They told me to make a call but I said I don’t have relatives. They beat me and hung me on the wall by one hand while standing on a chair then they kicked the chair away and I was swinging by my arm. They beat me on my head with a stick and it was swollen and bled.

This is a painful example of the kinds of treatment people suffer through in the name of repaying their debts. But there is a chilling parallel between this man’s experience and the national experience of being hopelessly in debt. This man’s debtors physically beat him to get as much money out of him as possible while international investors knowingly impose such drastic cuts to public services that people die as a direct result. The direct violence to the man’s body flows from the larger structural violence inflicted upon countries in the global South.

Historically international creditors throw less powerful countries into debt traps knowing the human cost of this decision. For decades the IMF has pushed countries to cut subsidies to key goods such as bread fuel and electricity with the expectation that it impoverishes a portion of the indebted country’s population. The people’s collective pushback can sometimes culminate in full-blown revolutions.

The resistance efforts play a large role in the Middle East and North Africa where every few years waves of anti-austerity protests shut down capital cities like Cairo Amman Khartoum and Tunis after their government accepts a conditional IMF loan. In the case of Sudan its inspiring 2019 revolution was catalyzed by a tripling of the price of bread at the behest of Sudan’s creditors including the IMF. No matter to the IMF which recommended more cuts to subsidies in 2020. When poor countries come to them again in the near future with no other option for finance whatever residual remains of its public services will be on the chopping block.

For public health spending the IMF is no better. In the 1980s it infamously pushed Madagascar into an austerity regime ending its monitoring program of malaria while increasing the price of life-saving antimalarial drugs killing ten thousand people. More recently IMF economists have argued that the best way a country can support its health care system is by cutting subsidies to food and fertilizers ignoring the reality that these actions would immediately raise the price of food and thus expose many to starvation malnutrition and famine which would inundate any health care system. In India’s case the IMF has advocated for ending subsidies of its farming sector and raising taxes under the veil that these cuts would help bolster India’s public health sector. Suspiciously their study neglects to mention how indebted countries like India would likely take the extra spending money from ending their subsidies programs to funnel it towards their external debts rather than re-invest it domestically. This twisted logic is not only absurd it is murderous. It is partially to blame for an ongoing epidemic of suicides by farmers who are forced to bury themselves in debt to operate and also the recent mass revolt where over 250 million farmers and peasants have taken to India’s streets in an attempt to block further agricultural market reforms.

Allowing this global indebtedness to continue is a moral abomination. But it’s also in the U.S.’ selfish interest to abolish the world’s debts as well.

As climate change accelerates massive global investment is needed to ensure countries can prevent the worst of its effects while responding effectively to its acute events like droughts and floods. Global South nations currently buried in debt lack the emergency resources to mobilize for these scenarios relying instead on humanitarian aid given after the fact. Years of being pummeled by debt and ecological devastation will eventually drive populations out toward neighboring countries. This will likely spark yet more economic instability secondary conflicts and consequent refugee crises which will eventually spill into the U.S. and its allies. We don’t even have to wait for this to occur in an abstracted future—it’s already happening. Even a conservative national security-oriented view of this would see the value of cancelling global debts now as a way to free up future public revenue to prevent this.

Not Debt Relief Debt Abolition

There is a long history of debt cancellation sometimes called a debt jubilee in order to pre-empt unrest and the uneven concentration of power in one class above another.

The Old Testament declared that all debts should be written off on the tenth day of the seventh month every 50 years. In his authoritative book on the history of debt—aptly titled Debt: The First 5000 Years—David Graeber finds a rich tradition of ritualistic debt forgiveness. In one instance in 1761 BCE Hammurabi the ruler of the ancient kingdom of Babylon cancelled all of his realm’s debts in the name of “justice and equity” so “that the strong might not oppress the weak.” Cancelling the debts marked the New Year in Babylon. In a relevant aside Graeber notes that the world’s first documented use of the word “freedom” in a political document is found in Sumeria where King Entemena issued a debt cancellation in 2402 BCE which was called amargi or freedom. In the more recent past partial debt cancelations are more common. Germany received partial debt forgiveness in 1953. In 2010 the World Bank canceled $36 million of debt owed by Haiti.

But the current sovereign debt system has not institutionalized debt jubilees as an integral part of its function. Instead we have a highly commodified and oligarchical system for debt one driven by the edicts of capitalism in the service of private creditors like BlackRock Ashmore T Rowe Price and Fidelity. It functions similarly to consumer debt in the U.S. sometimes with the same corporations profiting off of both types of debt. For hedge funds lending to governments is a for-profit enterprise and canceling loans is bad for business. Because profit is paramount in global finance hedge funds can actually capitalize off the mass pain from debt by betting governments will falter in their debt repayments (a move known as a “short” in the financial world). Just a few years ago Goldman Sachs shorted Greek debt while hiding parts of it from public view—which meant that as the country fell apart in an enormous economic depression caused by Wall Street’s greed Goldman made out with millions.

The tiniest hint of volatility in a country is grounds for its interest rates to increase meaning its government will be forced to give away more of its quickly disappearing resources to international players. Creditors’ racial prejudice also makes its way into sovereign debts the same way it influences consumer debts. Researchers found that Sub-Saharan African nations have shockingly high borrowing costs even accounting for so-called “market fundamentals” like their volatility. This “Africa Premium” happens with African Americans who have disproportionate debt burdens than their white counterparts a phenomenon some have called “borrowing while black.” Debt in all forms then is a powerful tool to impose global white supremacy.

Countries struggling with debt payments are currently left with piecemeal restructuring programs through the G20 or IMF which demand strict adherence to neoliberal market principles before ever qualifying for relief. Even for the poorest countries “relief” often means little more than temporarily suspending debt payments which merely delays the crisis. Talks can drag on for months as reluctant private lenders refuse to budge. In the meantime the process can damage a country’s reputation on the global credit market for years.

This entire system must be thrown out and remade from the basic moral foundations of solidarity democracy and equality.

In the short term global debt—including consumer and sovereign debt—should be immediately forgiven. And to prevent this kind of fatal debt buildup from happening ever again the IMF the World Bank and similar international lending institutions should be dissolved and replaced by grant-giving bodies that prioritize the most vulnerable and operate democratically. Essential goods and services like health care education transportation housing and food should be publicly administered and free to everyone. Loans with interest rates should be outlawed entirely since the only redistributive effect they have is siphoning money from the poor to the rich. By extension this means hedge funds and other for-profit firms that exert power over the poor through wielding finance capital as a weapon should be broken up.

A democratic system of international aid would give a nation’s people a voice to set the agenda of what their country needs. It would be responsive to countries’ needs in a way the obstinate neoliberal dogma of our current global finance system cannot be. It would realize the redistributive vision organizers activists intellectuals and revolutionaries from the global South have dedicated their lives to enacting.

Much of the political legwork for this must be done in the United States the current seat of global finance. The IMF’s headquarters is in Washington D.C. as is the World Bank’s. BlackRock is in New York City.

The first and most obvious obstacle then is that many Americans simply don’t know the extent to which American-led institutions are disempowering and impoverishing the world through debt. While the IMF is a notorious and reviled institution in the global South who many understand to be nearly as powerful if not more powerful than their country’s own leaders the IMF is far less known in the U.S.

The second obstacle is the unwillingness of global finance to democratize. For-profit enterprises making money off impoverishing the global South are not going to voluntarily dismantle themselves nor will multilateral institutions that further Western imperial power through finance. And so far individual outcries from scattered indebted nations have only incentivized international lenders to use plushy language veiling their austerity recommendations in the language of humanitarianism. But a clear-headed grassroots movement in the U.S. that links its own indebtedness to the sovereign debts of the global South and coordinates with debtor nations can push for more meaningful changes through electoral pressure and direct actions. From there global connections can be made to exert pressure on European and Chinese banks that make up the rest of sovereign creditors.

Let Freedom Ring with a Debt Jubilee

In the mid to late 20th century a wave of revolutionary struggles crashed over much of the global South.

Dozens of colonized nations from Chile and Burkina Faso to Lebanon Algeria and Indonesia rose up and declared their political independence from European colonizers like France and the U.K as well as neocolonial dictators who allied with the West. This opened up a profoundly new space in global affairs one that fostered national self-determination and enabled internationally-minded organizations like the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to imagine novel ways of organizing civilization. Hundreds of millions of people who had before only known of rule by elites half the world away were beginning to realize a post-imperial world.

Sixty years since the first NAM summit in 1961 and there is little to show for their historic struggles. The political independence these nations have on paper means little since they remain leashed to those same imperial powers of the past through instruments of finance capital. And because much of their debt is owed to private lenders global South nations are caught under the boot not only of the West but specifically the profiteering vultures of Wall Street. This is a tragic step backwards from the progress made by their revolutions.

Total debt forgiveness is part of an emancipatory vision for the world. To this end Americans pushing to forgive debts worldwide would help nations to secure the independence they’ve been struggling toward for over 100 years. It will take considerable organizing power to confront those who are crushing the world into indentured servitude. But the moral case is crystal clear: the global debts must be canceled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbS9lbmcvbmV3cy82MzYxMTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ServiceTitan Company created by Armenians valued at $ 8.3 billion,"The meeting of Nikol Pashinyan and Vladimir Putin is in process

But I think It Takes Two might be the first game to try its hand at turning a broken marriage into a co-op-only action-adventure game.

The story follows Cody and May who have decided that it’s easier to split up than solve whatever problems they’re having. Naturally this upsets their daughter Rose who has bought a book about love in the hopes of helping her parents. When she cries onto the homemade dolls representing her parents while wishing they would stay together she inadvertently transfers her parents’ consciousness into the bodies of the dolls. The game chronicles their journey to escape the spell that binds them. Cody and May aren’t alone though: they have the (unwanted) help of The Book of Love/Dr. Hakim an anthropomorphic book with an extremely questionable Spanish/French/Italian/who knows really accent who is determined to get Cody and May back together.

""The game’s tone is all over the place. One minute a very distressed Rose is trying to talk to the empty bodies of her parents and the next a talking book with a bad accent is lecturing the two dolls containing the consciousness of said parents about the importance of collaboration while hip-thrusting""

While the game is often very charming It Takes Two’s story is utterly bonkers and honestly one of the game’s biggest problems. The game’s tone is all over the place. One minute a very distressed Rose is trying to talk to the empty bodies of her parents and the next a talking book with a bad accent is lecturing the two dolls containing the consciousness of said parents about the importance of collaboration while hip-thrusting. Dr. Hakim is meant to be funny but his appearances are mostly very awkward and uncomfortable.

The larger problem however is the game’s portrayal of marriage. It Takes Two never takes the time to really get into May and Cody’s issues. Cody complains that May is never home and it seems like May resents Cody for not providing for the family the way she does but the things that break their marriage are never explored. Instead of being a marriage that collapses under the weight of serious problems their relationship seems like one that shouldn’t have ended in a marriage in the first place. Almost all they do is argue and while they may complement each other when things in the game are going well they’re quick to blame each other for any new issues that arise. Meanwhile the game continues to push the idea that all of this is solvable if they just learn to like each other again without ever digging into the more complex realities that arise in a long-term relationship. On the surface It Takes Two seems to want to explore complex ideas but it pivots away from them almost as soon as they arise.

It also doesn’t help that Cody and May are genuinely terrible people. Not only do they seem incapable of parenting their daughter knowing how each other thinks feels or spends their time or working out problems without immediately resorting to blaming one another they also do some genuinely terrible things. At one point the couple becomes convinced that to break the spell they’re under Rose needs to cry on them. They decide that the best way to make this happen is to murder Rose’s favorite toy elephant Cutie who like everything else in the world around them seems to have been brought to life by the spell animating the dolls Cody and May inhabit. When Cutie learns Cody and May plan to murder her she begs for her life but they’re determined. By the time they throw her to her death she’s lost an arm and an ear. Cody and May claim they feel bad about the whole thing but that doesn’t stop them from mutilating and murdering a living thing because they think it will help them. The scene is incredibly uncomfortable to play and highlights the inconsistency in It Takes Two’s writing which alternates between hopelessly naive and incredibly dark.

""The traditional platforming is great but what makes the gameplay in It Takes Two special are the unique abilities that each character gets in certain situations.""

Fortunately the gameplay fares much better. As I said before the game is co-op only requiring another person to join in via local vertical split-screen or online. I teamed up with my wife and we played the game on our couch but whatever you choose the game is split-screen so you can see what your partner is doing. The game starts off as a platformer with both characters having access to a spring jump double-jump and air dash ability. The platforming is both responsive and precise so you’ll feel confident as you take on everything from the easiest jumps to the most stressful gauntlets. As with Hazelight’s previous game A Way Out you’ll have to help one another out to progress. Sometimes that means flipping switches to open doors for your partner moving navigating splitting paths or moving around parts of the environment.

The traditional platforming is great but what makes the gameplay in It Takes Two special are the unique abilities that each character gets in certain situations. Early on Cody has nails that he can throw into wooden walls to hold things in place or create paths for May to swing across with the head of a hammer. Later May gains access to a pair of anti-gravity boots that let her walk up walls while Cody acquires a special belt that allows him to grow or shrink at will. At another point Cody gets a gun that can fire sap that sticks to environments and enemy wasps while May gets a matchstick gun that can detonate the sap.

As the game’s mechanics change so does the type of game that It Takes Two becomes. In the space-themed level it’s a puzzle-platformer that evokes bits of Super Mario Galaxy. In the section with the sap and matchstick guns it’s a third-person shooter. Later in a medieval section where Cody becomes a wizard and May takes the role of a knight it plays like Diablo. Sometimes the two players end up playing completely different games like the section in which Cody flies a plane through a nearby tree while May stares down the leader of the local squirrel militia in a Street Fighter-style piece of one-on-one combat.

""It Takes Two often feels like the best Nintendo games consistently introducing new mechanics and evolving their use in creative ways before testing the player’s mastery of them generally in a boss fight. After that they are discarded and never appear again.""

Just when you think the game is running out of ideas something else comes around the corner each with its own unique set of mechanics that is never repeated at any point in the game and all of it executed very well. It Takes Two often feels like the best Nintendo games consistently introducing new mechanics and evolving their use in creative ways before testing the player’s mastery of them generally in a boss fight. After that they are discarded and never appear again. It Takes Two shows repeated mastery of several genres and game mechanics and nothing ever overstays its welcome. None of the games are exceptionally deep but the sheer breadth of them means you’ll never be bored and It Takes Two always finds creative ways to make sure you’re communicating with your partner and working together.

The game’s environments are similarly creative. Players spend time in space on a pirate ship riding dinosaurs navigating a warzone climbing a tree and everything in-between. While each environment is clearly designed with a specific gameplay goal in mind there’s plenty of other pieces of the environment to interact with. There are also mini-games to find and play against your partner that include tug-of-war a Guitar Hero-esque rhythm game a shooting range a pair of battle tanks and more. Like every other bit of It Takes Two’s gameplay they’re a lot of fun and the game keeps score of who wins a loses so you can claim bragging rights.

The only problem with It Takes Two’s gameplay is that sometimes one character gets a more interesting ability or plays a more interesting segment than the other though these are generally few and far between. Generally both players have something interesting to do and most of the time the differences made me want to replay the game as the other character to see how it felt. Combine the game’s unbridled creativity and sheer variety with its excellent art design and wonderful music and It Takes Two is a joy to play.

"" Most games of this kind falter because they can’t tell when something is or isn’t fun and the poor sections overstay their welcome. Here the characters and story are what could have used both more attention and an editor.""

It Takes Two isn’t a long game; most players will finish it in 10-12 hours and it’s not particularly difficult either. Players have an unlimited number of lives and checkpoints are very generous. About the only you have to restart a section is if you and your partner both die at the same time. Even then most of the progress you’ve made will be preserved. It’s probably a good decision given how much of the game’s appeal is that something new is always around the corner but don’t come to It Takes Two looking for a challenge; it mostly isn’t there though that doesn’t stop it from being a blast to play especially with the right partner.

It really is a shame then that its story is so shallow and its characters so unlikeable. I know I was supposed to be rooting for Cody and May to make up get back together and regain their original bodies but I often found myself thinking that they deserved what was happening to them – which admittedly is kind of the point. They’re both intensely unlikeable people and objectively awful parents and it’s a shame that you have to deal with them to enjoy the rest of what It Takes Two has to offer. Most games of this kind falter because they can’t tell when something is or isn’t fun and the poor sections overstay their welcome. Here the characters and story are what could have used both more attention and an editor.

As poor as some of the storytelling choices are however it doesn’t stop It Takes Two from being an excellent co-op game whether you’re playing it on a couch or online. I just wish that I’d cared more about its characters and thought they might actually benefit from getting back together – and that Rose had left Dr. Hakim on the shelf where he belonged.

This market’s strength is impressive considering that of the top 5 stocks by market cap none are at all-time highs. Only two of them Google and Microsoft hit that mark over the last two months. Apple the biggest stock in the world is 16% below its peak in January.

If you break the S&P 500 into deciles by market cap you can see complete randomness into how far the median stock is from its 52-week high. This is a 180 from early in the pandemic where the only thing you needed to know about the condition of stock was its relative size. Small worst big best. It’s not that simple anymore.

The strongest stocks in today’s market are the ones most levered to the economic recovery. The median industrial stock for example is just 2.5% below its 52-week high. 36% of the members in this group closed at a 52-week high on Friday.

If you did nothing but look at a chart of every stock in the S&P 500 you would conclude that the economy was booming. Pull up a chart of Lennar or CSX or CAT or AA. Yes that Alcoa.

None of the aforementioned companies are considered glamour stocks. You wouldn’t find them trading with valuations sported by some of the high-flying tech companies.

If you sorted the market on a price-to-sales ratio you wouldn’t find any pattern. At least not until you got to the most expensive bucket. Those are where you’ll find the weakest names. But other than that the distance from a 52-week high seems to be completely random as far as valuation goes.

Another way of looking at a similar concept is to sort the buckets by their dividend yield. Again no pattern develops until you get to the stocks with low or no dividends. This is where you’ll find Twitter Tesla and Take-Two Interactive.

The stock market is in a very healthy place right now. 93% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average right now. The last time you saw a reading this high was 2013.

I continue to be impressed at the way sector rotation has kept this market afloat. If you told me 6 months ago that the momentum names would pause while industrial and materials lead us to a new phase of the bull market I wouldn’t have believed you.

The only reason to be concerned right now is that things might look too good. Not exactly a persuasive argument but I can understand this mentality. If you get nervous at all-time highs when the leadership is narrow and when it’s broad-based you’re going to have a difficult time making money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvaXQtdGFrZXMtdHdvL0hvd190b19CZWF0X3RoZV9WYWN1dW1fLV9Cb3NzX0d1aWRlX2FuZF9UaXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Beat the Vacuum - Boss Guide and Tips - It Takes Two Guide,"Welcome to the How to Beat the Vacuum page of the official IGN Wiki Guide and Walkthrough for It Takes Two on Xbox One Xbox Series X PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 and PC. Here we'll give you a detailed breakdown of how to defeat the Vacuum with step-by-step instructions screenshots and tips.

The Vacuum is the first boss fight of It Takes Two and it requires complete cooperation between you and your Player 2. When the fight begins the vacuum will chuck what are basically explosive mines at you. Dodge them and wait — eventually a platform will lift out of the ground. On top is a vacuum hose that can be aimed at the vacuum and on the ground floor is a vacuum that can be aimed around to suck up the explosive mines. One player must aim the top vacuum hose at the vacuum and the other must suck up the mines with the bottom hose. You can knock out about a fourth of the vacuum’s health each time you do this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvaXQtdGFrZXMtdHdvL0hvd190b19CZWF0X3RoZV9Ub29sYm94Xy1fQm9zc19HdWlkZV9hbmRfVGlwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Beat the Toolbox - Boss Guide and Tips - It Takes Two Guide,"This locks the arm into place. Cody must then shoot his other two nails into the two yellow pieces of wood along his arm. May must use these nails to traverse across his arm and attack his locks with her hammer on the other side. After destroying one the tool box will catapult May back to Cody.

This time the toolbox will pull a hole saw out and drill large holes into the platform both of you are on all while you’re dodging nails coming from the sky. After a couple of holes the drill saw will shoot out two horizontal saw blades and spin. Jump over these making sure to dodge the nails and avoid the holes.

After this the tool box’s arm will come for you again at which point you should repeat the above to have May reach the other side. She must destroy the second lock.

After a short cutscene May’s hammer will be slightly destroyed but the cutscene will place emphasis on a red and white can. Cody is going to need to shoot said can to make it explode. What’s going to happen is the tool box’s other arm will slam down onto the platform you’re on. Dodge it until it stays on the platform. Cody must stand on the hand section and May must hit the yellow circle to launch him into the air.

This will give him the vantage point to shoot at the red and white can.

It will take about three rotations of this to destroy the can and ultimately the toolbox. In between those times the toolbox will utilize two new moves: one sees a circular saw cut off parts of the platform you’re on effectively giving you less space to run around and the second will see the arm spin like a horizontal ferris wheel — jump over it to avoid taking damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvaXQtdGFrZXMtdHdvL0hvd190b19CZWF0X3RoZV9XYXNwX1F1ZWVuXy1fQm9zc19HdWlkZV9hbmRfVGlwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Beat the Wasp Queen - Boss Guide and Tips - It Takes Two Guide,"Dodge it or destroy it. Cody needs to look for the rails on the left or right side of the Wasp Queen. He must ride the rail to the backside of the Wasp Queen and shoot the two red Xs on its back with sap.

Then May must ride the same rail and shoot that sap to cause it to explode. This damages the Wasp Queen.

After taking out a third of its health the Wasp Queen will bring its butt up and shoot fire out of it. You can't dodge this nor can you jump over it: the only thing May and Cody can do is hop onto the rail and avoid confronting the fire altogether.

After this the Wasp Queen will unleash two swarms. A hammer swarm and another that creates a bar that swings right to left and left to right parallel with the arena floor. You’ll need to jump over that bar. Cody should focus his sights on the front of the Wasp Queen – there are two red Xs that need to be sapped up. When that happens May can shoot them to damage the Wasp Queen.

After half of the Wasp Queen’s health is gone it will perform a “bomb strike” of sorts. Essentially a mortar of wasps will hit the arena from above and a hexagon of wasps will expand outwardly from the impact point. Cody and May need to jump over it.

Multiple bombs will drop and after a while the bombs will become scissors — yes literal scissors — that you must run from."

Pushdown accounting is a bookkeeping method used by companies to record the purchase of another company. The acquirer’s accounting basis is used to prepare the financial statements of the purchased entity. In the process the assets and liabilities of the target company are updated to reflect the purchase cost rather than the historical cost.

This method of accounting is an option under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) but is not accepted under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting standards.﻿﻿

Key Takeaways Pushdown accounting is a method of accounting for the purchase of another company at the purchase price rather than its historical cost.

The target company’s assets and liabilities are written up (or down) to reflect the purchase price.

Any gains and losses associated with the new book value are “pushed down” from the acquirer’s to the acquired company’s income statement and balance sheet.

How Pushdown Accounting Works

When a company buys another company accountants must record the transaction in detail including the value of the assets and liabilities of the company that have been purchased. In pushdown accounting the target company’s assets and liabilities are written up (or down) to reflect the purchase price.

According to the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) the total amount that is paid to purchase the target becomes the target’s new book value on its financial statements.

Any gains and losses associated with the new book value are “pushed down” from the acquirer’s to the acquired company’s income statement and balance sheet. If the purchase price exceeds fair value the excess is recognized as goodwill which is an intangible asset.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

In pushdown accounting the costs incurred to acquire a company appear on the separate financial statements of the target rather than the acquirer.

It can be helpful to think of pushdown accounting as a new company that is created using borrowed money. Both the debt and the assets acquired are recorded as part of the new subsidiary.

Example of Pushdown Accounting

Say Company ABC decides to purchase its rival Company XYZ which is valued at $9 million.

ABC is purchasing the company for $12 million which translates to a premium. To finance its acquisition ABC gives XYZ’s shareholders $8 million worth of ABC shares and a $4 million cash payment which it raises through a debt offering.

Even though it is ABC that borrows the money the debt is recognized on XYZ’s balance sheet under the liabilities account. In addition the interest paid on the debt is recorded as an expense to the acquired company's balance sheet.

In this case XYZ’s net assets that is assets minus liabilities must equal $12 million and goodwill will be recognized as $12 million - $9 million = $3 million.

Under revised guidance in effect since late 2014 FASB has eliminated the percentage ownership rule. This means companies have the option to use pushdown accounting regardless of the size of their ownership stake.

Pushdown Accounting Requirements

Pushdown accounting was formerly mandatory when the parent acquired at least 95% ownership of another company. If the stake ranged between 80% to 95% pushdown accounting was an option. If the stake was smaller it was not permitted.

This has changed. Under new guidance in effect since late 2014 FASB has eliminated the percentage ownership rule. This means companies have the option to use pushdown accounting regardless of the size of their ownership stake.﻿﻿

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) changed its own rules to match the FASB guidance meaning public companies as well as private companies have the option but not the requirement to use pushdown accounting regardless of the ownership stake of the company purchased.﻿﻿

Advantages and Disadvantages of Pushdown Accounting

From a managerial perspective keeping the debt on the subsidiary's books helps in judging the profitability of the acquisition.

From a tax and reporting perspective the advantages or disadvantages of pushdown accounting will depend on the details of the acquisition as well as the jurisdictions involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vdHYvdHYtbmV3cy9hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWNoYW5uZWwtbmluZS1zdWZmZXJzLWN5YmVyLWF0dGFjay1kaXNydXB0aW9uLXRvLWxpdmUtYnJvYWRjYXN0cy00MTU3NDQxL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vdHYvdHYtbmV3cy9hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWNoYW5uZWwtbmluZS1zdWZmZXJzLWN5YmVyLWF0dGFjay1kaXNydXB0aW9uLXRvLWxpdmUtYnJvYWRjYXN0cy00MTU3NDQxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia’s Channel Nine Suffers Cyberattack Disruption to Live Broadcasts,"Australian broadcaster Channel Nine was the target of a cyberattack that saw the severe disruption of its live programming on Sunday with the network now investigating whether the hack of its systems was “criminal sabotage or the work of a foreign nation.”

Over the weekend hackers were able to bring down Nine’s news production and current affairs services across Australia for more than 24 hours with the network’s website also affected. Several shows suffered outages throughout Sunday including the popular morning show Weekend Today.

Local reports say Nine suffered the largest cyber attack on a media company in Australia’s history. The BBC reports that Australia’s parliament was also subject to a possible cyberattack on Sunday although it is unclear if the two attacks are connected.

The cyberattack on Nine has been described as sophisticated and deliberately aimed at crippling the news division. The network said it was cooperating with the Australian Cyber Security Centre to investigate but there are concerns that it may take weeks for production to return to normal.

In a news report on Nine’s website tech expert Fergus Hanson of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said the nature of the hack pointed to a government being responsible for the incident.

The BBC reports that the Australian government as well as several media groups and corporations from the country have been the target of state-backed hackers in recent years many of them linked to China. Relations between Australia and China are strained following a series of diplomatic spats.

More than a decade ago Casano worked for a nonprofit in Nicaragua and while there he developed a taste for the dragon fruit grown in the country. When he returned to New York City he couldn’t find the odd fruit with white flesh anywhere he looked. Casano decided to build a business importing dragon fruit after he “discovered an enormous opportunity for organic raw material.”

“Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere” he tells Inverse. “Most farmers cannot afford pesticides so the majority of these farms were ‘default’ organic. Until I launched Pitaya Foods all of the dragon fruit had been consumed locally. I thought if I could open the U.S. market to these farmers it could increase their income and improve their lives.”

THIS IS NIMBLE A SERIES WHERE BUSINESS OWNERS OPEN UP THEIR BOOKS AND LIVES TO INVERSE WITH HELPFUL TIPS ON HOW TO KEEP GOING.

The first step in launching Pitaya Foods? Helping the farmers gain USDA organic certification which would help the farmers financially while making his company’s products more appealing to an increasingly discerning customer base with the help of chief marketing officer and co-founder Ben Hiddlestone.

Dragon fruit has seen increasing popularity in the United States among the health-conscious crowd as its high in fiber nutrients and antioxidants. Typically people eat it raw in salads or in smoothies.

Since its founding the company has grown from sourcing produce from 10 growers in Nicaragua to 800 family-owned organic-certified farms in Brazil Peru Mexico and Vietnam. Pitaya Foods (pitaya is another name for dragon fruit) a certified B Corporation now sells frozen fruits smoothie packs and powders in more than 16000 retailers nationwide including Costco Kroger Publix Target and Whole Foods and juice bars such as Jamba Juice Playa Bowls and Nekter. It processed a whopping 10 million pounds of dragon fruit last year. And it’s also incorporated other fruits like jackfruit and acai into its product line.

In the Q&A below which has been edited for length and clarity the CEO and co-founder talks about how the company spends its money and its biggest expense that pays the most dividends.

Can you give us a rough overview of your revenues versus typical business operating expenses?

Corporate expenses are about 40 percent of gross revenue. Our travel and supply costs are high due to our business the standards we have for our products and relationships with our suppliers.

How do you track your money?

We use QuickBooks online. It is the simplest and easiest program for us to use.

What numbers do you look at to determine whether your business is doing well (for example revenues returning customers inbound inquiries)?

We are constantly looking at sales growth over the previous year sales velocity (units per store per week) promotional lift and more. This shows us how retailer sales are doing and consumer buying trends across the different varieties. It can also track how well a certain launch is doing.

In what situations do you dial back spending or increase it?

We usually dial up marketing and run promotions whenever we launch a new item as well as when we have a positive ROI in digital retail and foodservice. We definitely dialed up our marketing and trade spends last year when we expanded our portfolio and wanted to build more awareness for new varieties. We also strive to support new retailer relationships and availability so we will target spends for that as well.

In tough times what’s the first expense you reduce or eliminate?

The nature of our business forces us to be really conservative with our capital so we don’t have big expenses we can cut that would make a big impact. Most of the fruit we purchase is only in-season four months out of the year and we need to purchase 12 months of inventory. Therefore most of our cash is tied up in inventory. It is the toughest part of our business but it keeps us honest and we think about every expense.

While starting out as just dragonfruit the Pitaya Foods brand has grown to incorporate other international fruits. Pitaya Foods

What’s an expense you can’t spare?

Gotta pay your people. This is a non-negotiable for us; our team is imperative to our brand and growth. Payroll is the first thing we take care of when it comes to expenses. Obviously another expense we can’t spare is our ingredients — without them we can’t create our products.

Where do you draw the line between business expenses and investing in your business?

We believe every dollar or any time spent to further build upon our initial brand mission of sustainability quality and overall health is an investment in our brand. Our assistance in getting organic certifications for the small family farms in Nicaragua our B Corp certification and our Foreign Supplier Verification Programs are investments and we don’t see them as business expenses.

Since we launched the brand we have helped more than 600 small family farms in Nicaragua get their organic certification. In 2019 we created 1079 smallholder farmer jobs 229 female organic farmer jobs and 174 factory operator jobs (46 percent of operators are female).

What’s an unusual expense that you believe adds value to your company?

Happy Hour! It is important for us to have a good company culture so we always have to spend money on that. It creates a solid company culture and friendly work environment.

What was the biggest expense that ended up paying the biggest dividends?

We source our fruits from all over the world so it is always great to bring employees to the source so they understand who our company supports and why we invest so much in a quality supply chain. The team is always re-energized after a trip like that and it helps them further believe in our mission.

What's a line item on your budget that makes your business uniquely your business?

A lot of travel expenses to a lot of exotic countries to meet with suppliers. Our farmers and producers are a crucial part of our project. We work with them directly and meet with every one of them face to face to ensure that the farms we source our fruit from are kept clean that the fruit is of the best quality possible and working conditions are good for everyone involved.

What personal sacrifices have you made on behalf of your business?

I love my job and team so much that I feel like I really haven’t sacrificed too much. My wife and I started the business together so we got to spend a lot of time together. This business has given me more on a personal and professional level than I have had to sacrifice. My work friends are also my weekend friends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jdXJyZW50LWFmZmFpcnMvcGFyLXBhbmVsLWFza3MtbW5yZS10by1pbmNyZWFzZS1zb2xhci1jYXBhY2l0eS10YXJnZXQtdW5kZXItY3BzdS1zY2hlbWUtMTIxMDMyODAwMjkxXzEuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY3VycmVudC1hZmZhaXJzL3Bhci1wYW5lbC1hc2tzLW1ucmUtdG8taW5jcmVhc2Utc29sYXItY2FwYWNpdHktdGFyZ2V0LXVuZGVyLWNwc3Utc2NoZW1lLTEyMTAzMjgwMDI5MV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Par panel asks MNRE to increase solar capacity target under CPSU scheme,"A parliamentary panel has asked the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) to increase the capacity addition target under the scheme for setting up grid-connected solar projects by CPSUs and to take pro-active steps to encourage more participation from these units.

MNRE is implementing the scheme for setting up grid-connected solar PV power projects by central public sector undertakings (CPSUs) and government organizations with Viability Gap Funding (VGF).

As per the scheme these projects are implemented with domestically manufactured solar cells and modules.

""Target under the scheme for setting up of grid-connected solar PV power projects by CPSUs and government organizations should be increased.

""Since only a few CPSUs have participated in the scheme till date the Ministry should take pro-active steps and encourage more CPSUs/government organizations to participate in the scheme"" said Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy in its 17th report tabled in Parliament earlier this month.

On providing VGF under the scheme MNRE explained that VGF provided under the scheme envisages to cover cost difference between domestically-produced solar PV cells and modules and the imported ones.

MNRE has also submitted that under CPSU Scheme Phase-II there is no concept of quoting of tariffs and the bidders are required to quote VGF the maximum permissible limit for which is Rs 70 lakh/MW.

Under Phase-I of the scheme of 1000 MW nine CPSUs participated. These are NTPC BHEL Rashtriya Ispat Nigam NHPC ONGC GAIL  Scooters India Dadra & Nagar Haveli Power Distribution Corporation and NLC India.

Under CPSU Scheme Phase-II of 12000 MW seven CPSUs/ government organizations have participated so far. These are NHDC Singareni Collieries Company Assam Power Distribution Company Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Nalanda University NTPC and Indore Municipal Corporation.

The panel also noted that the target set for solar rooftops cannot be achieved without proper implementation of the Net/Gross Metering and there is a need to maintain uniformity in terms of regulations/model operating procedures/online unified portals etc.

It noted that all the State/Joint Electricity Regulatory Commissions have issued net metering regulations/tariff orders but there is lack of uniformity in this regard.

It observed that in most of the states and Union territories there is no proper payment mechanism for excess units exported to the grid and the same are generally adjusted in the electricity bill itself.

After analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of both the arrangements the ministry should ensure proper implementation of Net/Gross Metering arrangements in the country through consultations with all the stakeholders so that both distribution companies (DISCOMs) as well as the consumers get a fair deal it suggested.

The panel found that the targets set with respect to solar rooftop are extremely unrealistic as compared to actual achievements.

It rued that since 2015-16 till date the ministry has never been able to cross the figure of 500 MW installed solar rooftop capacity in any year even as an exaggerated and unrealistic target of 17000 MW has been set to be achieved in just nine months of 2022-23 (April to 31 December 2022).

The committee opined that given the performance of the ministry in this sector till date the rooftop solar target of 40GW by 2022 is highly unlikely to be achieved with the present pace of progress.

The panel noted that out of the assistance provided by the MNRE only 1948 MW of solar power rooftop could be installed in more than five years (from April 1 2015 to June 30 2020).

The phase II of the grid-connected rooftop solar programme was approved in February 2019 with a target of achieving cumulative capacity of 40000 MW from Rooftop Solar (RTS) projects by the year 2022.

However the panel noted that against the annual target of 3000 MW only 472 MW could be achieved during 2019-20 while still higher targets have been set for subsequent years that is 2020-21; 2021-22 and 2022-23 (up to 31 December 2022) such as 6000 MW 12000 MW and 17000 MW respectively.

It suggested that MNRE should widely advertise the benefits of having rooftop solar power system and also about the incentives being provided by the government for the same in all vernacular print and electronic media so as to spread awareness among the masses.

It also suggested that a Single Window Clearance System should be put in place in the first phase in all district headquarters in the country to provide all assistance/services/information to the customers and facilitate them in getting rooftop solar system installed in hassle-free manner.

The panel is of the view that the process of subsidy disbursement should be made transparent simpler and faster through the Single Window Clearance System and preferably a digital platform be developed for this purpose to reduce human contact in the process.

It recommended that the ministry may consider providing subsidy based on income criteria with a view to offering a higher subsidy for the customers in lower income group.

The ministry needs to draw a time bound plan across all states and Union Territories by which solar rooftop system should be installed on all government buildings it added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy9icGNsLXNlbGxzLTU0LTE2LXN0YWtlLWluLW5ybC10by1vaWwtNC00LXRvLWVpbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTcxNDA0My5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3MvYnBjbC1zZWxscy01NC0xNi1zdGFrZS1pbi1ucmwtdG8tb2lsLTQtNC10by1laWwvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxNzE0MDQzLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BPCL sells 54.16% stake in NRL to OIL; 4.4% to EIL,"NEW DELHI: Privatisation-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) on Friday said it has sold its entire 61.5 per cent stake in Numaligarh Refinery in Assam to a consortium of Oil India Ltd and Engineers India and government of Assam for Rs 9876 crore.OIL bought a 54.16 per cent stake to raise its shareholding in the refinery to 80.16 per cent the company said in stock exchange filings.Its partner Engineers India Ltd (EIL) bought a 4.4 per cent stake and the balance 3.2 per cent was acquired by Government of Assam.The sale of Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) clears the way for privatisation of India's second-largest fuel retailer.In keeping with the Assam Peace Accord the government had decided to keep NRL in the public sector.

Today engineers are given the luxury (and perhaps the burden) of having a plethora of different transistors at their disposal—whether they be conventional silicon SiC GaN or others.

A comparison of different semiconductor options available. Image used courtesy of Messina et al's ""first and euRopEAn siC eigTh Inches pilOt line"" (REACTION) project via ResearchGate. [accessed 26 Mar 2021]

With all of these options a process as fundamental as component selection can slow down a design cycle. Once an engineer chooses the type of transistor to use then he or she must choose from a number of different brands and materials.

Now UnitedSiC has released a calculator tool that allows engineers to more easily pick a FET for their designs without simulating or bench testing through a number of options.

A New SiC Tool

UnitedSiC is hoping to streamline the selection process with a new tool called the FET-Jet Calculator.

This calculator is a free online tool that helps designers select a device by comparing the performance of SiC FETs for different applications and topologies as well as environmental and electrical parameters.

UnitedSiC asserts that the calculator helps predict system performance without some of the tedious hands-on testing processes. Some of the metrics calculated include:

Overall efficiency

Component losses (dynamic and conduction contributions)

Junction temperatures

Current stress levels

The tool will also issue a warning if a resulting voltage is higher than the rating of a given part.

How It Works: FET-Jet Features

After trying the calculator it seems to be a very useful tool with an array of features.

The tool is an application-based component finder where right off the bat you’re asked to choose what application you’re looking to create—either AC/DC DC/DC or DC/DC isolated. Once your application is chosen you’re prompted to select what specific topology you’re using. For example within AC/DC applications you can select between PFC TPPFC Vienna and two-level voltage source inverter topologies.

You can then select your desired input parameters including power rating switching frequency heatsink temperature as well as topology-specific parameters.

The calculator will then output values for peak currents losses per FET losses per diode total losses and efficiency. Then with all of this information calculated it will offer you UnitedSiC FETs and diodes for your application given the input parameters and topology you entered.

One consideration however before using this calculator for SiC FET is whether the component you want to use should be SiC or silicon.

Silicon vs. SiC

In many ways SiC blows silicon out of the water concerning performance.

SiC is considered a wide-bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap that can reach up to 3.3eV instead of ~1.2eV for silicon. On top of this SiC exhibits higher hole and electron mobility values than Si. As a result of these two characteristics SiC can withstand much higher voltages with a breakdown voltage of 600 V and exhibit higher efficiency due to faster switching speeds and lower R DS(on) .

With so many seemingly superior options on the market one might question why you would ever use conventional silicon transistors.

The real strength of silicon is that it has been around the longest. The result of this is that the industry has made silicon products very accessible and affordable. If your application can afford a lower-performing transistor then silicon may be the best bet for the sake of cost and mitigating concerns about component availability.

UnitedSiC is not the only company offering tools for FET selection. EPC offers a tool for filtering GaN FETs ROHM has a similar tool for MOSFET selection specifically for synchronous rectification DC/DC converters and TI has a FET loss calculator for synchronous buck converter applications.

Being able to quickly and accurately choose your application's suitable component is crucial to a successful design. How do you typically compare FETs during the design process? Do you utilize tools like this one? Share your methods in the comments below.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Like his four-wheeled namesake the star of several Disney films he has a mind of his own and a flair for grabbing attention. He is in a high-stakes race in which he is seen as the underdog. And his main rival Tesla’s Elon Musk is a “frenemy” with whom occasionally he banters. Investors are salivating: during the past month the German giant’s share price has surged by 60% while Tesla’s has slipped. That is mainly because of a change of heart about which of the two will win the electric-vehicle ( EV ) contest. Investors have it seems caught “The Lo EV Bug”.

It is a spectacular turnaround. For most of last year the EV ambitions of one of the world’s biggest carmakers looked like a smokescreen to hide the lingering fallout of the five-year-old Dieselgate-emissions scandal bloated costs and fractious relations between Mr Diess and organised labour. But then Volkswagen’s boss pulled off two coups. First he won the full backing of the supervisory board ending the showdown with unions. This may enable him to improve lacklustre profit margins. Second he sought to out-meme Mr Musk. He used shareable videos Twitter and a virtual “Power Day” to wow the underdog-loving retail investors that helped drive Tesla’s market value to $800bn last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ5Njc0MC90ZXNsYS1kaXNwdXRlZC1lZG11bmRzLXRlc3RzLXJlc3VsdHMv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9pbnNpZGVldnMuY29tL25ld3MvNDk2NzQwL3Rlc2xhLWRpc3B1dGVkLWVkbXVuZHMtdGVzdHMtcmVzdWx0cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Disputed Edmunds Tests Edmunds Did Them Again: See The Results,"Edmunds achieved more than making huge waves in the media when its real-world EV range tests revealed no Tesla could match its EPA range. It got Tesla to contact it something that does not happen often since the company killed its PR department. Tesla disputed the results arguing that the cars should be run until they were not able to move anymore. Edmunds accepted the challenge and did new tests on a track. Tesla will hate the results.

The automaker’s main argument was that there is a battery buffer that should have been considered to achieve the EPA range. Since that buffer is also present in other vehicles Edmunds also took them to the test track in the Mohave desert. All cars were run by all test drivers at the same temperatures.

Besides a Model Y Performance a Model 3 Standard Range Plus and a Model 3 Long Range Edmunds also put a VW ID.4 First Edition and a Ford Mustang Mach-E AWD Extended Range to the test.

The test consisted of driving all the cars at 65 mph (105 km/h) on a 7.5-mile-long closed-course oval. When these cars reached zero charge Edmunds started counting how much further they could run with the battery buffer at the set speed. When they were no longer able to run at 65 mph they were driven until they could no longer move.

The Tesla vehicles run 10.3 miles to 22 miles more after reaching zero charge on the dashboard under 65 miles. They were the three EVs to have more range left after that point. When the EVs could not maintain that speed anymore the Model Y Performance lost its place in the ranking to the ID.4. While the VW ran 12.9 mi the Model Y ran 12.6 mi.

Although those are interesting numbers Edmunds had to add them to what the vehicles had achieved on the track.

Only one of the Teslas tested at the Mohave desert could reach its EPA range. It was the Model 3 Long Range which achieved 343 mi. Its official EPA range is 353 mi which will certainly sound strange. Technically speaking it did not reach its official range. Edmunds must have considered a percent difference as acceptable to say it did hit its EPA range.

The others wouldn’t get there even if Edmunds counted the buffer and was indulgent with their numbers. Doing that the Model Y Performance would reach 263 mi of range against an EPA range of 291 mi. The Model 3 Standard Range Plus would achieve 232 mi instead of the 250 its EPA range promises. Although the Model 3 Performance was not at the test track it would get 256 mi a lot less compared to its 310-mi EPA number.

To make matters even more complicated Edmunds took the Model Y Performance and the Model 3 Long Range to its real-world EV range test loop and the cars run even less than they did on track after reaching zero charge and driving to a halt. It should be right the opposite.

According to what Tesla engineers told Edmunds their cars have no defined buffer which is a factor to consider in this case. We have already mentioned that Tesla works with a virtual battery buffer on April 13 2020. The other ones would be ambient temperature driving style and instantaneous conditions. The only part that makes sense is the variable buffer.

As Alistair Weaver stresses in the video what this shows is that you can’t just rely on government figures. We have gone even further than Edmunds’ editor-in-chief when we recommended that EVs have specific testing rules that take them into full consideration and are able to determine how energy-efficient they really are.

A Tesla owner has found himself in the middle of a battle worth over $100000 in property damages after his Model 3 Performance crashed while being driven out of a valet parking garage. Despite being in the right and having the evidence to back up his claims the Tesla owner has ended up in an uphill battle that could last for some time.

From Routine to Horror

It was supposed to be a routine process. After having his Model 3 parked at a multi-story garage the Tesla owner asked for his vehicle to be returned to him. A valet then went on to retrieve the Model 3 from its parking spot. A Teslacam video of the valet driving the vehicle showed that everything seemed normal despite the parking garage employee driving a bit fast in such a cramped space.

Moments later the Tesla owner was shocked as part of the parking garage’s second-floor walls came crashing into the sidewalk below. Images taken by the electric car owner after the incident revealed that a vehicle had been partly pushed through the parking garage’s brick walls. Fearing the worst the Tesla driver ran up to check on the valet and his Model 3.

What he saw confirmed his fears. Smashed against two vehicles was his blue Tesla Model 3 Performance its front end crushed as it collided with other parked cars.

Unintended “Autopilot” Acceleration

As the valet stumbled out of the Model 3 he promptly claimed that the Tesla suddenly engaged Autopilot and drove itself into the other vehicles. The valet was not joking.

While those inexperienced with Tesla’s tech may find it easy to blame Autopilot to avoid accountability when something terrible happens those familiar with the driver-assist system know that Autopilot could not be engaged in a number of places. One of these is of course a multi-story parking garage. The Model 3 owner then knew something was amiss when the valet told him that “Autopilot” suddenly drove the Tesla into the other vehicles.

The parking garage company claimed innocence by stating that the incident was caused by “unintended acceleration” on the Model 3’s part. The company refused to budge and the Tesla owner decided to fight all the way. Being familiar with how Tesla stores its vehicles’ data the Model 3 owner decided to gather so much evidence that there will be no way his insurance company could lose the case.

The Hunt for Evidence

In cases such as these which involve a party claiming unintended acceleration through “Autopilot” it is always best to have a Tesla’s Event Data Recorder (EDR) report. The EDR is like the car’s black box recording everything that has happened in the vehicle. Everything from the driver’s weight the vehicle’s speed which pedals were pressed and how far they are pressed could all be determined in the EDR report. The Model 3 owner then contacted Tesla for help in retrieving his car’s records.

Much to his chagrin Tesla refused citing legal reasons because he lives outside of California. In a statement to YouTube channel Wham Baam Teslacam the Model 3 owner remarked that he is not really sure why Tesla refused his request though he thinks that if it were his lawyer that contacted the electric car maker the results would have been different. Disappointed but not deterred the Model 3 owner ended up hiring an EDR technician to retrieve his Tesla’s report. The move cost him $1300.

The EDR report was damning. A look at the data from the Model 3 showed that the valet was not even wearing a seatbelt while operating the Tesla. The vehicle was also moving reasonably fast for a car being driven out of a multi-story parking garage. But even more importantly the EDR showed that the valet had applied 100% pressure on the accelerator and 0% pressure on the brake pedal all the way up to the crash. With this data the Model 3 owner figured that he could ultimately prove that the parking garage’s unintended acceleration claim was untrue.

Denying Evidence

But despite the mountain of evidence provided by the EDR report the parking garage company decided to dig their heels in the sand and stand by their claim of unintended acceleration. The Model 3 owner’s insurance company has paid out on the multiple claims for the damages that resulted from the incident and have pledged to reimburse him after litigation is finished. But that process could take quite a while.

The incident resulted in $24000 worth of repairs to the Model 3 Performance. Adding on the damages for the other vehicles involved in the incident and the actual damages to the multi-story building itself the total cost of property damage from the crash is estimated to be far beyond $100000.

Ultimately the Tesla owner’s experience with the parking garage highlights two notable things. One parking garages and valets should know that it’s tough to lie about what one does in a Tesla since data from the EDR would most definitely show the truth. And second Tesla’s service has a lot of space for improvement so owners who approach the company for help after such a harrowing aggravating incident would not be turned away. An EDR request especially one by an owner involved in an accident is better off approved after all.

Covid-19 Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall,"A six-decade-old invention the lowly chip has gone from little-understood workhorse in powerful computers to the most crucial and expensive component under the hood of modern-day gadgets.

That explosion in demand—unexpectedly goosed during the Covid-19 pandemic for certain industries like smartphones and PCs—has caused a near-term supply shock triggering an unprecedented global shortage.

In February lead times—the duration between when an order for a chip is placed and when it actually gets filled—stretched to 15 weeks on average for the first time since data collection started in 2017 according to industry distributor data from Susquehanna Financial Group. Lead times for Broadcom Inc.—a barometer for the industry because of its involvement across the supply chain—extended to 22.2 weeks up from 12.2 weeks in February 2020.

The crunch has sideswiped the General Motors and Volkswagens of the world and swung politicians from Washington to Beijing into crisis control. It’s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia’s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world’s most advanced silicon yet don’t have the capacity to sate all demand. It’s a bottleneck that could last several quarters—or into next year.

Alarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production—potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a “serious imbalance” globally the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were “willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.” And on Friday Nio Inc.—the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla—became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.

A Pandemic that Reshaped Demand

Overall demand for semiconductors of all stripes—from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors—has grown over the past decade as smartphone usage and computing power boomed. A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019 but was then boosted 5.4% by 2020’s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets IDC data shows.

At the same time once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics which may include everything from displays to in-car systems are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030 according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.

On the other end of the supply chain chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years according to SEMI data suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online—a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.

Industry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits) required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics but are in a short supply at the moment.

Installed capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents 24M 12 0 2010 2015 2020 Source: SEMI

Uncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That’s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.

Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

The problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade—making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.

Industry Bottlenecks

The most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these “fabless” companies don’t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.

This is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication—TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals California-based Globalfoundries Inc. controlled by Abu Dhabi’s investment arm and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia the lion’s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea home to TSMC and Samsung respectively.

An opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp. which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel the largest chipmaker by revenue designs and manufactures its own chips but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.

Asia’s Game Companies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower Hua Hong VIS SMIC $1.1B PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 UMC $1.6B Globalfoundries $1.5B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Taiwan South Korea U.S. China Israel Samsung $4.0B TSMC $12.9B revenue estimate for Q1 2021 Global- foundries $1.5B UMC $1.6B Tower VIS SMIC $1.1B Hua Hong PSMC DB HiTek Note: Estimates as of February.

TSMC is the undisputed leader of that triumvirate in terms of sheer scale sophistication and reach cranking out millions of wafers every year for marquee clients in just about every industry imaginable. TSMC’s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020 up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan’s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.

According to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates 25% of all TSMC’s business comes from Apple the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However TSMC’s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world’s biggest consumer electronics communications equipment and auto parts companies.

Supply Chain Bottleneck TSMC manufactures chips for chip designers and semiconductor firms  which in turn supply major makers of consumer electronics and cars Note: The graphic captures only a subset of publicly-disclosed customers for TSMC and for its direct partners. Cost values are on a quarterly basis. Source: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources

Bottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software a segment led by the U.S.’s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.

Officials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan’s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn’t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly—regardless of where it is located.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvYW5hbG9nLWRldmljZXMtMjEtYmlsbGlvbi1tYXhpbS1idXktc2V0LWZvci1ldS1hcHByb3ZhbC1zb3VyY2UvODE3MTc3NTDSAX1odHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9hbmFsb2ctZGV2aWNlcy0yMS1iaWxsaW9uLW1heGltLWJ1eS1zZXQtZm9yLWV1LWFwcHJvdmFsLXNvdXJjZS84MTcxNzc1MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analog Devices' $21 billion Maxim buy set for EU approval: Source,"Advt

In this short video Dave McKeegan explains the practical scientific reasons that curved sensors make more sense than conventional flat ones and discusses why this groundbreaking shift might not happen in the very near future. In addition if and when they come to market the transition might be slow especially when you consider that entirely new systems will need to be designed and manufacturers prefer to wait around 30 years before launching a brand new lens mount — especially one that will have no backwards compatibility.

The Petzval field curvature inherent to today’s lenses — i.e. the curved image plane — isn’t the only difficulty posted by flat sensors by the way. Colors have different points of focus which lens manufacturers are constantly trying to correct.

While chatting to engineer and camera guru Dave Haynie he suggested that one option to achieve interchangeable lenses is to bundle the lens and the sensor together as seen with the Ricoh GXR released back in 2009. Given that the cost of sensors is constantly falling this might not be such an outlandish idea.

The PC was widely fitted with either 5.25″ or 3.5″ disk drives but other formats such as the older 8″ discs were not a fixture in the 16-bit desktop computing world. It’s something [Jozef Bogin] has taken aim at with his exploits in connecting a variety of 8″ drives to a PC.

In the early 1970s there were a variety of different 8″ drive standards that weren’t all entirely compatible but a de facto standard emerged as clones of the Shuggart drives used by IBM. It’s a modified version of this interface that can be found in a PC floppy controller. While there is enough electrical compatibility to connect the two there remains a variety of connectors used on the drives. There are also a wide range of power supplies with drives requiring 5 12 and 24 volts and some of them even requiring AC mains with different versions for 50Hz and 60Hz mains frequencies.

With an 8″ drive hooked up to a PC how might DOS or even older Windows versions interface with it? To that end he’s created a piece of software called 8format which not only allows 8″ disks to be formatted for the PC but also provides a driver that replaces the BIOS floppy settings for these drives. This doesn’t work for imaging disks from other older platforms but he provides pointers to more capable floppy controllers for that.

If these drives interest you there’s more to be gleaned from a tale of interfacing them with 8-bit retrocomputers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAzLTI4L2hlcmUtcy1ob3ctdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1pcy1wbGF5aW5nLW91dC1mb3Itc3RvY2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How the World's Chip Shortage Is Playing Out for Stocks,"A global semiconductor shortage has upended the supply of everyday devices from smartphones to gaming consoles to tech-dependent cars.

Why is it in the US sanction list ?,"Size of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is gigantic !

With more than 100 subsidiaries and 23 listed companies AVIC has over 450000 employees – more than America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus combined.

Avic is “of high strategic importance to China’s national defence and acts as the backbone of the country’s military and civilian aviation manufacturing industry” according to Fitch Ratings.

What is it's scope in aviation business ?

The firm is into products for military use as well as for the civil aviation market. It's subsidiaries manufacture some of China’s leading fighter aircraft such as the J-10 J-11 and J-20.

It is a major supplier of aero components for China's small regional jet ARJ-21 and C919 a narrow body medium-haul aircraft. It also exports products abroad including its regional turboprop MA60 series Y12s and the AC series helicopters.

What are the aspirations ?

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) is the face of china in aviation it is infact responsible for China’s plan to become technologically self-reliant and become a key supplier for the homegrown commercial aircrafts that Beijing wants to export to the world.

Dominance !

Yes Avic is at the forefront it plays a dominant role in research and development operations manufacturing and financing in China’s aviation industry.

It has a monopoly on military aircraft manufacturing and maintenance and is the third-largest shareholder of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) the manufacturer of

C919 aircrafts which is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.

Though Avic only holds around 12.35% share in Comac it has an “outsize influence on Comac’s operations. Much of Comac’s original leadership employees facilities and technology came from Avic.

International Presence :

Avic and its subsidiaries have been buying overseas aviation-related assets and technology and the company has a number of joint ventures with foreign firms including with GE Aviation in avionics and Honeywell Aerospace in flight control systems.

The sanctions :

Avic’s overseas ventures started raising concerns for washinton DC in recent years as bilateral relations between the USA and China took a downward development.

Beijing’s strategy of “military-civil fusion” – the policy that aims to use civil technology to strengthen its military capacity and development was seen a challenge.

In December 2020 seven of Avic's subsidiaries entered on the 'US Commerce Department’s list of Chinese companies' with alleged military ties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNTA4MzA3NTQvY2hpcC1tb25nLWdyb3VwLXB1cmNoYXNlcy1maXJzdC1iZWxsLTQyOS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWluLWNhbWJvZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chip Mong Group purchases first Bell 429 helicopter in Cambodia,"Chip Mong Group purchases first Bell 429 helicopter in Cambodia

TRUSSVILLE — Tractor Supply Company (TSC) the nation’s largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores is opening a new location in Trussville.

The store will go into part of the former location of Kmart in the Trussville Shopping Center off Chalkville Mountain Road. Mayor Buddy Choat said TSC will be in the gardening side of the location. Ollie’s will be another store at the location and a third spot will also be available in the large building.

The spot has been vacant for years as city leaders and Aronov the company that manages the shopping center have been hoping for a tenant. Aronov has been in talks about remodeling the center but no plans have been released.

TSC has over 1800 stores including Moody Gardendale and Chelsea. The stores supply basic maintenance products for homes land pets and animal owners. Products include clothing equine and pet supplies tractor/trailer parts and accessories lawn and garden supplies sprinkler/irrigation parts power tools fencing welding and pump supplies riding mowers and more.

The Trussville store is expected to open in late June 2021.

The old Kmart will be split into three businesses and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet will also operate out of the building. A third possible business for the old Kmart is Crunch Fitness. The company has been in discussions about moving into the spot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIxLzAzLzI4L3NxdWF0dGVycy1pbnZhZGUtbW9uLWphbG91eC1mb3JhZ2UtZmFybS1pbi1jdW51cGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Squatters invade Mon Jaloux forage farm in Cunupia,"Squatters invade Mon Jaloux forage farm in Cunupia

Illegal farmers have taken over almost a third of the 366-acre Mon Jaloux forage development centre in Cunupia which was once used to provide a steady supply of freshly cut Tanner grass to animal farmers.

Although the Office of the Commissioner of State Lands has taken many of the illegal occupiers to court the matters have either been thrown out for lack of prosecution or are stalled in a bureaucratic process.

The slow pace of decisive action has only encouraged more squatters to move in.

The forage farm which was previously owned by Caroni (1975) Ltd to provide feed for their dairy and mutton farms was restarted by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2012.

In the nine years the farm was left abandoned many of the assets were stolen or fell into disrepair.

Last week president of the Cattle Farmers Association Chris Medford advocated for the abandoned lands at Mon Jaloux to be once again put into production to help farmers who are buckling under the steep increases in imported feed as much as 14 per cent this year.

He said that was one way to reviving the livestock industry from total collapse as more farmers were selling out their animals to butchers and hanging up their boots.

Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture Avinash Singh also said then that contrary to the farmers' claims the Mon Jaloux farm was providing farmers with forage on a regular basis and more people were showing an interest in livestock farming or expanding their farms.

Manager of the Mon Jaloux farm Nigel Singh says the vision of the project was to supply a readily available nutritious source of forage and legumes to animal farmers especially in the harsh dry seasons.

He once managed a team of over 25 workers and had three functioning tractors to harvest tonnes of grass. His assets have now shrunk to just one functioning tractor and a team of six workers.

Singh said on average about 50 farmers collect forage from the farm monthly which is given free of charge and believes that if the farm can charge a nominal fee the money can help to off-set some of the operational costs.

Another forage farm La Gloria Estate in Moruga consisting of 6000 acres which was also acquired by the ministry when Caroni closed in 2003 is no longer producing grass to farmers.

""We have a serious squatting problem. The squatters occupy close to 160 acres. I occupy about 140 acres. The rest is abandoned lands"" Singh said during an interview on Friday.

He recalled in 2017 the farm was at peak production but due to lack of funding over the ensuing years production fell.

Excavators once dug a 1.5 acre-wide retention pond to irrigate the grass banks in the dry season and there was equipment which compacted the grass into bales. Each acre produced at least 80 bales. And one bale could feed two cows or at least eight sheep.

But all that is left of that operation are photos. The pond is now overgrown and used by the squatting farmers to water their crops while other equipment is broken and stored in warehouses.

Singh said the idea behind the project was to create a co-operative with the animal farmers but that never got off the ground.

For the time being he said he will continue to keep the farm in operation and treat the only functioning tractor with kid's gloves to facilitate the farmers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc29sYWNlYmFzZS5jb20vZW1pci1vZi1kYXVyYXMtc29uLXdlZHMtYWdmcy1kYXVnaHRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emir of Daura's son weds AGF's daughter,"President Muhammadu Buhari has given his blessings to Muhammad Umar Faruk and Maimuna Ahmed Idris children of Emir of Daura Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk and Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) Ahmed Idris as they are joined in matrimony on Saturday.

A Staffordshire dairy farm has been chosen to supply milk to ice cream giant Ben and Jerry’s.

The Fentons who run a site at Garmelow near Eccleshall are one of only 12 farmers chosen nationally to supply to the global ice cream maker.

However plans to create a new slurry lagoon as part of their enterprise have sparked concerns.

They have submitted four applications to Stafford Borough Council seeking permission for a new milking parlour and dairy cubicle shed for cattle a silage clamp and excavation and embankments to form a slurry lagoon.

The final two applications have been called in by ward councillor Jeremy Pert for the council’s planning committee to discuss their impact on the environment local water courses and the neighbouring area.

And a local resident John Court also raised concerns about the proposed location of the slurry lagoon and silage clamp on land north of Kempsage Lane at Wednesday’s planning committee meeting.

Committee members heard that the Environment Agency and the lead local flood authority had not raised any objections in response to the details they had received.

Mr Court said: “Post-Brexit is a good time for brave new enterprises so good on them I say.

“But the Environment Agency were asked to consider the risk of flooding on high ground on the south side of Kempsage Lane which never floods. The flood map for the footprint of the lagoon on the north side of the lane shows medium to high flood risk.

“I’ve lived on Kempsage Lane for 49 years and seen the site flooded many times – even paddled my canoe on it. Had the flood risk maps been picked up on the proposal would have been stopped at that point.

“A lagoon the size of two Olympic swimming pools is to be built with earth sides just 750mm above the surface of the field. Only the clay lining of the lagoon is waterproof so soil saturated from outside will be compromised.

“Last month a storm left the footprint of the lagoon flooded to over welly-depth. Floods are likely to overwhelm the low sides of the lagoon mixing flood water with slurry and parlour washings.

“A toxic mix could find its way through the drain flowing under the lagoon. This is an ecological disaster waiting to happen. Can we risk that? There may be a safe site away from drains but this isn’t it.”

David Collier an agent who spoke in support of the application told the meeting the proposed slurry lagoon would be an essential component of the family dairy farm.

He added: “The Fentons started on a Staffordshire County Farm and progressed to another in Cheshire. Their establishment of this unit will represent progression everyone wants from the county farm system.

“Mr and Mrs Fenton have achieved many accolades in the dairy industry for animal health welfare silage and the quality of their cows. They were recently selected to supply milk to Ben and Jerry’s ice cream - one of only 12 farmers chosen nationally – for their attention to detail and high quality.

“They’re dedicated to farming and extremely passionate about feeding the nation as well as providing a future for their three sons. They’re keen to become part of the community and welcome anyone who wants to know about farming.

“They extensively researched the best possible design for the farm and after much consideration concluded that the proposal is ideal both environmentally and agriculturally.

""Particular care was required in regard to the proposed slurry lagoon as poorly constructed or managed lagoons can cause water pollution.

“The site for the proposed lagoon was chosen because it affords easy access to the fields minimising tractor traffic on the highway. It’s possible to work with the current field levels minimising landscape change.

“Soil analysis showed there was a good soil structure for the construction of a safe lagoon. It’s well away from the source protection zone overhead and underground cables high water table and wetter land elsewhere on the farm.”

Committee members approved the silage clamp application but voted to defer their decision on the slurry lagoon to allow further information on flood risks to come forward.",,,

View the current offers here.

Many seasoned travelers find planning the perfect flights and hotels just as thrilling as the trip itself. Chasing elite status is an addicting sport whether you're booking a mattress run to earn Hyatt Globalist status or scoring bonus perks by status matching from another brand.

Sign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more airline loyalty and travel news.

But less experienced travelers may find the world of points and miles overwhelming and infrequent travelers may just need a decent place to rest their heads at night.

If you typically spend fewer than 10 nights a year in hotel rooms it doesn't always make sense for you to chase status with most major hotel chains. Marriott Hyatt and Hilton all require 10 nights per year to earn entry-level elite status. (Hyatt and Hilton have reduced status-earning requirements to five nights for entry-level status in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.)

A number of hotel cobranded credit cards offer complimentary elite status such as the Hilton Honors credit cards from American Express. But if you're an infrequent traveler those perks may not benefit you much if you only stay a handful of nights each year or if you primarily visit destinations that don't have many hotels within that brand.

If you just want an easy way to earn rewards without going down the loyalty rabbit hole this guide is for you.

Simple tools for everyday travelers

Here at TPG we typically recommend that travelers book directly with hotels instead of third-party booking platforms like Expedia for a number of important reasons. Change and cancellation policies are less forgiving the discounts aren't always worth the hassle customer service can be a joke and getting a refund when needed can be well-nigh impossible.

All of those considerations are entirely valid and travelers should consider online travel agencies at their own risk. That being said there are many times when the benefits outweigh the concerns. And not all OTAs are created equal: Many of the major players such as Hotels.com are quite reputable at least for third-party sites.

If you're willing to consider booking through an OTA for perks you aren't limited to programs focused on hotels. Booking.com Expedia and Trip.com all offer unique benefits for travelers as well from opportunities for free breakfast and upgrades to rewards that can be redeemed for a wide variety of travel.

These are some of the best OTAs for hotel bookings:

Hotels.com offers one free night for every 10 nights stayed plus additional benefits for repeat customers.

Which travelers should book hotels through OTAs?

(Photo by @JulieK via Twenty20)

The following types of travelers may find the most value in booking with OTAs:

Infrequent travelers looking to maximize limited hotel stays

Infrequent travelers have the most opportunity to earn usable rewards when booking through sites like Hotels.com or Rocketmiles. These companies cater to people who don't really care about elite status or brand loyalty but still want to earn rewards.

""Most (casual) travelers won't stay enough to earn status or enough points for a free night"" said TPG points and miles editor Ariana Arghandewal. Instead she recommends programs like Hotels.com Rewards to save money and earn free nights based on a limited number of stays.

Travelers who don't care about hotel brands

Since tools like Hotels.com simply serve as the middleman between hotels and guests travelers can easily compare properties from multiple chains — as well as independent and alternative housing options — on a single platform.

""Hotels.com is actually my top pick for occasional travelers who aren't brand-loyal"" said Caroline Lupini travel analyst at Forbes Advisor. ""It's an easy way for travelers to benefit from their hotel stays especially if they don't really travel enough to benefit from hotel loyalty perks for any of the big brands.""

Travelers who don't need much customer support

Every so often you might just need a last-minute place to crash for the night. Perhaps you're getting sleepy on the road during a long road trip or need a cheap place near the airport to sneak a nap before a red-eye flight. In situations like these you aren't looking for special treatment like early check-in or turndown service; you just want the best deal that's available now.

App-based OTA HotelTonight is perfect in these types of situations. The tool is specifically designed to connect spontaneous travelers with hotels looking to sell last-minute vacancies on short notice. As a result travelers can often score significantly discounted rooms on same-day or near-future bookings at prices that aren't available elsewhere either on the hotel's website or through other third-party companies.

For example a same-day booking at the South Congress Hotel in Austin Texas would cost $280 before taxes and fees through the hotel website which conveniently shows a price comparison to major OTAs in the bottom right corner.

But HotelTonight offers the same room for just $196 per night before taxes and fees discounted from the same retail rate of $280 that's listed on the hotel website.

Uncertain travelers concerned about the coronavirus pandemic

Platforms like Hotels.com include bed-and-breakfasts as well as home and apartment rentals which may feel safer for travelers concerned about social distancing.

Vacation home rental sites like Airbnb also offer private homes for short-term rent but travelers looking for simplicity may prefer comparing hotels and private homes in a single platform.

Travelers who value independent or boutique properties

Travelers who want housing options beyond the major chains may find unique hotel options through sites like Hotels.com.

""Hotels.com Rewards is great for stays at boutique and independent properties"" said TPG senior writer Andrew Kunesh who updates The Points Guy's valuation guide on loyalty programs each month. ""Earning a free night every 10 nights keeps your options open since you're not linked to a single hotel chain. (Hotels.com) may not get you aspirational award nights but it's a surefire way to get a solid return on paid stays.""

Travelers with premium credit cards

TPG senior points and miles writer Katie Genter has a pro tip for travelers interested in boutique and independent hotels.

""It can be beneficial to get a mid-tier hotel credit card and then focus on that brand even if you travel infrequently"" said Genter who spent three years on the road as a digital nomad before the coronavirus pandemic.

Genter also recommends the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program or Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection for travelers who hold premium travel rewards cards such as The Platinum Card® from American Express or the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Hotels that participate in these programs offer cardholders elite-like perks such as breakfast upgrades and late checkout.

Some of these properties may not cost as much as you'd think: ""You can sometimes snag inexpensive stays in these programs"" Genter told TPG. ""I once stayed at the Loews Chicago Hotel using Amex's Fine Hotels & Resorts program and got $160 of food and drink included on a $153 stay.""

Maximize your earnings

Of course we would be remiss to leave out additional ways to boost your earning potential on OTA hotel bookings.

Use the right credit card

Since you aren't tied to a cobranded hotel credit card you'll do best to use your favorite travel card for bonus points per dollar spent. Here are some of our top picks for travel purchases:

The Platinum Card from American Express : Best for welcome offer.

Best for welcome offer. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card : Best for earning miles.

Best for earning miles. Chase Sapphire Preferred Card: Best travel credit card for beginners.

Best travel credit card for beginners. Chase Sapphire Reserve : Best for travel credits.

: Best for travel credits. Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card: Best for no annual fee.

Each of these cards offers more than one point per dollar you spend and many include additional benefits such as trip protection. In some cases as TPG's Katie Genter noted above you can even score bonus perks such as free breakfast.

Use a shopping portal when booking

Leveraging an online shopping portal is one of the easiest ways to score extra rewards. Using a cash-back or rewards portal allows you to ""triple dip"" on hotel bookings: You earn returns through the website you book with you earn points on your credit card and you earn bonus nights or free perks through your OTA of choice.

You can learn more about how to use shopping portals to your advantage here.

You can use gift cards

You can purchase gift cards for major OTAs such as Hotels.com in many supermarkets office supply stores and online. Not only does this form of payment make it easy to gift travel to yourself or others but it can also help you reach spending requirements for sign-up bonuses more quickly.

Read the fine print

Each program has its own limitations. For example your free night credits with Hotels.com are only worth the average of the 10 nights you paid for. If you spent $100 a night for 10 paid nights you won't get a $200-a-night room for free. Instead you'll get a $100 discount on the $200 room. Hotels.com also has several other important caveats: No free night credits for incomplete stays award nights and rooms booked at promotional rates.

And of course we would be remiss not to mention the biggest most important caveat of booking through OTAs once again: In case of emergency you'll often have far more trouble getting the help you need especially if you need to make any changes or cancellations on your third-party reservation.

Travel insurance

Of course travel insurance through a premium credit card can help protect you when booking OTA hotel stays. Not only do travel credit cards pay bonus points per dollar on travel purchases but they can also help you get your money back under qualifying circumstances.

You'll want to read the fine print very carefully when it comes to credit card trip protection especially where OTAs are involved. The minutia can make all the difference as to whether you can get support or your money back. If you're concerned about your OTA hotel purchase consider purchasing an independent travel insurance plan for additional protection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jcmltaW5hbC1qdXN0aWNlLzU0NTI2MS10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXBvbGljZS1saWFiaWxpdHkv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NyaW1pbmFsLWp1c3RpY2UvNTQ1MjYxLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtcG9saWNlLWxpYWJpbGl0eS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The future of police liability,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/545261-the-future-of-police-liability/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jcmltaW5hbC1qdXN0aWNlLzU0NTI2MS10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXBvbGljZS1saWFiaWxpdHkv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NyaW1pbmFsLWp1c3RpY2UvNTQ1MjYxLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtcG9saWNlLWxpYWJpbGl0eS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

There could be a fight about keeping it there however and if that happens Giancarlo Stanton expects to be a part of it.

After the Georgia state legislature passed a restrictive election reform bill the MLB Players Association is considering approaching the league about moving the game.

The head of the MLBPA Tony Clark recently told the Boston Globe players are “very much aware” of the bill.

“As it relates to the All-Star Game we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue’’ Clark told The Globe. “If there is an opportunity to we would look forward to having that conversation.”

Stanton said while he didn’t know all the specifics he believed it would be worthwhile to discuss the matter.

“That’s always gonna be an open conversation to get the best result for what makes the most sense’’ Stanton said Saturday from Steinbrenner Field. “It takes situations like this and topics like this to move forward and talk about it and get a game plan.”

Stanton became one of the faces of the sport’s fight against racial injustice last season in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis and said that wasn’t a hard decision for him.

Giancarlo Stanton Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

“It needed to be done’’ Stanton said of speaking out. “When things need to be done you don’t worry about the difficulties or hardships of it. You just figure out day-by-day how to get through it and what’s the best thing to do.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts who is in line to manage the National League team in the game following their World Series title told the Los Angeles Times he would consider skipping the game if nothing is done regarding the Georgia bill.

“If it gets to that point it’ll certainly be a decision I’ll have to make personally’’ Roberts said of the bill which would require a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail and reduce the time period people have to request an absentee ballot among other restrictions. “When you’re trying to restrict African-American votes — American citizens — that’s alarming to hear.”

In 2017 the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of Charlotte due to North Carolina’s House Bill 2 which limited anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ community.

In the coming months the MLB All-Star Game might become a point of contention over the possibility of playing the game in front of full capacity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vYXJvdW5kdGhlZm9naG9ybi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8yOC9zZi1naWFudHMtcGFibG8tc2FuZG92YWwtYXRsYW50YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SF Giants: Fan favorite Pablo Sandoval makes Atlanta's roster,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWl0YmFydC5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDMvMjgvd2Fwby1jb2x1bW5pc3QtY2FsbHMtZm9yLWdlb3JnaWEtdG8tbG9zZS1hbGwtc3Rhci1nYW1lLW92ZXItZWxlY3Rpb24taW50ZWdyaXR5LWxhdy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlaXRiYXJ0LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wMy8yOC93YXBvLWNvbHVtbmlzdC1jYWxscy1mb3ItZ2VvcmdpYS10by1sb3NlLWFsbC1zdGFyLWdhbWUtb3Zlci1lbGVjdGlvbi1pbnRlZ3JpdHktbGF3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WaPo Columnist Calls for Georgia to Lose All-Star Game Over Election Integrity Law,"Kevin B. Blackistone a journalism professor at the University of Maryland and former ESPN analyst is calling for the MLB to pull its All-Star Game from Georgia over the state’s new election integrity law.

In his March 28 Washington Post op-ed Blackistone insisted that sports have “given so much” to Georgia. However because the state is trying to prevent the chaos that occurred during its 2020 elections from happening again the columnist now wants the Peach State to “lose something.”

Blackistone praised Atlanta for having one of the first liberal activist mayors in the south and noted that the NBA gave the city a team a few years after Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. testified before Congress in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Since 1968 Atlanta has been the focus of much professional sports activity Blackistone says.

“In recent years Atlanta got a WNBA team an MLS club and two NHL franchises (though it lost both). It has hosted several Super Bowls Final Fours and those Olympic Games centered on that park off Allen Jr. Boulevard. It would have been the site of the 2020 Final Four but that event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic” he wrote.

But like most leftists Blackistone is furious that Georgia is attempting to prevent future election debacles by making changes in its election laws. And like most leftists Blackistone is mischaracterizing what those changes are.

Blackistone claims that Georgia is now “threatening the protections for Black Georgians” and so “until further notice what sports brought to Atlanta it should take away.”

The columnist was incensed when Georgia state troopers arrested a black Georgia State Rep. who tried to get herself on TV by screaming and yelling and pounding on the governor’s door to illicitly disrupt the bill-signing ceremony as he signed the election bill into law last week. Blackistone absurdly claimed that the arrest was somehow “mimicking the worst scenes of the old Jim Crow South.” Except of course that the woman arrested was a duly elected official and a black woman — something that could not have happened in the Jim Crow South.

Blackistone next pointed out that the leader of the MLB Players Association said that the union is hoping the league will entertain the idea of taking the All-Star Game away from the Braves’ stadium. Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts also said he may refuse to attend the game because of the state’s election law update.

The columnist then praised the WNBA for its combined effort to oust Georgia’s Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler from her seat and then from ousting her as an owner from the league. “That was using sports as an agent for social change” Blackistone crowed.

With that in mind Blackistone thinks that sports should turn against Georgia because he doesn’t like the state’s laws. Pro sports need to punish Georgia. “Sports” Blackistone concludes “should remind those elected Georgians — the ones acting to take the state back to an ugly yesteryear — right now” and take away what it has given the state.

And what to do with...,"Forgive me for asking questions which have probably been asked already but I can't find the specific answers to!



1. I am a US citizen residing and working in the UK since mid 2016. I didn't even know what an FBAR was until 2019 and so filed delinquent FBARs for 2017-2019. Other things consumed my life last year and I again forgot to file an FBAR for 2020. Should I file a delinquent one? At one point my checking account did have >$10000 because I had my house deposit saved. Am I going to penalized for filing late? I haven't been penalized for the previous late filed FBARs and just chose the 'I didn't know I had to file' for my reason but I am afraid of incurring penalties now because I did know but forgot this time! As for FATCA isn't this something I am supposed to receive from the bank or do I have to go and file that myself? I received one from my bank once but don't recall receiving it annually.



2. I have most of my accumulated wealth in US based mutual funds and stocks one traditional IRA and one SIMPLE IRA all of which I had before moving to the UK. I also still have a US checking account with a large bank. Thus far I have basically just kept all the money where it is and reported any investment income or money withdrawn when I file my US taxes. I use a family members' address for all these accounts. I was under the impression I could still keep all these accounts using a family members' address but that it is 'questionable' to make further contributions to them while I live abroad. For clarity I am not withdrawing from any retirement accounts yet. Can I transfer money using services like TransferWise to my US bank account and contribute money to the traditional IRA or mutual funds I have in the US if I want to or is this not legal in some way? Should I be reporting these accounts to the UK? (I wouldn't even know how)



3. I have a UK employer sponsored pension plan since 2018 (I think?). From what I can tell the contributions to this are not treated as income for the FEIE and it is not treated as a PFIC. Do I need to report this pension/retirement account on the FBAR? I don't think I did on the previous FBARs - so if I am supposed to be reporting this do I then need to go back and amend the previous years?



4. My spouse is a UK citizen that has thus far remained completely outside the US tax system. We may decide to move back to the US in the future and I have read I need to demonstrate 5 years' tax compliance for him to get a green card. I have filed every year using turbo tax to the best of my ability though I'm sure I have made mistakes because of ignorance in addition to probably not filing FBARs correctly. Is this something that is likely to affect my spouse's ability to get a green card if we move back to the US?



If you read this far thank you!! This forum has been really valuable for me - with help from here I recently had my indefinite leave to remain approved in the UK! Now I have that out of the way I am trying to sort out my finances....",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMy8yNy9kb3JhLWJhbmtzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZ2F0aGVyaW5ncy1uby1zb2NpYWwtZGlzdGFuY2luZy1tYXNrcy83MDMxODcyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hundreds gather at Dora at The Banks for debut weekend,"Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday afternoon at the Designated Outdoor Refreshment Area at The Banks during its debut weekend.

Long lines packed with mostly unmasked people -- dressed appropriately in short sleeves and sunglasses -- formed outside bars and restaurants in the Dora stretching the width of East Freedom Way.

Those who had already received their drinks gathered in small groups or sat at one of more than a dozen picnic tables lining the street.

The Dora at The Banks spans 85 acres of Downtown Cincinnati from the Heritage Bank Center (formerly US Bank Arena) to Paul Brown Stadium and from Mehring Way to Second Street.

Having only just opened on Thursday it's the newest of at least 17 drinking districts established throughout Greater Cincinnati.

Many patrons were pleased overall with how the drinking district turned out adding that it was the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that they had gone out to a large public venue.

""I'm glad to see such a good crowd"" Kathy Mills 62 of Loveland told The Enquirer. ""I think it's great.""

Mills said the last time she was out in a large crowd was in 2019 but because she's been vaccinated she wasn't worried about being out in public with the virus still ongoing.

Muna Nyama 33 of Silverton also hasn't been out to a large public gathering since before the pandemic. He came down to The Banks to support local businesses and to check out the Dora for himself.

""I like it so far"" he said of the Dora adding that his fears about the pandemic have eased as more and more people get vaccinated.

However some said the Dora is a good concept but that it could have been executed better.

Tony and Elise Burtke of Fort Thomas said the long lines and lack of seating dampened the experience.

""We waited in line 30 minutes just for a drink"" Tony 36 said.

Local health officials have been urging vigilance as the weather gets warmer and residents get wearier of masks and social distancing. With spring making its presence known case counts have stalled their drop since the beginning of the year.

But few patrons at the Dora on Saturday were seen wearing masks and those who did have a mask were typically wearing it under their chin.

Mitch Tiedt 26 said he doesn't see the need to wear a mask in an open environment adding that with so many people choosing not to wear a mask anyway it almost seems pointless.

""The people who choose to be out here choose to be out here"" he said. ""They know the risk.""

Dora at The Banks is open daily from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. City officials say it's a permanent feature that will be open year-round.

Freedom Way from Joe Nuxhall Way to Marian Spencer Way is permanently closed for the Dora according to the Cincinnati Police Department.

Two teenage girls have been charged in the carjacking death of an Uber Eats driver this week in Washington DC police say.

Mohammad Anwar 66 of Springfield Virginia was killed Tuesday afternoon near Nationals Park the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement.

Anwar was working as an Uber Eats driver says a GoFundMe page set up by his family.

Four teenage boys have been arrested for carjackings in Washington DC after a similar incident led to the death of an Uber Eats driver earlier this week police said.

In what may be part of a disturbing trend cops on Saturday busted two 13-year-old boys for two back-to-back armed carjackings — just days after two teenage girls were charged with murdering the Uber driver the Metropolitan Police Department said in a press release.

During the first jacking one of the teens allegedly whipped out a handgun and demanded that a victim get out of the car — before fleeing in the ride at around 7:10 p.m. Friday according to police.

Just over an hour later the same teens allegedly struck again pulling the same move in a nearby Northwest section of the city at 8:40 p.m. according to cops.

Anwar and other bystanders could be heard yelling that the girls were trying to steal the vehicle. At one point the car suddenly zoomed down the street with Anwar hanging out of the driver's side door clinging to the frame. The car then crashed at the end of the street and flipped onto its side.

Two teenage girls are in custody after an Uber Eats driver was killed during a hijacking in Washington D.C.

The suspects carjacked the driver with a weapon and soon after crashed the car. Part of the incident was caught on video.

The driver was identified as Mohammad Anwar an immigrant who lived in Springfield Virginia according to NBC4 Washington. Anwar was working in the city’s southeastern quadrant when the girls ages 13 and 15 approached him and brandished a stun gun. A witness of the carjacking captured the incident on his camera phone and the footage was released by TMZ.

In the video the 66-year-old man can be seen leaning out of the open front door of the car crying out “This is my car!” One teen can be seen in the front passenger’s seat motioning toward another person behind the wheel. The two can be heard yelling commands at one another when the engine starts and revs up.

Moments later the car speeds off down the street with Anwar hanging out and the door slams into a light pole. The camera follows the car as it turns the corner and out of sight followed by the sound of screeching brakes and a loud crash.

As the bystander rushes to the scene the sedan is seen turned over on its side. The girls soon after climb out from the window of the car as the bystander filming said “They stole the car!” Anwar received life threatening injuries from the crash and was taken to a hospital where he would be pronounced dead.

While the suspects’ identities cannot be disclosed because they are minors it was confirmed by Metropolitan Police Department that one is a 13-year-old from Washington D.C. and the other is a 15-year-old from Fort Washington Maryland. NBC News reports that the two were arrested and have since been charged with felony murder and armed carjacking.

Anwar was a Pakistani immigrant who moved to America in 2014 according to a family statement. It described him as a “hardworking” man who was working to “build a better life for himself and his family. The loss for his family is immeasurable.”

Factor in delicate easy-to-irritate eyes and you might be put off using retinol for your eye area entirely. However if you’re currently using an eye cream or gel to even out skin tone or smooth fine lines like crow’s feet then switching over to an eye product with retinol will only kick everything up a notch.

And yes it’s possible to start slow and build your way up as is typical with any retinol skin care. “I would recommend lower strength and more moisturizing formulations perhaps in serum form” dermatologist Gary Goldenberg of Goldenberg Dermatology tells TZR over email. “Avoid high-potency retinol and tretinoin especially if you’re just starting out. Use the product sparingly and several times per week initially. Then increase frequency.” Simple isn’t it?

The dermatologist goes on to note that retinol is just as important to use around your eye area if you’re hoping to hoping to minimize signs of aging. “It can help with pigmentation and fine wrinkles and lines such as crow's feet” Goldenberg says.

For those already using retinol mixing it into your eye care routine is a simple added step. “Put retinol and a moisturizer in the palm of your hand. Mix the two and then gently apply little dabs to the skin around the eyes” explains Goldenberg. (And remember this doesn’t include tretinoin another vitamin A derivative: “Retinol is over-the-counter and tretinoin is prescription. Tretinoin usually has higher strength” he explains. “But for wrinkles and pigmentation I usually recommend retinol since it has similar efficacy and is less irritating.”)

Warren Buffett one of the greatest value investors of all time is turning 90 this year. Operating from his hometown of Omaha Nebraska Buffett lives in a modest house drives a modest car and enjoys the simple pleasures of life like an ice-cold Coke.

After sticking to the same investing game plan for years Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.09%) (BRK.B 0.04%) portfolio has gotten a fairly considerable revamp over the last few years. For instance trusting the wisdom of his closest Berkshire money managers the company began buying shares of tech growth stock Apple in 2016. Technology a sector that Buffett used to mostly avoid now comprises about 40% of Berkshire's portfolio.

So it's clear that Buffett is willing to go in new directions if the right opportunity comes along. With this in mind perhaps Buffett should consider Starbucks (SBUX 1.32%) Honeywell (HON 0.60%) and United Parcel Service (UPS 0.12%). These companies offer a great combination of market leadership dividends and value.

Here's why Buffett would love all three companies and why they would fit nicely into Berkshire's portfolio.

1. Starbucks

Berkshire Hathaway owns over $30 billion in shares of consumer staple stocks Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz. Although Starbucks technically falls in the consumer discretionary category its product line has arguably become more of a staple for consumers than many offerings from Coke and Kraft Heinz. The shift in consumer sentiment away from sugar and preservatives toward healthier options hinders the growth prospects of soda and processed-food companies. Yet Starbucks manages to have a similar level of recession resilience as these companies (with a much brighter future in the forecast).

Starbucks was hit hard by the pandemic but has since reopened nearly all of its stores. Its revenue and earnings are close to pre-pandemic levels with U.S. same-store comps down just 5% year over year as of its most recent quarter. This is impressive considering 60% of its U.S. company-operated stores are still offering limited seating.

Starbucks leaned heavily on grab-and-go ordering and its mobile app during the pandemic. And it worked. Customers are using the app and spending more money per transaction than ever before which bodes well for Starbucks' future.

Since issuing its first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in April 2010 Starbucks has raised its annual payout every single year. Its quarterly dividend is now $0.45 per share which is a yield of 1.7% at today's prices. Starbucks has plans to build new stores focused solely on grab-and-go ordering -- which should help it grow earnings and its dividend for years to come.

2. Honeywell

Just over 2% of Berkshire's portfolio is dedicated to industrial stocks. If Buffett was looking for an industrial to add then Honeywell deserves to be a top contender.

Like most industrial stocks Honeywell suffered revenue and earnings declines last year. As results improved toward the end of the year management said it is now confident that the company can return to growth.

The same factors that hurt Honeywell's 2020 results should help it in 2021. Commercial aviation could rebound as air traffic improves. Higher oil prices and industrial production will help its performance materials and technologies segment. Honeywell's customers delayed building solutions projects in 2020. But in its fourth-quarter conference call Honeywell management announced orders were piling in putting its backlog in a good position for 2021. And finally safety and productivity solutions (SPS) -- the only segment that grew in 2020 -- should continue to benefit from warehouse automation and productivity solutions. SPS ended 2020 with a $4 billion backlog -- double the backlog at the end of 2019. Simply put Honeywell is seeing business pick up in all of its segments.

Aside from an optimistic outlook Honeywell has many qualities that Buffett would love. The company's strong balance sheet history of dividend increases and growth prospects give it long-term value. Despite last year's challenges Honeywell was able to generate tons of free cash flow that more than doubled its dividend payments.

Excess free cash flow continues to give Honeywell the dry powder needed to limit how much debt it adds to its balance sheet. Today its balance sheet remains one of the best of the major industrials.

3. UPS

Ranking 48 out of 48 on Buffett's list of holdings is UPS. So yes Buffett owns the stock. But at 0.003% of Berkshire's portfolio the company's UPS shares could double and it would hardly make an impact.

UPS rival FedEx reported encouraging earnings and guidance on March 18 that showed a strong recovery in business-to-business (B2B) sales and e-commerce growth. This is good news for UPS which would like its B2B volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.

UPS has the makings of a perfect Buffett stock. With 70% higher net income and double the market cap of FedEx UPS is the market leader in its industry. Its adjusted 2020 EPS of $8.23 per share gives it a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of around 19. UPS has a dividend yield of 2.6%. The company just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.02 per share more than double what it was 10 years ago.

UPS has plenty of growth prospects as well. It's leading the distribution process for COVID-19 vaccines a trend Buffett can appreciate seeing as he's been buying healthcare stocks. UPS was also one of the few industrial stocks that crushed earnings throughout 2020 not to mention notching its best quarter ever at the end of the year.

E-commerce is a booming trend that benefits UPS. The company has been expanding its fleet and laying the groundwork for what it expects to be years of e-commerce growth. The pandemic accelerated that trend which was a big part of UPS' strong 2020 performance. However there's reason to believe it will retain much of the business it gained while adding more in the years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoYXRzLXdoYXQtdGhleS1saWtlLXBlcHNpLWNvbGEtdG8tcmVjZWl2ZS0xNS10ZXNsYS1zZW1pLXRydWNrcy1ieS10aGUtZW5kLW9mLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,That's What They Like: Pepsi Cola To Receive 15 Tesla Semi Trucks By The End Of 2021,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoYXRzLXdoYXQtdGhleS1saWtlLXBlcHNpLWNvbGEtdG8tcmVjZWl2ZS0xNS10ZXNsYS1zZW1pLXRydWNrcy1ieS10aGUtZW5kLW9mLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTE0OTMtdXMtY291cnQtZGlzcHV0ZXMtMThiLWFlY29tLWRhbWFnZS1hd2FyZC1pbi1yZW1hcmthYmxlLWZyYXVkLXN1aXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Court Disputes $1.8B AECOM Damage Award in 'Remarkable Fraud' Suit,"A federal appeals court has thrown out a $1.8-billion award granted by a lower court three years ago to an AECOM unit in a bizarre legal battle involving a Nevada company that claimed to have won multiple contracts using the name of Morrison Knudsen—the former well-known Boise-based construction contractor that was sold in 1996 and through acquisitions became part of design-build giant AECOM in 2014.

The appellate judges did not alter the lower court’s injunction halting use of the fake MK name in a long-running internet manipulation but they ruled March 24 that the award was excessive.

The Nevada company claimed in press releases that it received three awards totaling $1.8 billion from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency U.S. Bureau of Land Management Blackstone Mining group and the Indonesian Infrastructure Partnership in a “remarkable fraud to usurp the identity and goodwill of Morrison Knudsen Corp.” AECOM said in its 2017 U.S. district court lawsuit.

MK was incorporated into the parent as AECOM Energy & Construction Inc.

To win the awards the Nevada company “falsified corporate records submitted false statements to both federal and state government agencies” and created a website on which it claimed MK’s history since 1912 and its well-known construction projects as its own. The company's address was a United Parcel Service facility in Henderson Nev. the lawsuit contends.

“In 2008 unbeknownst to MK defendants began what would become an intricate series of frauds designed to trade off and indeed take over the MK identity” the suit says.

False Statements

Through a stated address in Los Angeles company officials filed required government reports changing names of unrelated companies to the MK brand and submitted other reports for years to state officials claiming approvals of a board of directors ""under penalty of perjury"" the suit contends.

The filing contends that the defendants which include five named individuals took over Morrison-Knudsen Services an affiliate of the former contractor that was incorporated in 1982 but dissolved in 2002. Defendant Todd Hale iisted as company ""president"" revived the company falsely claiming to Nevada authorities that he had board authority to do so.

“Defendants similarly took over another dissolved Nevada affiliate of MK Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Viet Nam” the AECOM lawsuit says. Defendants also changed the name of their existing company E Planet Communications to Morrison Knudsen International in 2016. Westland Petroleum Corp. a defunct company also was renamed Morrison Knudsen in 2016.

AECOM called the company’s use of domain name www.morrison-knudsen.com “cyberpiracy.” Its suit contends the false MK site would show up ""at or near the top"" of searches of the Morrison Knudsen name and that Wikipedia's refrenc3e is to the fake site.

Through false statements to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office changing the company address from Boise to Los Angeles defendants ""effectively then had control of MK's trademark registrations"" according to the suit. The office acknowledged defendants' firm as ""rightful owners"" of MK trademarks for work in as a general contractor on public and private sector projects including dam utility transportation and industrial facilities.

The falsified website also claimed the fake MK could take ""equity positions in a variety of projects"" and back projects with ""equipment lend/lease and financing.""

Cease and Desist

The design-build firm sent a cease and desist letter to the Nevada company accusing it of attempting to trade on MK’s goodwill “the goodwill that rightly belongs to AECOM” its lawsuit says. The parent asked the court to enjoin defendants' company from further use of MK’s name trademarks and corporate records.

In November 2018 the federal district court awarded AECOM $1.8 billion in damages and permanently enjoined the Nevada company from claiming it is Morrison Knudsen Corp. or that its products and services originate from or have any relation to MK or from using the MK logo or any name or logo similar to Morrison Knudsen.

In ordering the lower court to reconsider the award total the appeals court said “AECOM has failed to show that it suffered an ‘injury in fact” although it agreed that AECOM is the entity that “always owned and still owns the MK property.”

The appeals court said while generally AECOM would be entitled to a monetary remedy in this case AECOM failed to show any revenue earned by the rogue company or that defendants had started work under any claimed construction contracts or proved they were able to undertake their construction.

But the court did say that since defendants failed to provide reliable evidence of their profits or costs the lower court could consider a “discovery sanction” if AECOM seeks such relief.

Separately Judge Michelle Friedland one of three ruling disagreed. She said that the lower court’s damage amount was “within the range of options available for the court to consider"" opining that defendants ""stonewalled AECOM's every effort to ascertain information about their finances.""

Attorneys for the defendants could not be reached.

A spokesman for AECOM did not respond by press time to an ENR query on the ruling.",,,,,,

But the contrary is true. In fact underlying conditions brought on by NCDs have led to a rise in the death toll from COVID-19. The majority of those who have died from COVID-19 had an underlying NCD such as obesity cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic lung disease or cancer. Nearly three-quarters of all deaths around the world are caused by NCDs so the urgency of the problem was only further highlighted by COVID-19.

In fact at the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the WHO Director-General has said that “the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the full danger of noncommunicable diseases – and signalled the urgent need for stronger public health policies and investment to prevent them”. In the work of AKHS and as part of the COVID-19 response we have increased our health promotion and disease prevention activities to address risk factors for NCDs as well as augmented our efforts to diagnose and treat disease early.

How has AKDN responded during the pandemic? Can you speak about the Global Task Force and your role?

We began by tracking the pandemic in early 2020. The Aga Khan Health Services (AKHS) the Aga Khan University (AKU) and the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) engaged with Ministries of Health to develop country- as well as area-specific COVID-19 preparedness plans. The priority was to bolster government and AKDN’s diagnostic and care capacities and secure much needed supplies and test kits.

By mid-March of 2020 an AKDN COVID-19 Global Task Force (GTF) was set up to mount a robust response to the pandemic across all agencies and the Imamat and to make use of global learning.

The AKDN response ranged from frontline health workers testing suspected cases and treating mild and moderately ill patients construction of additional temporary health facilities and increasing the capacity to treat severe and critical cases to advising national authorities on their country’s response and preparedness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpvdXJuYWwuaWUvYWxsLWlzbGFuZC1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXNoYXJlZC1pc2xhbmQtNTM4NTk4MS1NYXIyMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How two different expensive healthcare systems on this island have managed to (occasionally) work well together,"This article is part of The Good Information Project a new initiative from The Journal to help create greater understanding of big issues we face. This month we are focusing on the question ‘What could a shared island look like?’

WHEN IT COMES to any discussion of a united or more shared island how to reconcile two very different healthcare systems is a knotty puzzle.

The people of Northern Ireland put a huge value on their free-at-the-point-of-access health service. In a 2019 poll on healthcare people were asked whether the two different healthcare systems would influence their vote in a referendum on a united Ireland.

Overall 52% said that it would discourage them from voting for a united Ireland.

The highest plurality of voters across all age categories genders and religions said that the different healthcare system would be a deterrant with 9% saying it would encourage them to vote for a united Ireland and 32% saying it would make no difference (7% said they did not know).

While the healthcare services both north and south on the island of Ireland have some big differences they also face similar problems. One of the bright spots in recent years has been north-south initiatives between the two.

The North West Cancer Centre is a shining light in all-island healthcare while a joint approach to cancer aims to share research and hopefully make treatments more accurate. The all-island milk bank based in Enniskillen receives donations from across the island and distributes it to mothers north and south.

These are examples that have transcended politics and resulted in practical benefits for patients on the island – but a lot more research is needed to scope out the possible benefits in other areas of healthcare and potentially figure out whether the twain can meet.

Experts say it’s possible that a more collaborative approach to stroke services orthopaedic services transplant services and public health issues around obesity and mental health could see improvements for patients – but the research isn’t there to show it at the moment.

This piece will look at the extent of the differences between the two systems the cost of the systems and the several organisations already operating for years to increase health collaboration for patients in both jurisdictions.

Two systems facing a lot of the same problems

In Northern Ireland GP appointments hospital appointments and prescription costs are all covered by National Insurance contributions. This is sometimes called ‘the NHS’ but Northern Ireland’s health service also provides social services through local councils.

In Ireland a GP appointment costs around €60 a visit to the Emergency Department costs €100 and prescription costs are also paid for directly by the patient. There is also a two-tier healthcare system in Ireland. Around a third of the Irish population have a means-tested medical card which gives them access to healthcare for free while 46.2% of the population has private health insurance.

Ireland is an outlier across the EU in how a large proportion of the population pay in full for GP visits instead of it being free or heavily subsidised.

It’s also not clear to what extent free access to GPs leads to better health outcomes for patients though there are concerns that if GP visits are reduced by charging for them that it might not always apply to “unnecessary” GP visits and people may not get necessary treatment as a result.

Despite the different healthcare systems the people on both sides of the border face similar healthcare challenges: an ageing population that will need more care and a discussion on quality of living; better cancer services; a waiting list crisis; obesity and diabetes; and mental health issues particularly after waves of severe restrictions.

The UUP has said that the Health and Social Care Act introduced in 1948 aimed to give access to people “on the basis of need rather than ability to pay”. It now says that its wish is to “see an end to headlines about our health service facing swelling waiting lists delivering critical services inefficiently and lurching from one crisis to another”.

That will sound familiar to many in Ireland who have witnessed similar criticisms of the HSE and where the Department of Health portfolio has been labelled ‘a poisoned chalice’.

Professor of Social Policy Deirdre Heenan of Ulster University said of the two systems:

Even the most ardent republican would still acknowledge the value that people attach to the National Health Service. That is something that is deeply cherished here because services are free at the point of delivery.

“But services aren’t free – we pay for them through our taxation.

“There are two different models. What strikes me often when we’re talking about it is there’s a very poor understanding of those systems other than a kind of very broad brush approach.”

In Northern Ireland’s 2018-2019 budget of £13 billion £5.6 billion was allocated to health alone (44%) for a population of 1.8 million people.

In 2019-20 it was £6.12 billion and the latest budget for 2020-21 is £6.45 billion Northern Ireland’s Department of Health confirmed to The Journal.

This compares to the HSE’s budget of €17 billion for 2018-2019 for a population of 4.9 million and €20.6 billion for 2021.

This means that Northern Ireland’s health spending per person was ahead of Ireland’s just three years ago but the two are now almost exactly the same with Ireland spending €4204 per person in 2021 and Northern Ireland spending the equivalent of €4182.

In the BBC programme Spend It Like Stormont the permanent secretary for NI’s Department of Health Richard Pengelly said that the current health budget spend isn’t sustainable.

“We can’t continue the way we are” he told the BBC.

“We have enough money to run a world class health service but we don’t have enough money to run this health service.”

“If we continue on that trajectory [of health budget increases of 6% a year] within about 20 years the health service will need virtually all the money that’s available to the Executive.”

An all-island approach: Covid-19

During the Covid-19 pandemic there has been much talk of an all-island approach to tackling the pandemic and by extension an all-island approach to healthcare in general.

“I suppose we are at a point that we can look at it in terms of a useful case study” said Professor Deirdre Heenan. “It’s the same pandemic in the north as in the south but how was it treated? What were the policies? Were they different?”

On any cursory examination it makes sense to say ‘we should be looking at this as an island’. We repeatedly heard ‘this virus doesn’t respect borders. This virus knows no borders’. But surely the obvious next point is ‘Yes fair point. So what? What are you doing about it?’

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between both jurisdictions north and south pledging cooperation on the island of Ireland. But Heenan questions whether this was a political show and asks what changed as a result how often both Chief Medical Officers spoke to each other and what positive effect it has had on patients and the island’s Covid response.

Professor Heenan said that there needs to be a clearer focus or plan of what calls for an all-island response would mean in practice.

“Our Deputy First Minister [Michelle O'Neill] talked about the waiting lists recently and referred to the fact that we needed cross border healthcare to address our waiting lists. She may be right she may be wrong but we simply don’t have the evidence to support what that would look like” she told The Journal.

“There are many examples where people talk in a glib off-the-cuff fashion about how wonderful it would be if we had a better system across this island. I suppose my issue is: where are the studies that have the evidence to show that there would be economic benefits and better outcomes for people on this island?”

Some shared services – but not many

Professor Heenan said that two “flagship” areas of healthcare that have taken an all-island approach and shown to be better than two separate approaches are paediatric services and cancer services.

“Children’s heart services are on an all-island basis. Prior to that children from the North would have gone to Birmingham. You can imagine if you had a sick child who needed an intervention and someone talked about getting you a flight to Birmingham how traumatic that would be: where would you stay what would be the cost of it?

“There was talk about developing a service in the Royal Hospital in Belfast but a realisation that we didn’t have the critical mass to support that.

“So there was an agreement that the service based in Dublin could be used [Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin] and I haven’t met anyone yet who doesn’t view it as anything other than a resounding success. The politics disappeared. No one said ‘I’m not going to Dublin because I am not in favour’.”

Last week Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and Northern Ireland’s Health Minister Robin Swann signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with the US National Cancer Institute with the aim of “reducing cancer incidence and mortality on the island of Ireland through cross-border and transatlantic collaborations”.

It’s hoped that in practice sharing information will make treatments for cancer patients more precise.

The joint-initiative was originally established in 1999 after the Good Friday Agreement. In the 20 years since it has established robust cancer clinical trials infrastructure on the island of Ireland and trained over 500 clinicians and scientists to bolster research.

Prof Mark Lawler Chair in Translational Cancer Genomics at Queen’s University Belfast said at the event to mark the signing: “Cancer knows no borders so neither should we. We need to compete not against each other but against a common enemy – cancer.”

There have been other small steps towards cooperation: The Cooperation And Working Together (CAWT) facilitates cross-border collaborations in health and social care and the HSE has a North-South unit to promote cooperation with health providers.

The Taoiseach’s Shared Island Unit is looking into how healthcare on the island of Ireland could be more collaborative and has commissioned the ESRI to do research on the topic of healthcare.

At a recent talk hosted by the University of Cambridge Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan said that collaborations wouldn’t happen overnight but added that Ireland’s health system was gradually moving to be more like Northern Ireland’s healthcare system.

“The current Irish policy when it comes to healthcare [is] the Sláintecare document… as agreed by all parties in the Oireachtas. It’s referenced and recognised in the current Programme for Government of the Irish Government which is entitled ‘universal health care’ which is a clear statement of where we are going.

The path that we are on puts Ireland on a path that is going to lead to the convergence of standards between the two parts of the island. We’ve short term commitments that include extending free GP care to more children and older people. Although we don’t have free at the point of delivery as yes it is I would have thought a very clear point of direction to where Ireland is heading.

“I think there would be a convergence between the two jurisdictions when it came to healthcare if the endpoint would be free at the point of delivery.”

With mounting job losses pervasive wage cuts and diminishing unemployment benefits compounded by the rising cost of education and medical expenses there’s newfound urgency around the politics of debt.

Students are launching tuition strikes tenants are organizing and pushing back against landlords medical industry insiders are offering loopholes to get out of medical bills on TikTok and leftist politicians are calling for total student debt cancellation while moderates like Chuck Schumer and President Joe Biden offer meager means-tested debt relief programs.

At the same time poor and less powerful nations have also gone into record levels of sovereign debt (i.e. debt that a national government takes on) in an attempt to keep their economies and people alive. Countries like India Zambia Ethiopia Costa Rica Egypt Argentina and Ecuador among dozens of others are struggling with mountainous debts to public and private lenders. The suffering—on both a personal and societal level—caused by those debts is causing waves of social upheavals.

As consumer debt pressures individuals to twist their lives around repaying it sovereign debt contorts nations in a similar way. Just as indebted Americans often forgo medical treatment for fear it will only rack up monthly bills poor nations slash their own public health spending in the name of repaying debt. Sovereign debt pushes governments to drastically cut public services of all kinds and open their country up to predatory investors leading to mass unrest.

The end result is the same for both: a rise in preventable illnesses general deprivation impoverishment instability and death.

And while international campaigns for sovereign debt cancellation exist this issue has received relatively little attention inside the U.S. compared to our own consumer debt woes. These two conversations around debt are taking place in relative isolation from one another.

But consumer debt in the U.S. and the sovereign debt of nations around the world are morally and politically linked.

Sovereign debt is a moral atrocity pushing nations slowly into death spirals. It is indefensible for the same reasons student and medical debt in America is indefensible and struggling to abolish one implicitly relies on the same broad liberatory vision which includes the other.

At its core to be hopelessly indebted whether as a person or as a nation is to be shackled. Those shackles must be broken and the U.S. is in a unique position to do it.

Dying of COVID Buried in Debt

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown poorer and less powerful countries to a ravenous global finance system one that is indifferent to human welfare and dignity. In 2020 global South nations dramatically ramped up public spending to try and offset the losses in the private sector due to COVID taking on so much debt that some are already on the verge of defaulting or failing to repay.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects debt-to-GDP ratios to rise by 7-10 percent in low and middle-income countries a rapid acceleration of rising debt triggered by the 2007-09 recession. Despite this increased spending the fallout from COVID has pushed 130-500 million people into extreme poverty meaning more public spending will be needed to provide basic services for them. Instead of helping governments bolster these services powerful lenders like the IMF insist that countries should be cutting down on them. Because there’s only a handful of governments and organizations wealthy enough to lend governments money debtor countries are forced to abide by the loan conditions laid out for them—or risk being blacklisted from international financing entirely. This is a recipe for a human disaster in the coming years when the mounting sovereign debts will begin tearing apart state budgets eviscerating countries’ social fabrics in the process.

Ethiopia’s ongoing debt crisis is a helpful case to understand how this dangerous dynamic is playing out in global South nations generally.

Though much of its growth in the past decade occurred thanks to state-led programs which helped to reduce poverty Ethiopia accepted a $2.9 billion loan from the IMF in 2019 with the express purpose of undercutting public investment and redirecting power to the private sector. At this time Ethiopia’s unequally developing economy had been forcing rural villagers into urban slums for years where they were forced to work informal or wage-labor jobs. Harsh and unhealthy living conditions in the slums of Addis Ababa and other cities were contributing to a rise in non-communicable ailments like cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes. Scientists advocated for robust universal health care. But Ethiopia with few options but austerity made good on its agreement with the IMF and cut spending while keeping health care expenditures stagnant. Overall now Ethiopia is spending about twice the money to pay its outside debts than to its own public health sector. Poor Ethiopians are dying so that the IMF can have a tidier spreadsheet (and greater leverage for extracting resources from the country).

This is the norm in the global South where most countries are entrapped into spending more in a futile attempt to repay external debts than to support their own public health institutions even as their people are pushed into toxic slums. A predictable result has been that over-stretched under-funded health care centers leave out those suffering with preventable diseases like measles and polio leading to yet more death. For COVID specifically global South countries are so paralyzed by debt and austerity that a vaccine apartheid is beginning to form which could kill hundreds of thousands in the next year.

The Ethiopian government began openly criticizing sovereign creditors when the pandemic hit in early 2020. As the death toll mounted and its economy plummeted Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pleaded for debt relief. “The dilemma Ethiopia faces is stark” Ahmed wrote in a New York Times op-ed in April 2020 around the same time the G20 announced temporary debt relief for the world’s poorest countries including Ethiopia. “Do we continue to pay toward debt or redirect resources to save lives and livelihoods? Lives lost during the pandemic cannot be recovered; imperiled livelihoods cost more and take longer to recover.”

Canceling Ethiopia’s debts would mean it could use a huge chunk of its revenues to re-invest domestically in order to shore up its flailing health care system instead of sending billions of dollars each year to already-rich creditors. “Increasing health care spending is essential irrespective of debt levels but we have less money on hand and much of it is due to creditors” Ahmed writes.

Seven days after his op-ed was released Moody’s downgraded Ethiopia’s sovereign credit rating for “its stated intention to seek official sector debt service relief” as if to punish the poor country for ever asking for help. This means Ethiopia is likely going to pay more in interest rates and bond yields edging it toward a debt spiral—and thus closer to a social crisis that could kill even more people than the country has already lost to COVID-19. Moody’s has also downgraded the credit rating of El Salvador as well as the banking systems of South Africa Nigeria and Morocco. India’s credit rating is now beginning to hover around “junk” status thanks to its respective downgrade. These downgrades are ticking time bombs that could explode in the next three to four years slowly suffocating a nation’s economy until it hits a breaking point.

As Ethiopia sinks deeper into debt more people are leaving the country seeking work opportunities abroad. Many travel to the Middle East. In 2018 alone about 150000 Ethiopians smuggled themselves into Yemen in the hopes of eventually finding work in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. With a similar rate of emigration in 2019 this has made the maritime route between the Horn of Africa and Yemen one of the busiest and most dangerous in the world. To make this life-threatening voyage Ethiopians are often forced to give away all their possessions to human traffickers who demand exorbitant fees for services. They must then navigate the war in Yemen which itself is the largest humanitarian catastrophe on Earth braving warring parties who torture them and throw them into inhumane detention centers. If they survive this and make it into richer neighboring countries their best-case scenario involves them being treated as indentured servants by employers which includes a barrage of exploitation and threats from governments.

At each step in this perilous journey Ethiopians accrue debt they are unable to pay either by the human trafficking middlemen or by tyrannical bosses who demand fees to process “paperwork.” The national indebtedness of Ethiopia and the resultant suppression of its economy cascades into worlds of personal debt and yet more powerlessness for the Ethiopian people.

It’s a vicious cycle that leads to mass death and immiseration and it’s found all over the globe. Global South nations drowning in debt see their economies slowly collapse under the pressure which drives their populations to seek work opportunities abroad. In effect the loans made to finance the government become ways for powerful firms to exploit that global South as a workforce and keep them ever-vulnerable sacrificing more and more of themselves to paying endless debts.

One anonymous Ethiopian reported the brutal treatment the traffickers went to extract money from him while he was in Yemen:

They demanded money but I said I don’t have any. They told me to make a call but I said I don’t have relatives. They beat me and hung me on the wall by one hand while standing on a chair then they kicked the chair away and I was swinging by my arm. They beat me on my head with a stick and it was swollen and bled.

This is a painful example of the kinds of treatment people suffer through in the name of repaying their debts. But there is a chilling parallel between this man’s experience and the national experience of being hopelessly in debt. This man’s debtors physically beat him to get as much money out of him as possible while international investors knowingly impose such drastic cuts to public services that people die as a direct result. The direct violence to the man’s body flows from the larger structural violence inflicted upon countries in the global South.

Historically international creditors throw less powerful countries into debt traps knowing the human cost of this decision. For decades the IMF has pushed countries to cut subsidies to key goods such as bread fuel and electricity with the expectation that it impoverishes a portion of the indebted country’s population. The people’s collective pushback can sometimes culminate in full-blown revolutions.

The resistance efforts play a large role in the Middle East and North Africa where every few years waves of anti-austerity protests shut down capital cities like Cairo Amman Khartoum and Tunis after their government accepts a conditional IMF loan. In the case of Sudan its inspiring 2019 revolution was catalyzed by a tripling of the price of bread at the behest of Sudan’s creditors including the IMF. No matter to the IMF which recommended more cuts to subsidies in 2020. When poor countries come to them again in the near future with no other option for finance whatever residual remains of its public services will be on the chopping block.

For public health spending the IMF is no better. In the 1980s it infamously pushed Madagascar into an austerity regime ending its monitoring program of malaria while increasing the price of life-saving antimalarial drugs killing ten thousand people. More recently IMF economists have argued that the best way a country can support its health care system is by cutting subsidies to food and fertilizers ignoring the reality that these actions would immediately raise the price of food and thus expose many to starvation malnutrition and famine which would inundate any health care system. In India’s case the IMF has advocated for ending subsidies of its farming sector and raising taxes under the veil that these cuts would help bolster India’s public health sector. Suspiciously their study neglects to mention how indebted countries like India would likely take the extra spending money from ending their subsidies programs to funnel it towards their external debts rather than re-invest it domestically. This twisted logic is not only absurd it is murderous. It is partially to blame for an ongoing epidemic of suicides by farmers who are forced to bury themselves in debt to operate and also the recent mass revolt where over 250 million farmers and peasants have taken to India’s streets in an attempt to block further agricultural market reforms.

Allowing this global indebtedness to continue is a moral abomination. But it’s also in the U.S.’ selfish interest to abolish the world’s debts as well.

As climate change accelerates massive global investment is needed to ensure countries can prevent the worst of its effects while responding effectively to its acute events like droughts and floods. Global South nations currently buried in debt lack the emergency resources to mobilize for these scenarios relying instead on humanitarian aid given after the fact. Years of being pummeled by debt and ecological devastation will eventually drive populations out toward neighboring countries. This will likely spark yet more economic instability secondary conflicts and consequent refugee crises which will eventually spill into the U.S. and its allies. We don’t even have to wait for this to occur in an abstracted future—it’s already happening. Even a conservative national security-oriented view of this would see the value of cancelling global debts now as a way to free up future public revenue to prevent this.

Not Debt Relief Debt Abolition

There is a long history of debt cancellation sometimes called a debt jubilee in order to pre-empt unrest and the uneven concentration of power in one class above another.

The Old Testament declared that all debts should be written off on the tenth day of the seventh month every 50 years. In his authoritative book on the history of debt—aptly titled Debt: The First 5000 Years—David Graeber finds a rich tradition of ritualistic debt forgiveness. In one instance in 1761 BCE Hammurabi the ruler of the ancient kingdom of Babylon cancelled all of his realm’s debts in the name of “justice and equity” so “that the strong might not oppress the weak.” Cancelling the debts marked the New Year in Babylon. In a relevant aside Graeber notes that the world’s first documented use of the word “freedom” in a political document is found in Sumeria where King Entemena issued a debt cancellation in 2402 BCE which was called amargi or freedom. In the more recent past partial debt cancelations are more common. Germany received partial debt forgiveness in 1953. In 2010 the World Bank canceled $36 million of debt owed by Haiti.

But the current sovereign debt system has not institutionalized debt jubilees as an integral part of its function. Instead we have a highly commodified and oligarchical system for debt one driven by the edicts of capitalism in the service of private creditors like BlackRock Ashmore T Rowe Price and Fidelity. It functions similarly to consumer debt in the U.S. sometimes with the same corporations profiting off of both types of debt. For hedge funds lending to governments is a for-profit enterprise and canceling loans is bad for business. Because profit is paramount in global finance hedge funds can actually capitalize off the mass pain from debt by betting governments will falter in their debt repayments (a move known as a “short” in the financial world). Just a few years ago Goldman Sachs shorted Greek debt while hiding parts of it from public view—which meant that as the country fell apart in an enormous economic depression caused by Wall Street’s greed Goldman made out with millions.

The tiniest hint of volatility in a country is grounds for its interest rates to increase meaning its government will be forced to give away more of its quickly disappearing resources to international players. Creditors’ racial prejudice also makes its way into sovereign debts the same way it influences consumer debts. Researchers found that Sub-Saharan African nations have shockingly high borrowing costs even accounting for so-called “market fundamentals” like their volatility. This “Africa Premium” happens with African Americans who have disproportionate debt burdens than their white counterparts a phenomenon some have called “borrowing while black.” Debt in all forms then is a powerful tool to impose global white supremacy.

Countries struggling with debt payments are currently left with piecemeal restructuring programs through the G20 or IMF which demand strict adherence to neoliberal market principles before ever qualifying for relief. Even for the poorest countries “relief” often means little more than temporarily suspending debt payments which merely delays the crisis. Talks can drag on for months as reluctant private lenders refuse to budge. In the meantime the process can damage a country’s reputation on the global credit market for years.

This entire system must be thrown out and remade from the basic moral foundations of solidarity democracy and equality.

In the short term global debt—including consumer and sovereign debt—should be immediately forgiven. And to prevent this kind of fatal debt buildup from happening ever again the IMF the World Bank and similar international lending institutions should be dissolved and replaced by grant-giving bodies that prioritize the most vulnerable and operate democratically. Essential goods and services like health care education transportation housing and food should be publicly administered and free to everyone. Loans with interest rates should be outlawed entirely since the only redistributive effect they have is siphoning money from the poor to the rich. By extension this means hedge funds and other for-profit firms that exert power over the poor through wielding finance capital as a weapon should be broken up.

A democratic system of international aid would give a nation’s people a voice to set the agenda of what their country needs. It would be responsive to countries’ needs in a way the obstinate neoliberal dogma of our current global finance system cannot be. It would realize the redistributive vision organizers activists intellectuals and revolutionaries from the global South have dedicated their lives to enacting.

Much of the political legwork for this must be done in the United States the current seat of global finance. The IMF’s headquarters is in Washington D.C. as is the World Bank’s. BlackRock is in New York City.

The first and most obvious obstacle then is that many Americans simply don’t know the extent to which American-led institutions are disempowering and impoverishing the world through debt. While the IMF is a notorious and reviled institution in the global South who many understand to be nearly as powerful if not more powerful than their country’s own leaders the IMF is far less known in the U.S.

The second obstacle is the unwillingness of global finance to democratize. For-profit enterprises making money off impoverishing the global South are not going to voluntarily dismantle themselves nor will multilateral institutions that further Western imperial power through finance. And so far individual outcries from scattered indebted nations have only incentivized international lenders to use plushy language veiling their austerity recommendations in the language of humanitarianism. But a clear-headed grassroots movement in the U.S. that links its own indebtedness to the sovereign debts of the global South and coordinates with debtor nations can push for more meaningful changes through electoral pressure and direct actions. From there global connections can be made to exert pressure on European and Chinese banks that make up the rest of sovereign creditors.

Let Freedom Ring with a Debt Jubilee

In the mid to late 20th century a wave of revolutionary struggles crashed over much of the global South.

Dozens of colonized nations from Chile and Burkina Faso to Lebanon Algeria and Indonesia rose up and declared their political independence from European colonizers like France and the U.K as well as neocolonial dictators who allied with the West. This opened up a profoundly new space in global affairs one that fostered national self-determination and enabled internationally-minded organizations like the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to imagine novel ways of organizing civilization. Hundreds of millions of people who had before only known of rule by elites half the world away were beginning to realize a post-imperial world.

Sixty years since the first NAM summit in 1961 and there is little to show for their historic struggles. The political independence these nations have on paper means little since they remain leashed to those same imperial powers of the past through instruments of finance capital. And because much of their debt is owed to private lenders global South nations are caught under the boot not only of the West but specifically the profiteering vultures of Wall Street. This is a tragic step backwards from the progress made by their revolutions.

Total debt forgiveness is part of an emancipatory vision for the world. To this end Americans pushing to forgive debts worldwide would help nations to secure the independence they’ve been struggling toward for over 100 years. It will take considerable organizing power to confront those who are crushing the world into indentured servitude. But the moral case is crystal clear: the global debts must be canceled."

""Hay que vaciar. Los clientes vienen menos y los restaurantes están cerrados. La disminución de las ventas alcanzó casi 50%"" explicó a la AFP el hermano Jean Claude responsable de la comercialización en la abadía fundada en 1098.

Para liquidar las existencias Citeaux decidió lanzarse ""un desafío"" y vender por internet al menos una tonelada de queso de aquí al martes por la mañana a través de la empresa emergente ""Divine Box"" especializada en la venta en línea de productos elaboradas en las abadías.

Al cierre de la venta el viernes a medianoche el objetivo se superó con creces pues que se vendieron 20069 kg de queso.

Los 19 monjes trapenses que viven en silencio orando y realizando trabajos manuales se habían encontrado con ""4.000 quesos de más"" en sus bodegas o sea 28 toneladas de excedentes.

Un colmo para este queso francés llamado ""reblochon"" muy solicitado y producido desde 1925 que obtuvo en 2020 la medalla de plata en el concurso internacional de Lyon.

""Normalmente se rechazan pedidos. Se venden en Hong Kong Tokio Dubái..."" explica el cisterciense.

Con la fabricación y venta de quesos la abadía se convirtió en una pequeña empresa exitosa con un volumen de negocios de 12 millones de euros (14 millones de dólares) al año para una producción de 140.000 quesos.

""Hemos intentado explicar a nuestras 75 vacas que había que producir menos leche pero no parecen entender"" bromea el monje. ""Y no podemos empujar las paredes"".

“Aquí en Jalisco hay tres ventas muy fuertes que son la rosca de Reyes el pan de muerto y la empanada y la empanada es la venta fuerte para las panificadoras más cuando están establecidas a la redonda de un templo” explicó Hugo Salcedo Gómez presidente de la Sección de Panificación en la Cámara de la Industria Alimenticia de Jalisco (CIAJ).

Tradicionalmente quienes hacen la conocida como Visita de los Siete Templos que se remonta al caminar de Jesús de Nazaret por siete puntos acostumbran comprar empanadas al salir de alguno de los templos y por eso la Semana Santa es una de las fechas más importantes para los panaderos que en los últimos días han mantenido los hornos encendidos preparando la variedad de empanadas.

“Hemos tenido más variedad juegas con los sabores con los tamaños con el tema de azucarar o de ponerle algún tipo de decoración diferente y he visto que en el tema del empaque se está teniendo empuje para que la decisión de compra favorezca a ese producto”.

Explicó que la panadería tiene tres nichos: puntos de venta restaurantero o de mayoreo y venta al detalle y desde hace mes y medio que en Jalisco se reabrieron la mayoría de giros el flujo de personas se estabilizó con cifras similares a las del 2019 pero en el nicho restaurantero siguen bajas las ventas.

“Aunque están abiertos los restaurantes los consumos siguen todavía bajos andan promediando un 70% de los consumos que se tenían antes de la pandemia y si lo englobas en el mercado del pan nos hace estar todavía abajo con un 85 o 90% del mercado estabilizado”.

En Jalisco se estima que hay 2 mil 800 panificadoras y se generan alrededor de 150 mil empleos la mayoría de ellos concentrados en el área metropolitana de Guadalajara.

Nintendo Switch no para quieta eso es un hecho por lo que sigue superando récords que ella misma ha hecho pero también de otras consolas. En esta ocasión la consola de Nintendo lanzada en 2017 ha superado las ventas totales de la consola portátil de Sony PSP según estimaciones que se pueden leer por parte del portal VGChartz.

Durante la semana terminada el pasado 13 de marzo se reportaban las ventas de 425.124 nuevas Nintendo Switch lo que hacía que sus ventas generales se elevasen a las 8122 millones. Estas cifras comparadas con las ventas totales de PSP con 8109 millones de consolas vendidas harían que las de Switch ya fueran superiores y por tanto superadas.

Estas nuevas cifras de ventas son el total combinado de consolas vendidas entre las dos que tiene Nintendo: Switch y Switch Lite. Con esto la consola híbrida de la compañía se ha convertido en la décima consola más vendida de la historia por lo que ahora le tocará el turno de seguir escalando entre los siguientes puestos; algo prácticamente posible ya que su ritmo de ventas apenas ha bajado.

La siguiente consola de la lista es Game Boy Advance (que hace poco cumplió 20 años) con 8151 millones seguida de Xbox 360 con 8580 millones de consolas y de PlayStation 3 con un total de 874 millones de consolas vendidas. Por ahora Switch está a 029 millones de GBA a 458 de Xbox 360 y a 618 millones de alcanzar a PS3.

Desgranando por territorios las ventas de Nintendo Switch tenemos por un lado las 2768 millones en EU los 2125 millones en Europa y el total de 1879 millones de consolas vendidas en territorio japonés.

It makes sense: Verizon has a big network and offers appealing prices. Before you switch your iPhone to Verizon you need to understand all of the costs that could be involved.

Go deeper on this topic by reading our article 7 Things To Do When Switching iPhone Phone Companies.

The Changing Phone-Company Landscape

It was only a few years ago that all of the major phone companies subsidized the cost of a new iPhone in exchange for customers signing up for a two-year contract. That meant that you could get an iPhone for a big discount off its full retail price if you just agreed to use that company for a few years. These days though phone-company subsidies and long-term contracts are mostly gone. That's why a new iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro can cost well over $1000 while a brand-new iPhone 8 or 8 Plus costs less than half that much.

As those subsidies and two-year contracts ended and customers began to pay the actual cost of the phone they started looking for phone companies who made the new phones affordable again. Most carriers came up with a combination trade-in and upgrade plan.

Switching Costs Vary Depending on Your Situation

Unfortunately these new plans are more complex than the old subsidized ones and make figuring out the costs of switching to Verizon trickier. In fact there are so many scenarios for switching we can't provide a single cost. What we can do though is give you a sense of common costs for switching your iPhone to Verizon.

Buying a New Phone vs. Bringing Your Own

The first thing you need to figure out when switching to Verizon is whether you'll have any cost for your phone. You can use a phone you already own or buy a new one.

If you're switching a phone you already own you need to know whether you owe any money to your old phone company for it. Many phone companies offer plans in which you pay for your phone in monthly installments rather than as a single upfront cost. This makes the initial cost of the new phone lower but it makes switching to a new phone company harder.

If you pay for your phone in installments you either need to wait to switch until the phone is paid off or pay the full amount you owe to your old phone company in one chunk. How much that depends on the model you bought and how many payments you have left but it can be a significant amount.

On the other hand you can choose to buy a new phone when you move to Verizon. You'll still need to pay any balance on the old phone but you may be able to get a promotional discount on the new one.

The best cheapest scenario for switching is to own your iPhone outright. When you do that you won't have any additional costs related to the phone itself.

You May Able to Trade in Your iPhone

You can save some money when moving to Verizon if you trade in a phone that you already own. As long as it's a relatively recent model and you don't have any installment payments left on it you may be able to get a few hundred dollars in trade-in value when you switch to Verizon. The exact models that qualify and the exact amounts they can net you change all the time so check the Verizon site.

The trade-in value is usually credited to your account over a period of months or years so it will only reduce your costs by a few dollars per month. Given that you might be better off selling a used iPhone before switching since that can net more money.

Watch Out for Early Termination Fees

Though they're much less common than they used to be you could have an Early Termination Fee (ETF) that you have to pay before leaving your old phone company. These are fees that are charged if you leave the company before an agreed-to period of time. Usually the fee is calculated on a pro-rated scale that goes down for every month you stay with the company. Check with your current phone company though because ETFs can cost hundreds.

Everyone Pays Activation Fees

Verizon charges a one-time $30 activation fee for every device you're adding to your plan when you switch.

The Bottom Line

As you can see there are a lot of factors that go into calculating your costs when switching to Verizon. And this is all before you figure out what monthly service plan you want how many phones you want on that plan and other things that factor into the cost.

That said as a potential switcher you actually have some advantages. Because there are relatively few contracts these days customers are able to switch between phone companies more often. That means that phone companies compete harder for your business. They offer limited-time promotions discounts and other offers to entice you. If you're thinking about switching keep an eye on the promotions and you may be able to get a great deal and save significant money but taking advantage of the right offer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHA6Ly9yb2JlcnRkeWVyLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzL2FyZS10aG9zZS12ZXJpem9uLXNhbGVzcGVvcGxlLWdvaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are those Verizon salespeople going door-to-door in Bethesda fake?,Bethesda news restaurants nightlife events and openings real estate crime reports and more - the way only a lifelong Bethesda resident like Robert Dyer can bring it to you.

The OnePlus 9 series has now launched in the US as indeed it has worldwide. However it encountered a potentially significant stumbling block in that market at its unveiling which was that neither its vanilla or Pro variants were capable of connecting to the Verizon network.

However George Koroneos a social-media rep for the carrier has confirmed that the new premium Android devices have now been certified by the company. Therefore they can now use Verizon 5G (and 4G/LTE) bands as well as those of its pay-as-you-go arm Visible.

Accordingly OnePlus fans with these carriers can as Koroneos notes go ahead and buy either new variant through their preferred vendor. This then inadvertently highlights the fact that the handsets are not available directly through the carrier as various previous generations (including the 8 and 7T series) of the OEM's flagships have been.

Similarly Visible does not offer the 9 or 9 Pro even though it does still stock the 8 5G. Therefore it now looks like the well-promoted partnership between OnePlus and Verizon has fallen through in 2021...something both parties have kept fairly quiet until now if so.

Retail and fashion worlds try their hand at cosmetics

Retailers and fashion companies in Korea are jumping on the cosmetics bandwagon.The growing luxury cosmetics market and the relatively low entry barrier are the primary reasons behind these companies' ambitions.Compared to other categories of products cosmetics leaves high margins and facility investment isn’t necessary as they can partner with existing equipment manufacturers.Shinsegae International a fashion arm of Shinsegae Group opened its first Poiret brand store at the department store’s main branch in central Seoul on Thursday.Poiret is a luxury cosmetics brand aiming to launch overseas including in France and the United States. The price of Poiret’s products is similar to those of Hermès Beauty. A lipstick costs 82000 won ($68) while a serum costs between 220000 won and 680000 won. A cream costs between 220000 won and 720000 won.The name Poiret comes from Paul Poiret one of the leading fashion designers of the early 20th century.Shinsegae International prepared for more than 10 years to launch Poiret and aims to become a global luxury cosmetics brand according to the company.Last year Shinsegae International acquired Swiss Perfection a high-end brand based in Switzerland. It also unveiled cosmetics brands like Yunjac in 2018 and founded a joint venture with Italian cosmetics maker Intercos in 2015.Emart also under Shinsegae Group launched cosmetics brand Stone Brick in 2019. It specializes in pigmented makeup like lipsticks and eye shadows and offers a Lego-like modulated system that enables users to match and stack each product like a brick puzzle.It was Emart’s second brand after skincare brand Sentence. Emart’s cosmetic ambition was evident when it launched health and beauty franchise Boots in partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance in 2017.None of the attempts have yet been successful. Boots pulled out in February last year while brick-and-mortar Sentence shops at Emart have all been shuttered.Another prominent player in the cosmetics industry this year is Hyundai Department Store.The company’s fashion brand The Handsome plans to launch its first cosmetics brand in the second half of this year.Last year Hyundai Department Store Group acquired a 51 percent stake in domestic cosmetics firm Cleanzen Cosmeceutical. Several months later it acquired a 27.9 percent stake in SK Bioland a supplier of chemical ingredients for cosmetics.Another fashion company LF tried its hand at vegan cosmetics and launched its brand Athe in 2019.A spokesperson for the company stated “The domestic cosmetics market is already saturated but we thought there is a new demand for vegan cosmetics” adding the brand is planning to go global.“Almost all cosmetics businesses suffered a decline in growth last year specifically on color makeup products” said Park Eun-kyung researcher at Samsung Securities. “At the same time demand for luxury products gotten stronger so there is a high chance the latecomers could outrun” companies like Amorepacific and LG Household & Health Care.Amorepacific and LG Household & Health Care are currently the industry's leaders.“A strong rebound in the cosmetics market is expected this year due to splurging from Covid-19” said Cho Mi-jin a researcher at NH Investment & Securities. “Online-centered brands will have an advantage over offline-centered brands because preference for online consumption still remains.”BY BAE JUNG-WON JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]",,,,,,,,,,,,
WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy93YWxtYXJ0LXdhbHRvbi1mYW1pbHktZm91bmRhdGlvbi1iZW50b252aWxsZS1hcmthbnNhcy1jb21wYW55LXRvd27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart's Company Town of Bentonville Arkansas,"In its rise as the nation’s largest retailer Walmart has pushed millions into the grinder of working poverty — employed but lacking a living wage health insurance job security dignity and a voice in the workplace — while decimating the community fabric of many suburbs and small towns. But while recently visiting my mother in Bentonville Arkansas my husband and I were astonished to discover that the Walton family is also building a professional-class urban utopia in and around its headquarters. The Waltons are using their charity the Walton Family Foundation (WFF) to bankroll the conversion of small-town Bentonville into a playground for Walmart’s management class and supply chain vendors with expansion of the arts foodie culture education transportation and mental and physical health associated with the consumption norms of a professional-class labor force. The WFF presents itself as an altruistic philanthropic charity dedicated to the well-being of the wider Northwest Arkansas (NWA) region. But the foundation’s self-appointed role of NWA’s regional developer actually functions as a three-pronged accumulation strategy for the Walton family. The WFF serves as a tax shelter in which the Walton family stashes its financial largesse to avoid paying Uncle Sam. In turn the Foundation uses the Waltons’ sheltered fortune to finance public improvement projects that are intended to attract skilled workers to Walmart headquarters region as it shifts to e-commerce retailing. Then as Bentonville develops economically the Walton family is well-positioned to capture rents that flow into the region as a consequence of the Foundation’s efforts to make the place a more appealing location to do business. The Waltons have deployed their charitable foundation to exploit Bentonville’s willingness to trade democratic control over planning and decision-making for access to Walton capital. In this twenty-first-century take on the company town WFF’s philanthropic urbanism scales up private control over urban governance structures from the piecemeal public-private partnership model of early neoliberal urban privatization efforts to one that is more all-encompassing — portending a dystopian urban future in which a corporation’s philanthropic arm has the ability to remake an entire metro area according to that corporation’s whims.

Walmart’s Urban Utopia For over a generation Walmart’s massive highly integrated distribution network has imposed itself across the global economy. The company is the world’s largest private employer with 2.2 million people working in 11000 stores across 27 countries generating $500 billion in yearly revenue. The Walton family has a majority stake in the firm; its members have a combined wealth of $228 billion as of 2020. The Walton Family Foundation’s putatively benevolent utopia-building in Bentonville and the NWA region are possible because of the Walton family’s rapacious economic and political activities in the rest of the world. Walmart began as a general-goods store in Bentonville (population 3000) in the 1950s. For the next seventy years the development of Bentonville and the larger NWA region was tied directly to being Walmart’s headquarters. Suppliers and business service firms seeking to do business with Walmart were required to migrate to the hinterlands of “upper South” Arkansas as a prerequisite for contracting with the company. As a result Bentonville’s population and regional importance grew alongside Walmart. Today Bentonville has a population of sixty thousand residents and is the center of the NWA metro region an amalgamation of small towns and suburbs of roughly 460000 in which 77 percent of Bentonville residents are white 9 percent are Latino 6 percent are Asian and 2 percent are black. Over the last decade as the retail sector shifts away from brick-and-mortar stores toward e-commerce Walmart’s leading edge has been challenged by new commerce giants chiefly Amazon. To compete with Amazon and modernize their retailing venture Walmart has built out their online store and invested in other e-commerce companies like Jet.com to manage new forms of distribution. This new phase of retail competition found Walmart operating from a position of comparative weakness as Walmart’s recruiters encountered difficulties luring the high-skill “creative class” labor necessary to compete in this more nimble online sphere to relocate to small town red-state conservative Bentonville Arkansas. Junior executives in training finance experts supply-chain vendors and technology workers were not attracted to quiet provincial red-state small-town life. Why would they forego coastal areas that provide a smorgasbord of professional-class lifestyle consumption opportunities? Walmart’s solution was to gentrify Bentonville and the wider NWA region with the cultural accoutrements and amenities the management class finds appealing. WFF was mobilized to address the problem of attracting high-skill labor by serving as the vehicle of community development. WFF became the region’s de facto planner and coordinated with government agencies on Bentonville’s downtown revitalization as well as on regional infrastructure and transportation upgrades. Foundation planners produced the Northwest Arkansas Design Excellence Program regional plan and brought in fifty international firms with expertise in landscape architecture and urban design museum curation and infrastructure engineering to realize urban planning initiatives. The Foundation’s planners implemented New Urbanist design enhancements promoting sustainability and community through increasing density enhancing neighborhoods’ walkability and creating arts scenes and public recreational and green spaces. WFF architects even invented an Arkansas architecture vernacular that pays homage to Arkansas landscape and (unintentionally) the big-box store: all foundation-financed buildings are stylized boxy buildings clad in wood corrugated tin or board-formed concrete. Foundation planners emphasized their commitment to preserving a sense of place by combating the alienation associated with urban sprawl. Bentonville’s town square is a throwback to a 1950s Main Street the center of town life. The original Walmart store has been turned into a museum of nostalgia enshrining the town’s patriarch and creating a sense of Bentonville’s specialness. The Walton foundation has helped finance build and maintain hundreds of miles of highly manicured mountain bike trails to make NWA a mountain-biking capital of the United States. Cyclists can ride the forty miles of the paved Razorback Greenway that connects the NWA region from Bella Vista to Fayetteville. Or they can hop on trails that are woven into Bentonville’s neighborhoods. The Foundation’s landscape designers crafted the three-hundred-acre Coler Mountain Bike Preserve into a network of biking and hiking trails and tree canopies. Visitors can refresh themselves at Airship Coffee an open-air café and beer garden in the Arkansas architecture vernacular featuring locally brewed beers and kombuchas or stretch out on the yoga platforms dotting the natural landscape. The road-bike infrastructure in Bentonville is top shelf compared to that of any other city in the United States. Landscape designers have turned their attention toward building an interconnected string of green spaces so that residents can traverse the city under a tree canopy or have dotted community-center spaces to have a picnic stage impromptu performances or scale outdoor climbing walls. To cultivate an arts scene WFF built two world-class art museums Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and its contemporary art-experience satellite The Momentary. Museumgoers can then while away the day in the museums’ various coffee labs or drink craft cocktails at The Momentary’s Tower Bar inspired by the high modernism of a 1960s airport lounge. In the evening film buffs can take in a movie at the Walton Foundation–supported Skylight Cinema. The foundation also brought in leaders in the hospitality industry to create a culinary scene with New American and ethnic fusion restaurants lining the town center plus a high-end food court 8th Street Market complete with a gourmet chocolatier a juicer a shuffleboard lounge and a burrito shop. WFF also recognized the premium that professional-class parents place on high-quality social services. To that end the Foundation spearheaded the Helen R. Walton’s Children’s Enrichment Center located blocks away from the future 350-acre corporate headquarters campus. The early-childhood daycare center offers small classrooms staffed by degreed teaching professionals guiding a “Whole Child” approach for children’s development. Recognizing that toxin-riddled products can hinder development the Center offers nutritional services and a chemical-free environment for the kids of Walmart’s managers. Down the road these children can attend the Foundation-supported Thaden School a six- to twelfth-grade private school par excellence. Similar to the Walton Childhood Development Center Thaden is planned for five to six hundred students allowing the school to limit fifteen students to a classroom. Thaden offers its parents and students “a core curriculum called ‘Wheels Meals and Reels’ which will use bicycles food and moviemaking to help teach math physics history sociology urban planning and other subjects. . . Thaden promises to be an oasis in a world where most schools teach to the standardized tests.” Thaden’s curriculum is designed for students to actively learn in the school’s greenhouse gardens teaching kitchen mountain-bike obstacle course and bicycle maintenance facilities. Students will also be able to show their films in the school’s $12 million arts center.

Bourgeois Enclave Simulation Bentonville is saturated with the infrastructure public services and cultural amenities that the professional classes strive for. And yet as a lived experience the town feels empty and ersatz — at best like a chintzy old-school diorama of New Urbanist professional-class consumption norms and at worst some simulated bourgeois enclave culled from a Black Mirror episode. On Bentonville’s streets the new housing development mimics the architectural styles of a San Francisco or Parisian streetscape. Bentonville boosters market differentiated specialized “districts” like the Cigar District when only a single cigar shop is open for business. The city is infused with sanitized street-art projects commissioned by the WFF with messaging that could have been transcribed straight from the brainstorming session of an HR department diversity retreat. One depicts a child of color whimsically chalk-drawing on the side of a building with an overall strap hanging off his shoulders like a Precious Moments figurine. While Bentonville claims to be a mountain-biking mecca the smell of weed that often accompanies mountain bikers was nowhere to be found in the two weeks we spent in Bentonville. And the nachos sucked. For all their pretense of “community-building through design” parochial paranoia abounds. While we biked around the Thaden School campus marveling at the school’s Scandinavian-inspired architecture we were stopped by a security guard in a golf cart. After telling us that suspicious teachers asked him to investigate us (two middle-aged people on bikes) he bragged how Thaden was designed without fences precisely to encourage the community to interface and activate the open campus design.

Walmart’s Dystopia The Walton Family Foundation’s putatively benevolent utopia-building in Bentonville and the NWA region are possible of course because of the Walton family’s rapacious economic and political activities in the rest of the world. Walmart’s global retailing dominance forms the bulk of the Walton family’s $228 billion fortune stemming from its ownership of roughly half of all Walmart stock. The story of how Walmart’s profits are made off the backs of the working poor is well-established. To achieve global retailing dominance Walmart’s business model has wreaked massive environmental havoc. Walmart organized a globally dispersed supply chain — reliant of course on fossil fueled transportation networks. To gain economies of scale Walmart favored store locations in small towns and on suburban peripheries altering the geography of consumption away from dense walkable Main Streets to fossil-fueled car-centric sprawl. In turn the Waltons use their spoils to fashion a wider economy polity and culture amenable to ever more profit making for the Waltons and other families like them. The Walmart corporation operates one of the largest corporate PACs in the United States and the Waltons understand how to use the two-party system to benefit them. Walmart money and connections helped Bill Clinton rise to national prominence in the late 1980s when he was governor of Arkansas. The Walmart PAC has been the second-largest corporate donor to the Republican Party. Walton family members donated to the presidential campaign of George W. Bush whose tax cuts on income from stock dividends enabled the Walton family to keep $607 million from federal tax collectors per year. While they pay as little taxes as possible the Waltons take as much as they can from the government. By paying its workers poverty wages Walmart socializes the costs of its labor force by pushing their employees to utilize federal anti-poverty programs to survive like food assistance Medicaid and public housing at the cost of around $6.2 billion a year. Local governments also subsidize costs associated with new Walmart store construction. New Jobs First documented over $1 billion in state and local government handouts to Walmart between 1983 and 2004. The Walton family is not acting altruistically by transforming Bentonville. Rather these investments are part of an accumulation strategy. The Walton Foundation also uses its financial power to capture government infrastructure grant dollars. Many federal grants for infrastructure projects require a local match to pay for upgrades. Localities starved by capitalists’ tax avoidance tactics often do not have the necessary local match to access federal grant money. But private foundation dollars can leverage federal revenues. For example the $38 million Razorback Regional Greenway was financed with a combination of $15 million from the Foundation and a $15 million grant from the US Department of Transportation with money from the municipality and the Arkansas State Highway Commission making up the rest. In summary: Walmart suppresses workers’ wages and siphons value out of the places they operate leaving behind a trail of environmental and community devastation. The Walton family then uses this money power to fuel its political power to ensure it can hold on to the wealth it captures and socialize the costs of its business activity. Making all scales of government pay for its accumulation deprives the public of revenue needed to fund the infrastructure architecture and playgrounds that Bentonville residents enjoy thanks to the WFF’s largesse.

Placemaking as Accumulation Strategy The Walton family is not acting altruistically by transforming Bentonville. Rather these investments are part of an accumulation strategy. First the primary reason behind constructing Walmart’s professionalized urban utopia is to lure skilled workers to Bentonville for the retailer to be competitive in e-commerce. Walmart’s competitive edge in online retailing will yield the Walton family dividends well into the future. Second the Walton family’s charitable investments in Bentonville allow the family to avoid an estimated $3 billion in federal estate taxes. Charitable trusts function as tax shelters for the very rich. According to Accounting Today  “When a donor sets [a trust] up the IRS assesses how much gift or estate tax is due based on how much of the trust’s assets will end up benefiting charity and how much will go to heirs.” In order to evade estate taxes the charitable trusts must donate a portion of the trust to charitable organizations or projects that work for the public good. “Whatever is left at the end [of a twenty- to thirty-year period] goes to a beneficiary usually the donor’s heirs without any tax bill.” Trusts can invest funds in ways that are not encumbered the same way charitable projects are. If investments return anything above the amount earmarked for charitable giving these returns can also be passed on tax free to heirs. For example Helen Walton the widow of Walmart’s founder Sam Walton stashed over a billion dollars in four trusts. The IRS tax rate on those funds was 3.6 percent. Her trusts invested these funds and “the trusts returned about 14 percent a year. . . That growth means the four Helen Walton trusts have been accumulating assets faster than they give them away. As of 2011 they held a combined $2 billion up from $1.4 billion in 2007.” Bentonville’s transformation is dependent upon a supposedly nonmarket actor the Walton Family Foundation working like a parallel state to set development priorities organize the logistics to realize these projects and assemble the capital to subsidize it all. Charitable trusts not only allow elites to shelter their wealth from the federal government but also empower the wealthy to shape public planning and policy without a democratic mandate. Taxes fund projects and policies that are accountable to the electorate; if average people don’t like the way elected officials are using tax dollars those people can vote the elected officials out of office. By depriving the federal government of tax revenues in order to hoard those funds for their own development priorities the Waltons’ charities deprive the American people of decision-making control over how wealth is allocated — and maintain de facto control over public policy. Since 2003 Walton family members have injected billions into the Walton Family Foundation through twenty-one charitable trusts. Before building their Bentonville utopia the Walton Family Foundation spent the bulk of its philanthropy dollars privatizing public education. The cruelty of the Foundation’s support for the Thaden School’s enriching curriculum and small class sizes will not be lost on critics of the Waltons’ neoliberal education reforms. The Waltons seek to supplant public education with a marketized “school choice” education deform centered on charter schools. By pitting privatized charter schools in competition with underfunded public schools for student enrollments the Waltons intend to drive neighborhood public schools out of the education market through closure. The Walton Foundation spent $1.3 billion to promote charter school proliferation. One in four charter schools in the United States now receive start-up funds from the Foundation. The Walton Foundation also promoted the use of standardized test scores — from which Thaden promises to be an oasis — to punish urban schools that were unable to perform at levels achieved by more resource-rich school districts. Charter school proliferation funded by the Walton Foundation deteriorates quality public education across entire school districts. With more schools to support local school districts make drastic cuts to frontline education trim curriculum to the bare bones and in some cases cram forty-plus students into classrooms. In cities like Chicago charter school proliferation led to massive public school closures that overwhelmingly impacted black communities that lost their community anchors. Today the Walton Foundation currently issues about $575 million in annual grants with half of those going to NWA redevelopment projects. Sam’s daughter Alice Walton was central in redirecting the Foundation’s charitable giving toward Bentonville’s redevelopment in 2005 when she laid the groundwork for the Foundation’s $1 billion investment in her vanity project Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Finally as the Walton Foundation’s placemaking projects successfully lure people to the NWA region the Waltons are well-positioned to capture value from growing real estate demand. Bentonville’s population is on track to double from its 2000 levels by 2025. Greater demand for housing has already increased prices for homes in Bentonville by more than $100000 between 2014 and 2019 where the total value of real estate has reached an all-time high of $2.64 billion. The Walton family owns Arvest Bank the largest home lender in the region. Arvest also finances the expansion of retail and office space serving as the region’s primary banking institution and issuing Paycheck Protection Program loans to small businesses totaling over $1 billion. On a smaller scale arts and culture consumption grew 300 percent between 2010 and 2015 generating $131 million in economic activity. The Waltons’ tax shelter partially finances amenities that attract high-skill labor which in turn facilitate further profit making from the niches of community building.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZm94MTcuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGgtbmFzaHZpbGxlLXdhbG1hcnQtcGFya2luZy1sb3QtdW5kZXItd2F0ZXItZmxvb2RpbmctY29kZS1yZWQtc2V2ZXJlLXdlYXRoZXItbWlkZGxlLXRlbm5lc3NlZdIBggFodHRwczovL2ZveDE3LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zb3V0aC1uYXNodmlsbGUtd2FsbWFydC1wYXJraW5nLWxvdC11bmRlci13YXRlci1mbG9vZGluZy1jb2RlLXJlZC1zZXZlcmUtd2VhdGhlci1taWRkbGUtdGVubmVzc2Vl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flooding in South Nashville Walmart parking lot cars under water,"The parking lot at a South Nashville Walmart is underwater.

GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $185.92 per share and the market cap of $337.5 billion The Walt Disney Co stock appears to be significantly overvalued. GF Value for The Walt Disney Co is shown in the chart below.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of The Walt Disney Co is 1.2% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Media - Diversified. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -35.5% which ranks worse than 88% of the companies in the industry of Media - Diversified.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months The Walt Disney Co's ROIC was 0.71 while its WACC came in at 8.49. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of The Walt Disney Co is shown below:

Well it seems that one of Walt’s biggest architectural inspirations has been ripped down even with some of his remaining family members fighting to save it.

According to NNY360 “Walt Disney used to stand at the corner of East 36th and Walnut streets in Kansas City and admire how the Westminster Congregational Church looked particularly like a castle.”

This church stood for over 110 years but recently was deemed an unsafe structure and ordered to be demolished.

If we take a look at the church we can definitely see how the architecture would have given Walt the idea of a castle. After going to the church every week and looking at it even when he wasn’t at a Sunday service it is clear that Walt’s love of castles developed at an early age — even before he moved to California in his early 20s in 1923.

The Walt Disney family used to attend the church as well so its destruction truly hit the family on a variety of levels. Walt’s nephew Charles Elias Disney shared “Uncle Walt was always taken by architecture. And when he would talk about architecture in later years he talked about that church.”

The article went on to report

“When he heard of the building’s potential demise Charles Elias Disney pleaded in a letter to the editor published in The Star that the building which is on the national and Kansas City lists of registered historic places be saved and restored.” Related: JUST IN: Ryan Seacrest Announces “Disney Family Singalong Volume II”!

It seems that Sam Unruh who purchased the building in 2016 spent over $100000 to try and fix all of the structural damages that needed to be repaired but more money was required. Unruh mentioned that the cost to fully repair the building would be astronomical and he could not afford it. Apparently although many wanted to save the building no one had the finances to help fix it.

Unfortunately even with Disney family’s appeal the building still ended up being demolished and crumbled to the ground. That being said after seeing Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort although the church may be gone we can see how its architecture inspired the castles that Disney fans still flock to to this day.

Do you think that the city should have worked harder to save the 100-year-old church that inspired Walt Disney?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1NjQ5NDYvY2hhcmFjdGVyLWRpbmluZy1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtY29udGVtcG9yYXJ5LWNoZWYtbWlja2V5cy1zYWZldHktc29jaWFsLWRpc3RhbmNpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Character Dining Wasn't Open At Disney World Early In The Pandemic. Here's What The Parks Have Done To Make It ...,"When Walt Disney World Reopened its doors mid-pandemic in July of this year things looked very different. There were mask requirements new guidelines and signage everywhere. Ride lines were spaced out. Temperatures were checked. But notably some attractions were shuttered while other options including parades and character dining seemed like relics of the past. Luckily Walt Disney World resorts and theme parks were merely trying to figure out the dynamics of how the parks could make character dining work in this new normal.

At Chef Mickey's and other character dining options there were two issues at hand. First how could Walt Disney World make character dining safe? Secondly at the Contemporary buffet-style restaurant how could Disney World make buffet dining safe?

How Character Dining Has Changed At Walt Disney World During The Pandemic

Chef Mickey’s was actually the first place I experienced character dining as a kid and I distinctly remember joyfully getting out of my chair to hug characters engage in close contact and ask for autographs. Over the past 12 months hugging strangers has no longer been an option and the new Chef Mickey’s asks children and adults to remain in their seats while eating. Anyone who is up out of their seats must remain masked.

Ultimately though this doesn’t overall detract from the experience. In its place characters are still ambling around and interacting with waves and other energetic movements. Your favorite characters are still involved in the fun and it still feels interactive--just in a slightly less up-close-and-personal way. In addition at the end of the meal diners also get a cute card from Mickey and friends that features signatures. It’s a nice little touch at the end of the meal particularly given the signature thing flew out the window as part of the social distancing measures.

How Buffet Dining Has Changed At Walt Disney World During The Pandemic

Here’s the doozy though. The problem with re-opening Chef Mickey’s had a little to do with it being a dining experience but I’d wager unlike full service restaurants like Be Are Guest or the Contemporary's own The Wave... of American Flavors it had more to do with the buffet component. This is seemingly evidenced by the fact Chef Mickey's opened with a new dining format before it even added characters again. Prior to the pandemic Chef Mickey’s was known for its buffet and popular for breakfast. Currently it’s only open between 7:30 and 12:30 p.m. and it is no longer a buffet-style restaurant.

Buffets have largely gone by the wayside at heavily populated entertainment institutions. A recent visit to Universal Studios’ Dockside Inn and Suites at Endless Summer Resorts mentioned that a buffet idea there had been shuttered in favor of more counter service-style options and that will likely not be changing as things got back to normal. The same is true at the Walt Disney World resorts and parks though in practice how the food is served looks very different. Chef Mickey’s has also shifted away from the traditional buffet in which you would leave your seat and fill your plate yourself. Now a server brings an absolute smorgasbord of food to your table.

Chef Mickey’s Has Shifted From A Buffet To More Of A Family-Style Adventure.

The current menu features items like Mickey-shaped pancakes a bread service including sweet rolls and these crisp donut-y fritters. Yogurt parfaits fruits and a large platter of meats including eggs bacon sausages and more are also placed front and center. The two major highlights for grownups though just may be the “Loaded” Potato-Cheese Casserole and the Banana Bread French Toast which is more like a dessert than a breakfast item with mascarpone cream and lots of chocolate.

All of these items are brought directly to your table along with your drink selection. Along with the family-style food you can also order tea coffee etc. and a variety of specialty drinks and smoothies that do cost extra. So keep that in mind as we start talking cost for the new version of character dining.

What Is The Cost Of Chef Mickey’s Family Feast?

Well having Mickey Minnie Goofy and co. on hand does not come cheaply. This is certainly not a meal you would want to indulge in if the character component is not important to you. For breakfast adults currently cost $42 dollars. Kids themselves cost $27 dollars. This is pricy but you do get a lot of food along with the character experience during your meal. For adults not having the hassle of getting plates for your kids or helping kids learn to get their own buffet food -- particularly if you are a parent of littles -- also makes the new Chef Mickey's experiences actually more desirable than the old way of doing things. So if you can swing the cost you're in for a pretty fun family meal.

Disney World has had to make a slew of changes since the pandemic first hit. Some of those changes will doubtless continue even as safety restrictions wane and the Orlando theme parks and resorts continue to re-open and expand hours and attraction offerings. We'll have to wait and see what the future holds for character dining but in some ways the new family-style offerings at Chef Mickey's are even more fun and intimate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi1gFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvcmFkaW8vZGF5Ni9hc3RyYXplbmVjYS1zLXZhY2NpbmUtbWlzaGFwcy10aGUtbWlnaHR5LWR1Y2tzLW5obC1oaXN0b3J5LXJ5YW4tbWNtYWhvbi10aGUtYmFyYml6b24taG90ZWwtYW5kLW1vcmUtMS41OTY0MTA2L3doeS1kaXNuZXktdHVybmVkLXRoZS1taWdodHktZHVja3MtbW92aWUtaW50by1hbi1hY3R1YWwtbmhsLXRlYW0tMS41OTY0MTEz0gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjU5NjQxMTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Disney turned The Mighty Ducks movie into an actual NHL team,"Disney and the NHL might seem as incompatible as fire and ice.

But in December 1992 these two worlds collided when the NHL awarded Disney its own expansion franchise who they called the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

""In hindsight it's very weird that the Ducks came from this company that did so many of these beloved animated icons especially geared toward children"" said CJ Woodling sports writer and co-founder of the blog Crash The Pond.

The path to a Disney-owned professional ice hockey team started with Disney's 1992 film The Mighty Ducks. The film follows the Mighty Ducks a losing pee-wee hockey team who are coached to championship glory by a Minneapolis defence attorney.

With a budget of $14 million Woodling says Disney didn't have high expectations for the film. But it ended up being a surprise success — it grossed more than $50 million between the United States and Canada according to IMDB.

""It just kind of became this phenomenon especially for a sport that specifically in the United States had only regional popularity"" he said.

But following The Mighty Ducks' success other regions in the U.S. started to catch on to the hockey craze.

One of those regions was southern California which was in the middle of a hockey boom due in large part to Wayne Gretzky's 1988 trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings according to Woodling.

""So [Disney] knew that there was a viable market here in southern California to create a team specifically close to Disneyland their original theme park [in California]"" he said.

Disney's vision was shared by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman who assumed his position a couple of months after Disney was awarded an NHL team. Bettman has a reputation for expanding hockey to non-traditional markets and during his tenure the NHL has successfully expanded into states like Florida Texas and Arizona.

""This was a perfect opportunity for [Disney CEO] Michael Eisner and Disney's desire to use this team as a marketing tool to get into an area that has a lot of growth potential and at the same time matching Gary Bettman's vision to grow into non-traditional markets"" he said.

They cared more about saving their money and getting a good return on their marketing investment than they did in providing a championship team. - CJ Woodling

Disney branding

The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim made their NHL debut on Oct. 8 1993 but not everyone was pleased.

""When the Mighty Ducks name was announced and the branding was announced and Disney was going to be the owner of the team a lot of the traditional markets [and] a lot of the traditional journalists really didn't take the team seriously and they were kind of laughed off"" Woodling said.

But Disney wasn't ashamed to attach their brand to the team.

""To just put into perspective how much Disney viewed the Ducks as a marketing tool their very first home game … was preceded by a 20-minute pre-game show that was essentially a Disney on Ice production featuring a bunch of Disney characters"" he said.

Disney was also happy to incorporate the Mighty Ducks into their other properties. The team's cartoon logo and jersey were used in movie sequels D2: The Mighty Ducks and D3: The Mighty Ducks and the team's mascot Wild Wing starred in his own short-lived animated series.

Woodling says Disney's branding paid off for a while. At one point the team reportedly accounted for 80 per cent of the NHL's $1 billion in merchandising revenues.

'Successful blueprint for companies'

Though the team experienced some highs under Disney ownership it couldn't escape its tag as a marketing gimmick.

""For a number of years it was pretty clear that the Walt Disney Company didn't necessarily care so much about winning"" Woodling said. ""They cared more about saving their money and getting a good return on their marketing investment than they did in providing a championship team.""

This led to Disney selling the team to Henry and Susan Samueli in 2005. The Samuelis rebranded the team to the Anaheim Ducks and changed its logo and colours.

""The Samuelis wanted to make the team grow up"" he said. ""They wanted to leave that past in the past and they wanted to become a serious hockey team.""

The team has seen some success since the rebranding — they won their only Stanley Cup in their first season as the rebranded Ducks. But when they can the Ducks will throw it back to their Disney era.

This season for example the Ducks brought back a ""very cartoonish Wild Wing-jumping-out-of-the-ice jersey from the 1994 season"" for the NHL's reverse retro line recalled Woodling.

The first episode of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers a new series based on the franchise's first film has also premiered on Disney+.

""There's clearly interest and there's clearly demand for new refreshed content with a twinge of nostalgia"" Woodling said.

Though the Mighty Ducks' Disney era didn't bring a championship to Anaheim Woodling considers it a ""successful blueprint for companies to plunge plenty of marketing dollars into sports and to have sports become more of the popular culture more of the mainstream culture [and] more of this consumer culture.""

Westborough – It’s no secret the world is facing a climate crisis. Air pollution is covering city skylines oceans are filling with trash and animals are losing their habitats due to deforestation.

That’s why Zero Waste Westborough is fighting to make a difference in the environment and the community.

Zero Waste Westborough forms out of Waste Management Task Force

Zero Waste Westborough is a subgroup of the Westborough Board of Health’s Waste Management Task Force.

Last fall some members of the task force realized there was more work to be done than what the task force could accomplish during its monthly meetings. So four task force members formed Zero Waste Westborough and began meeting at least once a week. Their mission is to educate and engage the community in reducing waste.

Westborough waste problem mounts

According to the Westborough Board of Health the town threw out 2367 pounds of waste per household in 2018.

Inspired by that fact Zero Waste hosts community meetings to teach people not only how to reduce waste but also why it’s important to do so.

“You just have to be able to inform people of and change their mindsets that [not all] waste should go in the trash” said ZWW member Lauren Buerstatte. “This is something valuable that should be taken care of appropriately.”

Zero Waste focuses on compost

The U.S. Department of Environmental Protection estimates that 24 percent of waste is organic material that can be composted.

With all that food going down the drain ZWW is currently focused on encouraging Westborough residents to start composting their leftovers instead of tossing them in the garbage.

“I don’t think that there’s any reason Westborough shouldn’t be composting other than it’s unknown and it’s not something that we have done” said Zero Waste member Nathan Askew. “It’s really meeting people where they are and taking them on the journey.”

Buerstatte shares the same hopes. She got her whole family to begin composting. After getting her children involved her neighbors got on board. That soon sparked a chain reaction.

“It’s a little bit just from my family but if every family starts composting in one way or another it’s just a really good starting point” said Buerstatte.

Westborough residents indeed don’t have to travel far to compost. They can do it right at the Westborough transfer station. All that’s needed is a recycling sticker which they can get for free from the town.

Zero Waste seeks community engagement

Working on education Zero Waste has also been seeking creative ways to engage the community in reducing waste.

It recently held an art contest where 45 students submitted a logo design for ZWW. The contest encouraged both students and their parents to think deeper about composting and their carbon footprint.

A Glimpse of Blockchain Technology

In most simple words Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer ledger that maintains a complete copy of transactional records in a transparent and immutable manner. Instead of relying on a third-party intermediary or any centralized authority it ensures complete decentralization.

There are various exciting features of this technology but among them immutability is unquestionably one of its key characteristics.

Although many people still relate Blockchain with cryptocurrency today the technology has its footprints in almost all industries including supply chain healthcare logistics finance and with the continuous advancements in technology garbage collection is no more an exception.

Implementing Blockchain in waste management can enable governments to track and monitor waste right from its generation(source) to its disposal(destination) bringing a greener environment.

How Crypto and Blockchain Improve Waste Collection

Every day the planet drowns under an ever-increasing amount of garbage wreaking havoc on human health the economy and the atmosphere. Systematic and effective waste disposal has emerged as a major concern in several countries including developing nations. The reason for this vast waste management is due to the increased pace of urbanization and accelerated rate of population.

Since the waste management process involves various steps such as segregation transportation recycling disposal tracking and monitoring such complicated processes are nearly hard even for government institutions. But such a process can be streamlined by having a single platform to track all waste management activities right from their origin to their disposal.

Let’s delve deeper and explore how Blockchain can help in tackling waste management.

Prevents Fraud and Manipulation

The present disposal of waste management is unfair lacks transparency and proper documentation. What happens is when contractors dispose of the waste material they submit a waste plan report to the municipality office for receiving the payment which is based on the quantity of waste they are collecting and presenting. There is no proper channel that can check the submitted and hence these reports are easily manipulated leading to payment frauds at a large scale.

Blockchain can eradicate this fraud by offering a single decentralized P2P platform where the whole process can be traced and cross-checked.

Streamlining Documents

In traditional documentations there are always the possibilities of loss of information. But having information on distributed ledger eradicates such problems as information is stored in an immutable and transparent manner like forever. Moreover technology permits a massive ledger of data to be accessed securely by various stakeholders.

Blockchain Has Already Entered Garbage Collection: Here is How

Seeing the potential benefits of Blockchain various players have entered this space to tackle waste management. Ivan Zubilewicz an entrepreneur from Campo Viera in northeastern Argentina has developed a cryptocurrency that he hopes would improve and enhance local waste management.

Although the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency hasn’t developed in Argentina yet Viera will soon be utilizing JellyCoin (in a limited capacity) in order to deal efficiently with waste collection.

Another similar community-driven approach is carried out by a nonprofit group called CITAG which stands for Citizen Involved & Technology-Assisted Governance) in Bengaluru city India. According to Shobha Ananda Reddy who is CITAG’s secretary and an environmental scientist her municipal government Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has a Blockchain-based app to manage waste management. For now CITAG’s Blockchain is in a development phase but Reddy believes that if successfully implemented data tampering would become a non-factor and the record of citizen complaint filings and collector-marked pickups would be more precise. In addition it will also include feedback to higher-ups on who is doing well and who is not.

RecycleGO based in New York City is another Blockchain-driven waste management project that aims to integrate software and technology into recycling. CEO Stan Chen believes that the world needs extensive scalable solutions for tracking in terms of attaching data to human activity to provide social impact behavior to be monitored measured and credited.

Concluding Lines

This has brought us to the end of our discussion. There is no doubt regarding whether Blockchain can revamp the entire waste management industry or not. By maintaining accountability in waste management by placing producers customers and waste management workers into a network together Technology can give a new definition to the environment.

Not only Blockchain but Blockchain coupled with IoT sensors can help in tracking how much waste has been collected how much can be recycled how much is hazardous and non-biodegradable and everything bringing a cleaner and greener environment for one and all.

Around two-and-a-half lakh families come under the Kollam diocese the first Catholic diocese in the country. The letter written by Bishop Dr Paul Antony Mullassery accused the LDF government of trying to destroy the livelihood of fishermen and selling out the fisheries sector to big businesses. It criticised the government over a decision now abandoned to allow an American company to conduct fishing in deep seas off the coast of Kerala and carry out onshore fish processing operations; and for introducing the Kerala Fish Auctioning Marketing and Quality Control Bill during the pandemic without consulting any stakeholders.

Although the bishop also had some harsh words about the central government it was his criticism of the state government that caused a stir in poll-bound Kerala.

Sure enough the government promptly launched a counteroffensive. It defended the new legislation – it said the law will stop exploitation ensure fair price to workers and assure quality of fish. The government however did not stop there. It criticised the Church itself accusing it of working with the opposition. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan went so far as to say that Christians will have reason to doubt the sanctity of all pastorals in future.

Father Antony the secretary of the pastoral council was still visibly disturbed when The Federal met him at the Holy Family Roman Catholic Church in Kollam a few days later. He was angry about the accusations and blamed left-wing workers for online attacks against the local church authorities.

“How can we trust this government?” Fr Antony said referring to the MoU between Kerala Inland Navigation Corporation and EMCC International for the latter to invest ₹5300 crore for research and development to promote deep sea fishing in the state.

The CM cancelled the MoU after the Leader of the Opposition the Congress’ Ramesh Chennithala denounced it at a press conference last month. “It was withdrawn only because it was exposed. What if they bring it back once they are voted back?” Fr Antony asked.

Fr Antony insisted that the Church was right in speaking for the rights of the fishing community.

The Kollam diocese’s stand however has made other dioceses uncomfortable who would rather stay away from overtly political matters. “We do not want to politicise these issues” Father James Kulas the coordinator of the Kerala Latin Catholic Council – a body of 12 Latin diocese in the state – told The Federal. “We also have grievances but we do not want those grievances to be used in the election.”

Electoral Importance

Kerala’s fishing community occupies an important space in electoral politics. The state has 222 fishing villages dotted along the length of its 589.5-kilometre coastline.

The fisherfolk are not a homogeneous group; they don’t vote for one party en masse; their choices vary – according to caste and cultural geographical and political affiliations. But many of them – like the farmers who work someone else’s land – work for big boat owners who are against the steep increase in licence fee and fines stipulated in the new Act.

“The annual licence fee for boats less than 20 metres in length and with 250hp engines has been revised to Rs50000 from Rs5000. Fines for violating fishing norms have risen three- fourfold to around Rs2 lakh. This is unacceptable” said Peter Mathias president All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators’ Association a 4000-strong body.

Mercykutty Amma who as fisheries minister bears the brunt of the criticism is unmoved. “Only owners of big boats and trawlers will have to pay” she told The Federal. “The rules will put an end to exploitation by middlemen. Ordinary fishermen will not be affected.”

Mercykutty Amma represents Kundara constituency in Kollam and is again contesting from here. She told The Federal that the church along with the opposition and boat owners and middlemen were waging a “false campaign” against the government.

Complete Dominance

The LDF enjoys complete dominance in Kollam. It won all 11 constituencies in the district in 2016 and did well in last year’s municipal elections. The fishing community constitutes the majority of the population in at least five constituencies: Eravipuram Kollam Karunagappalli Chavara and Kundara. Kundara the constituency represented by the fisheries minister has a substantial population of cashew workers and inland fishermen. (The fisheries sector accommodates 3.13 per cent of the total population of Kerala. Most of them are in the marine sector meaning they venture out to the sea. Others work inland fishing in rivers and lakes.) Thiruvananthapuram which is adjacent to Kollam also has a sizeable population of fishermen across four constituencies: Vizhinjam Kovalam Thiruvananthapuram and Nemom. The LDF holds 10 out of 14 seats in the district. The BJP holds Nemom its lone seat in Kerala.

Key Part of Community

Christian fisherfolk in Kerala concentrated in southern and central parts of the state belong to the Catholic community. The Church is the main institution around which the community is organised. Historically the institution has not only looked after the laity’s religious wellbeing but also their socioeconomic concerns. It remains to be seen however what effect the bishop’s pronouncements will have on the election.

The Federal spoke to several fishermen in the southern districts of Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram who cautiously welcomed the new law.

M Joseph a fisherman in Thankassery Harbour praised the legislation. “Raising fines for catching certain species in breeding season is perfectly fine as far as we are concerned” he said. “Small-scale fishermen don’t do these things only the big players with mechanised trawlers. We all think that the government should raise the fines further.”

Joseph was among those who came to the rescue of Malayalis during the catastrophic ‘flood of the century’ that hit Kerala in 2018. He received an award from the government for his selfless work saving lives. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called the fishermen “Kerala’s own army”.

Joseph’s friends shared his views but they were pessimistic about the future.

“It does not matter who wins. Our plight will not improve” said Sebastian who also received an award for his rescue work during the floods. “It was an honour to be called ‘Kerala’s own army’ but that does not make our lives any better.”

Climate Change

In the past few years a series of extreme weather events – cyclones floods – have hit Kerala and communities across the coastal belt have been badly affected.

The fishermen The Federal spoke to admitted that the government had stepped up to the task and provided much-needed assistance.

“People were paid compensation those who lost homes were given houses or flats under the LIFE Mission” said Pani Adima John the councillor representing Kottappuram ward in Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. John was referring to the government’s Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment scheme which provides financial assistance and housing options to people from economically weaker sections and low-income groups. An independent John refuses to join either of the two major parties in Kerala. However he acknowledges that the LDF government has handled recent crises deftly – a sentiment echoed by the fishermen we spoke to.

Joseph and Sebastian both received Rs10 lakh compensation in the aftermath of the cyclone. “We also received food kits and welfare cheques without fail” Joseph said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdGl6ZW4uY28udHovdGFuemFuaWEvbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC9tdi1saWVtYmEtc3RpbGwtcGxpZXMtb24tbGFrZS10YW5nYW55aWthLWV2ZW4tYXQtMTAwLXllYXJzLTI1MjI1OTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MV Liemba still plies on Lake Tanganyika even at 100 years,"Lake Tanganyika. On Lake Tanganyika a century-old relic of World War I that became the stuff of Hollywood legend still plies the slate-grey waters - but it is not clear for how much longer.

Once a feared gunship defending the African lake for Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany the legendary vessel - which inspired the 1951 classic “The African Queen” - has been sunk and refloated twice renamed and repurposed as a ferry.

As it marks 100 years of service the MV Liemba originally a symbol of colonial power is now an essential lifeline for the people who live along the lakeshore. “Liemba is the only safe means of transport along the lake” said Mathew Mathia Mwanjisi the ship’s captain.

“Historically it’s very important to Tanzania as a country but again it’s very important for the people along the coast of Lake Tanganyika.” The tale of the warship and the battle for Lake Tanganyika inspired British novelist C.S. Forester to write his 1935 novel “The African Queen” later adapted by Hollywood in the movie of the same name starring Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. Piled high with pineapples maize and rice - as well as up to 600 passengers - the MV Liemba navigates the world’s longest lake every two weeks from Kigoma Tanzania in the north to Mpulungu Zambia in the south.

The journey of some 600 kilometres is meant to take some three days but is often longer as the ship hops from village to village transforming into a lively aquatic carnival at each stop. Children in leaky canoes paddle alongside to sell fresh mangos.

‘History of the country’

Lai Bakari Kiunguti is a ship-bound trader with a makeshift stall below the deck to serve the ship’s passengers. Like many others her livelihood depends on the boat and as the MV Liemba ages she worries for the future. “When MV Liemba stops travelling I will stay at home. That would make me poor because it means I wouldn’t work” she said.

The MV Liemba requires constant maintenance and may not stay afloat much longer without a complete overhaul. Tanzania asked the German government for help repairing or replacing the vessel in 2011 and KfW a German government-owned development bank is assessing whether rehabilitation might be possible.

But it may be cheaper to simply replace the MV Liemba with a new ferry ending a century of fascinating history. “It is carrying the history of the country” said Bertram Mapunda a professor of history at Tanzania’s University of Dar es Salaam.

Mapunda said the ship should be celebrated and preserved just as German colonial-era buildings and railway lines are throughout the country. The MV Liemba began its life in a shipyard in Papenburg Germany in 1913 where it was named the Graf von Götzen after German East Africa’s former governor.

Before setting sail the steamer was taken apart packed into 5000 numbered crates and shipped to Dar es Salaam.

Recent history

MV Liemba has been operating almost non-stop since 1927. In 1948 the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation (EAR&H) took over running the ferry allowing it to link services with the Central Line from Kigoma to Dar es Salaam. From 1976 till 1979 the ship was overhauled. At this time twin diesel engines replaced the original steam engines.

The driving force behind this renovation was Patrick “Paddy” Dougherty. He was born on March 18 1918 in Downpatrick and did an apprenticeship at Harland & Wolff in Belfast. Subsequently he served during the Second World War in the Royal Navy and became a ship’s engineer.

In the sixties and seventies he worked for the EAR&H in Kisumu Kenya as first engineer and later as chief engineer on the ferries of Lake Victoria. After the renovation of MV Liemba he left Tanzania.

In 1977 the EAR&H was dissolved and the new Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) took over operation of MV Liemba. In 1993 the TRC gave Liemba an overhaul managed by the Danish shipyard OSK ShipTech A/S sponsored by the Danish International Development Agency.

The rebuild included the deck house the electronic system and the pipes renovation of the cabins of the passengers and crew new MAN engines of 460 kW each from MAN installation of a hydraulic crane on the foredeck and conversion of the rear cargo hull into a passenger room (capacity increase to 600 passengers.

To improve safety MV Liemba received a double bottom in the area of the forward cargo compartment. The ship was re-measured and the Danish engineers found that Liemba was 71.40 metres long and 10 metres wide.

With the new machines the ship can achieve a speed of 11 knots. MV Liemba now has ten first-class passenger cabins (double bed) and two VIP cabins. Eighteen second-class cabins (six double and 12 quad-beds) are also available.

In 1997 the UNHCR used MV Liemba and MV Mwongozo to repatriate more than 75000 refugees who had fled Zaire during the First Congo War following the overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko.

MV Liemba made 22 trips between Kigoma and Uvira during this five month operation. In 1997 TRC’s inland shipping division became a separate company the Marine Services Company Ltd.

In 2011 TRC wrote to the Federal Government of Germany requesting assistance in either renovating or replacing the vessel. The German authorities undertook a study that it is thought concluded that it would be cheaper to build a new ship than renovate Liemba.

The final request for financial help fell between the governments of Lower Saxony where the ship was built and the federal government in Berlin with the then President of Germany Christian Wulff stating that the vessel had a “singular history” and performed an “indispensable service” to the people of East Africa.

Scuttled sunk afloat

Then it was taken by railway and porter to the shore of Lake Tanganyika where it was reassembled in 1915 armed with cannon and put to work defending the waters against Belgian and British soldiers.

Measuring 70 metres long and weighing 1200 tonnes the Graf von Götzen dominated the lake for nearly a year dwarfing all other ships.

But when the outnumbered German land forces retreated the warship was filled with cement and scuttled. The Belgians salvaged the Graf von Götzen towing her to Kigoma harbour after the war but she sank again during a storm.

In 1921 Winston Churchill ordered the ship raised once more. Despite the years submerged the Graf von Gotzen was still useable because the German crew hoping to see the ship sail again had coated the engines in thick protective grease before sinking her.

Rechristened the MV Liemba after the local name for the lake it was put into service as a cargo and passenger ferry in 1927.

The original steam engines continued to operate until the mid-1970s when they were replaced with diesel. Subsequent books such as Giles Foden’s “Mimi and Toutou Go Forth” have also explored the ship’s history and its role in the Great War’s East African Campaign.

The MV Liemba has also seen the effects of more recent conflicts in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1997 she was used by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) to carry more than 75000 refugees returning home to DR Congo after fleeing war.",,,,,,

CompuCom is an IT managed services provider (MSP) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of The ODP Corporation (Office Depot/Office Max).

The MSP's workforce of over 8000 employees provides hardware and software repair remote support and other tech services to high-profile companies including Citibank Home Depot Wells Fargo Target Trust Bank and Lowe's.

Some expenses to be covered by cyber insurance

""The Company estimates the loss of revenue to be between $5.0 million and $8.0 million as a result of the incident (primarily because of CompuCom's need to temporarily suspend certain services to certain customers)"" CompuCom's parent company ODP Corporation revealed on Friday.

""In addition the Company expects to incur expenses of up to $20 million of which the Company assumes approximately $10 million will be accrued through the first quarter of 2021.""

The expenses are mainly related to the company's ongoing efforts to restore impacted systems and services as well as ""to address certain other matters resulting from the incident.""

CompuCom also expects that a share of the expenses incurred after the ransomware attack will be covered by cyber insurance.

""The Company carries insurance including cyber insurance which it believes to be commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations and expects that a portion of these costs may be covered by insurance"" ODP Corporation added.

The MSP is still working on restoring service delivery to customers since the ransomware hit its network and expects to ""have service delivery restored to substantially all of its customers"" by the end of March.

Ransomware deployed using Cobalt Strike beacons

After discovering that DarkSide ransomware's operators started encrypting CompuCom's systems the MSP disconnected their access to some customers to block the malware from spreading.

The company also notified the customers that they were compromised by malware soon after the attack but didn't share any info about a possible ransomware attack.

After going through the first stages of the incident's investigation CompuCom reached out to customers with a 'Customer FAQ Regarding Malware Incident' containing additional details.

According to the FAQ the threat actors installed Cobalt Strike beacons on several systems in CompuCom's environment beacons that allowed them to steal data spread to other network devices and eventually deploy the ransomware payloads on February 28.

Dahmen edged fellow American Sam Ryder and Puerto Rican player Rafael Campos by a stroke. He shot a 2-under 70 in the final round to finish at 12-under 276 pressed all the way to the final putt. He received a first-place check for $540000.

At a gusty Corales Puntacana Resort Dahmen joined former Huskies C.T. Pan (2019 RBC Heritage) and Nick Taylor (2020 Pebble Beach Pro-Am) as recent PGA Tour champions.

Dahmen originally from Clarkston Washington played a single season for the UW in 2007 before turning professional.

He hadn't won as a pro golfer since 2014 when he finished first in a pair of Mackenzie Tour events in Canada. His best PGA Tour finish had been runner-up at the 2018 John Deere Classic and the 2019 Wells Fargo Championship.

For that matter Dahmen entered this event after missing cuts in six of his seven events this year. Victory couldn't have come at a better time.

""It has been a tough start to the year"" Dahmen said. ""To turn around those missed cuts to this is pretty incredible. This is unbelievable. This is awesome.""

The event was held opposite the WGC Dell Technologies Match Play in Austin Texas.

In the final round Dahmen birdied four of the first seven holes to build a significant lead but he bogeyed the par-3 11th and par-5 14th to enable others to push him to the end.

""It's so fricking hard to win a golf tournament"" he said. ""I knew it was hard but I can't believe how hard it actually is.""

Dahmen 33 is one of the tour's endearing personalities traveling to all of his golf events accompanied by his wife of a year and a half Lona. He mentioned how she's supported him emotionally and financially working multiple jobs when he was playing mini-tours and had no money.

""It’s never as bad as you think it is and it’s never as good as you think it is but Lona’s been great for me"" he said. ""She still gives me a hug and a kiss and tells me to go kick butt so it’s been good.”"

Wuheqilin/Handout via REUTERS

A digital illustration by a prominent Chinese propaganda artist mocking Western governments media and businesses critical of labour conditions in Xinjiang has gone viral on China's social media.

The digital art by the artist who goes by the name Wuheqilin referring to a one-horned Chinese mythical beast shows two figures with white pointed hoods interviewing a scarecrow in a field of cotton and Black slaves.

One of the journalists holds up a microphone with a logo that looks similar to ""BBC News"".

At the bottom of the illustration reads: ""Can you tell us what unfair treatment you have suffered Miss Scarecrow?""

""I've been sexually assaulted and abused"" a placard next to the scarecrow says.

Steadying the cross on which the scarecrow is held is a hooded figure wearing a Minneapolis police uniform an apparent reference to the police officer who pressed his knee on the neck of a dying George Floyd last year.

Western governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps drawing fierce denials from Beijing who says the camps are vocational training centres that help combat religious extremism.

Earlier this year BBC reported that women in the camps had been subject to rape sexual abuse and torture.

The Chinese foreign ministry said at the time that the BBC report was ""without factual basis"" and the people interviewed by the BBC have been ""proved multiple times"" to be ""actors disseminating false information"".

Last week Swedish clothing retailer H&M faced a public backlash in China when social media users circulated a statement the company made last year announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.

Chinese celebrity endorsers have since dropped several foreign retail labels including Nike.

The assault on Western brands followed coordinated sanctions by the United States the European Union Canada and Britain on Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang which Washington has said have amounted to genocide.

In Wuheqilin's illustration which has garnered 1 million ""likes"" the blood-red letters ""HM"" can be seen carved onto the trunk of a tree while in the background is a black antique cotton scale that looks similar to Nike's swoosh logo.

Entitled ""Blood Cotton Initiative"" the illustration also refers to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) an international group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang citing human rights concerns.

Nike H&M and a number of Western brands are BCI members.

Wuheqilin who has 2 million followers on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo in December published a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child drawing the fury of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

It showed a “general improvement” in controls compared to the last report in 2017 but Auditor General Caroline Spencer stated that “[e]ntities still need to improve their policies the monitoring of purchasing card use and better manage transaction limits.”

The Australian National Audit Office report into three government departments’ Credit Card use in 2017. These were Australian Public Service Commission the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (now The Department of Home Affairs) reflected why controls around credit card use was so important:

“Credit cards offer a transparent flexible and efficient way for Australian Government officials to obtain cash goods or services to meet business needs. The misuse of credit cards can expose an entity to risks such as waste and fraud. Instances of misuse and weaknesses in relevant entity controls attract considerable parliamentary and public interest and cause reputational damage to affected entities and the Australian Government.”

They aren’t wrong: misuse of public funds by politicians has long been fodder for the press gallery. In 2019 Nationals deputy leader Bridget McKenzie was given a shellacking in the media for racking up $12550 in travel bills per week. I’m sure you as a reader can think of a few off the top of your head.

If the public sector isn’t careful this could happen more often as we transition toward digital wallets.

Virtual credit cards and digital wallets will soon become the norm. Savvy Finance conducted a survey about sentiments toward how people transact – and 47% said they prefer paying via digital wallet. Digital wallets and virtual credit cards will become as ubiquitous as the smartphones they reside on.

Credit cards are not created equal – some have different interest rates interest-free days and of course rewards programs. So who is benefiting from those?

It’s not just about purchases

We as taxpayers understand that there’s a lot of travel and expenses involved in government. Travelling to conduct inspections attending meetings in Canberra or a state capital reviews representing the government at forums and what have you. It is unreasonable to think the government will simply “shift over to Zoom” and never spend a cent on travel again. The WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development spent almost $20 million on credit cards (2018-19). WA is a big place; no one will dispute that travel will eat up a lot of resources. Purchases and their regulation isn’t the problem.

In the ANAO report it found:

“Each of the entities used online workflows which required pre-approval for travel and purchasing. The majority (94% or more) of transactions tested had been appropriately authorised were supported by evidence of acquittal (such as a receipt or tax invoice) and had been verified and approved consistent with entity requirements. Goods and services purchased were reasonable in light of the entities’ business needs and credit card policies.”

Having proper documentation in place is part of having a transparent and accountable public service. One of the recommendations in the WA Auditor General’s report was to:

“periodically review the use of purchasing cards within the entity to identify and act on any shortcomings such as whether there are too many cards within the entity or that they are not being utilised to their full advantage.”

Information is scarce as to whether the objective of the public service is to maximise value from the use of credit cards via choosing charge or credit cards with the lowest possible interest rate or highest amount of interest free days or to use platinum or gold rewards to their fullest to reduce expenditure on travel and accommodation. This is in concert with the Australian government framework for using credit cards:

“in deciding whether to use a Commonwealth credit card or credit voucher you must consider whether it would be the most cost-effective payment option in the circumstances[.]”

But is the public service using the most cost-effective cards? How are we the public to know? What happens when a “tap and go” culture becomes the default?

Switching to lower-cost alternatives to credit cards as part of a review process

At current there is one provider of credit or charge cards for travel and accommodation. It’s mandatory for non-corporate government entities to use a Diners Club card but optional for Procurement Payment Services.

The Whole of Australian Government (WoAG) procurement arrangements encompass: “domestic and international air services; travel management services; accommodation program management services; travel and card related services and car rental services. Under the Arrangements it is mandatory for entities to make payment for flights domestic accommodation and car rental through a Diners Club account.”

Processes and procedures exist to reconcile accounts minimise fraud confirm individual responsibility and recall unused or expired cards.

Periodic reviews of processes and procedures is the standard for any government department. However factoring in whether the card is cost-effective under all circumstances should also be considered. It should be able to figure out if it’s compliant with the WoAG standards; balances low interest rates with longer interest free days; if insurance and other extras are offset by the interest rate or annual fees; and if rewards points are simply being tallied for the sake of being tallied. Rewards points could be used effectively if monitored and governed by proper procedures and processes.

This would capture the spirit and the letter of WA Auditor General’s first recommendation:

“have appropriate [policies] and administrative systems in place for the use of government purchasing cards.”

In my view using the market of credit cards in a regular review process would further cement trust and faith in the public sector when using public funds.

Now that government employees are increasingly accessing credit and charge cards on their phone making them as cost-effective as possible should be the new priority when reviewing processes.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months Sherwin-Williams Co's ROIC was 13.30 while its WACC came in at 7.16.

Reader's Digest: How did Good Cake Day get started and how would you best summarise what you offer?

Chinelo: My cousin and a good friend of mine both had their own businesses so I felt inspired to start my own. I wanted to do something that would allow me to help people feel special and loved. I’ve always loved a good cake and reconciling that with knowing how special we feel on our birthdays I decided to start a cake business. After spending two years learning how to make cakes online I registered Good Cake Day at Companies house on 21 December 2016.

Four years later I help people feel connected to their loved ones glamming up their special occasions with unique buttercream cakes and luxury brownies. I call this my BLUSH Manifesto: Beautiful Loved Unique Special and Human.

RD: How have previous roles helped you in what you do now?

Chinelo: I have four degrees in Law and International Business and always dreamed of being a commercial lawyer at an international law firm in London. On my rebellious days I dreamt of being a business consultant. My LinkedIn profile reads like this: law firm law firm law firm construction company construction company owner of a cake company!

It seems unlikely but my corporate background has given me the soft skills needed to run my business. From attention to detail to a knack for research I keep finding myself using skills I learnt in law firms and construction companies in my business. For example creating trackers on excel reviewing legal documents and something as ""simple"" as knowing my way around a printer. I also think my legal and business background also helps with knowing how to structure my business.

RD: How does your work compliment your personality?

Chinelo: I love engaging with people on a personal level. Having a business dedicated to helping people feel special definitely compliments my personality. I also love the flexibility of choosing my working hours and fitting my work around my lifestyle.

I was the art prefect in junior school and love that I can finally apply my creativity to my work!

RD: Letterbox gifting has seen a real boom over lockdown—how does it feel to know you’re playing a part in spreading small instances of joy?

Chinelo: It feels absolutely fantastic! I love knowing I can brighten someone's day with a beautifully presented box of delicious brownies and a wax-sealed handwritten note. I've had customers say they felt like royalty when they unboxed their brownies and that makes all the long hours worth it.

Writing out my BLUSH cards I read so many personal messages. Some of my favourites were at the peak of lockdown when customers would send brownies to their loved ones to let them know they were thinking of them and looking forward to seeing them. I remember one particularly lovely message: “Thank you for being the sister I never had for all your help and support during tough times. Thank you for being proud of me when I achieve and being genuinely happy for me in my happiness. Love you to the moon and back"".

RD: Cake decoration has really taken on a whole new modern aesthetic especially in the Instagram age. What designs of yours are you finding most popular?

Chinelo: Oh yes the modern aesthetic is very in and I'm here for it! ""Esmerelda"" (below) is really popular. I've made her quite a few times and in two colours.

I think there is a new appreciation and expectation of cake as an artistic centrepiece not just food to be eaten. As you say with Instagram and Pinterest being such visual platforms aesthetically pleasing cakes are great for sharing and promoting your business.

RD: Where do you look for inspiration when developing a new product?

Chinelo: I rarely set out to develop a new product. I tend to get inspired by things I observe or conversations I have and then design products based on that. For instance I was recently thinking about how people typically order cakes from a cake maker and then have to shop for party accessories like candles cake toppers and balloons elsewhere. Typically two or three other shops.

I started to think about how simple it would be to have it all in one place. That was the inspiration for my Build Your Party Box. You can buy your cake matching cupcakes brownies party hats confetti balloons stylish long gold candles banner Prosecco non-alcoholic drink and so much more in one place! It’ll hopefully make the whole process a lot easier for people to celebrate.

RD: What does a typical workday look like for you? How has the business adapted for lockdown?

Chinelo: I typically start my day by checking emails and Instagram for urgent messages and updating my to-do list and/or shopping list. The rest of my day varies depending on whether I have upcoming cake orders. If I do I'll spend the bulk of my day baking planning my decorations and subsequently decorating the cakes.

Wednesdays are my brownies prep days so I'm typically writing BLUSH cards (handwritten personal messages) making brownies clarifying orders with customers (if need be) and preparing my packaging. Thursdays are my brownies boxing and dispatch day.

On days when I don't have upcoming cake orders I update my website draft social media copy take pictures of new products complete training courses networking research catching up on finance admin drafting reports and engaging with my online community on social media…there’s a lot to do!

Like many during the lockdown I pivoted my business from making large celebration cakes and in-person cake decorating classes to focusing on brownies and creating online classes. If someone had told me brownies would become a core part of my business I would have laughed out loud. Before lockdown I was selling three brownies every two-three weeks. I now average 25 per week and over 250 the week of Christmas.

RD: What are your favourite and least favourite parts of the job?

Chinelo: My favourite part of my job is definitely seeing my customers' reactions when they receive their cakes and/or brownies. There's something really thrilling about seeing people appreciate things you think of in your head.

My least favourite part of my job is definitely admin! It takes me a lot of discipline to get admin done.

RD: What do you like to do to switch off?

Chinelo: A good mani-pedi followed by a full body massage and brunch! I'm very much looking forward to June...

RD: What has been the most valuable business lesson you’ve learnt so far? And what has been your most tangible achievement?

Chinelo: Success takes time!

My most tangible achievement to date has been landing Google as a client over Christmas. 154 tins of brownies individually delivered to all members of a team it was brilliant.

I'm also particularly proud of my media mentions since lockdown; from Reader's Digest calling my brownies ""the most delicious brownies known to man"" to BBC Good Food naming my brownies the best for a glam gift it’s been really flattering.



Good Cake Day's ""Nneoma"" wedding cake

RD: In five years time where would you like to see the business?

Chinelo: On course to being established as a leading provider of unique buttercream cakes in London and UK postal brownies. I would love to have a reputation for being an accessible luxury cake brand-friendly committed to making our customers feel special and being a wonderful place for employees to work. Think the Selfridges of the cake world! A US presence would also be amazing.

RD: Lastly a very important question—at a celebration for you what flavour and design would be your ultimate personal cake?

Chinelo: Oh I love this question! My vanilla sponge with mango passionfruit and yuzu coulis with white chocolate buttercream.

I have a flamboyant design with edible ruffles pearls and lace in pastel colours. It's soooo yummy!

The Palm Beach property market has been skyrocketing and inspired at least one disgraced billionaire casino mogul to cash in.

According to the Palm Beach Daily News Steve Wynn just made $5.2 million selling a mansion just three months after he bought it.

A company controlled by Wynn 78 acquired the luxury lakefront property in December for $18.4 million. It sold this week for $23.68 million.

Palm Beach Real-Estate Boom

The exclusive enclave that is home to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club has long been a haven for the super-rich and never more so than now. The pandemic has triggered an exodus of America’s wealthiest from its COVID-plagued cities. And they’re all heading for Florida and “The Island” drawn by the promise of sun golf and zero income taxes.

“Anyone with money is fleeing New York and coming here” Guy Clark an agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate told Bloomberg recently. “It’s a seller’s market like I’ve never experienced.”

The property Wynn just sold is a 7273-square-foot Mediterranean-style home that sits on the Intracoastal Waterway with 155 feet of water frontage and a private dock. Unusually it has more bathrooms (five) than bedrooms (four). It also has a glass wine cellar a fireplace and an elevator. Outside there’s a covered balcony a 40-foot pool with a sun shelf and a spa.

Built in 2020 it had never been lived in when Wynn bought it. And that’s probably still the case. Wynn certainly never lived there: his main residence is three miles south at 1960 S. Ocean Blvd.

Last month he bought another lakeside house across town at North Lake Way for $49 million which suggests flipping Palm Beach mansions is Wynn’s new thing. Here after all is man who made his billions flipping Las Vegas Strip resorts like the Mirage Treasure Island and the Bellagio.

Living Le Rȇve

Wynn relocated to Florida shortly after explosive allegations of sexual misconduct towards female staff forced him to sell his 11.8 percent stake in Wynn Resorts for $2.1 billion.

He also sold his mansion in Summerlin and more recently listed his sprawling Beverly Hills estate for an extraordinary $110 million.

The man who reinvented Las Vegas has reinvented himself as an art dealer and for the past year or more has run a gallery on the second floor of The Esplanade on Worth Avenue Palm Beach’s famous upscale shopping district.

The longtime collector of fine art sells multimillion dollar artworks including Picassos Matisses and Warhols through the gallery and via his website sierrafineartllc.com.

His new career got off to a bad start when a Picasso (“Le Marin”) he hoped to auction at Christies was damaged after being hit by a rogue paint roller.

It was the second time Wynn has clobbered a Picasso. In 2006 he famously put his right elbow through the canvas of “Le Rȇve” while showing it off in his office causing millions of dollars of damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL21hci8yNy9leHBlcnRzLXNlZS1vcHRpbWlzbS1pbi12aXJnaW4taG90ZWxzLW9wZW5pbmctaW4tbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts see optimism in Virgin Hotels opening in Las Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) - Opening a new casino resort during a pandemic isn’t ideal but Virgin Hotels Las Vegas may have found a sweet spot with the timing of its launch.

After delaying its opening twice the off-Strip property opened Thursday.

Industry watchers say Las Vegas casino operators still face pandemic-related challenges but the operating environment today is much better than where Las Vegas stood just weeks ago.

“The prospects for summer look increasingly positive - with vaccination levels increasing and plenty of pent-up demand from people looking to put the pandemic behind them” Jonathan Day an associate professor of hospitality and tourism management at Purdue University told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “It’s a sign of optimism in the recovery that Virgin is committed to opening.”

Virgin Hotels Las Vegas initially planned to open in the fall after a $200 million renovation of the former Hard Rock Hotel. Plans were pushed back to January and delayed once again before Thursday’s opening date was announced.

Now Las Vegas is starting to show significant signs of recovery.

In recent earnings calls heads of casino operators Caesars Entertainment Inc. and MGM Resorts International revealed that bookings were increasing. Foot traffic on the Strip is on the rise. Casino floor operators can now operate at 50% capacity for the first time in months. And various surveys show that Americans are itching to take a leisure trip again as COVID-19 case numbers drop and vaccines roll out.

“Considering we had opening dates scheduled for late 2020 and early 2021 ultimately we feel good about our March 25 official opening date” said Richard “Boz” Bosworth president and CEO of J.C. Hospitality owner of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

“There are positive signs pointing to another great Las Vegas comeback” he said. “No city does it better than Las Vegas and we are excited to open our doors once again to our team members and welcome locals and tourists back to the city.”

Industry watchers expect to see Las Vegas tourism take off this summer after more than a year of lockdowns and strict operating restrictions.

“I think we’re going to have a killer summer. There’s pent-up demand to travel especially domestically” said Finley Cotrone an assistant professor in residence at UNLV’s college of hospitality. She called Virgin Hotels’ opening “really good timing.”

UNLV assistant professor of hospitality Amanda Belarmino said it didn’t make sense to open a new property back in the fall. At that time operators were closing amenities and some properties closed midweek because of lack of demand. Those properties have just started returning to full-week operations.

“There’s still a lot of uncertainty but we’re in the most optimistic place we’ve been since it started. So it makes sense (to open) now” Belarmino said.

She added that the reopening timeline is good for the city as well as the property. A new property going online should help drive foot traffic and bring back hundreds of workers.

Bosworth said Virgin Hotels is putting about 2000 local hospitality employees back to work. Some used to work at the Hard Rock.

Day thinks March will still be a challenging month to open a hotel but that the timing will allow Virgin Hotels to prepare for an influx of summer travelers.

“Opening now will give the opportunity to come up to speed as demand increases” he said in an email.

David Givens vice president of hotel operations for Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said he was looking forward to the opening.

“Everyone just wants to open” he said citing a busy recent weekends on the Strip. “It makes sense to get it open and then with the restrictions easing I think we’ll do OK.”

The property’s opening date does have downsides industry experts say.

For one Virgin Hotels’ doors opened a week after the initial weekend of this year’s NCAA Tournament one of the biggest annual events in Las Vegas.

“I would have opened early March. I would have wanted to get all of those kinks out for the first week of March Madness” said Debi Nutton a gaming consultant and former Wynn Resorts Ltd. executive. “The demand for that week is going to be tremendous and that March Madness crowd fits right in with Virgin.”

While the increased foot traffic during the first weekend of March Madness may have been a boon for Virgin Hotels it’s unclear how many travelers would have made a stop at the off-Strip property.

Sports betting partner Betfred is not yet licensed in Nevada and the property’s sportsbook isn’t set to open until the summer pending regulatory approval.

Cotrone also pointed out that while case numbers are down Virgin Hotels is still opening in the midst of a global pandemic. She voiced concern for some front-line workers especially knowing that some travelers will fly in from states that have dropped mask mandates.

“I do worry about our front-line employees as our guests come in (from) different states (and some are) convinced that the pandemic has passed” she said. “We still need to have these precautions with masks. Our front-line employees carry the brunt of that challenge.”

Bosworth told the Review-Journal that the safety of Virgin Hotels’ staff partners and guests is a top property.

“We would like to have brought all our team members back sooner but with the increase in COVID-19 cases and the restrictions that were in place it simply was not safe or profitable for us to open the doors at those earlier dates” he said.

“So after everything has been said and done I think everything worked out the way it was meant to be” he said. “The resort is primed and ready to kick off the recovery of the Las Vegas economy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9qb3VybmFsaXN0LXJlY2FsbHMtd2hlbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtd2FzLWFtZXJpY2FzLW1vbnRlLWNhcmxvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casino.org Journalist Recalls When Las Vegas Was 'America's Monte Carlo',"Journalist Recalls When Las Vegas Was ‘America’s Monte Carlo’

Posted on: March 28 2021 03:45h.

Last updated on: March 28 2021 05:34h.

Through the years some Las Vegas casinos have associated themselves with glamourous Monte Carlo on the French Riviera. Now those days are gone according to KSNV-TV Channel 3 reporter Tom Hawley.

Hawley recently said during a “Video Vault” report on Channel 3 that no name has been employed more to get customers into Las Vegas casinos than “the glamorous centerpiece of the Principality of Monaco.”

Hawley’s weekly “Video Vault” segments explore different aspects of Las Vegas history including developments in the casino industry and the Mafia’s influence decades ago in Southern Nevada.

The most recent segment looked at the way Las Vegas casinos used glamourous Monte Carlo as a marketing tool.

The trend dates back to the years even before casino gambling was legalized in Nevada in 1931. In the 1920s the Northern Club on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas referred to the city as “The Monte Carlo of America” Hawley wrote on the station’s website.

In 1932 the Northern Club’s name was changed to the Monte Carlo. The Silver Club in downtown Las Vegas called itself the “Monte Carlo of the Desert” the veteran reporter noted.

Years later the Flamingo Casino on Highway 91 branded itself “America’s Monte Carlo.” The Flamingo was opened in December 1946 under the direction of gangster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel on the desert highway to Los Angeles. This highway now is called the Las Vegas Strip. It is home to more than 20 major resorts.

‘A Cut Above’

Michael Green a UNLV history professor said on the “Video Vault” segment that the Monte Carlo in Monaco has been associated with the elite.

In Las Vegas use of the Monte Carlo name suggested these local properties were “a cut above” the sawdust joints he said.

A lot of Western casinos in the olden days would claim they’re the ‘Monte Carlo of the West’” Green said. “It makes sense to be the Monte Carlo of Las Vegas.”

A more recent version of that name was unveiled on the west side of the Strip on June 21 1996 with the opening of the 32-story Monte Carlo hotel-casino.

This came during a boom in the 1990s in megaresort construction on the Strip. The construction boom gained steam after casino developer Steve Wynn opened the Mirage in 1989 on the west side of the resort corridor.

No More Monte Carlos

The Monte Carlo on the Strip was closed temporarily after a three-alarm fire on the top six floors in January 2008.

Improper welding sparked flammable foam blocks on the resort’s decorative crown structure Hawley said. No one was seriously injured.

In May 2018 the Monte Carlo’s name was changed to Park MGM. Now for the first time in a century there are no direct Monte Carlo tie-ins in Las Vegas Hawley said.

Green said Las Vegas is “well-enough known that we really do not need to attach ourselves to Monaco’s coattails.”

“Maybe in Monaco there’s now a Las Vegas resort for all we know” Green said.

“We’re back it’s good” says Mark Farrington from Eastview. “It’s good to have a little sense of normalcy for these kids that put up with so much over the last year or so.”

“Just lots of emotion and lots of excitement” adds Sarah Sauer of Andover. “And yeah for her to get the opportunity to be a part of this team.”

Sauer and her family are in St. Paul to watch their daughter Nora a freshman play for the Andover Huskies. It’s her very first state tournament.

""They really have to become a team” Sauer said. “You know they’re not going to have the crowds there that are cheering them on but they’ve got a lot of support from us parents who’ve been there all year.”

And what a difference a pandemic year makes.

In 2020 there was a packed house and cheering fans at the X with its 18000 seat capacity. The boys’ and girls’ hockey tournaments finished up just before the shutdown.

This year only 250 people are allowed in because of COVID-19 safety protocols.

“It was a hard decision for the high school league because so many people want to come to the tournament” said Kelly McGrath Xcel Energy Center’s director of marketing. “It’s such an annual tradition for families and groups of friends who come to downtown St. Paul and enjoy the tournaments.”

That 250-person limit mandated by the Minnesota Department of Health continues for just a few more days.

On Thursday the MDH-approved capacity for the X will rise to 3000.

Some wish the change could have come with the start of the tournament.

“I don’t particularly care for it especially when it’s going to be 3000 on the first” Farrington says. “What’s the difference between now and the first? But at least they’re skating and it’s good.""

There are numerous other COVID safety measures at Xcel Energy Center including seating in pods of two and the use of zip-ties to cordon off seats. Face coverings are required of course and the venue is also requiring guests to do an online self-health check.

“You answer a quick series of questions that basically say you’re not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or haven’t been in close contact” McGrath said. “Our guests will show that to security when they come then they’ll scan their own ticket. We have touchless ticket scanners.”

McGrath said the arena will also have 500 hand sanitizing stations and an anti-viral spray is being used to coat touch areas.

She also says UV lighting system is installed on escalators to clean handrails. Every other sink in restrooms will be disabled as well as hand dryers. Paper towel dispensers are installed instead McGrath says.

And then there’s Vic Peterson a hockey dad from Breezy Point.

""We are a team made up of three high schools who’ve never been to the state tournament” Peterson says. “So for obvious reasons it’s exciting.""

His 15-year-old son Isaac is on the Northern Lights Lightning Team. For their Tuesday draw they’ll get 114 seating tickets. If they get to the next round on Friday they’ll get 600 tickets — a big change in 48 hours Peterson says.

""Can we please look at the body of the event which is from Tuesday to Saturday?” he asks. “Rather than split those restrictions up let’s bring those all into one for the length of the entirety of it even if it is asking for 48 hours.""

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to Gov. Tim Walz’s office for comment about the changes coming April 1 but did not hear back.

Meanwhile Peterson says with four tickets his family like many others is making some tough decisions.

“Isaac has an older sister and a younger brother both who play hockey” he explains. “Do we ask them do we give them the tickets or do we give to grandma and grandpa who sacrificed so much and they’re now fully vaccinated. Never been able to see Isaac play in a year.”

Sauer says she understands about safety concerns versus the desire to be a part of the tournament. She too is thinking about the seniors in her family.

""It’s still fun but it’s hard because we have a lot of relatives grandmas and grandpas that can’t be there” Sauer said. “It’s still an opportunity for (the players). I’m glad we can be here. At least we can be in Xcel right instead of not even having a state tournament.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cnJlbnRhcmd1cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzLzI5L3Bvd2VyLW91dGFnZS10YWtlcy1kb3duLXBhcnRzLWFydGVzaWEtc3VuZGF5LWFmdGVybm9vbi83MDQ1NTY2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power outage impacts parts of Artesia Sunday afternoon,"A downed transmission line in Chaves County was the apparent cause of a power outage that impacted scores of people Sunday afternoon officials said.

Leah Boone customer service representative with Central Valley Electric (CVE) in Artesia said power went out around 4:28 p.m. and was restored around 5:32 p.m. Sunday.

She said the downed transmission line belonging to Xcel Energy affected Xcel and CVE customers in both Chaves and Eddy County’s.

Boone said CVE gets some of their electricity from Xcel and it affected the rural electric cooperative’s customers in both counties.

CVE’s coverage area starts north of Roswell and ends around the Lakewood and Loco Hills areas near Artesia the cooperatives website noted.

Wes Reeves Xcel spokesperson said there were two outages apparently attributed to the outage.

Boone didn’t have an estimate on how many CVE customers were without power during the near hour-long outage and she didn’t want to estimate.

The Artesia Police Department got a call of the power outage around 4:39 p.m. from North 13th Street and West Richey Avenue per a dispatch report from the Regional Emergency Dispatch Authority (REDA).

Boone said the power outage caused CVE’s phone system to go down at the office at 1403 North 13th Street.

“The phone lines at CVE were put on a backup generating system and were working but with multiple calls coming and in all at once it was impossible to answer all of the calls all at once” she said.

Reeves didn’t have any immediate information on why the transmission line went down or what crews did to restore power.

He also didn’t have an exact number on how many customers felt the sting of the outage.

In the Class A 170-pound semifinals Seth Goetzinger was in trouble. Kimball Area's Ashton Hanon was out for blood and Goetzinger's shot at a perfect season and a state title to cap off his senior year was in danger.

Goetzinger had defeated Hanon soundly in the state preliminaries and Hanon desperately wanted revenge. Every move that Goetzinger tried to make Hanon seemingly knew what was coming.

Goetzinger lacked energy. There was hardly any buzz in the St. Michael-Albertville gym. Usually the Minnesota state wrestling tournament is held at the jam-packed Xcel Energy Center. The crowd is usually roaring. But on Saturday Goetzinger's teammates weren't able to cheer him on. His parents his little brother Wes and his coaches were the only ones in his corner. Goetzinger had to generate his own energy to hold off the desperate Hanon.

He did it in just the knick of time. Goetzinger edged the Kimball Area star 9-8 to advance to the 170-pound Class A finals.

""I didn't wrestle my best today"" Goetzinger said. ""The whole setting there was something off. It felt different. It wasn't loud like it usually is. But I just never gave up. I kept my head on straight. I didn't let the fact that I was losing or that he tied it up affect me too much. I just knew I had to keep on going.""

Up next he wrestled Fosston/Bagley's Carter Sorenson. They'll be teammates at Augsburg University next year but Saturday they were rivals. They each wanted to walk out on top in the last match of their high school careers.

Goetzinger mustered up the strength and was able to gut out a big 7-5 victory. The Chatfield senior will bid adieu to high school wrestling as a state champion.

""It feels really good after everything you've done to see all the hard work pay off in the end"" Goetzinger said. ""I mean it was the last match of my high school career. I had to give it my all.""

Goetzinger finished a perfect 33-0 this season. He'll leave a remarkable legacy on the Chatfield wrestling room. He was the one who set the tone in practice every day. Goetzinger is looked up to in the Gophers' wrestling program but his teammates mean just as much to him as he means to them.

""I'm going to miss my teammates a lot"" Goetzinger said. ""I'm going to really miss high school wrestling. I'm going to miss the setting the mood in the room and hanging out with everybody. It hasn't really set in that it's over. By tomorrow it will. I'm going to really miss it.""

This time Goetzinger staved off the bad ending. Ending as a state champion is what everyone strives for. Goetzinger earned his perfect ending.

ROSS GETS HIS REVENGE

Caledonia/Houston's Brandon Ross reacts after winning the Class A 120-pound championship on Saturday March 27 2021 at St. Michael. Joe Brown / Forum News Service

Brandon Ross had revenge on his mind. The Caledonia-Houston junior had to endure a painful offseason after losing in the Class A 120-pound state title match last year. It drove him to put in extra time and extra work. Like lifting early in the mornings before school got started. Or staying after practice to refine his craft even more.

All that extra work paid off. Ross got his well-deserved revenge. After a devastating second-place finish last year Ross earned his first state title on Saturday.

Ross blitzed through the best 120-pounders in Class A. He pinned Zumbrota-Mazeppa’s Kaleb Lochner in the quarterfinals. Eli Larson was no match in the semifinals as Ross dominated to the tune of an 8-3 decision. Then in the finals he blitzed Ryan Jensen with an onslaught of moves. By the time Jensen got his senses back Ross was already up 6-1 and cruised to the title.

“I just stayed focused and never got uncomfortable” Ross said. “I always stayed prepared and took deep breaths. When it’s time to shine I did. That loss last year motivated me a lot. I wanted to come back and get the gold.”

Caledonia head coach Shay Mahoney has preached mental toughness all year long. No matter the opponent Ross doesn’t want his game to ever change. When his heart was pumping and the adrenaline was racing before the state finals he leaned on Mahoney’s teachings.

He found a way to breathe. He found a way to settle the nerves. And then he went out and dominated.

“When it’s time to shine I put all this hard work into it” Ross said. “I just have to go get it.”

Ross fell in love with the grind. He fell in love with working hard. It wasn’t something extra he was supposed to do. It’s just what he did. It became normal. So as he prepared to make the three-hour drive home he savored his state title. But also was thinking about tomorrow.

“It means a lot but I still have another year” Ross said. “We’re hopefully going to come back for another one. I have to get right back to work as soon as possible.”

Véronique a journalist philanthropist and influencer worked with some of the fashion world’s top designers to create her outfits introducing their works to American audiences.

Curator Florence Müller found Véronique Peck a fascinating historical figure to research.

“She was a young journalist. In the 50s it was very rare for a young woman” Müller said. “She was in her twenties and she was working for one of the most famous newspapers in France. When the newspaper learned that Gregory was going through Paris on his way to Rome to film ‘Roman Holiday’ they asked for an interview and they sent Véronique. She did the interview and Gregory really fell in love with her. They married three years after.”

Her subjects also included Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was an Army general French writer Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette and French philosopher Dr. Albert Schweitzer Müller said.

“She was writing about the new books novels theater plays and new hot places in Paris. Of course fashion was one of the great things she already knew before she met Gregory.”

Müller worked with the Pecks’ daughter Cecilia Peck Voll and found a treasure trove of archival goods.

“I discovered this huge collection that she has kept not only of several hundred dresses but also documents and photography. All sorts of souvenirs about her mother and her father as well” she said.

Müller used archives at couture houses in Paris for research. About half the dresses on display are original samples from fashion shows.

“Véronique was very good friends with many couturiers like Hubert de Givenchy André Courrèges Yves Saint Laurent and she was able to be dressed with these original designs” which was not a common practice at the time she added.

Courtesy of the Denver Art Museum/Eric Stephenson The Denver Art Museum’s exhibition “Paris to Hollywood” showcases the wardrobe of Véronique Peck the wife of actor Gregory Peck and runs through July 18.

Because Véronique spent so much time traveling with Gregory she couldn’t attend every fashion show that showed off the latest clothes in Paris. And Müller said the sketches on display at the museum show the creative process of how Véronique shaped her style and worked with designers thousands of miles away.

“Her mother Alexandra who was living in Paris was able to attend the fashion shows” she said. “She was writing to her daughter long letters describing all the great collections and the great pieces that she should acquire. On top of this the fashion houses would send Véronique sketches with a little piece of fabric in order to do her final choice.”

In all the “Paris to Hollywood” exhibit showcases 100 outfits from 17 different designers all from the 1950s through the 1990s. As times changed so did the styles. And some of that history is on display too.

“I think this connection is really wonderful because it shows a link between Paris the back-then capital of fashion and Hollywood the capital of movie and famous glamorous star style” Müller said. “I think visitors will learn the evolution of the silhouette and how the looks are related with the evolution of women in society. How women have really been empowered through the decades.”"

Yum! Brands has successfully deployed Tictuk’s platform in approximately 900 KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants in 35 countries outside of the U.S. It plans to scale and offer Tictuk’s omnichannel ordering and marketing capabilities to more markets and franchisees globally to deliver more ways for consumers to access its brands through social media and other conversational commerce channels.

Brands plans to combine Kvantum’s artificial intelligence and machine learning approach to understanding human behavior with the unique skillsets of the anthropologists and sociologists at Collider Lab a culture-based consumer insights and marketing strategy consultancy Yum! acquired in 2015. Yum! Brands believes that Kvantum’s and Collider Lab’s combined methodologies will yield even deeper consumer and brand insights and help advance the Company’s R.E.D. Marketing strategies around the world.

According to a press statement the Tictuk business unit as part of Yum! Brands will continue to offer its technology platform to existing clients. Yum! Brands estimates that both of these all-cash acquisitions will have an immaterial impact to its 2021 financial results and should accelerate its ability to grow digital sales as they are deployed over time in markets around the world.

While the new technology solutions would seem a logical fit for a global brand focused on leveraging advanced econometrics big data and machine learning techniques to the advantage of its 50000 restaurant locations only time will tell if the acquisitions achieve the expected results in terms of increased customer satisfaction loyalty and revenue growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHJiLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Byb2Zlc3Npb25hbC1idWxsLXJpZGVycy1yZXR1cm4tdG8tdGhlLWtmYy15dW0tY2VudGVyL2FydGljbGVfMWE1YzVmYjAtOTAxNS0xMWViLWJjYWQtN2I5MWUxMDY3MWE0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Professional Bull Riders return to the KFC Yum!

Chipotle Mexican Grill doesn't quite have a reputation for being the cheapest meal in town (yes we know the guac is extra) so it should come as no surprise that the chain's CEO Brian Niccol rakes in a massive paycheck every year. According to Salary.com Niccol who also serves as Chipotle's Chairman of the Board has regularly earned eight figures in total compensation since taking over as the company's head honcho in 2018.

However it wouldn't be wrong to say that Niccol has earned his pay. Per Chipotle's website the Miami University grad was CEO of Taco Bell directly prior to taking over at the fast-casual Mexican restaurant and has also held several other management positions within Yum! Brands and Procter & Gamble during his career. He has earned considerable praise and numerous accolades during his first few years at the helm of Chipotle as well.

MANILA Philippines — KFC Philippines is giving investors – even those who have no solid experience in running a quick-service restaurant (QSR) – the opportunity to be the “Colonel” of their own KFC store via its innovative franchising scheme.

KFC Philippines under its franchising program will handle the full operations of the store thus assuring entrepreneurs a hassle-free management experience while enjoying the full benefits of franchise ownership.

This also gives the KFC sub-franchisee a higher level of confidence that the store is maximizing its potential as it will be supervised according to the company’s world-class standards daily.

KFC Philippines will handle the daily operations and full management of the franchised stores to maximize their potential. The sub-franchisee as the investor will be assured of KFC’s world-class product quality and service. Its Human Resource Group will also be directly involved in the recruitment of talent ensuring aligned criteria on selection and personnel training. This also ensures the sub-franchisee’s store personnel will be equipped with all the necessary tools.

Originally called Kentucky Fried Chicken KFC was founded by Col. Harland Sanders who developed the brand’s world-famous 11 secret herbs and spices. It is now owned by Yum! Brands which granted the mother franchise to KFC Philippines for the country. In 2019 Yum! Brands allowed KFC Philippines to start offering the business to sub-franchisees.

The pandemic failed to dull the appetite of investors for the fast-growing QSR. It has since opened four sub-franchised outlets in Santiago Isabela Waltermart Capas Waltermart Malolos and Waltermart Candelaria. A number of sub-franchised outlets will also open this year.

Given KFC’s globally set operational standards entrepreneurs can create jobs within their communities through their very own KFC store.

Interested entrepreneurs who own a property for a potential KFC franchise may send their details to KFC Franchising. They can also inquire via https://corporate.kfc.com.ph/franchising/.

Investment starts at P19 million which includes store construction equipment and the initial fees. The minimum area requirement is 1200 square meters for a free standing/drive-thru store and 160 sqm for an inline or a mall store.

KFC prides itself as the first QSR in the country to utilize e-bikes for eco-friendly food-delivery service on a wide scale. It currently has over 300 branches nationwide."
