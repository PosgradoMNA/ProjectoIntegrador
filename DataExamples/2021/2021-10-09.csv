With a Ph.D. in economics from Oxford a master of public administration from Harvard and experience serving on the boards of companies like Chevron 3M and Barclays Ms. Moyo has the kind of broad exposure and macroeconomic knowledge that is often lacking in the upper reaches of siloed organizations.

But Ms. Moyo recognizes the complexity of thorny issues like climate change inequality and the erosion of democracy and resists the temptation to offer pat solutions. She is adamant that climate change is an existential crisis but wary about rushing to limit fossil fuel use given the energy needs of the developing world. She is a champion of diversity but worries that focusing on racial equity distracts from the threat of automation. She understands that unchecked capitalism can create inequality but is careful not to dismiss the importance of economic growth.

“I am at the crossroads of many different perspectives” she said. “I’m on the board of a large global energy company. I serve on the board of the Oxford University endowment. I also was born and raised in Africa and there’s still 1.5 billion people on the planet who have no access to cost-effective energy including my parents who still live in Zambia.”

Ms. Moyo currently serves on the Chevron and 3M boards and this year published her fifth book “How Boards Work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLXNocm9wc2hpcmUtNTg4NTcwMTjSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvdWstZW5nbGFuZC1zaHJvcHNoaXJlLTU4ODU3MDE4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Climate change: Artist carrying polar bear to COP26 to encourage talking,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZW5maWVsZGRpc3BhdGNoLmNvLnVrL2ZpbmVzLWZvci1kcml2ZXJzLWluLWx0bnMtaGl0LTNtLWFtaWQtcm93LW92ZXItc2lnbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fines for drivers in LTNs hit £3m amid row over signs,"Councillor claims signs are ‘misleading’ drivers reports Simon Allin Local Democracy Reporter

The eastern entrance to the Fox Lane Quieter Neighbourhood in Palmers Green where traffic enforcement cameras are used

Opposition councillors have slammed “confusing” road signs after Enfield Council raked in more than £3million from fines dished out to drivers in two low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs).

The Conservatives claim the “sheer volume” of penalty charge notices issued to motorists – almost 62000 since September last year – shows how unclear the signs are.

Two LTNs were introduced in Enfield last year in a bid to cut rat-running and pollution; the Bowes Primary Area Quieter Neighbourhood in Bowes Park and the Fox Lane Quieter Neighbourhood in Southgate and Palmers Green. Some of the road entrances that are closed to motor vehicles are enforced using cameras in order to allow access to emergency services.

Enfield Council claims the signs installed at motor vehicle closure points “fully meet the requirements set out in the relevant regulations”. But motorists are continuing to be caught out by the cameras with the total fines revenue from the LTNs reaching £3031881 in August. It includes more than £1.5m raised from a single camera in Meadway Southgate.

Maria Alexandrou shadow cabinet member for climate change said: “This disgraceful Labour council has failed to do something about the misleading camera road signage especially on Meadway Warwick Road and Fox Lane and is shamelessly continuing to charge residents with penalty fines they can ill afford to pay.”

Signs installed by the council to alert residents to the LTNs state “no motor vehicles” and “area in which cameras are used to enforce traffic regulations” both of which are included in the Highway Code.

But Cllr Alexandrou said the council should have gone further and included larger written warnings similar to those alerting drivers to the presence of ‘School Streets’. She said: “They are not big clear signs saying ‘road closed – LTNs’. With school streets people know. It has been a year; if [the signs] had been clear people would have cottoned on.”

Several other councils have introduced additional signage to warn of LTN restrictions. Some include signs saying “motor vehicles prohibited penalty charges now apply” and “enforcement cameras live”.

During a meeting of the council’s environment and climate action scrutiny panel in March leader Nesil Caliskan said she would ask an officer to review some of the LTN signs after fines raised by enforcement cameras neared £2m. Cllr Alexandrou claimed nothing had been done following that meeting but a council spokesperson said the signs were reviewed.

Enfield’s Conservatives had previously called for the borough’s LTNs to be removed until it could be shown that they are supported by a majority of residents but the Labour administration rejected the call. The Tories claimed the schemes had failed to improve air quality and caused additional congestion and pollution on surrounding main roads.

Labour-run Ealing Council began removing seven LTNs this week following “extensive consultation with local residents and consideration of available data on the impact of LTNs on air quality and encouragement of active travel”. It plans to retain two of the LTNs in areas where the majority of local people were in favour.

An Enfield Council spokesperson said: “Signage installed at motor vehicle closures points in the borough fully meet the requirements set out in the relevant regulations. Using the prescribed signs available they clearly indicate that motor vehicles should not pass through the restriction and that camera enforcement is in place. These camera-enforced closures are in place following discussion with the emergency services prior to the trials starting to enable the emergency services continued access to these residential areas.

“The signs installed were reviewed following discussion at a scrutiny panel meeting in March which confirmed their compliance. Neither the regulations nor the accompanying national guidance suggests councils should add additional signage such as non-standard ‘information signs’ in case motorists are unclear about the meaning of the official signs.

“However in a number of locations the council has added additional advisory signs prior to the closure points to help inform motorists that there is no through access. All our signage is under regular review and if trials are made permanent there will be an opportunity for a further review of signage.

“The trials and monitoring of the Bowes and Fox Lane quieter neighbourhoods are ongoing. Decisions on both of these trials are expected over the winter period.”

He also earmarked N76.6 million as residential rent in the seat of power for the 2022 fiscal year.

All these are contained in the 2022 Appropriation Bill of N16.39 trillion the President presented to the joint session of the National Assembly on Thursday.

A breakdown of the budget revealed that N24.83 billion was allocated for the President’s State House operations and N1.18 billion for the Vice President.

The State House residential rent gulped N66.6 million last year.

The State House rent was a permanent feature in the yearly budgetary allocation during the previous administrations and the Buhari’s government has continued with the arrangement despite its description as a suspicious item.

Ripples Nigeria had earlier reported that between 2015 and 2020 residential rent payment in Aso Rock gulped N400.1 million.

Nawah recently expanded to Jordan on the back of its $1 million Seed round raised earlier this year.

Founded in 2015 by Omar Sakr Nawah is the first Mena-based company to issue certified reference materials (CRMs).

It has also expanded its offerings to pharmaceutical companies to include formulation development stability studies as well as all raw material and finished products quality control checks.

Press release

Nawah Scientific Egypt’s fastest-growing life science venture has announced today that Dr. Essam Abdelhadi Ex-Abbott VP Middle East Turkey Africa and Pakistan has acquired a stake at Nawah and joined the advisory board. This comes as Nawah gets closer to closing a significant Series A round led and joined by regional and international investors.

“It’s such an honor” Dr. Omar Sakr Nawah’s founder and CEO commented. He added “Dr. Abdelhadi has been always a role model to look up to. He comes with immense experience in pharmaceutical industry sales and marketing across the same geographical markets Nawah plans to expand to in addition to deep hands-on expertise in managing operations at such scale. We could not wish for a better investor and advisor to help us manage our current rapid growth”.

Dr. Abdelhadi led a very interesting career with top leadership positions in several multinational pharmaceutical companies such as Janssen Cilag Johnson & Johnson Abbott Pharma and Abbott nutrition. He commented on this investment “I was impressed by the development Nawah has achieved in a relatively short time in an untypical environment. One won’t expect this level of scientific quality to emerge in the region and I have full confidence that Nawah will grow upwards and onwards to compete in the international scientific services market”.

With a clear mission to “Empower Science in MENA & Africa” Nawah has introduced a brand-new business model to the region bringing the power of the digital era to the capable hands of scientists. “Scientists' role is to think design the experiments and interpret results we do the rest of technical work for them at Nawah” commented Prof. Ali El-Halawany Chief Scientific Officer at Nawah. Here is how it works: Nawah's online platform receives experiments requests online a courier collects samples for analysis Nawah's scientists carry needed tests and return results online. By this Nawah enables scientists to do higher-quality research regardless of their location and owned lab facilities.

Nawah has expanded its offerings for pharmaceutical companies to include pharmaceutical formulation development stability studies as well as all types of raw material and finished products quality control checks. Yet even more importantly Nawah is the first MENA based company to produce certified reference materials (CRMs) that are much needed by the industry",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9hc2hicmluZ3N0aGF0Y2FzaC9wbGF5LXdvdWxkLXlvdS1yYXRoZXItdG8tc2VlLWlmLXlvdXJlLW1vcmUtbGlrZS1lLTMyemJqMjJydznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Play ""Would You Rather"" To See If You're More Like Evelyn Or Lee Abbott From ""A Quiet Place""","BuzzFeed Bring Me

On June 8th 2020 the 275 now graduated seniors had a virtual graduation with the promise of an in person Commencement in June 2021. That date was delayed again to October 10th 2021 when roughly 110 members from the class of 2020 met once again perhaps for the first time since they left campus. Many of the graduates found the ceremony to be an official marking of their success and are happy that their family and friends could participate in the occasion with them in person.

The graduates and their families were welcomed to Commencement by Tony Etz '83 Chairman of the Knox Board of Trustees. Etz is a fourth-generation Knox College graduate. During his remarks he emphasized “All of us graduates of this great college are bound together forever in this community and I hope that you’ll keep us close.”

Following a performance by the Knox College Choir President Andrew McGadney presented his address to the graduating class. After thanking the graduates’ families friends mentors and Knox faculty and staff President McGadney spoke directly to the graduates. “I am so proud of each and every one of you and I can’t wait to get to know you better during future moments on campus and across the country and the globe. Please know you will always be a part of the Knox community and I look forward to partnering with you as we make this great institution even better together for future generations.”

Knox graduate Nyerere Billups class of 1999 delivered the Commencement address. Billups is the director of portfolio program management operations for AbbVie Inc. an American publicly traded research-based biopharmaceutical company founded in 2011. He is responsible for driving continuous improvements in R&D governance and R&D pipeline performance reporting and has spent most of his career working in research.

Billups has received multiple certifications in leadership and strategic management from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management. He joined the Knox Board of Trustees in 2016 as an alumni trustee and became a general trustee in June of 2020. He serves on the admission and campus life and athletics committees the committee on board diversity and has also served on the nominating committee and the most recent presidential search committee. He volunteers as a Knox alumni mentor is part of his class’ leadership team and is involved in the Black Alumni Network (BAN).

“This moment the gravity of it it's with me as the same time I sat where you sat” said Billups. “I’ve been dealing with adversity since I arrived on February 12th 1977. But I’m here to tell you today that life isn’t what happened to you it’s how you respond to the things that happen in life” said Billups.

Billups’ message for the class of 2020 was “The one thing that nobody can ever take from each of you as individuals is the magnitude of who you are. The one thing that’s in your control is the magnitude of who I am.”

“So I leave you with these simple words. Use everything that you’ve gone through as your setup for you to step up and for you to show up.”

Honorary degree recipients include Brian Wallach and Sandra Abrevaya the founders of I AM ALS a patient-led patient-centric movement created to find a cure for ALS after Brian was diagnosed with the disease. “Never doubt your own power especially when you are facing long odds. Never doubt the value of your voice and your lived experience…never doubt that you can change the world. Take it from this old guy the world needs some changes” said Wallach.

The attendees also listened to remarks from senior class speaker Kylie Linh Hoang '20. Hoang majored in history and minored in environmental studies and museum studies. Hoang acknowledged the determination that the Class of 2020 demonstrated in their first year in 2016 after the presidential election. Students worked to embrace each other’s differences and support each other amidst political shifts and again in their last year as many struggled in virtual spaces among the difficulties of the pandemic. “Knox was far from a perfect campus but it was the first place that I ever felt like everyone made an honest effort to be good to each other” said Hoang.

“My hope for the class is that we take these experiences and we use them to bring good to all of the new communities we join and build” said Hoang. “I hope that we as a class are remembered for being a force of good in the world.”

Former Knox College President Teresa Amott delivered some remarks summing up the spirit of the class of 2020: “Class of 2020 I can see you in my mind’s eye: I remember your energy how hard you worked in the classroom on the playing fields in the library and the lab. I remember how much you cared for one another how you fell in love with ideas with places with causes. I remember your passionate embrace of dignity justice sustainability knowledge and community.”

Amott retired in June 2021 after over 40 years in education 10 of which were at Knox. She says she has stronger “hope and faith” than ever before in the class of 2020 after the hardships of the past 18 months. “Take away from this Commencement ceremony our abiding hope and faith that you will be the next Greatest Generation. That you will heal a troubled world avert a climate catastrophe advance the frontiers of scientific knowledge bring refuge to the millions displaced by violence or persecution address the root causes of systemic isms and widen the circle of inclusion so that all may experience security prosperity dignity and justice. This work will not be easy but you are up to it I know. You are Knox graduates: go forth and change the world Class of 2020. I wish you well.”

Each graduate's name was announced by Michael Schneider Provost and Dean of the College as they walked across the stage to shake President McGadney’s hand. Graduates and their families took a moment of silence when the name of Fazley Shebaz Chowdhury was read in memoriam. He passed in December of 2020.

Tianna Cervantez '06 Executive Director for Diversity Equity and Inclusion and Director of Intercultural Life concluded the ceremony. “I am inspired. Inspired by you and all the awesome life-changing work I know you are prepared to do in this world” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As per the results the IT bellwether registered a net profit of Rs 9624 cr for the quarter ended September 2021 compared to Rs 9008 cr reported in the June quarter. It has reported a net profit of Rs 7475 cr in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal.

Nifty IT Index was also the index topper on NSE with with 4.7% gain for the week ended October 8. The index was also top gainer jointly with Nifty smallcap50 with 2.0% gains each on Friday.

Meanwhile as TCS results are for everyone to see what an investor could expect from other IT sector companies as far as Q2FY22 results are concerned and which shares should be in focus explains Zee Business senior research analyst Kushal Gupta.

He said seasonally Q2 is called strong quarter for IT sector space. ""Largely D-sreet's expectation is very positive and revenue growth by top IT companies is pegged to be around 5 per cent in Q2 FY22. Overall 4 to 7% growth is expected on QoQ "" he said.

Global IT services provider Accenture Q2 results will also act as precursor for other IT companies as we have seen that when Accenture results came last there was good action seen in the IT space said Kushal. We can however expect pressure on margin from Indian IT companies as many IT companies have announced wage hike which will certainly impact their earnings he said. Besides minor cut in subcontracting and utilisation rate will also affect margins to some level said the research analyst.

""In that case particulary the focus should be on Infosys Wipro and HCL Tech. MidCap IT companies are expected to perform even better especially on revenue front. On QoQ they can grow by 5 to 10% while large cap IT companies are expected to grow by 4% to 7% as far as their revenues are concerned. Also strong pipeline deals and completion of old deals would reflect in the results of the IT companies"" he said.

He further said one should also keep in mind that IT companies' shares are trading at premium valuations from their historice levels and devise strategy accordingly. It may happen that the kind of numbers IT companies throw in Q2 results may not reflect in stock prices.

TCS Q2 FY22 Results Key Highlights:

• Operating Margin at 25.6%; +0.1% QoQ -0.6% YoY

• Net Income at Rs 9624 crore +14.1% YoY | Net Margin at 20.5%

• Strong Client Addition: 5 New Clients (total: 54) in $100Mn+; 17 new clients (total: 114) in $50Mn+

I use it all the time and for the most part I stopped relying on Red Giant Colorista for all my grading. In the current version there is an AUTO option in Lumetri Color. To be honest I have never used it 😀 however to get a quick base these types of “auto” features can be helpful. Now with Auto Tone Color Adobe wants to make this auto-correction better.

How Auto Tone works

Auto Tone adjustments are reflected in the Basic Correction sliders at the top of the Lumetri panel and users can easily fine-tune the results. It acts as a guide to help editors become familiar with adjustments available to improve color in their video or a jumping-off point for more experienced users.

When it is released Auto Tone will replace the current Auto adjustment button in the Lumetri panel providing more sophisticated color correction with better results with a single click.

As currently implemented Auto Tone analyzes the unaltered source images and should be applied before adding other color effects. Auto Tone is not currently compatible with log-encoded video or log-to-Rec709 LUTs which is a shame as getting a base quickly would be helpful for people that don’t use LUT’s.

Download The Beta

Tone Color is available in the Creative Cloud app under Beta Apps. You have to download and install the Beta version Of Premiere Pro. This version won’t replace the current version.

Auto Tone color could be an easy fast way to get started and hopefully build some confidence with color grading. It’s a vital skill that I think every editor should learn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FpLWFyL2FydGljbGUvMjE3NDc2NDcvYWlibGUtaG93LWFpLWlzLWEtc3RyYXRlZ2ljLXRvb2wtZm9yLW1hbmFnaW5nLXRoZS1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How AI is a Strategic Tool for Managing the Supply Chain,"More and more supply chain leaders are considering incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into their business but are still skeptic. That’s because they’ve been on the receiving end of too many sales calls where companies say AI can change the world and magically do all sorts of things.

It turns out that it's easy to sell on hype but it's harder to actually deliver results. AI isn’t a crystal ball but it can be a powerful tool for organizations throughout the supply chain. From deciding what to keep in stock to absorbing the shocks that are bound to happen here’s how a flexible AI can help meet your business goals.

Providing advanced warnings

Our brains can only handle a limited amount of information. It’s not our fault; that’s just how we’re wired. We struggle when trying to make a decision that involves more than 4-5 factors. And because the global supply chain is so complex managers often have to account for more factors than that.

For example let’s say a customer had 40000 SKUs and five purchasing managers. That means each person was handling just under 10000 SKUs each. There’s no way they could possibly pay attention to each one.

A well-trained AI system however can handle that level of detail. It can see that a shipment has been stuck at customs for three days when it was supposed to clear in eight hours. And it can notify the purchasing manager about the issue and the risk of missing the delivery date. Rather than be caught off-guard later on after the delivery date comes and goes managers can get 3-4 days advance warning to proactively take action.

Deciding what to keep in stock

The past 18 months have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on businesses to manage supply and demand. Shipping is overwhelmed and supply shortages are everywhere.

The industry saw this problem play out with a retail automotive group focused on a particular type of service with other competitors that try to get that same business. The question they faced was we know we’re going to stock out of some products so which ones do we let go?

Using AI models they were able to double-down on the main product and let everything else stock out. The idea was tied to the importance of customer loyalty. They spun the shortage into an opportunity by focusing on the core products that people loved and those were the ones that kept them coming back.

Defining a new equilibrium

Before the pandemic the toilet paper market was pretty steady. But no one not even AI could have predicted how demand would spike in those early days. However where AI can be helpful is in mapping out what future scenarios could look like and under your best assumptions what your business’ best move would be.

By looking at “what ifs” even those that seem unlikely AI can set a new equilibrium and help organizations make smarter decisions when the unthinkable happens. In the case of toilet paper manufacturers AI can examine whether it makes sense to retool everything in the process or retool the 20% it takes to meet the initial demand with a projection that everything else is going to return to a base level.

Absorbing the shocks

When things are running smoothly most business’ supply chains are in a fairly steady state. You might sell 5000 units one month 5500 the next and 4500 after that but it’s generally pretty predictable.

The challenge that the supply chain faces is that all of that falls apart when shocks come through. All the nicely controlled just-in-time production systems are thrown into chaos. The result is that companies fall back into manual decision-making. They go into triage mode and begin guessing to find the right next step. But people aren’t good at making thousands of interconnected decisions on the fly and that’s where automated systems can come in and help steady the ship.

Remaining flexible

One AI horror story from the supply chain world comes when a consulting group told a global logistics company that the AI ran overnight and that it could tell them where every parcel was going to be where every trailer was going to be by the minute throughout the day.

That’s ridiculous of course because it shows a complete lack of understanding about the supply chain industry where conditions change by the minute. If someone calls in sick or even takes a restroom break that wasn’t accounted for in the AI model the entire model breaks down.

It’s possible however to take a more flexible approach updating those AI predictions as often as every 15 minutes. That’s the type of AI that learns on the ground and adjusts accordingly. It’s not so much a look into the future but a dynamic tool that reacts minute-by-minute.

Strategy first

To make the most of any AI tool companies must put their strategy first. Leaders should agree on what they’re trying to achieve and then apply AI to help them reach that goal. Rather than concentrate on which parcel ends up at which scanner at a precise time shift the focus to reducing overall costs and increasing operational efficiency. If you set a higher-level goal and hone in on the opportunities you're often going to get better results than trying to get everything perfect.",,,,,,,,,

Windows 11 bugs slow down AMD processors

American multinational semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) dealing with microprocessors and chips has published information about a pair of bugs that can reduce performance for Ryzen processors running Windows 11 by as much as 15 percent.

The bug can increase L3 cache latency by three times which in turn can affect apps that need quick access to memory reports Engadget.

The second bug is related to the “preferred core” feature that allows a system to use the fastest individual CPU cores in a processor.

As per the report AMD is working with Microsoft to resolve both issues and the fix is expected to arrive by the end of the month.

Windows 11 is available through a free upgrade on eligible Windows 10 PCs and on new PCs pre-installed with Windows 11 worldwide.

After you upgrade you’ll only have 10 days to revert back to Windows 10. Microsoft is supporting Windows 10 through 2025 but you’ll need to do a clean install (erase all your data) after that 10-day downgrade window.

New pre-installed Windows 11 devices have begun rolling out from partners including ASUS HP and Lenovo with more coming soon from partners like Acer and Dell.

According to the company Windows 11 features powerful new experiences whether users are working on a school project collaborating on a presentation for work building a new app or creating your next big idea.

Windows 11 comes with redesigns the Taskbar icons and Start menu. It also adds rounded corners for all program windows and built-in Teams chat.

Windows 11 also includes support for DirectStorage a feature first introduced on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles.

Quick forward to 2021 Asus have very quietly updated the UM425 series with more recent AMD Ryzen H specs a more complex thermal design to match those and an audio jack all available in the ZenBook 14 UM425QA lineup. We got one of these a retail unit available locally in stores and put it through our tests so we can share our findings with you down below.

Our configuration is the Ryzen 7 5800H processor with 16 GB of RAM 1 TB of storage and the 1W 400+ nits IPS panel available here in Europe for 1000 EUR at the time of this article with Ryzen 5 configurations starting at around 700 EUR. Both are excellently priced for what these laptops are.

In just a few words these UM425QA models are marginally thicker and heavier than the previous UM425IA/UA generation much more competent in demanding loads and run somewhat warmer even with the updated cooling design. These aside Asus seems to no longer have skimped on the panel quality keyboard and wifi connection at least on our configuration although that might differ between regions. We’ll get in-depth on all these down below.

Specs as reviewed- Asus ZenBook 14 UM425QA

Asus ZenBook 14 UM425QA Screen 14.0 inch 1920 x 1080 px IPS matte non-touch 1W 400+ nits Chi Mei N140HCE-EN2 panel Processor AMD Ryzen 7 5800H 8C/16T up to Ryzen 9 5900HX Video AMD Radeon Vega 8 8 CUs up to 2 GHz Memory up to 16 GB LPDDR4x-4266(soldered) Storage 1x M.2 PCIe x4 SSD (SK Hynix BC711) single M.2 2230 slot Connectivity Wireless 6 (Intel AX200) Bluetooth 5.0 Ethernet with adapter Ports 1x USB-A 3.2 gen1 2x USB-C 3.2 gen2 with data video and power HDMI 2.0 microSD card reader audio jack Battery 63 Wh 100W USB-C charger with quick-charging Size 319 mm or 12.5” (w) x 210 mm or 8.27” (d) x 16.8 mm or 0.66” (h) Weight 2.73 lbs (1.24 kg)+ .88 lbs (.4 kg) charger + cables EU version Extras white backlit keyboard glass NumberPad HD+IR webcam with Hello stereo bottom speakers sleeve

Asus offer the UM425QA series in a couple of different variants with a choice of Ryzen 5 5600H 7 5800H or 9 5900HX processors 8 or 16 GB of memory 512 or 1 TB of storage and either a 2.5W 250-nits or a 1W 400+ nits panel both matte and non-touch. The base models might get that dimmer and somewhat lower-quality panel and might also ship with WiFi 5 AC instead of WiFi 6 AX so make sure to carefully check the specs.

Here’s our coverage of the 2023 Asus ZenBook 14 (AMD/Intel) updates.

Design and construction

As mentioned earlier this UM425QA sub-series is a bit thicker and heavier than the other ZenBook 14 variants available out there but still highly portable for the 14-inch class. Our configuration is ~3mm thicker than the other models and tips the scales at 2.75 lbs (1.25 kg) plus .9 lbs (.4 kg) for the charger while the variants based on Intel/AMD U-class hardware are about 1.2 kilos and come with a more compact and lighter charger at around .2 kilos.

These aside all these ZenBooks are identical in design and craftsmanship. Aluminum is used for the entire exterior chassis with a plastic inner frame so these are not unibody builds but they do feel nice and premium to the touch.

However much like on all the ZenBook 14s tested before I also noticed the same creaky/squeaky noises in the chassis. They’re mostly coming from the bottom D-panel and you’ll hear them when grabbing the laptop picking it up from a corner or when opening the screen.

That last part is caused by this whole design which lifts up the laptop’s main body on small rubber feet placed at the bottom of the screen part. This way the laptop offers a slightly inclined typing position and allows for better airflow into the fan through the unobstructed air-intakes on the bottom. However this design also places the outputs just under the screen which means that most of the hot air blows straight into the panel. That’s one of my common complaints with most of the ultrabooks sold by Asus these days and as you’ll see in the Performance and Emissions sections it’s still something to be aware of and consider in your decision here.

All in all though this ZenBook is a practical and ergonomic laptop. I like the clean design and the fairly subtle branding and I like how the smooth metal used for the interior feels to the touch. Both the arm-rest and the lid-cover smudge very easily though and you’ll constantly have to rub them clean. I also appreciate the full-size inputs and the spacious arm-rest on this laptop the fair-sized bezels with still room for a camera at the top of the screen and the laptop’s good grip on a flat surface despite it resting on those tiny back feet.

On the other hand this series still integrates a light into the power button/key and it’s not the newer design available on the late-2021 ZenBook generation the one without a light and a finger-sensor baked into it. That light is dim but still annoying when using the laptop at night. At least the status LEDs are on the sides and not under the screen.

I also find the front lip and corners of this design too sharp for my liking and bitty on the wrists even more on this model that sits a little bit higher off the desk than the other ZenBooks.

Finally the IO is lined around the edges and pretty good here. This is an AMD laptop so there’s no Thunderbolt but the two USB-C ports are gen2 and both support data video and charging. There’s also a full-size HDMI port on the left side and a full-size USB-A gen1 on the right where you’ll also find an OK micro SD card reader.

Oh yeah and the 3.5 mm audio jack is back on this generation on the right side after Asus decided to skip on it on some of their 2020 models. That made no sense and I’m glad they brought it back.

Keyboard and trackpad

I’ve said it before and I’m going to say it again: these 14-inch ZenBooks offer some of the best inputs you can find on any ultrabook these days.

However I still think that Asus might source their keyboards from a few different places as this keyboard on the UM425QA still feels a bit different to me a bit softer and mushier than what’s available on the UX425 models. I remember the strokes being firmer on the UX425s and I also have one of the newer ZenBook 14X here for a side-by-side comparison and that keyboard also feels a bit firmer to me. Here’s a detailed comparison of the ZenBook 14 and 14X lineups if interested.

At the same time I must add that I got along much better typing on this UM425QA than on the older UM425IA/UA models and I think most of you should not have a problem using this keyboard everyday or even type for a living on it.

The keys are also dark-gray so offer good readability and contrast with the white illumination. You can set the LEDs on three brightness levels; these don’t get very bright on even the top setting but they’re fine to use in the dark. I also found the uniformity to be quite good here and little light creeping from underneath the keycaps. Furthermore Asus implemented LED indicators for Caps Lock or Fn+Esc here as well as implemented the ability to reactivate the lighting with a gentle swipe over the clickpad once it times out.

For the mouse this ZenBook offers the now-standard NumerPad a spacious and smooth feeling glass surface that acts as an excellent clickpad with daily use or as a potential NumerPad with the press of the dedicated touch are in the top-right corner.

As for biometrics there’s no finger-sensor on the Zenbook UM425 but you do get an IR camera at the top of the screen with Windows Hello support.

Screen

Based on the specs-sheet on Asus’s website they still offer two screen options for the ZenBook 14 UM425QA series. Both are matte non-touch 14-inch IPS panels with FHD resolution but one is a dimmer option with roughly 250-nits of max brightness and the other is this newer generation and more efficient 1W panel with 400+ nits of maximum brightness.

We have the better panel on our review unit but if you’re interested in what to expect from the base panel we’ve tested it in the previous-gen UM425 here.

Back to our review unit we measured 500+ nits of brightness at the maximum setting with good contrast and fair-blacks wide viewing angles and alright color coverage at 100% sRGB.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: Chi Mei CMN14D5 (N140HCE-EN2);

Coverage: 96.7% sRGB 67.0% Adobe RGB 69.0% DCI-P3;

Measured gamma: 2.19;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 518.53 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 30.23 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1185:1;

White point: 6700 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.43 cd/m2;

PWM: possible 25K Hz and <30% brightness (to be updated).

This also came very well calibrated out of the box and tuned out to be uniform in luminosity and color plus with little to no light bleeding around the edge.

If we’re to nitpick I will add that this doesn’t get very dim at the lower setting which might matter to some of you and it might also use PWM at low brightness levels. I don’t have the proper tools to test for PWM so I’m basing this on reports of the same panel used on a couple of other laptops. Nonetheless at this sort of high 25K Hz frequency the human eye cannot detect flickering so this should not be a concern to any of you with real use.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a top-specced configuration of the Asus ZenBook 14 UM425QA with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor and AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphics 16 GB of LPDDR4x-4266 memory and a fast 1 TB PCIe x4 SSD.

I should also add that this is a retail unit available locally in stores provided by Asus for this review and running on the software available as of early October 2021 (BIOS 206 MyAsus 3.0.22.0 app).

Spec-wise this is based on the 2021 AMD Cezanne Ryzen H hardware platform. Out configuration gets the main-stream Ryzen 7 5800H processor with 8Cores and 16 Threads snappy in single-core tasks and very competent in multitasking. It runs at 15-35W of sustained power in this implementation between the various power profiles which allows for faster CPU performance than on any other ZenBook 14 model.

Graphics are handled by the integrated AMD Radeon Vega 8 chip with 8 Compute Units and frequencies of up to 2.0 GHz and the higher sustained power settings allow this to run at maximum potential in GPU loads and games. Our configuration also comes with 16 GB of LPDDR4x-4266 memory in dual-channel the newer SR kind but with OK timings and latencies.

For storage Asus opted for a surprisingly fast SK Hynix drive here just keep in mind that the readings above are with the laptop plugged in and the drive is slightly limited in speeds when using the laptop on battery.

The SSD and wifi chips are the only upgradeable components here. To get to them you need to remove the back panel hold in place by a couple of Torx screws and two more extra screws hidden behind the rear-rubber feet. For some reason Asus implemented an M.2 2230 SSD format on this unit right next to another M.2 slot for the wireless. That’s going to make SSD upgrades rather difficult.

Inside you’ll also notice that this UM425QA series is different than all the other ZenBook 14s with extra space allocated to the dual-fan cooling module and a longer heatpipe.

The SSD has also been moved farther away from the CPU and gets both a metal heatsink and a thermal pad that links the heatsink to the metal back panel in order to better dissipate the heat. This works and I haven’t noticed any performance issues with the SSD during my time with this laptop. I did notice some sort of spill/oily liquid over the SSD on my unit and it seems to have originated from that thermal pad. It’s the first time I’m seeing this but I must remind you that this review unit is retail so if I were you I’d open this laptop up just to make sure there’s no spill inside.

As far as the software goes this ZenBook gets the standard MyAsus app which allows control over the power profiles battery and screen settings updates etc.

There are three performance/thermal profiles to choose from:

Performance – allows the CPU to run at 35+W in sustained loads with fans ramping up to 40-41 dB;

Standard – allows the CPU to run at 25+W in sustained loads with fans ramping up to 37-38 dB;

Whisper – limits the CPU at 15+W to favor lower fan-noise of sub 35 dB.

Whisper mode is perfectly capable for daily use and Standard is what I’d mostly recommend for demanding combined loads and that’s because the Performance profile offers marginal gains with an increase in noise and temperatures as you’ll see down below.

But first here’s what to expect in terms of speeds and temperatures with daily use with the laptop resting mostly silent and the fans only occasionally kicking on with multitasking.

OK so on to more demanding tasks we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 benchmark for 15+ times in a loop with 2-3 seconds delay between each run on the Performance mode.

The Ryzen 7 5800H processor peaks at 60W of power and then quickly drops and stabilizes around 35+ W of power with clock speeds of 3.2 GHz temperatures of 95+ degrees Celsius and fan-noise levels of around 40-41 dB. This results in very high scores for an ultrabook but at the same time the CPU is thermally throttled in comparison to beefier full-size implementations. For that reason opting for a Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU would make little sense here as that too would be thermally limited in multithreaded loads.

On standard the system limits the fans to 37-38 dB at head-level which is a noticeable difference. The CPU also ends up running at lower power and clocks as a result but still within less than 105 of what it delivers on the Performance mode while also running cooler in the high-80s. These findings are one of the reasons why I consider this Standard profile to be the best-balanced option for this ZenBook UM425QA chassis.

Finally you can also opt for the Whisper mode with limits the CPU at 15W with now barely audible fans and good temperatures in the mid-70s. The laptop still performs well even at these limited settings at ~30% under the results on the Performance profile.

Finally this ZenBook runs at 30W on the Performance mode when unplugged which once more is excellent performance for a portable design such as this one. All these findings are detailed in the chart below.

To put these findings in perspective here’s how the 27+W Ryzen 7 5800H (on the Standard profile) fares in this test against a couple of other portable laptops based on either AMD Ryzen 6/8 Core processors or against some of the Intel-based models.

I also tested the Ryzen 7 5800H CPU in the 3Dmark CPU test on Performance. We’re looking at 80-95% of the performance of the same 5800H processor in the full-size Lenovo Legion 5 laptop with the difference being larger in the 8 and 16 Threads tests where the power limitation kicks in here.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings by running the longer and more challenging Cinebench R23 and Prime95 tests which both resulted in ~35W of sustained CPU power.

Finally the 3DMark stress benchmark runs the same test 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time in combined CPU+GPU loads and this laptop flawlesly passed it. This suggests a good thermal profile and no performance losses as the heat builds up.

Next here are some benchmark results. We ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the Performance profile on this Ryzen 7 5800H configuration. Here’s what we got.

Once more these are good results for a Ryzen 7 5800H implementation nearly on-par with the beefier laptops in low-thread tests and roughly 10-205 lower in the all-thread benchmarks.

At the same time this full-power Ryzen 7 performs excellently in multi-threaded loads in comparison to most other portable designs. The few AMD Ryzen 7 4800U/5800U models are the only ones to come close and even most of those are not able to run at 35+W of sustained power that’s possible here. Of course the AMD Ryzen hardware in performance 14-inchers such as the Asus Zephyrus G14 or the Razer Blade 14 clearly outmatch this ZenBook UX425QA but those are also significantly thicker and heavier devices. Still Ryzen H hardware seems to make it into more and more portable and mid-sized 14-inch designs now so I’d expect this ZenBook UM425QA to get some matching competition in the near future.

CPU aside this configuration is rather unbalanced as the Vega iGPUs bundled with this generation of AMD hardware are still not the greatest performers. In fact even the lower power chips in the Intel Tiger Lake ZenBooks outscore it by a fair margin (10-25% between tests) and that’s despite the fact that the Vega 8 chip runs at full potential in this laptop. It’s just not competitive enough for now but that will most likely change next year with the Ryzen 6000 hardware platform and the RDNA2 based Vega graphics.

For now though the GPU performance of this ZenBook UM425QA configuration is not amazing by today’s standards and if that’s important to you I’d advise either going with a Tiger Lake options or better yet with something that integrates some sort of dedicated graphics. Even an MX350 chip would be a solid update and from there on you can go up to 1650 3050 3050Ti ultraportable and onwards to higher-tier models if within your budget.

Nonetheless we also ran a couple of DX11 DX12 and Vulkan titles on the Best Performance profile of this Ryzen 7 + vega 8 configuration at FHD resolution and Low/Lowest graphics settings and we’ve thrown in a few other similar platforms tested recently for comparison. Here’s what we got:

We’re still looking at 60+ framerates in the older titles but 25-40 fps in the more demanding AAA games launched in recent years. Not bad not great.

The performance logs down below show the CPU/GPU clocks and temperatures in a couple of games. The Ryzen hardware runs somewhere in the 25-30W of power between the tested titles with the GPU averaging very close to its maximum speeds of 2.0 GHz. This however results in fairly high temperatures somewhere in the 83-90 degrees Celsius and 72-75 C on the GPU.

Lifting up the laptop from the desk is going to improve the airflow into the fans and help shed roughly 3-7 degrees out of those temperatures. Using a cooling pad underneath your laptop should further make an even bigger difference on these temperatures but none of these tricks help improve the gaming performance as that’s already pretty much the maximum you can get with this platform by default.

On the other hand the Standard profile might make sense here. You’ll sacrifice on framerates by 10-15% but you’ll end with quieter fans and CPU temps in the 80-85 C with the GPU in the 70-75 C. That’s with the laptop sitting on the desk so they would drop more of you lift it up or put it on that cooling pad.

Finally here’s how well this laptop performs when unplugged on the Standard mode.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

Asus went with a more advanced thermal module here than they put on most of their ultrabooks with two thick heatpipes and two fans grouped together on a single radiator.

I do prefer a design with separated fans and the components placed in between the kind available in portables laptops like the new Asus ZenBook 14X or Lenovo IdeaPad 7 Slim. Nonetheless even this design is more competent than what you will normally find in sub-1000 USD/EUR ultrabooks and it does allow the AMD hardware to run well.

However the components end up running at high temperatures at max load but my major pea is with the hot air being pushed into the screen with this design. The plastic bezel soaks up some of the heat but even so the actual panel averages temperatures in the high-40s Celsius right near the radiator on the Performance mode.

It doesn’t heat up as much on the Standard mode as in this case the internal components run a bit cooler and the fans spin slower so don’t push out the hot air as aggressively into the screen. This is the final reason I suggest considering the Standard profile over Performance on this laptop even if it comes with a slight decrease in capabilities.

As far as the noise goes the fans spin at 40-41 dB at head-level on Performance and 37-38 dB on Standard which is a noticeable difference with real use.

On the other hand with daily use this ZenBook runs completely silent on Whisper mode with the fans resting idly most of time and only occasionally kicking in with multitasking. I haven’t noticed any coil whine or electronic noises on this unit.

*Daily Use – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Whisper Mode fans at 0-35 dB

*Gaming – playing Far Cry 5 for 30 minutes Standard Mode fans at 37-38 dB

*Gaming – playing Far Cry 5 for 30 minutes Performance Mode fans at 40-41 dB



For connectivity there’s the latest-gen WiFi 6 with an Intel AX200 module on this laptop. It performed well with our setup and the signal and performance remained strong at 30-feet with obstacles in between. However careful that some UM425 configurations shipped with WiFi 5 AC chips in the past and I wouldn’t be surprised if that also happens on the lower-tier configuration of this UM425QA series especially with the current chip shortage.

Audio is handled by a set of stereo speakers that fire through those grills on the underside with the angled shape of the D-Panel allowing the sound to bounce off the table and preventing you from easily muffling these when using the computer on the lap.

I didn’t get Audio Wizard installed on my unit and out of the box these speakers were fairly loud and 78-80 dB at head-level with average sound quality and not much on the lower end. These also distort to some degree at maximum volume and push vibrations into the frame so you shouldn’t really expect to use them at higher than 60% volumes where they should be just fine for videos movies and music playing in the background.

Finally I should mention there’s an HD camera placed at the top of the screen OK for occasional calls but still washed out and not much in terms of quality.

Battery life

There’s a 63 Wh battery inside the ZenBook UM425QA series a bit smaller than what Asus put on the previous Um425 generation but still larger than what you’d normally get on a 14-inch notebook. Combined with the efficient AMD hardware and screen this notebook will last for a fair while on a charge.

Here’s what we got on this review unit with the screen set at around 120-nits (60% brightness).

7.5 W (~8+ h of use) – text editing in Google Drive Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– text editing in Google Drive Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 6.2 W (10+ h of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 5.5 W (12+ h of use) – Netflix fullscreen in Edge Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– Netflix fullscreen in Edge Whisper + Better Battery Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 9 W (~6-8 h of use) – browsing in Edge Standard + Better Performance Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON.

Somehow continuously using the keyboard seems to affect the battery life here which impacted our Text Editing scenario.

The laptop ships with a 100W charger that plugs in via USB-C. It’s a dual-piece design with a fairly compact brick but long and thick cables that add up to a fair bit of bulk at .4 kilos in weight. A full charge takes about 2 hours with quick-charging.

Price and availability- ZenBook 14 UM425QA

The ZenBook 14 UX425QA is available in stores at the time of this post.

Over here in Europe the Ryzen 7 + 16 GB RAM + 1 TB SSD configuration goes for 999 EUR and that includes the brighter and more efficient screen option. Ryzen 5 models with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSDs are also available from 699 EUR.

You’ll also find this in the UK starting at 899 GBP for the Ryzen 7 model while in Canada the base Ryzen 5 configuration starts at 999 CAD.

However finding this in the US seems difficult at this point. It was available at BestBuy and Amazon for $999 for the Ryzen 9 5900HX + 16 GB RAM + 1 TB SSD configuration but it seems to be out of stock right now. Hopefully it will be available again in the near future.

We’ll update when we know more and in the meantime follow this link for updated prices and configurations in your region.

Final thoughts- Asus ZenBook 14 UM425QA review

All in all this ZenBook 14 UM425QA is a good-value performance ultrabook. It’s significantly more powerful than the average portable laptop that you can get for under 1000 USD/EUR these days especially in demanding loads that require a fast CPU. It also offers a more advanced internal cooling module while not sacrificing on portability style practicality or battery life. At the same time this Ryzen H configuration is somewhat unbalanced with only Vega iGPU graphics not really the right match for what this can do on the CPU side. I’m also not a fan of this sort of design that blows the hot air straight into the screen which is still implemented on this series.

But if you do need that fast CPU in this sort of portable chassis and you’re OK with the quirks mentioned throughout this article you’ll not go wrong with the ZenBook 14 UM425QA.

On the other hand if you don’t plan on running demanding CPU-heavy workloads on your laptop such as perhaps programming or engineering or even video editing software this sort of Ryzen H configuration might not even be for you. Furthermore your money would be better spent elsewhere if gaming sits high on your list of priorities where an option with some sort of dGPU would make more sense.

Finally if you’re not in hurry to get a new computer right now I’d also remind you of the ZenBook 14X models recently unveiled with an updated thermal design that blows the hot air onto the sides and some extra screen options (OLED higher-resolution and touch) that are not available on the UX425QA series. Those should be available in stores later this year and most likely get a bump to the Ryzen 6000 hardware with RDNA2 Vega graphics at some point in 2022. We’ll have a follow-up article comparing the regular ZenBook 14 designs with the updated ZenBook 14X models in the near future.

Anyway this wraps up my time with the Asus ZenBook 14 UM425QA and I’d love to hear what you think about it som get in touch in the comments section down below.

Photo indicates Tiger is back on the golf course watching over son Charlie club in hand,"Tiger Woods has been in recovery since his single-car accident back in February. Woods suffered fractures to his tibia and fibula in his right leg along with other damage to the lower leg. He’s been spotted out and about in L.A. visiting doctors during his rehab sitting in a cart watching his son Charlie play golf but this sighting is a little bit different.

A photo posted to the Twitter account @TWLEGION appears to show Woods keeping an eye on his son on the range reportedly at a junior event in Florida. Woods is standing on his own – no crutches or golf cart – with a golf club in hand with just a black sleeve on the majority of his right leg.

🚨BACK ON THE COURSE — Tiger Woods was seen this weekend in Florida watching his son compete at a junior event. TW was wearing a sleeve on his right leg & golf clothes on the range with a club in hand. First sighting in quite some time. 🙌 (Post credit: Mack Williams / Facebook) pic.twitter.com/U7Ie42ZxOE — TWLEGION (@TWlegion) October 9 2021

We haven’t heard much from Woods since his accident but we did hear about his conversation with the U.S. Ryder Cup team a few weeks ago at Whistling Straits. His message obviously resonated with the team as they would go on to demolish the European side 19-9.

This image should serve as another positive sign for golf fans as it appears we may see Woods return to the PGA Tour after all. Steve Stricker had this to say about Woods in the days leading up to the Ryder Cup.

“He won’t be able to be a captain’s assistant this time around because of his on-going rehabilitation to try and get better. To try to play golf again. And that is going well” Stricker said. “He’s progressing. He’s doing well things are moving in the right direction.”

We’ve seen incredible things from Woods including his triumph at Augusta National back in 2019. At this point it’s impossible to doubt him.",,,,,,

On those weekends when he couldn't get out of town he rented the RV through a posting on Craigslist.

It was a hit. So he bought several more Sprinters built a website and recruited others to list their campers and motor homes creating a marketplace that works like an Airbnb on wheels.

""I'm a joy broker"" he said.

At a time when other segments of the travel industry are struggling Sprayberry joins a growing number of local and national websites involved in peer-to-peer RV rentals. The sites connect road trippers to individual RV owners and cater to people who want to turn their depreciating campers and motorhomes into income-generating assets.

The biggest national RV peer-to-peer web sites include Outdoorsy.com which touts thousands of listings in 11 countries and RVshare which has more than 100000 RV listings across the U.S.

Unlike RV dealers and traditional rental companies such as Cruise America which have long managed fleets of rentals that they own and maintain these new generation of technology-based companies serve as matchmaking sites for RV owners and enthusiasts.

Grady Linder left and Ryan Lloyd launched a no-frills camper van rental service in 2017.

The rise of the websites come at a time when RV sales — and prices — are soaring. The coronavirus pandemic gave those with a bit of disposable income and a sense of adventure permission to live like nomads and work from anywhere. Travel by RV also helped people feel safe from the spread of COVID-19.

At the website RVshare.com summer bookings in the Twin Cities this year were up 52% compared with last year. Nationwide the company's bookings tripled during the past 12 months.

Grady Linder of Minneapolis is among those trying to capitalize on the camper craze. After experiencing the joys of the open road himself in 2017 he started converting small ""transit vans"" that are easy to park and get nearly 30 miles per gallon into no-frills campers that he rents on various peer-to-peer websites.

His company Twin Cities-based Voyager Campervans has expanded to include Austin Texas; Nashville and Phoenix.

""These are all people who have never owned an RV before"" Linder said. ""This is their entry into the RV world.""

Demand for RVs has been so strong that Linder is now selling them too. He charges about $12000 to build out a van that someone already owns. A new fully converted model runs about $38000.

Paul Bolstad and his wife Sheryl are prime targets for the growing peer-to-peer rental marketplace. The couple devoted tent-campers are now in their 60s. That kind of roughing it just isn't comfortable anymore.

""The rocks are getting bigger and the ground is getting harder"" said Bolstad a professor at the University of Minnesota.

Unwilling to give up their time in the wilds but reluctant to sleep on the ground they decided to test the RV lifestyle by renting a 19-foot Sprinter van from Sprayberry's website for a three-week trek through the Canadian Rockies.

""It's as big as you can get and it still drives like a car"" he said. ""And this is is as close as you can get to camping without having to sleep in a tent.""

Though they loved the freedom of being able to camp in national parks prepare food on the road and not have to worry about finding a hotel Bolstad said they can't justify the expense of buying one.

""These things are $80000 to more than $100000 to buy; you'd have to spend a lot of nights in it for it to pencil out"" he said praising the wisdom of those who rent their camper vans on peer-to-peer sites. ""This allows them to own it and not have it be a $100000 driveway ornament.""

For Seth Alsbury a tech entrepreneur the path to RV ownership was paved by necessity. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic he was living in Los Angeles but had to get back to the Twin Cities quickly to be with his ailing father.

With so much unknown about transmission of the disease he didn't want to fly and he didn't want to drive a car and stay in hotels. So he bought a used 30-foot Class A motor home. In a nod to Star Wars he calls it the ""Millennium Falcon.""

Back in St. Paul while tending to his father he no longer needed the RV so he started renting it on a website he created. With bookings rolling in he shopped ads and auction sites to expand his fleet. As the pandemic spread so did his customer base.

One family needed to get an aging relative across the country for brain surgery. She relied on a wheelchair and an RV was the only way.

""The ability to travel self-contained is super fun and convenient but in the time of pandemic it was critical"" Alsbury said. ""We felt like we were essential workers on the front line of the pandemic.""

Alsbury now owns about 10 RVs that he markets through Sprayberry's websites and a site he launched himself. Like Sprayberry he's focused on managing the marketing and bookings. He relies on family and a network of mechanics to maintain his fleet and handle the check-ins and check-outs.

""We're on call 24/7"" he said. ""It's like having a newborn baby. When you get a call at midnight from across the country you've got to be there at all times.""

The rental income Alsbury said helps pay the bills and enables him to head south after winterizing the vehicles and putting them in storage. With leaf-peepers making their final trips and the rental season winding down he's already planning to drive one of the vehicles south to California or Mexico where he'll surf and play his saxophone.

""It's not technology money"" he said. ""But it's paying my bills.""

Sprayberry is also riding the success of his RV rental business which enabled him to go cold turkey on the corporate world after getting laid off in the early days of the pandemic.

""I got rid of all my khaki pants and almost anything with a collar"" he said. ""And I didn't have to feel guilty about not wearing pants during a Zoom meeting.""

He now manages about 70 camper vans travel trailers and motorhomes on his two websites RVThereYet.com and camptasticrentals.com.

Many of his more affordable rentals go for about $125 per night and the average driveable rental booking brings in $3500 to $4500 per booking for which he takes a cut.

Sprayberry also feeds his listings to the national websites which he says take a higher portion of the fees. In an increasingly crowded market he's trying to differentiate himself from those platforms by providing a higher level of customer service and by taking a smaller share of the rental income than many of the national marketing sites.

""For me it's just owners and prospective renters talking directly"" he said. ""I don't have the middleman fees.""

Because it's mostly a seasonal business he's laser-focused on keeping expenses low. He pays or barters with friends and neighbors to let him store his RVs in their driveways. He's the sole employee of the company and he doesn't have an office enabling him to truly work remotely as he's shuttling from one picture-perfect outdoor destination to the next.

""Anybody who sees me on my Facebook thinks I don't have a job"" he said. ""It's part of my brand to make it look like I don't.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LWRldmVsb3Blci13aG8tMTYtYWlyYm5icy0yMTc5OTM0NNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LWRldmVsb3Blci13aG8tMTYtYWlyYm5icy0yMTc5OTM0NC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The entrepreneur who has 16 Airbnbs in Manchester-from renting out his own home,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Entrepreneur Corin Craig Jackson is on course for his first million with his burgeoning luxury aparthotel business - after starting by hiring out his own apartment on Airbnb while he slept in his car or sofa-surfed at friends' houses.

Corin bought his first Manchester city centre apartment for £117500 straight after graduating from Manchester University after saving up the £20000 salary he earned for a placement year during his business degree to use as a deposit.

After buying the two-bed apartment he set to work giving it a New York loft style makeover and decided to try testing it out for short term lets on Airbnb seven years ago when the rental site was in its infancy.

Now he has a portfolio of 16 aparthotel rooms with another seven in the process of being either purchased - or renovated ready for rental - under his Jacksonheim Boutique brand.

Corin said: “When I first started seven years ago the first property I listed on Airbnb was my New York Boutique apartment - that was my own home.

""I basically went and slept in my car or sofa surfed at friends’ houses so I could let it out.

“It was only the third apartment listed on Airbnb in Manchester at that time.

“I wasn't getting anywhere near the prices I'm getting now but it started as a good side earner for me.”

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

Corin had joined the graduate scheme for a large confectionery business after completing his degree and as he rose up the ranks in the company he used his disposable income to start buying other properties which he could upgrade and then put as short-term lets on Airbnb.

“I was using my salary to support mortgage applications and my income from the apartments to grow"" he said.

“It got to the stage in December 2019 that I was earning more from the apartments than from my six figure salary and so I knew it was time to take the plunge and make that my full time business.”

But within months of that decision the global pandemic hit - and the country went into lockdown in March 2020.

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

Far from being put off from buying more apartments Corin saw it as an opportunity to further develop his burgeoning brand - even though friends and family thought he was “mad” for doing so.

Since lockdown restrictions eased earlier this year he has been reaping the rewards with a buoyant letting market as people escape for ""staycation"" breaks in the UK amid ongoing uncertainty over foreign travel.

Corin 30 said: “In March 2020 the market disappeared and everyone told me I was mental but I persevered.

""And now I have a portfolio of 16 properties and 6-7 on the way to completion there's rapid growth there it has been a lockdown success story for us.

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

“Everyone was saying to pull out the travelling market is not there but I was saying 'look the market will come back you told me I was stupid the first time around'.

""And since June as soon as we came out of lockdown it went crazy.”

He now has 16 apartments available to book via Airbnb Booking.com and directly from Jacksonheim Boutique as well as other property developments underway.

Corin's original NYC Boutique apartment remains one of his most popular rooms in his Jacksonheim Boutique aparthotel collection of 16 individually styled apartments across Manchester.

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

Corin says there can be huge sums to be made especially when big events are happening in Manchester like big football matches or the recent return of Parklife festival - when Airbnb rooms were in such high demand prices inflated to £1000 a night - up from starting prices at off-peak times from £75 a night.

“The NYC Boutique is pretty much fully booked up until December every single night. That’s £3900 gross revenue a month while the best performing will do about £6900 a month"" he said.

“Monthly turnover in total is in the region of £60000 with new additions nearer £70000 and I’ve no doubt by the end of the year turnover will be hitting a million.”

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

Corin specialises in luxurious refurbs of the apartments to make them stand out from the ever-growing Airbnb crowds - his most recent transformations are two all-pink themed Boujee Boutique apartments.

“When I started out on Airbnb it was a niche consumer using it but now it's used by every man and his dog and is seen as a successful way of booking an alternative to a hotel"" he said.

“As purchasing behaviour has changed it’s become much more accepted.

“When I first told my mum and dad what I was doing they thought I was an idiot but now it has come full circle and they're using Airbnb for breaks as well.

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

“That's how much people's perceptions of the platform have changed in such a short space of time.

“It started as a side earner but now I employ 12 people to run the portfolio.”

And he believes that anyone can give Airbnb a go - even if you don’t own your own home.

(Image: Jacksonheim Boutique)

Corin said: “I'm a big believer that anyone can do it.

“You don't necessarily have to own a property either you just have to have permission to sub-let from your landlord.

You could start your own short-term let business from your phone.”

But Corin says he wouldn’t recommend doing what he did by sleeping in your car to do it.

He laughed: “I would never recommend anyone to do that I'm a bit of a crazy person I do appreciate not everyone would do that.”

Residents business owners and long-term renters warn the huge growth in people buying properties in Thanet specifically for holiday lets is ""killing the community"".

They claim that people from the area are having to move away due to the lack of long-term rental homes or the significant costs involved.

There are currently more than 300 Airbnbs available in Margate - compared to just 15 rental properties advertised on Rightmove.

Meanwhile in Tonbridge which at 11 has the fewest ""entire property"" Airbnbs in Kent there are 36 homes available to rent.

The issue has been highlighted in a motion due to be put forward by Margate councillor Rob Yates to Thanet District Council next week.

In it he calls for rules to be introduced to tackle the ""serious issue"" including restricting occupied nights for entire property Airbnb rentals to 90 per year.

The Old Town area of Margate is a popular Airbnb destination

Such measures were introduced in Greater London five years ago to free up much-needed housing stock.

Cllr Yates says unless something similar is done in Thanet people from the area will no longer be able to find a long-term place to rent and will have to move away.

""Someone wanting to rent out their spare room for Airbnb is not a problem; it's people buying properties and then renting the whole thing out on Airbnb"" he said.

""They aren't part of the Margate community they are using Margate as an investment opportunity.""

Cllr Yates warns Thanet will end up like Newquay with empty properties in the towns for half of the year.

Cllr Rob Yates is putting a motion forward about Airbnbs

He also says as businesses in the thriving towns grow more staff are needed yet there are less places for them to live.

In his motion - which he says has won support from everyone he has spoken to - he highlights the concern raised by residents around the growth in Airbnbs especially in relation to the reduction in long-term rentable properties.

""We welcome the majority of visitors to Thanet who make an important contribution to our economy but we hear residents’ concerns and wish to take action to control this serious issue which is damaging our community and damaging the reputation of Airbnb"" he said.

""This council recognises that it currently does not possess the powers to intervene and regulate these properties and that this is a problem faced by many local authorities across the country.""

In the motion he asks that planning restrictions affecting short-term rentals be introduced such as change-of-use regulations that are required in London to turn a property into an Airbnb.

Margate Arts Club recently sparked a debate on the matter with this post

He also asks that the leader of Thanet council Cllr Ash Ashbee write to Marie Lorimer the UK public policy manager at Airbnb to request a meeting and seek to introduce a 90-day annual limit for entire home rentals in Thanet within the platform.

Cllr Yates says the competition for long-term renters is too much and something needs to be done.

Margate Arts Club recently sparked the debate on its Instagram page by posting ""Airbnb is killing our community"" which won support from business owners and residents including tenants who commented on how hard it is to find somewhere to rent.

The club says the effects of buying properties for the sole purpose of letting them as a holiday home is devastating to communities and independent businesses.

""Holiday lets force the housing prices/rent up and full-time residents out"" it stated.

Whitstable is another popular Airbnb destination with more than 300 available compared to just 17 rental properties on Rightmove

""We don't want dead zones or a seasonal town. Berlin and Barcelona have felt the devastating affects of Airbnb and passed legislation to curb it.

""It's really sad to see friends creatives and locals who have helped make this town become so amazing displaced.

""When the winter hits business owners rely on people who permanently live in the area to support them. If the community has moved on these businesses will go also.

""What's the point of the Airbnbs if the cultural infrastructure has been forced on to the next 'cool'/rundown place anyway?""

A study by Visit Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University showed the number of Airbnb properties in Thanet increased by 450% between 2016 and 2019.

""When the winter hits business owners rely on people who permanently live in the area to support them...""

Searches on the Airbnb website show there are currently more than 300 ""entire place"" stays available in Margate compared to 230 in Broadstairs and 195 in Ramsgate.

Cllr Yates's motion will be discussed at a full council meeting on Thursday at 7pm.

A spokesman for Airbnb said: “Airbnb is built on the foundation of helping people afford their homes and making communities stronger and we have reached out to Thanet Council to offer our support.

""Across the UK the majority of Hosts share a space in their own home and nearly a third of UK Hosts say that the additional income is an economic lifeline. We take housing concerns seriously and have called for a nationwide registration system to better understand the impact of short-term letting activity on local areas and an update to planning guidance to empower local authorities.”

Or follow us on Google News

One of the most interesting highlights of the 2021 Tesla Annual Meeting this week was Elon Musk’s continued focus on safety. I think it’s safe to even call it an obsession.

It’s highly ironic. The biggest myths and concerns in the media and among the general public about Tesla are misguided safety concerns. They are often genuine concerns — not manufactured attacks — but are misguided nonetheless. I’ll come back to these concerns in a moment but let’s start with the highlights from the annual meeting.

Tesla Factory Safety 18% Better Than Average Goal Is To Have Safest Factory

First of all Elon Musk highlighted that Tesla factory safety has improved considerably as Tesla has scaled up and matured as a company. He pointed out that Tesla factory safety was 18% higher than the automotive industry average. In other words Tesla factory workers get hurt less.

Furthermore Elon said I think for the first time that Tesla aims to have the safest factory in the world. A fan of superlatives he doesn’t want Tesla to just be good or above average — he wants Tesla to get another #1 under its belt. Though this time it’s not about the quickest car the top selling car the longest range electric car or anything else in the “bragging rights for customers” category. Nope — Elon just really wants to have and be able to say they have the safest factory in the industry.

Safest ATV

Elon mentioned that they are trying to design and develop the safest ATV (4-wheeler). ATVs are not very safe but Elon is looking for ways to truly improve on their safety.

Johnna already wrote about this. Again though it stood out to me during the annual meeting and is one of the things that stimulated this article. It’s just such a strange focus area. The ATV itself is not really that notable to me. But the fact that with such a limited-impact and sporty product Tesla is highlighting safety above all else — well it just jumps out and broadcasts that Elon Musk and Tesla are hyper-focused on safety.

Tesla Autopilot & Full Self-Driving

This is the big one. Why does Elon focus so much on Autopilot and the “Full Self-Driving” package*? Because he’s obsessed with saving lives and preventing accidents. This is the point of Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD). (*This doesn’t yet offer full self-driving cars but aims to make existing cars 100% self-driving via software updates over time.)

So far we don’t have a good statistically sound analysis to determine if Autopilot or FSD Beta are saving lives or preventing accidents. The stats used in the following graph don’t have an adequate control group. They do imply that Tesla’s Autopilot features help prevent accidents and deaths but be cautious to not make a firm conclusion on that since: where Autopilot is used what class of cars have similar features and other qualities of Tesla vehicles with Autopilot engaged and the people who drive them might be the most important factors influencing crash rates.

I use Autopilot every day though and I’m convinced that it increases safety significantly. That is certainly the goal.

The ironic thing here is that there’s so much fear-mongering about Tesla Autopilot and Tesla FSD Beta. Tesla is doing what it can to prevent accidents yet critics are attacking FSD Beta’s methods of doing so without any real evidence that Tesla’s methods are not working.

Batteries

The hype around potential battery fires has come and gone routinely since I started covering Tesla 9 years ago. For some reason it’s very easy for common people to get concerned about a tiny possibility of electric vehicle battery fires yet not think twice about the highly flammable containers we all carry along with us through the day.

It doesn’t help that national media outlets will cover the 3 or so Tesla battery fires a year but completely ignore the tens of thousands of gas-tank fires. This tremendous imbalance leads to imbalance in public perception.

Ironically Tesla has built some of the safest most reliable batteries in the industry. But what else could one expect from Tesla? It safety obsession is real and really helpful.

Tesla Safety Score

I wrote about this at length the other day so I’ll just direct you to that piece in case you missed it: I’d Bet Tesla’s “Safety Score” Has Increased Safe Driving Significantly.

Vehicle Design

Perhaps the most well known of all of these points is what’s represented in the chart at the top of the article. When the Model 3 came out the Model 3 Model S and Model X had the lowest “probability of injury” scores ever recorded by the NHTSA. Elon has said that safety is their #1 priority when designing cars and that has seemingly been confirmed by the record-breaking ratings. For more on Tesla vehicle safety see: “Why Tesla Model 3 Is The Safest Car On The Planet (Video).”

Overall from factories to cars to insurance and beyond Tesla has a strong safety record. In fact it’s got such a strong record that it seems safety is a company obsession.

We’re seeing political moves to boost clean energy sources over fossil fuels as well as to promote cleaner tech especially vehicles. One immediate result is a wide array of companies new and old getting into the electric vehicle (EV) business and its auxiliaries opening up new opportunities for investors.

One particularly strong field for such opportunities: supporting infrastructure. Developing new battery technology recycling old batteries expanding the EV charging network exploring and exploiting lithium deposits – these and more are all areas that will need solutions as the number of electric cars on the roads continues to grow. And the companies that can successfully build in one of these niches will bring investors the returns they want.

With this in mind we’ve used TipRanks' database to look up the latest details on three EV battery stocks. They are producing the raw materials and support structure that EVs require for success. And better yet Wall Street’s analysts see them as mid- to long-term winners. Let's take a closer look.

Lithium Americas (LAC)

We’ll start with a mining company. Lithium Americas a Canadian-based resource company has two major projects for the production of battery-grade lithium carbonate. This is an essential mineral in the current rechargeable battery production and Lithium Americas’ projects are expected to produce approximately 100000 metric tons annually over the next four decades. The mines Cauchari-Olaroz in northern Argentina and Thacker Pass in Nevada are gearing up for production in the next 6 to 8 months. Thacker Pass contains the most significant recoverable lithium deposits in the US.

Lithium Americas reported in its 2Q results that both projects remain on track. The Cauchari-Olaroz project has 1200 workers on site and chemical and processing plants for recovered lithium which are being built at the mine site are two-thirds or more complete. This Argentinian lithium project is expected to produced 40000 tons annually of the company’s total starting in the middle of next year.

The Thacker Pass mine in Nevada is also reported to be meeting the company’s development schedule. The mine when it begins production later this year will make lithium a major export from Nevada which is already known as a mining-intensive state. The Thacker Pass mine is projected to reach some 60000 tons annually at full output.

Lithium Americas’ mines have not yet entered production so the company has no revenue stream as yet. This makes the stock highly speculative but with reason to be bullish: the company’s development is running on time as is the governmental regulatory process. In addition the company reported having $505 million in cash on hand and $156 million in undrawn credit at the end of 1H21 available for funding operations.

Story continues

J.P. Morgan's Tyler Langton sees potential for Lithium Americas – in fact the analyst initiated coverage of this stock with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and a price target of $28. This figure implies ~36% one-year upside potential. (To watch Langton’s track record click here)

Backing his stance Langton wrote: “Demand for lithium should roughly double from 2021E through 2025E and then double again from 2025E through 2030E. The biggest driver of this growth should be from electric vehicles (especially battery electric vehicles) continuing to gain share and larger battery sizes... LAC should see strong and steady production growth through the end of the decade while its two projects should have attractive positions on the cost curve. LAC also has a solid balance sheet to fund this growth and significant leverage to our lithium price forecasts…”

Overall there are 5 recent analyst reviews on file for Lithium Americas and they include 4 Buys against a single Hold to give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are selling for $20.60 and the $24.43 average price target suggests the stock has room for ~19% growth in the year ahead. (See LAC stock analysis on TipRanks)

Albemarle Corporation (ALB)

Next up is Albemarle a North Carolina-based chemical manufacturer. The company produces lithium and bromine chemical products as well as catalysts needed in other chemical manufacturing processes. Albemarle has been in business since the 1880s and has operations across the United States Chile and Western Australia as well as in East Asia the Middle East and Europe. The company is the largest global provider of lithium for EV battery backs.

Some recent numbers will show Albemarle’s importance in the global chemical industry. In the last reported quarter 2Q21 EPS hit $3.62 derived from $424.6 million in net income. This was more than 4x higher than the 80-cent EPS reported in the year ago quarter.

During the second quarter Albemarle streamlined its operations through the sale of its Fine Chemistry Services division to W.R. Grace & Company. The sale was worth $570 million of which $300 million was paid in cash and $270 million was issued to Albemarle as preferred equity in a W.R. Grace subsidiary. Albemarle will use the proceeds to execute its long-term growth strategy which includes a greater focus on lithium operations. The company reported that its lithium performance expanded in the first half of this year.

In September of this year Albemarle took a major step to increase its lithium production through the acquisition of the Chinese company Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials. Guangxi Tianyuan is a lithium converter company for which Albemarle agreed to pay US$200 million. The deal is expected to close early next year.

Berenberg analyst Sebastian Bray is openly bullish on Albemarle’s prospects writing of the company: “We expect demand for lithium the key material used in electric vehicle batteries to grow strongly during this decade and pricing to remain firm. We forecast long-term contract prices for Albemarle of USD16000 per ton significantly ahead of Albemarle’s 2020 Aaverage contract prices of USD13000... We expect Albemarle’s earnings to grow strongly on the back of lithium capacity additions. We estimate Albemarle’s production will increase five-fold by 2030E quickly contracting current valuation multiples.""

In line with these comments Bray rates ALB shares a Buy with a $280 price target that indicates a 12-month upside of 30%. (To watch Bray’s track record click here)

Albemarle also gets decent support from Bray's colleagues; Based on 10 Buys 4 Holds and 2 Sells the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $254.38 the average price target suggests upside of ~18% in the year ahead. (See ALB stock analysis on TipRanks)

ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT)

ChargePoint is one of the largest operators of EV charging station networks in the US and Europe. ChargePoint has more than 5000 commercial and fleet customers which include 76% of the Fortune 50 companies. In addition ChargePoint boasts over 118000 charging locations in its North American and European networks.

ChargePoint recent reported its Q2 fiscal 2022 results and showed revenue of $56.1 million up 61% year-over-year. Of that total revenue $40.9 million came from networked charging; this was a 91% gain yoy. The company reported more than $618 million in liquid assets.

In a point of interest for investors ChargePoint raised its full-year guidance range by 15% at the midpoint to the $225 million to $235 million range.

Earlier this month ChargePoint announced strategic moves in its European operations including the acquisition of has·to·be. has·to·be is the provider of be.ENERGISED a cloud-based e-mobility EV charging software platform. The acquisition will allow ChargePoint to further expand its position in the European EV charging ecosystem and follows the acquisition of ViriCiti in August.

In coverage for D.A. Davidson Matt Summerville notes two important factors in CHPT’s prospects: “(1) CHPT has a meaningful first-mover advantage in the North American public L2 EV charging market with a portfolio of well-regarded products 100% of which are sold with a CHPT Cloud software subscription (and an approximately 60% of which generate subscriptions from its Assure service/maintenance plan) and can be accessed via CHPT’s highly-downloaded/rated mobile app or via an EV’s infotainment system; (2) a growing presence in the rapidly-expanding European EV charging market underpinned by its recent acquisitions of has·to·be and ViriCiti…”

To this end Summerville rates the stock a Buy and his $30 price target suggests it sill grow 63% over the next year. (To watch Summerville’s track record click here)

Overall ChargePoint’s 11 recent analyst reviews include 7 Buys 3 Holds and 1 Sell giving the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $34 implies a bullish upside of ~85% from the current trading price of $18.40. (See CHPT stock analysis on TipRanks)

After joining the Florida State football team as a tight end ahead of the 2018 season McDonald launched a 501(c)3 non-profit called To Rise to Progress aimed at providing community relief in 2019.

Due to these efforts McDonald was named one of 109 nominees for the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team this past July.

He found out Sept. 24 that he is one of the 23 people (11 FBS players 11 players from other football divisions one coach) who has been named to the 2021 Allstate AFCA Good Works Team.

McDonald is the seventh FSU player to be named to the Good Works Team which recognizes off-field service efforts put forth by those in and around college football. He's the third Seminole on the team in the last six years joining former FSU tight end Mavin Saunders (2017) and former FSU center Alec Eberle (2016).

""So the fact that Allstate was able to choose me along with 22 of my peers to represent this year's Allstate AFCA Good Works Team is honestly the most humbling thing that I've been a part of in college up to this point. It's something that I'm very very proud of. I can't wait to see where the future takes me because obviously I'm headed in the right direction just by being a service-oriented person.""

This is the 30th year of the Good Works Team. However the 2021 team is different than any of the previous 29 due to the new era of name image likeness legislation in college athletics.

With college athletes now able to profit off themselves while retaining their eligibility Allstate is pledging $1 million to these Good Works Team players and the charities of their choice.

""We dedicate resources to financially empower people"" said Terrance Williams Good Works Team selection committee member and Executive Vice President and General Manager Allstate Agency Distribution.

""This historic decision allowing college athletes to be compensated for the use of their Name Image and Likeness means Allstate can foster equity for these athletes who are community leaders.""

Since its launch in 2019 To Rise and Progress (formerly The Making Change Foundation) has created a number of community service projects. These include a weekly pizza donation program to those in need during the academic year blanket and clothing drives a hygiene kit giveaway during the summer months and a hydration initiative.

Additionally McDonald -- who has 15 catches for 144 yards through FSU's first six games this season -- took a class to become a certified yoga instructor during the coronavirus pandemic and now teaches free yoga classes on FSU's campus as part of Rise and Progress.

""I feel like my purpose is what led me to this point honestly. My purpose on earth is to serve God by serving others so the best way for me to do that was to become organized in it and try to really be forward-thinking and progressive"" McDonald said.

""The best way for me to do that was to create Rise and Progress. I don't know how I got to this point so early. I feel like it's perfect timing and I'm just thankful that I'm in this position.""

McDonald is hopeful that his portion of this money from Allstate can go to his To Rise and Progress organization.

""I'm hoping that (my Good Teams Work donation) can be my cause but if it's not then I'm going to just go ahead and recommend some of the nonprofit organizations that I know that are very successful and have mission statements that are close to the mission statement that I have for my organization"" McDonald said.

""But I really hope that it can go to my organization because there are people who are part of Rise and Progress who deserve the recognition because I wouldn't have been able to do it without them. I'm definitely going to recommend my organization but if we can't for whatever reason I understand and I'm gonna be a blessing for somebody else.""

While the NIL era which began July 1 has brought about a new era in college sports it's been especially impactful for someone like McDonald. Due to NCAA rules he wasn't allowed to take a forward-facing role in To Rise and Progress before then or use his platform to help raise money for the organization.

This change has allowed him to take a much more prominent role within the organization since the start of July. He's done a few meet and greet events and has plans to do a few more in exchange for food to give away instead of money.

""From a personal perspective it changed the way that I was able to try to fundraise because before I couldn't put my name on anything that I was trying to fundraise with. Florida State fans or anybody who knew the Camren McDonald story they couldn't directly help us because it would be an NCAA violation"" McDonald said.

""But now that that gray area has been removed and there's no more blurred lines you know exactly what you can and cannot do. It's helped from a fundraising perspective. It's helped me become more financially stable within the organization...

""You don't really do it for financial compensation that's not the reason that you do it but financial compensation allows you to scale your efforts to where you're able to do more you're able to help more people. If that's the case then I'm going to keep doing as much as I was doing and ramp it up even more.""

Voting for the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team has gone live on ESPN's website. People are allowed to vote once each day and the team member who receives the most votes when the poll closes on Nov. 22 will be named the Good Works Team captain.

McDonald is honored to have been selected to the team but now he's setting his sights on earning that team captain honor.

""I'm going to do everything that I can in my power to get selected as a team captain. I'm just grateful to be in this position but I'm not going to settle at this point"" McDonald said.

""I'm going to keep driving keep going hard and keep approaching community service like it's football. Just bring a competitive aspect to it and try to do the most competing with myself. It's me versus me to try to do the most that I can to serve God by serving others.""

Seven years after the ill-fated Google Glass and five years after Snap rolled out Spectacles another tech giant is trying its hand at internet-connected smart glasses.

Facebook launched its first smart glasses on Thursday in a step toward its aim of offering true augmented-reality spectacles.

The glasses which were created in partnership with Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica allow wearers to listen to music take calls or capture photos and short videos and share them across Facebook's services using a companion app.

Facebook said the glasses line called ""Ray-Ban Stories"" would start at $299 (€253). They will be available in the US UK Canada Italy Ireland and Australia.

However concerns over privacy have been already been raised over the product which has built-in speakers and a microphone for making calls.

Amnesty International’s tech wing Amnesty Tech said on Twitter that ""Facebook is a surveillance advertising company whose business relies on exploiting our data and invading our privacy on a vast scale.

""Now it has teamed up with Ray-Ban to sell camera glasses. @ray_ban have you thought this through?""

There are also concerns over people taking unsolicited photos of others in public without their knowledge or consent.

Anticipating privacy concerns Facebook said that by default the glasses ""collect data that’s needed to make your glasses work and function like your battery status to alert you when your battery is low your email address and password for your Facebook login to verify it’s really you when you log into the Facebook View app.""

Facebook also said an LED light on the glasses would show when the camera is on to make other people aware when a wearer is taking a photo or video.

It published a guide outlining how to use the glasses responsibly for example turning them off in private spaces like public bathrooms and not using them for illegal actions like harassment or capturing sensitive information such as PIN codes.

Photos taken by users can't be posted directly to Facebook or any other social media platform. That's where the separate View app comes in.

Convincing social media users that they need to wear an ""all-day"" connected device on their face may prove an uphill battle even for Facebook.

Facebook's pivot to augmented reality

The social media giant which reported revenue of about $86 billion (€72.7 billion) in 2020 makes most of its money from advertising but has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on wristband technologies to support augmented reality glasses.

Facebook's chief scientist said last year the company was five to 10 years away from being able to bring to market ""true"" AR glasses which would superimpose virtual objects onto the wearer's view of the real world.

Major tech firms including Amazon.com Inc Alphabet Inc's Google Microsoft Corp Apple Inc and Snap Inc have raced to develop various smart glasses products but early offerings like Google Glass proved difficult to sell to consumers put off by high price points and design issues.

Snap which unveiled its smart Spectacles in 2016 this year launched AR glasses but they are not for sale and are offered only to AR creators. Snap's CEO Evan Spiegel said in 2019 that he expected it would be a decade before consumers widely adopted AR smart glasses.

Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the company was setting up a team to work on building the metaverse a shared virtual environment which it is betting will be the successor to the mobile internet.

""We’ve believed for a long time that glasses are going to be an important part of building the next computing platform"" said Zuckerberg in a video posted on his Facebook page on Thursday.

Facebook which has been criticized over its handling of user data said it would not access the media used by its smart-glasses customers without their consent.

Amazon's new warehouse in Tijuana Mexico borders homes made of wood tarps and cardboard.

Some residents of the homes have reportedly said they are fearful Amazon will kick them out.

Insider went to Tijuana where several residents said they were grateful for the new jobs.

Amazon's newest fulfillment center in Tijuana Mexico made headlines after it opened in September and put the neighboring community of Nueva Esperanza in the spotlight.

Photographer Omar Martinez captured photos of the Amazon facility the first of its kind in Tijuana that showed the brand-new facility standing feet away from a sprawling community of makeshift homes made of wood tarps and cardboard where stray dogs lie in unpaved streets.

The photos were widely shared on social media with users quick to condemn them as ""dystopian"" symbols of inequality as Insider's Katie Canales reported. Some residents have expressed fears that Amazon could evict them while the local government has praised Amazon's decision to move into the northwestern Mexican city.

Insider hired an interpreter and crossed the border to talk with residents living in the shadow of Amazon's new facility. Most of the eight people interviewed for this story said they felt hopeful about Amazon's arrival in Tijuana.

Locals praise Amazon's new jobs

""It's good for the community because it brings jobs"" said Rosano Ochoa Builon whose home neighbors the Amazon warehouse. ""The factory is welcome.""

She said she was surprised by the recent media attention on the facility saying she's never seen anything like it in 20 years of living there.

The blue and gray Amazon factory is instantly recognizable when approaching by air or on land. It sits in a newly-developed industrial zone on the Tijuana River just a few miles from the US-Mexico border.

Amazon opened the facility in September and says it's creating 250 new jobs.

Thomas Pallini/Insider



Lourdes Velazquez Toledo who runs the eatery Comedor/Antojitos Mexicanos just outside the main gate to the industrial park told Insider that she's seen an increase in customers since Amazon moved in.

""It's a better job than what they had before"" Velazquez Toledo said of Amazon's new hires speculating that local factories could lose workers to Amazon.

It's unclear what Amazon is paying workers at the Tijuana facility. Amazon declined Insider's request to confirm its wages saying only that it pays ""industry-competitive salaries.""

Amazon pays workers a $15 minimum hourly wage in the US and at a nearby facility just over the border in San Diego California. By comparison Tijuana's 2021 minimum wage is around 26 pesos ($1.29) an hour – which is slightly higher than the minimum wage elsewhere in Mexico given the city's status as a special economic zone near the US border.

Locals reported hearing Amazon offering wages at the Mexican peso equivalent of $15 per hour for some positions.

Thomas Pallini/Insider



Reuters reported in April that 15 contracted staffers at Amazon warehouses across Mexico earned roughly 25 pesos ($1.25) per hour – above the minimum wage in their area – plus bonuses. The report also included allegations of unfair mandatory overtime practices.







Without confirming any specifics Amazon has managed to make an impression – at least among the locals interviewed by Insider – that its wages are competitive. Two employees of a nearby factory told Insider that they've heard that Amazon's jobs are ""good work in a good company"" and that they pay well without knowing specifics on wages.

One resident of Nueva Esperanza who asked not to be identified said some of her coworkers quit their jobs to work at Amazon. She said they may have left because of the perception that Amazon is a ""better company than ours"" and had a nicer facility.

She also said she had seen social media posts that expressed concern over whether Amazon could destroy nearby homes because they were giving the e-commerce giant a ""bad image.""

Amazon's facility was built from the ground up in Tijuana.

Thomas Pallini/Insider



Amazon declined to comment directly on the Nueva Esperanza settlement but told Insider: ""We are in constant communication with the local government to find a way to generate a positive impact in the community.""

""At Amazon we are committed to the development of Mexico and the communities in which we operate benefiting thousands of Mexican families through the generation of direct and indirect jobs"" Amazon said.

The Amazon fulfillment center will allow for same-day deliveries in Tijuana and next-day deliveries to nearby cities a government press release said. Amazon is investing around $21 million into the ground-up construction of the 344000-square-foot facility.

""Since our arrival in Mexico Amazon has created more than 15000 jobs throughout the country and now we are adding 250 in Tijuana creating employment opportunities with industry-competitive compensation packages for all our employees who enjoy benefits superior to the law such as health insurance life insurance savings fund and food vouchers"" an Amazon spokesperson told Insider in a statement.

The community of Nueva Esperanza is a collection of makeshift homes and unpaved streets.

Thomas Pallini/Insider



""Our wages and benefits strengthen local communities and our investments help these areas to grow and to build better futures"" Amazon said citing 6.5 billion pesos of donations in Mexico that it says helped 30000 families.

A woman who lives near the new warehouse told the Voice of San Diego that she's worried about being kicked out of her home.

""They have not threatened us directly with eviction but we have seen how other houses in the neighborhood have been sidelined to move or worse have destroyed their homes because they want to develop the land. I just don't want that to happen to us "" she said.

While none of the locals interviewed by Insider said they were fearful of being evicted by Amazon they agreed Amazon has deep enough pockets to be able to resettle them.

""If Amazon wants to get rid of these houses Amazon has the money to relocate these people"" Trinidad Adel Calles Zazueta a passerby near the warehouse told Insider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3VyLm9yZy9hcnRzLWxpZmUvMjAyMS0xMC0wOS9hLWxhd3JlbmNlLWJvb2tzdG9yZS10cmllZC10by1iZWF0LWFtYXpvbi1hdC1pdHMtb3duLWdhbWUtYW5kLXN1cnZpdmVkLW5vdy1pdHMtZXhwYW5kaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Lawrence bookstore tried to beat Amazon at its own game and survived. Now it's expanding,"Danny Caine never expected to turn his bookstore into a partial shipping warehouse. He was just trying to keep his small business afloat. It wasn’t even the first pandemic pivot he tried.

“The hardest thing about March 2020 other than society falling apart was we went through four or five different ideas of how to do this. It felt like every Sunday I was meeting with the managers and being like ‘Okay what are we going to do this week?’” says Caine the owner of the Raven Book Store in Lawrence Kansas.

When the store closed to in-person browsing last year it was the nationwide shipping that really stuck.

Before the pandemic only 1% of the Raven’s sales took place online. Now it’s closer to 30%. They also offer local delivery and curbside pickup in addition to in-store browsing.

""A lot of places are struggling. We feel really lucky and thankful that that's not us at the moment"" Caine says. ""It's certainly a testament to the Lawrence community.""

Mackenzie Martin / KCUR 89.3 Raven Book Store owner Danny Caine says in Amazon's perfect world indie bookstores don't exist.

While book sales have been consistently strong during the pandemic big companies like Amazon have mostly been the beneficiaries. More than 70 bookstores closed in 2020 and bookstore sales fell nearly 30%.

“That shipping is why we're still here"" he says. ""It saved us.""

It’s also one of the factors that caused them to move into a bigger location on Massachusetts Street in late August. Online orders used to be processed in the middle of the fiction section but the new store has a backroom where two employees manage orders full-time. That in addition to increased street traffic has made for a successful few weeks.

“It’s going better than we could have possibly dreamed” he says. “We've added three booksellers.”

Carlos Moreno / KCUR 89.3 / KCUR 89.3 Caine has written a book ""How To Resist Amazon and Why."" It sits on display near the front of the store.

Caine of all people knows how rare it is to be a successful small business owner in 2021. His book “How to Resist Amazon and Why” was published in March.

He frames his political arguments more as ""pro-bookstore"" than ""anti-Amazon.""

“You can't compete with Amazon in terms of selection or speed but one thing you can have that they don't is a point of view that people really celebrate. And you have your curation.""

A big part of the Raven's voice is the way it champions books by Kansas authors like Meg Heriford's ""Ladybird Collected"" or Sarah Smarsh's ""She Come By It Natural."" It's more expansive than even that though. These days the Raven and some other indie bookstores are reinventing the definition of a bookstore beyond four physical walls.

It raises the question: how important are brick-and-mortar locations to customers? With e-commerce websites like bookshop.org it’s never been easier to digitally support indie booksellers who are a part of the local community or who curate collections tailored to the customer.

It's not quite as romantic as browsing in-person but it's certainly gaining traction among customers who value convenience more than anything right now — and pop-ups and online bookstores are a significantly easier way for newer booksellers to get involved.

“It’s not a very traditional model of bookstores at all. But I would argue you need to think that way to be ready for the future"" Caine says.

Bliss Books & Wine Sisters La’Nesha Frazier and La’Nae Robinson opened Bliss Books & Wine in 2019 as an oasis for avid Kansas City readers and wine lovers but found a national audience online during the pandemic.

In Kansas City sisters La’Nesha Frazier and La’Nae Robinson own Bliss Books & Wine a bookstore that pairs literature with complimentary wines. The pandemic stalled their search for a physical location but in lieu of one business has still been pretty good.

“Like every state. I’m shipping books everywhere” says Robinson. “And they're like ‘We know you're not Amazon. We don't want Amazon. We want the owners that know who we are. That know what we like.’”

They're currently hosting rotating pop-up events and storing their inventory at Frazier's house — but they plan to open a storefront in late 2021 or early 2022 to serve as a gathering place for other avid readers.

""Once we do open up the brick-and-mortar we will be able to then have our wine lounge on top of our bookstore"" Frazier says. ""Once that is up and running then we'll be whole again.""

Their virtual bookstore isn't going anywhere though.

“There's no way that we could just be the brick-and-mortar and cut out our extended community that we built virtually. Like that is the Bliss family. It's everyone. It's all inclusive” Robinson says.

Carlos Moreno / KCUR 89.3 / KCUR 89.3 Ngaio one of the resident cats at the Raven Book Store watches traffic from a nook at the front of the store. Owner Danny Caine says she's settling into her new surroundings well but her wanderlust leads her to take unaccompanied walks around the neighborhood.

Likewise Danny Caine is grateful to the Lawrence community for its support. But he doesn’t want people to assume bookstores are suddenly going to be okay based on the success the Raven has seen recently.

“We've had to work really hard to get here and you know it could go wrong any second” Caine says.

That’s especially true now when the holidays are approaching and the U.S. Postal Service is struggling and there is a myriad of supply chain issues due to the pandemic. It’s all the more reason Caine says to shop early for the holidays.

In the end indie bookstores won’t ever be able to compete with Amazon’s speed but what they do offer may matter more in the long run.

“From a purely economic standpoint this isn't the most efficient or cheapest way to buy books” Caine says. “But is it more ethical than buying books on Amazon? I would certainly argue that. And I think a lot of our customers would too.”

Hudson Hamrick 31 faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a $250000 fine. A sentencing date has not been set.

Prosecutors said Hamrick made more than 300 fraudulent transactions between October 2016 and some time last year. According to charging documents Hamrick ordered expensive products — such as electronics guitars tools computers and other high-end consumer products — from Amazon filed a return and received a full refund.

Hamrick received bogus refunds on the return of more than 270 products about 250 of which were worth significantly less than what he initially ordered court documents state.

If he didn’t initiate a return Hamrick would seek a concession by claiming to have never received the product or that it arrived broken necessitating a replacement prosecutors said.

In making the announcement Acting U.S. Attorney Stetzer commended the FBI for their investigation of the case and thanked Amazon for their cooperation in the investigation.

But take two seconds to figure it out and it’s plenty clear: Ethernet is not always the best choice for an internet connection these days.

Here’s the scenario: It was time to get started on our Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max review. My entertainment center is a bit of a rat’s nest of wires and dongles and sticks and boxes. There’s a lot going on in there because I’ve had to use every streaming option there is over the years. So the simplest thing to do was unplug the 2018 Fire TV Stick 4K and plug in the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. No muss no fuss and no mucking about with Wi-Fi at first because I still had it plugged in to a powered Ethernet adapter. “Ethernet is always better” said the voice in my head. One of the voices anyway.

But not all Ethernet is created equal. Sure I’ve got a gigabit fiber connection running into an Eero Pro 6 with a gigabit switch in between. It’s fast. But the Amazon Ethernet adapter? It’s what’s known as a 10/100 adapter. It either works at 10 Megabits per second or 100 Mbps. Same goes for Google’s own adapters for Chromecast.

And so the look on my face must have been a little funny when I saw this new Fire TV Stick 4K Max only pulling about 90 Mbps in a speed test. That’s slower than pretty much every other device in the house. It’s unworthy of being connected to my network. It offended my family and it offended the Shaolin Temple.

It also makes perfect sense why (in addition to pure cost) Amazon hasn’t included its Ethernet adapter with any of its Fire TV devices. The simple fact is that it’s slower. Once we got to Wi-Fi 4 (formerly known as 802.11n) the theoretical speed of the adapter was less than that of the wireless network. Something like 6 times less actually.

That’s not to say the 90 Mbps I was getting is slow. It’s plenty fast enough to stream 4K video. It’s plenty fast for the Amazon Luna cloud gaming service on the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. But it’s also slower than the average U.S. broadband speed of 199 Mbps as reported by Ookla for August 2021.

The point is this: Unless you’re in some weird networking situation in which you just have to be plugged in — and especially if you have some fairly recent networking gear and a good connection — it’s best to not bother with an Amazon Ethernet Adapter anymore. Don’t bother or at least make sure you’re not getting really slow speeds.

Unless you just like making yourself feel a little foolish and then writing about it on the internet.

(Published 2021),"Spirit Airlines and American Airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Tuesday after several days of disruptions frustrating passengers across the country.

By midafternoon Spirit had scrapped more than half its scheduled flights for the day according to FlightAware an aviation data firm. The airline canceled more than 40 percent of its flights on Monday and 19 percent on Sunday. Spirit attributed those disruptions to “a series of weather and operational challenges.”

American had canceled about 300 flights by the middle of the afternoon on Tuesday about a tenth of Tuesday’s scheduled trips. The airline canceled about 18 percent of its flights on Monday and 9 percent the day before. American pinned the blame on a weekend storm that hit Dallas Fort Worth International Airport its large hub airport.

“A prolonged severe weather event in Dallas Fort Worth on Sunday night into Monday morning brought sustained heavy rain strong winds lightning microbursts and hail to our largest hub” Curtis Blessing a spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday. “The nine-hour weather event resulted in flight delays cancellations and nearly 100 diversions. Our team members are working around the clock to care for our customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdXN0aW4tY2FubmliYWxpemVkLWRhbGxhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin Cannibalized Dallas – Here's Why American Airlines Was Glad,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdXN0aW4tY2FubmliYWxpemVkLWRhbGxhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9vY3QvMTAvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbHMtbW9yZS10aGFuLTEwMDAtc3VuZGF5LWYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines cancels more than 1000 Sunday flights,"Southwest Airlines cancels more than 1000 Sunday flights

Southwest Airlines canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend blaming the woes on air traffic control issues and weather.

The airline canceled more than 1000 flights in total or 29% of its schedule as of 7 p.m. ET Sunday according to flight tracker FlightAware. That was the highest rate by far of the major U.S. airlines. Next in line was Allegiant which canceled 6% of its flights. American Airlines canceled 5% of its flights while Spirit canceled 4% on Sunday according to the flight tracker. On Saturday Southwest Airlines canceled more than 800 flights.

In a Twitter post Las Vegas airport officials urged passengers traveling on Southwest to check their flight status before heading to the airport. They suggested exploring “self-service rebooking options” and warned that there will be “long lines and wait times at the airport as airline team members work to accommodate customers.”

Southwest Airlines said in an emailed statement that it had experienced weather challenges in its Florida airports at the beginning of the weekend which were compounded by unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region. Those issues triggered delays and prompted significant cancellations for the airlines beginning Friday evening.

“We’ve continued diligent work throughout the weekend to reset our operation with a focus on getting aircraft and crews repositioned to take care of our customers"" said Southwest Airlines. “With fewer frequencies between cities in our current schedule recovering during operational challenges is more difficult and prolonged.""

The company said that it's allowing customers to explore self-service rebooking options on Southwest.com where they can get updates on the status of their travel.

However Henry H. Harteveldt president and travel industry analyst at The Atmosphere Research Group based in San Francisco points to other causes for the cancellations.

First he says Southwest has scheduled more flights than it can handle a problem that started in June. He also noted that Southwest operates what’s known as a point-to-point route network and when a delay occurs it “cascades” along the remaining flight segments. That's because for example a Southwest flight departing Fort Lauderdale Florida for the airline's home base of Dallas may make multiple stops along the way.

But Harteveldt says the most troubling reason is the likelihood that some pilots who oppose Southwest's decision to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations are participating in an illegal job action where they call in sick or are engaging in a “work slowdown.”

In a statement Saturday the airline’s pilot union Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said that's not the case.

“SWAPA is aware of operational difficulties affecting Southwest Airlines today due to a number of issues but we can say with confidence that our pilots are not participating in any official or unofficial job actions"" it said.

Harteveldt noted Southwest's woes could linger and affect its fourth quarter financial performance.

“All of this is happening as people are in the midst of booking their Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year holiday travel” he said. “It’s very possible that some people who might normally book on Southwest may see this news and choose to fly other airlines.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZ2VuLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjEvMDkvMjAteWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItYW5kLXRoZS1wYWluLW9mLTktMTEtc3RpbGwtZmVlbHMtcmF30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 Years Later and the Pain of 9/11 Still Feels Raw,"John Menchaca was 30 when he got sick from a liver infection and remembered how his older sister Dora Menchaca took it upon herself to contact the public health department in Los Angeles County to begin tracing the source of his illness.

It was Hepatitis-A. He had gotten it from a place he had eaten in Mexico. He remembered more about how determined she was to track the source of the infection than he did about how sick he was then.

“Science and research wasn’t just a profession or a job to her” he said. “She was all in from the beginning.”

With the Covid-19 pandemic having its grip on the world for more than a year-and-a-half now Menchaca thinks about what his sister might be doing about that today. He said he imagines she’d be on the front lines of trying to understand and explain the science behind the virus. He can almost hear her talking about how exciting the vaccines were and how she’d be urging the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing.

And then he starts to get choked up because even 20 years later the death of his sister remains raw.

Dora Menchaca was 45 when she boarded American Airlines Flight 77 headed from Washington D.C. to Los Angeles the morning of Sept. 11 2001. He said she was supposed to land that day and see her husband Earl Dorsey and their two children Imani and Jaryd.

But like nearly 3000 others on that day she never made it home.

Instead John said all he has now are photos and a tribute binder he can’t quite bring himself to put together. He relies mostly on his memories of her now. But while the nation remembers collectively the tragedy of 9/11 John said he remembers Dora every day.

“She still comes up in conversations all the time with my family” he said. “Something always seems to bring her to mind.”

And he is reminded again how much he misses her.

Growing Up

John Menchaca was four years younger than Dora but he remembered growing up in San Antonio with her and how she was always there to help him with his studies. Education was a premium ideal growing up in the Menchaca family.

“She was a voracious reader. Constantly reading” he said. “Not just textbooks either. Every Sunday her and my dad would sit and go through the entire newspaper in San Antonio – front to back – and discuss what was going on for two or three hours. She had this inquisitive mind and was incredibly curious.”

He said he remembered her being patient with him while helping with his math homework. He said it was no surprise to anyone that as she went through high school she was going to college. Menchaca said she was always a high achiever and when she was accepted to the University of Notre Dame the whole family drove up with her in an old Volkswagen bus to see her off.

Menchaca said it was the first time they’d ever been outside the state of Texas.

“I remember when we crossed the Mississippi and it took us by surprise at how big it was” he said. “We thought the bridge would never end.”

The drive back after dropping her off felt longer. He missed her. But he said they drove up again for her graduation from the University of Notre Dame in 1977 and their parents were proud. So was her younger brother who could see she was on her way to bigger things.

Staying Close

Even as their careers diverged – she went on to the University of North Carolina for her master’s in public health and then UCLA for a doctorate in epidemiology and he was studying to become an accountant – they stayed close.

In the early 1980s the two shared an apartment together in West Los Angeles while she was still at UCLA and when she gave birth to Imani he said he got to spend time with his niece while in that apartment. She completed her doctorate in 1986 according to the UCLA Daily Bruin.

The time in the apartment he said was filled with great memories. She had plants in the apartment – a foreshadowing of a gardening hobby she would continue at her home in Santa Monica. John mostly recalled how she seemed to balance so much with patience and grace.

He didn’t know it at the time but he said at a memorial for Dora after the 9/11 tragedy a woman approached him. She told him about how Dora had played soccer with a bunch of guys and that when one of the player’s wives had gotten ill Dora wrote the husband a letter in Spanish and sent coupons to restaurants and supermarkets.

“The woman told me Dora gave the gift of time” he said. “Instead of wasting time running around to stores and restaurants that time could be spent with his sick wife.”

When John Menchaca got married in 1987 he said Dora's daughter was the flower girl at the wedding. After Dora married he would visit his sister in Santa Monica. He said his two older daughters would visit “Aunt Dora” and always had a good time with her.

He said she was always great with his children – and especially with hers.

“She would be proud of them” he said. “They’re both good quality people. Very caring and very responsible and very in touch with life. They took up professions that are meaningful and are going to help humanity.”

Dora Menchaca worked hard at Amgen as a director of clinical research and had this inner drive to research a cure for cancer. Her father had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and she was relentless in her pursuit of finding a cure to help those with similar illnesses.

Dora Menchaca was in Washington D.C. briefing U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials on some cancer research the day before on Sept. 10. But John Menchaca said she had been talking about wanting to spend more time with her family and so she caught an earlier flight home on the morning of Sept. 11 2001.

It was American Airlines Flight 77.

John Menchaca said he can still remember everything about that morning. He woke up and both he and his wife watched in disbelief as the smoke poured from the World Trade Center. He said he remembered talk of Los Angeles being a possible target and how he was going to get to the office to make sure everyone there was OK.

“I hadn’t sat down two minutes and my phone rang” he said. “It was my dad and he says right away he’s got some bad news; Dora was on one of the planes. He started crying.”

The world shifted at that point for John Menchaca. His sister was dead at 45. The pain that began that day would never really leave.

A year after the attacks he went to a memorial at Amgen and saw the marker that honors her. Five years after the attacks he turned 46 – one year past his older sister’s final age. Ten years after he was going to several memorials for 9/11 victims. Last year because of COVID-19 he stayed at home with his family – something for which he believes she would have advocated.

But 20 years seems like a long time ago and alternately not long ago at all. And for John Menchaca it’s a moment frozen in time thawed by grief and scarred forever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dyYWlzb25kYW5nb3IvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9zb3V0aHdlc3QtY2FuY2Vscy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMTAwMC1mbGlnaHRzLXBpbG90cy1zYXktaXRzLW5vdC1hLXByb3Rlc3Qtb3Zlci1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLW1hbmRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Cancels More Than 1000 Flights—Pilots Say It's Not A Protest Over Covid Vaccine Mandate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2021/10/10/southwest-cancels-more-than-1000-flights-pilots-say-its-not-a-protest-over-covid-vaccine-mandate/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dyYWlzb25kYW5nb3IvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9zb3V0aHdlc3QtY2FuY2Vscy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMTAwMC1mbGlnaHRzLXBpbG90cy1zYXktaXRzLW5vdC1hLXByb3Rlc3Qtb3Zlci1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLW1hbmRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

That news was delivered by Guernsey County Community Improvement Corporation Executive Director Norm Blanchard during a CIC meeting Friday.

""No contracts have been signed at this time for the actual work but they have applied for the building permits and I have been given permission to release that information"" Blanchard said.

The cost to build the AEP Cambridge Service Center is estimated to be nearly $20 million according to Blanchard.

An employee at the Southeast Ohio Building Department in Marietta confirmed the company obtained three permits for the construction of the service center and two sheds described as open storage facilities.

The property is owned by Ohio Power Co.

The proposed facility has been compared to an AEP center adjacent to I-70 in Belmont County.

The architect for the project is listed as MS Consultants Inc. of Columbus.

Blanchard also discussed expansion plans at Ridge Tool and Colgate-Palmolive.

""Ridge Tool has extended their lease with the landlord through 2029 and full expansion plans are due by 2025"" he said. ""That's good news. We were concerned if their lease ran out they might not expand here.""

The company is working with Guernsey County officials to lease an additional 10 acres adjacent to its current location for expansion.

Blanchard said Phase III of a three-part expansion plan at Colgate-Palmolive is still in discussion among company officials.

The company has purchased an additional 14 acres next to the 72 acres at its current location to make expansion possible.

""They have purchased all the land around the building"" Blanchard said. ""They have what they need to complete an expansion project.""

Colgate-Palmolive previously invested $1.2 million in machinery and equipment during Phase I for the production of liquid hand soap at the Cambridge facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion created 24 new jobs.

Phase II reportedly will create eight jobs and $667000 in payroll with a $20 million capital investment.

Initiatives to fill the former Fabri Form and Pomegranate properties in or near Byesville are underway according to Blanchard.

The Fabri Form property has 60000-square feet available and the purchase price for the Pomegranate building on Southgate Road has been lowered to $250000.

""The problem with the Pomegranate site is the soil surface is extremely unstable due to previous use as a coal processing facility"" Blanchard said. ""It would require a lot of site preparation work.""

A $530428 renovation project at Seneca Lake Marina was discussed.

The plan calls for the existing wood deck and deck structure to be replaced with a pre-engineers structure and sidewalk ramps for Americans With Disabilities access.

Blanchard also provided updates regarding plans for expansion at Ohio Bridge in Cambridge the county's strategic plan work at the Otto Luburgh site on Wintergreen Road and the Guernsey County Power Plant.

The power plant remains on target for a cold opening in the spring with operations starting in the fall of 2022.

A $2.1 million funding request through Congressman Bill Johnson's office is still awaiting U.S. Senate approval. The funds are for a $3376269 projects at the D.O. Hall Business Park that includes $2615949 for site preparation and $760300 for wetland mitigation.

A parking lot constructed near the FedEx facility south of Cambridge enabled the company to hire 140 new drivers and package handlers according to Blanchard.

Mike Jacoby president of Ohio SE Economic Development gave a brief presentation regarding development efforts within the 25-county region served by the not-for-profit agency.

One of the topics he discussed was inclusion grants that help small companies with small projects.

Blanchard pointed out D&J Precision Machine in Cambridge is a success story for the inclusion grants after the company received a $25000 grant to improve its computer system.

Jacoby also praised Guernsey County officials for their willingness to work together.

""We have a great partnership with Guernsey County and the officials here work really well together"" he said. ""You have a great track record for success.""

He also alerted officials that JobsOhio has new programs to help communities.

It is a jump from doing office paperwork to building solar power systems but that is the leap Lorraine Nez is taking to bring renewable energy to her Native American reservation.

""It's there why are we not using it?"" she said of solar power.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1YW5jb2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwL3NlZWtpbmctZ2lnYXdhdHRzLWludmFkZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iraq is seeking 10 Gigawatts of Solar Power; if World had gone Green in '80s Would the US have ever invaded Iraq?,"Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – In a historic irony Iraq is turning to solar energy according to Dania Saadi at SPGlobal.

Ali Jawad at the Anadolu Agency reports that the Baghdad government is seeking to generate 10 gigawatts of solar power for electricity by 2030 though it already has several projects in train that will come online much sooner.

I am struck by the irony that if only the US had invested massively in renewable energy and electric vehicles right from the 1970s when the climate crisis had become clear to scientists Washington may not have felt the need to invade Iraq to unleash its hydrocarbon resources. When Ronald Reagan took back down Jimmy Carter’s solar panels off the White House he was symbolically committing this country to generations of energy wars.

Iraq has signed an agreement with Masdar the green energy company based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates for a total of 2 gigawatts of solar power. The French energy giant Total will build another 1 gigawatt in solar capacity for Iraq (though most of its investments will be in the hydrocarbon sector) and PowerChina is committed to putting in 2 gigawatts of solar in Iraq.

Most recently Iraq just inked a deal with a consortium spearheaded by Norwegian firm Scatec Solar to construct two solar power farms with a total capacity of about half a gigawatt.

Petroleum Minister Ihsan Abdul-Jabbar announced the Scatec deal on Friday tweeting “We are proud of accomplishing this achievement given the short tenure of the government of signing the third solar power deal with Scatec after Total and Masdar.”

Iraq has a power generation capacity of 19 gigawatts but has an estimated need for 30 gigawatts. The shortfall has produced electricity blackouts and brownouts especially in the summer when it can be 122 degrees F. (50C). Iraqis left without electricity to run air conditioning in that kind of weather have been very unhappy and the electricity shortages have been among the government failings that have provoked large youth demonstrations in the past couple of years leading to the resignation of one prime minister and to a call by the present PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi for early elections on Sunday October 10.

Although Iraq is an oil giant exporting about 3 million barrels a day it does not have much natural gas. Petroleum is not typically used to power electricity plants but is rather mostly used for transportation though it has other uses such petrochemicals including fertilizer and plastics. Iraq is only 33rd in the world for natural gas production and imports 4 billion cubic meters of gas from Iran every year.

The United States has exerted enormous pressure on Iraq to cease buying Iranian natural gas. Iraq’s Sunnis and the nativist Sadrist movement of cleric Muqtada al-Sadr are unhappy about this dependence on Iran as well as are relatively secular-minded Iraqi nationalists like the current prime minister.

Saudi Arabia recently brought a 300 megawatt solar plant online in that country in just two years and if Iraq wants to throw money at this problem it can certainly build a lot of solar farms quickly. In recent years Iraq’s oil revenues have been on the order of $60 billion a year so the government has the money. The country is relatively thinly populated with a lot of desert and marginal land where the solar farms could be sited. Only about 32 acres are required for a 1 gigawatt solar farm.

Iraq could become a solar energy giant and could finally solve its electricity crisis which originated when the Saddam Hussein Baathist government diverted money to the ruinous Iran-Iraq War and then the invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War after which Iraq was under severe UN and US sanctions. During the American military occupation of Iraq 2003-2011 US engineers and officials attempted to expand Iraq’s electricity production but often used American methods to repair electricity plants with which Iraqi technicians were unfamiliar. Iraqi guerrillas opposed to the US occupation also engaged in sabotage of public infrastructure.

Iraq still faces terrorist actions by ISIL but solar farms are less vulnerable to sabotage than gas pipelines.

Then Vice President Dick Cheney spent the build-up to the Iraq War meeting with the CEOs of Big Oil and BP was lobbying British PM Tony Blair not to allow it to get left out of the bonanza when the US opened Iraq’s oil fields (which had been under sanctions in the 1990s).

If even Iraq is turning to solar power we can perhaps glimpse a future in which hydrocarbons will no longer be something the world goes to war over.

Though limited power was restored Sunday after about 24 hours of outages the collapse of the state-run electrical grid on Saturday is just the most extreme manifestation of a chronic fuel shortage that has plagued Lebanon for the last year and a half.

Lebanese citizens have struggled with the state’s electric company Electricité du Liban for years and its shortcomings mean that private generators are common at least for those who can afford them. Even in an ordinary week it’s common for people to have as little as one or two hours of daily electricity from the state grid.

Lebanon's electricity grid shut down entirely after the country's two main power stations ran out of fuel.



The city is pitch black except for the lights of a handful of buildings and car headlights.

But the crisis came to a head Saturday when the nation’s two largest power stations ran out of enough diesel fuel to provide even a few hours of electricity in a country already confronted with multiple crises.

The Deir Ammar and Zahrani power stations shut down in quick succession over the weekend after fuel ran out leaving Lebanon’s population of more than 6.8 million people without public power. The blackout comes just over a week after the government allowed a contract with a Turkish company supplying power via two barges off the coast of Beirut to lapse cutting off that energy supply.

Though common private generators proved insufficient during the outage — as Beirut-based journalist Bel Trew pointed out on Twitter Saturday not only are such generators incredibly expensive to run and equally subject to Lebanon’s fuel shortages but they do little to keep essential services like hospitals running.

Lebanon now has zero state power meaning the entire country is running on private generators. They are prohibitively expensive: my last month’s bill was 3.75 million lira which is $2500 on official rate& about $250 on black market. How is the airport running?What about hospitals? https://t.co/eFzcVhxH1I — Bel Trew (@Beltrew) October 9 2021

According to Washington Post reporters Nader Durgham and Liz Sly even before the weekend’s outage chronic fuel shortages meant that hospitals have been “forced to suspend operations or halt vital procedures” among a slew of other issues.

“It is drastic and it has been drastic for a while” Lebanese Energy Minister Walid Fayyad told the Post. “With a few hours a day people can go about their basic needs for a couple of hours and of course it is better than nothing but the situation is dire and we need more than a few hours a day.”

But Lebanese citizens put the situation in starker terms.

“We have forgotten what electricity means” Abdul-Hadi al-Sibai a Beirut taxi driver told the New York Times.

A 6 million-liter fuel donation from the Lebanese armed forces brought power back on Sunday ahead of the schedule originally predicted by Lebanon’s central government. However it’s not a permanent solution — according to Reuters the new supply of fuel will only be enough to keep the lights on for three days. A shipment from Iraq is set to boost the fuel supply later this month according to Al Jazeera and the energy ministry announced Sunday that it had received a $100 million fuel credit from the central bank of Lebanon so that the country can again pay to import fuel.

Lebanon has dealt with energy problems for decades; hours-long outages have long been a part of everyday life. But the country’s current economic crisis combined with political corruption has turned what was once a serious but for many manageable inconvenience into a far more acute crisis.

“There is no fuel and limited generation so the variation in frequency is ruining the grid” Marc Ayoub an energy researcher at the American University of Beirut explained to Al Jazeera.

Lebanon’s power outage is just one of multiple crises

The shutdown comes as Lebanon is experiencing shocking hyperinflation; the Lebanese lira which is pegged to the dollar has dropped 90 percent in value since fall 2019 and is currently trading about 18900 lira per dollar on the black market. Prior to Lebanon’s 2019 economic implosion the exchange rate was 1500 lira per dollar.

That astronomical inflation makes ordinary goods like medicine hard to come by much less enough fuel to power an entire country.

Critically the compounding crises have serious political implications both internally and outside of Lebanon. Hezbollah the Iran-backed Shia militant group — which is part of Lebanon’s government although the US has designated it a terror group — brought in gasoline fuel by the truckload from Iran via Syria according to a New York Times report last month apparently flouting US sanctions.

Currently according to the Washington Post those US sanctions are also a major obstacle to a plan for Lebanon to import gas from Egypt via Syria which could improve the long-term outlook for Lebanon’s power grid. That could soon change as US ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea confirmed in August that the Biden administration is seeking “real sustainable solutions for Lebanon’s fuel and energy needs.”

For the time being however the Lebanese government has been conspicuously absent in responding to the interconnected crises facing the country despite the fact that Lebanon formed a new government last month. That absence has only served to highlight Hezbollah’s ability to deliver basic goods where the central government fails potentially giving the group a larger foothold in the country.

Lebanon’s new government is also its first functional administration since a major explosion rocked its capital Beirut last year according to the BBC. In the aftermath of that crisis the existing government resigned creating a stalemate that took 13 months to resolve.

Lebanon’s political system has enabled chaos for years

In June the World Bank identified the collapse of Lebanon’s financial system as “in the top 10 possibly top three most severe crises episodes globally since the mid-nineteenth century” adding that there’s no sense of how the nation will recover from such a catastrophe.

Despite that severe diagnosis global actors like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have thus far largely declined to step in due to a lack of faith in Lebanon’s government and its disinclination to deal with any of the several interconnected and deeply rooted crises facing the country.

Specifically Lebanon’s 2019 financial collapse sprang from decades of bad economic policy: Ultra-wealthy deeply entrenched public servants have long benefited from a peculiar political system and enriched themselves further by helping themselves to public funds. From 2018 to 2020 the country’s GDP fell from $55 billion to $33 billion — a precipitous drop typically associated with the outbreak of conflict according to a recent World Bank report.

Calls for the resignation of the whole government with the rallying cry “All of them means all of them” erupted in October 2019 after attempts to raise money by taxing the use of WhatsApp the messaging service widely used both within Lebanon and to communicate with the rest of the world including a large Lebanese diaspora.

That resignation did eventually occur — but not until August 2020 after a massive explosion in Beirut caused by more than 2700 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate killed hundreds injured thousands and left hundreds of thousands homeless. The explosion also destroyed Lebanon’s major grain silo leaving the country with less than a month of reserves at the time. It also destroyed Beirut’s port area which handled about 70 percent of the food imports in a country that imports about 85 percent of its food.

Despite the popular outrage that drove Lebanon’s previous government to resign there are signs that the new administration led by Najib Mikati a billionaire and Lebanon’s wealthiest man will be more of the same. Mikati who is now prime minister has held the position twice before — meaning he comes from the exact system that plunged the country into its current upheaval.

That government as Faysal Itani adjunct professor of Middle East politics and security at Georgetown University wrote for Vox last year is deeply entrenched making it difficult to change despite its many and obvious problems. As Itani explains:

Lebanon’s political system is the product of a decades-old power-sharing arrangement among leaders of Lebanon’s 18 religious sects the most important being the Sunni and Shia Muslims and Maronite Christians. This system known as confessionalism parceled out political power according to sectarian quotas with each sect usually led by one or several members of prominent political families.

Despite the lack of public services and the blatant corruption of those in power Lebanese politicians have generally proved adept at playing up sectarian disputes and doing just enough to keep their constituents satisfied.

However the depth of Lebanon’s current crises exemplified by the outright collapse of the state power grid Saturday means that the status quo of previous Lebanese governments might not be good enough going forward. Already Mikati the new prime minister has pledged to end the fuel crisis and restart talks with the IMF to shore up the economy a potential lifeline for Lebanon — if he keeps his promise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vdWsvYWR2aXNvci9lbmVyZ3kvaG93LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWNhbi1jdXQteW91ci1iaWxscy1hbmQteW91ci1jYXJib24tZm9vdHByaW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Solar Power Can Cut Your Bills And Your Carbon Footprint,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/energy/how-solar-power-can-cut-your-bills-and-your-carbon-footprint/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vdWsvYWR2aXNvci9lbmVyZ3kvaG93LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWNhbi1jdXQteW91ci1iaWxscy1hbmQteW91ci1jYXJib24tZm9vdHByaW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Here's what you need to know,"Below Select looks at the consumer protections offered by credit cards  debit cards and some major BNPL providers to help you decide which is better for you.

In fact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently warned consumers about the tendency to overspend when using BNPL services the negative impact they could have on credit scores  their late fees and the lack of consumer protections.

""BNPL loans are still new and government regulations haven't fully caught up. That means that the short-term financing options generally offer consumers fewer protections"" says Leslie Tayne founder and managing director at Tayne Law Group.

Yet as consumers flock towards this new financing method they should be cautious about them.

BNPL also known as point-of-sale loans  are installment loans that allow consumers to split up the cost of their purchase over time. BNPL options are available nearly everywhere that you shop with a number of big-name retailers like Walmart Amazon Target and Sephora using them. A recent Credit Karma study found that 44% of respondents had used a BNPL product at least once.

Will you have to keep making installment payments on the item even after you return it? What company do you contact in order to resolve the issue: the BNPL provider the merchant or the credit or debit card issuer that you used to finance the BNPL loan?

But what happens when you purchase the sweater using a ' buy now pay later' loan (BNPL)?

Have you ever purchased a winter coat online only to discover that it looks nothing like the images you saw on the website when it arrives? While you'll have to file a complaint with the merchant and possibly the credit card company before being refunded returning an item and being refunded is usually straightforward when you buy it on a credit card.

Consumers are offered a number of credit card protections through the Fair Credit Billing Act. There are two types of complaints consumers can file with their credit card issuer: A billing error or an issue with the quality of a good or a service. A billing error may be an authorized charge an incorrect charge or a math error. If you have a 'billing error' the FCBA requires that credit card issuers conduct an investigation if a consumer files a complaint within 60 days of receiving their account statement.

While the FCBA does not apply to issues with the quality of a good consumers can still file a complaint with their issuer. Since this type of complaint falls under state laws consumers are more likely to resolve their issue or be refunded if they meet certain requirements such as having purchased the item in their home state.

The FCBA only applies to 'open end' credit accounts such as credit cards or retail cards with revolving accounts so these rules do not apply to debit cards or installment loans like BNPL loans.

It's also worth noting that certain cards like The Platinum Card® from American Express have benefits that include return and *purchase protection which can help you get reimbursed after a retailer's return policy has expired or if your purchase has been lost stolen or damaged. Terms apply.

However people who use debit cards also have protections when it comes to fraud charges through the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Much like credit cards these protections do not apply to issues with the quality of the product. If consumers do have problems with the quality of a good or service they bought with a debit card they'll have to resolve the issue with the merchant before contacting their debit card issuer some of which have their own zero liability policies.

BNPL loans on the other hand are not subject to the regulations that credit or debit card issuers fall under. While countries like Great Britain are rolling out regulations on the BNPL industry that would allow consumers to escalate complaints to a national agency there are no special regulations for BNPL providers in the U.S. Some of the major BNPL providers such as Affirm Klarna and Afterpay have their own dispute resolution policies in place.

""If you buy a faulty item with a BNPL loan you're subject to the policies of both the merchant and the BNPL lender which can make it tricky to navigate the return process"" says Tayne. ""In some cases you may have to continue paying an item until the merchant informs the lender that you've successfully returned it.""

For example Affirm has a dispute resolution procedure that works similarly to a credit card dispute resolution procedure: Consumers have 60 days to open a dispute with Affirm. After both the consumer and merchant submit information to substantiate their claims Affirm will then rule in favor of either the merchant or the consumer.

Consumers should also check if they're required to make payments on returned items. Klarna Affirm and Afterpay all offer consumers the ability to delay payments. Klarna will allow you to pause payments if you report a problem with your order while Affirm will not require continued payments on a purchase if you open a dispute with them within 60 days of the transaction. Afterpay allows customers to push the original payment due date back by two weeks while the return is processed.

Furthermore depending on how you're financing your purchase through BNPL you might have to contact the merchant the BNPL provider and the debit or credit card issuer to resolve issues. (Though some providers like Affirm just allow you to link your checking account for payments.)

Since Afterpay only allows consumers to pay with credit or debit card consumers are subject to the same protections they would be had they used their payment cards directly at the retailer says Amanda Pires Vice President of Communications at Afterpay.

This means that if you buy an item using Afterpay and are making payments with a debit card then you're subject to the protections offered by your debit card issuer. According to Pires 90% of Afterpay transactions are financed with debit cards.

For consumers figuring out which companies they need to contact when returning an item or reporting a faulty item that they purchased with a BNPL loan can be confusing.

Tayne suggests that consumers contact the retailer to understand the return policy research the BNPL's return policy and as a last resort reach out to the card issuer if they need additional help.

""If a retailer won't accept the return or the BNPL service is not cooperating consider contacting the credit card company. Credit card companies will often ask if you have attempted to resolve matters with the seller so do your best and dispute a transaction as a last option"" says Tayne.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9zd2VldC1zcG90LWJhLWZ1ZWwtc3VyY2hhcmdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sweet Spot Sunday: Saving big on British Airways surcharges with Asia Miles,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here .

Sweet Spot Sunday is a weekly series highlighting the best-value award redemptions across loyalty programs.

British Airways Executive Club can be incredibly useful for booking Oneworld award flights particularly on short- and medium-haul routes. However if you are booking award flights operated by British Airways itself you will incur some of the highest fuel surcharges levied by any airline. The extra costs for transatlantic awards typically start around $200 one-way for coach and $700 for business class.

What's more you'll even face these steep surcharges when booking British Airways flights using miles from most partners including American Airlines AAdvantage Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan and Iberia Plus. But there's one program that charges far lower surcharges than the rest: Cathay Pacific Asia Miles.

New to The Points Guy? Sign up for our daily newsletter and check out our beginners guide.

Why it's special

British Airways does a fairly good job of releasing award availability on transatlantic routes. The only problem? It tacks on hefty fuel surcharges to its awards. Those are in addition to the U.K.'s already high Air Passenger Duty fees which are mandatory for itineraries beginning in the U.K.

The fees can range from $400 to $1800 on a round-trip ticket so your ""free"" flight can quickly become quite expensive. Most partners pass on these same surcharges when booking award tickets. However with Cathay Pacific Asia Miles the fees can be roughly 50% less than booking with any other program which is quite significant.

Asia Miles charges more miles for transatlantic awards than British Airways but the savings on the surcharges can make up for it especially if you're sitting on a lot of transferable points.

The program uses a distance-based award chart – but just to give you an idea a nonstop one-way award from New York-JFK to London (LHR) costs 27000 miles in economy 43000 in premium economy 61000 in business class and 87000 in first class. Meanwhile an award from Los Angeles (LAX) to London Heathrow will set you back 40000 miles in economy 50000 in premium economy 75000 in business class and 120000 in first class.

You can check how much an award will cost by entering your itinerary in the award calculator tool on the Asia Miles website.

How to book this award

Only a handful of partner airlines are bookable through the Asia Miles website. Luckily British Airways is one of them so the process of booking these awards is fairly simple.

Step 1: Log in to an Asia Miles account

You'll need to be signed in to an Asia Miles account before you can search for an award ticket. If you don't have an account yet you can create one fairly easily. You can also sign in using various social media accounts.

Step 2: Search for award availability

Once signed in head to the award redemption page and enter your search criteria.

You can also access this page by going to the ""Flight awards"" page via the ""Redeem awards"" tab and clicking the ""Redeem now"" button under ""Other flight awards.""

(Screenshot courtesy of asiamiles.com)

Step 3: Pick your flight

You'll then be shown all of the flight options available for your preferred date as well as +/- three days. You can search different cabins by toggling their respective buttons at the top of the screen. If there's no button for a specific cabin that means that there's no award availability.

(Screenshot courtesy of asiamiles.com)

Step 4: Confirm and pay

Once you click on the flight you'd like to book you'll be shown the taxes and fees for the award. The site shows the fees in Hong Kong dollars by default but there's a currency converter you can use to see the price in U.S. dollars.

When you're ready to book click ""next"" to start the checkout process. Note that you'll only be able to proceed if you have enough miles in your account. Be sure to pay the surcharges with a card like The Platinum Card® from American Express or Chase Sapphire Reserve so that you're protected if something goes wrong during your trip.

As you can see although you'd need 1000 fewer British Airways Avios for the same flight the surcharges would be over $500 more!

How to earn miles for this award

Bottom line

You'll always need to pay fuel surcharges on award flights operated by British Airways. However you can often pay significantly lower fees by booking your awards through Cathay Pacific Asia Miles. You'll likely end up using more miles but if your ultimate goal is to pay as little out of pocket as possible the cash savings will make up for it.

The 34-year-old netted all the goals at Argentina's 3-0 win against Bolivia in World Cup qualifying and now has 79 for the national team.

Messi scored his goals in 153 caps for Argentina while Pelé netted his 77 in 92 official matches for Brazil.

Both goals at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires in front of about 20000 fans were pieces of art by the six-time Ballon d'Or winner.

The first came in the 14th minute with Messi moving the ball between a Bolivian defender's legs and shooting from outside the box to the right of goalkeeper Carlos Lampe.

The second came in the 64th minute after he and striker Lautaro Martinez dazzled the Bolivian defense with a quick exchange of four passes. Messi still had time to dribble past one defender before scoring.

Messi completed his hat-trick in the 88th minute from close range after getting a rebound from Lampe.

Messi didn't speak about the record after the match but celebrated by lifting the Copa America trophy in front of home fans who were allowed to attend after a 20-month pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I waited a lot of time for this I sought this I dreamed about this"" he said. ""It is a single moment because of the way it happened after so much wait.""

""There was no better way to celebrate than being here"" he added. ""My mom my brothers are here in the tribunes... They suffered a lot and today they are here celebrating. I am very happy.""

Messi had a troubled relationship with the national team with a series of hurtful defeats in World Cups and Copa Americas until he led the team to the continental title against Brazil in July. It was his first major title with Argentina a team that was in a 28-year title drought.

Three-time World Cup winner Pelé is currently in hospital due to surgery for a tumor on his colon.

The USMNT finishes its trio of October World Cup qualifying matches on Wednesday Oct. 13 vs. Costa Rica in Columbus Ohio (ESPN2 ESPN+ UniMas TUDN).

U.S. head coach Gregg Berhalter made seven changes to the U.S. lineup that faced Jamaica on Thursday night as the Americans squared off with a highly motivated Panama side looking to rebound from its first WCQ loss during the first match date of the window.

Both teams had trouble finding their rhythm in the first half on a soggy field at Estadio Rommel Fernández. While the U.S. had the game’s first real chance when a Walker Zimmerman header was tipped over the bar by Panama goalkeeper Luis Meija in the third minute Panama had the better of opportunities through the opening 45 threatening on a number of corner kicks and dangerous crosses into the penalty box. In the 14th minute Panama forward Rolando Blackburn slipped behind the defense but wasn’t able to connect with a nice ball played through the six-yard box and a U.S. miscue on a throw-in led to another solid opportunity for Panama in the 18th.

U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner was forced to make an acrobatic save in the 28th on a Panama corner and was called into action again at the end of the first half leaping to push away a driven shot by Edgar Barcenas from 18 yards out.

Needing a spark Berhalter made two substitutions at the break bringing on forward Brenden Aaronson and midfielder Tyler Adams. The pair helped get the U.S. attack moving with a bit more energy but Panama opened the scoring nine minutes into the second half to the delight of the home crowd. The goal was a breakthrough of sorts after Panama had several close calls on corner kicks. On the goal defender Eric Davis served a ball for Godoy at the near post and his header on frame deflected off U.S. forward Gyasi Zardes who was trying to clear and flew into the back of the net for the game’s lone goal.

Berhalter made his final three substitutes in the 68th minute with forward Ricardo Pepi midfielder Cristian Roldan and defender DeAndre Yedlin entering the match. The fresh legs made an impact as Pepi had a dangerous shot just moments after coming on but the U.S. was unable to create quality scoring chances over the 90 minutes and despite seven minutes of stoppage time an equalizer down the stretch went wanting.



GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN



PAN - Anibal Godoy (Eric Davis) 54th minute: Davis lined up for Panama’s seventh corner of the evening and sent in a service to the near post. Godoy rose above the U.S. defense to get his head on the ball and his shot deflected off forward Gyasi Zardes and bounced to the far back corner of the net for what proved to be the difference maker. PAN 1 USA 0



ADDITIONAL NOTE

The USMNT is now 16-2-6 all-time against Panama and 6-1-2 in World Cup qualifiers.

Midfielder Kellyn Acosta extended his consecutive games played streak to 19 matches dating back to the 6-0 win against El Salvador on Dec. 9 2020. Acosta’s run of games is the most by a USMNT player since Landon Donovan played 35-straight matches from 2001-2003.

Matt Turner is the only U.S. player to play every minute of World Cup qualifying so far as he made his 11th consecutive USMNT appearance the most by a USA goalkeeper since Brad Guzan played 12 consecutive matches from June 5-October 10 2015. The record for consecutive matches by a USMNT goalkeeper is held by Tony Meola who played 15-straight games from Dec. 19 1990-Sept. 4 1991.

Turner now has a 9-1-2 record in his 12 USMNT appearances keeping clean sheets in eight matches while conceding only four goals.

After making their World Cup Qualifying debuts on Thursday against Jamaica defender Shaq Moore and forward Tim Weah earned their first World Cup qualifying starts.

With Yunus Musah (18) and George Bello (19) in the line-up two teenagers started for the USMNT for a third-straight match. Bello and Ricardo Pepi (18) began the game on Sept. 8 in Honduras while Musah and Pepi started on Thursday against Jamaica.

Tonight’s match was the 40th of head coach Gregg Berhalter’s tenure. The team is 28-7-5 since Berhalter took over in January 2019.

An announcement by the Treasury said the Mammut Industrial Group also known as Mammut Industries and its subsidiaries were no longer under United States sanctions.

Mammut Industries and three of its main executives/shareholders were put in the sanctions list in were sanctioned in September 2020 by the Trump administrationpursuant to Executive Order 13382 issued by President George Bush in 2005 targeting “weapons of mass destruction and their proliferators and supporters.” The executive order threatened fines imprisonment and freezing assets.

The Mammut Industrial Group and its subsidiaries are private companies with thousands of employees in Iran were accused by the US to have supplied ""military-grade dual-use goods"" to Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization and specifically Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group which makes liquid-propelled missiles.

In early July the three individuals Behzad Daniel Ferdows Mehrzad Manuel Ferdows and Mohammad-Reza Dezfulian were all excluded from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

At the time the Treasury in a statement said that ""These delistings do not reflect any change in US government sanctions policy towards Iran” a Treasury spokesman told Reuters anonymously. “They have nothing to do with ongoing JCPOA negotiations in Vienna.”

The Biden Administration refuting former president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 announced its intention to return to the agreement. A round of talks began in Vienna with the participation of the remaining signatories of the deal with the US indirectly negotiating with Iran on the sidelines.

After six rounds of talks Iran suspended the meetings in June saying its new president needed time to form a government. But two months after Ebrahim Raisi (Raeesi) came to office Tehran is still not ready to resume negotiations.

The United States and its European allies have become concerned and have been urging Iran to return to the negotiating table citing Tehran’s continued enrichment of uranium.

Delegates from the Taliban and the United States have held “candid and professional” talks in the Qatari capital according to a US official with the two-day discussions focusing on security and “terrorism” concerns the rights of women and girls as well as evacuations from Afghanistan.

The weekend talks in Doha were the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides since the Taliban took over Afghanistan on August 15.

“The discussions were candid and professional with the US delegation reiterating that the Taliban will be judged on its actions not only its words” Ned Price spokesman for the US Department of State said on Sunday.

“The US delegation focused on security and terrorism concerns and safe passage for US citizens other foreign nationals and our Afghan partners as well as on human rights including the meaningful participation of women and girls in all aspects of Afghan society” he said.

“The two sides also discussed the United States’ provision of robust humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people.”

Al Jazeera’s Natasha Ghoneim reporting from Doha said that the Taliban delegation had described the two-day talks as “positive”.

“They hope it paves the way for recognition of the Afghan government – not only by the United States but the international community” she said.

The Afghan delegation led by the Afghan acting foreign minister Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi also came to Doha seeking financial assistance that comes with any sort of international recognition she said.

The Afghan delegation was asking the US to end economic sanctions and to “unfreeze” some $10bn worth of assets she added.

The Taliban announced its all-male Cabinet last month but it has struggled to govern amid a liquidity crisis after it was cut off from the international financial institutions such as IMF and World Bank.

The group has said it needs to pay government employees and provide services to Afghans amid a looming economic and humanitarian crisis.

Neither the US nor the Taliban have said if any agreements were reached during the talks.

“What concessions were made to get financial assistance what deals might be made … we don’t know as of now” said Ghoneim.

The Taliban took back power in Afghanistan in August almost 20 years after they were deposed in a US-led invasion for refusing to hand over al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden following the September 11 2001 attacks on the US.

Ahead of the talks US officials told the Reuters news agency that the US would press the Taliban to release kidnapped American Mark Frerichs. Another top priority would be to hold the Taliban to their commitment not to allow Afghanistan to again become a hotbed for al-Qaeda or other armed groups.

The US officials said the talks were a continuation of “pragmatic engagements” with the Taliban and “not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy” to the group.

Washington and other Western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large in Afghanistan.

They are trying to work out how to engage with the Taliban without granting the group the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country.

While the Taliban has signalled flexibility on evacuations it has said there would be no cooperation with the US on containing armed groups in Afghanistan.

The US-Taliban agreement of 2020 which was negotiated by the administration of former President Donald Trump had demanded that the Taliban break ties with “terrorist” groups and guarantee Afghanistan would not again harbour “terrorists” who could attack Washington and its allies.

In turn the Afghan group has demanded that its senior leaders be taken off the “terror list” accusing the US of violating the Doha agreement which paved the way for the US withdrawal.

Since the Taliban took power the Islamic State in Khorasan Province ISKP (ISIS-K) an ISIL (ISIS) affiliate has ramped up attacks in the country particularly targeting the Shia Hazara community.

ISKP has clamed a suicide attack on a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in which dozens of people were killed."

“I’m a big fan of Song Exploder and the way Hrishi analyzes songwriting and recording using the multitracks and sessions and the creator’s voice” said Sean Ono Lennon. “The shows are always intelligent well-researched and beautifully edited so we felt comfortable and confident opening up the archive to them to tell the story of this important song’s creation. They’ve done an amazing job and I’m excited for everyone to hear this special episode.”

Reflecting on the 50th anniversary of “Imagine” Yoko Ono Lennon said:

“John and I were both artists and we were living together so we inspired each other. The song ‘Imagine’ embodied what we believed together at the time. John and I met – he comes from the West and I come from the East – and still we are together. We have this oneness and ‘the whole world would eventually become one’ is the sense that we will all be very happy together. All these instructions are for people for how to spend eternity because we have lots of time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmFzdC1ncm93aW5nLWpvYi13aW5kLXR1cmJpbmUtdGVjaG5pY2lhbi1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LW5vLWRlZ3JlZS0yMDIxLTEw0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9mYXN0LWdyb3dpbmctam9iLXdpbmQtdHVyYmluZS10ZWNobmljaWFuLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktbm8tZGVncmVlLTIwMjEtMTA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wind techs paid $27 per hour one of the fastest-growing jobs,"Mahmut Serdar Alakus/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images



Wind-turbine technicians are the workers who service the very top of towering wind farms.

The median wage is $27 per hour and most jobs don't require a four-year degree.

Employment is projected to increase 68% from 2020 to 2030 – significantly faster than other sectors.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

There are more than 65000 land-based wind turbines across the US according to the American Wind Energy Association and more are coming online each year.

Each of the wind turbines that dots the landscape of a wind farm is generally made of a tower blades and a central unit called a nacelle. All three elements require specialists to install and maintain them throughout the life of a turbine.

The nacelles have the most going on since that is the housing for the generator gearbox brakes and circuitry that convert the mechanical energy into electricity to send down to the power grid.

In order to make repairs wind techs typically have to climb as high as 300 feet up the narrow tube of the tower to the nacelle while hauling up all the tools computers and safety gear needed to get the job done. And if a blade needs repair the techs have to rappel down from the nacelle to complete the job while dangling hundreds of feet above the ground.

The median wage for wind techs is $27 per hour according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics which works out to about $56000 per year – about 33% higher than the national median earnings of $42000.

A community college or technical degree is typically enough to qualify for the job and many employers provide a year or more of on-the-job training. Most techs will need to understand electrical hydraulic braking mechanical and computers systems as well as have first aid and rescue training.

Mahmut Serdar Alakus/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images



With 6900 workers in 2020 the field is small but one of the fastest growing in the entire economy with BLS projections expecting a 68% increase in new jobs by 2030. That's nearly nine times faster than the projection for all other occupations tracked by the agency.

Beyond claustrophobia and acrophobia a few things might dissuade someone from racing to find a wind-tech job.

For one thing the schedule can be grueling. Most wind farms are located in remote areas so travel times to job sites can take a long time. Plus bad weather or other unpredictable events can knock out a turbine at any time of the day or night and repairs need to happen as quickly as possible.

Mahmut Serdar Alakus/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images



More importantly the Labor Department says wind techs have one of the highest rates of injury and illness of all occupations. In particular a 2017 study found that falls in the energy sector are quite common (though just a few are fatal) as are strains sprains and overexertion.

As the world shifts from carbon to renewable power sources it will increasingly rely on workers like wind techs to do the high-risk jobs that keep the modern economy moving.

If you are a wind tech or a worker who has a job you consider high risk please get in touch with Dominick Reuter via email. Responses to this story will be kept confidential.

According to an expert panel who drank samples from across the state this week Norfolk has the best tap water. Norfolk’s Department of Utilities won the top prize in the “Best of Virginia Tap Water Taste Test” held at the 2021 American Water Works Association Distribution System Rodeo in Virginia Beach.

Water samples were judged in four categories – clarity odor flavor and aftertaste. As the winner Norfolk Utilities is now eligible to represent the Commonwealth in the national American Water Works Association ACE Conference in June 2022.

“We improve the quality of life for residents by providing excellent water and wastewater services at the best possible value” Bob Carteris said the acting director of the Department of Utilities. “We’re proud and honored by this latest achievement.”

“This water left the treatment plant and went into the distribution system before we pulled samples for the competition” said Sid Lowe assistant superintendent of water distribution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy93YXRlci10cmVhdG1lbnQtcGxhbnQtZmxvb2RpbmctcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLW5qLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLTIwMjExMDEwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hurricane Ida showed how climate change threatens Philly area's water supply,"Marc Lucca president of Aqua Pennsylvania surveys flood damage in the original filtration building at the company's Pickering West water treatment plant near Phoenixville.

Aqua is reassessing whether to restore the building if operations at the flood-prone plant are relocated t higher ground. Read more

The water came in fast and nothing could be done to stop it.

As the remnants of Hurricane Ida deluged the region last month Marc Lucca the president of Aqua Pennsylvania watched live security cameras as employees at the Pickering West water treatment plant splashed through ankle-deep water gushing into the facility. “In a matter of minutes they were hip-deep in water and had to evacuate” he said.

Floodwater laden with mud and debris poured into the Chester County plant from three directions disabling operations for nine days and affecting service to about a million people in Delaware Chester and Montgomery Counties. “We saw seven to eight inches of rain two inches an hour” said Lucca. “We’re seeing an intensity of these storms that we’ve never seen here before.”

More than a month after the storm Pickering West is operating at only half capacity and might never be fully restored.

Seventy miles away in Bridgewater N.J. the operators of New Jersey American’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant also experienced an unexpectedly rapid rise of Ida’s floodwaters.

Tom Kantor a maintenance mechanic was driving toward the plant for the midnight shift when his pickup truck stalled in high water. He was rescued by a public works employee in a construction vehicle. But Kantor’s four-month-old Dodge Ram floated away a total loss.

“The DPW guy brought me up and I made it in before we closed the gate” Kantor said. He and his coworkers were marooned in the treatment plant for more than two days before the waters subsided.

The Raritan-Millstone plant unlike the Pickering plant in Pennsylvania stayed dry and continued operating thanks to a new $37 million flood wall completed only three years earlier that held back the high water.

That new wall was built after a hurricane 10 years ago came within one inch of flooding the plant. This time the flood crested nearly a foot above the level of the old wall. Without the new wall’s additional four feet the flood would have swallowed the plant which serves about 1.5 million people in central New Jersey.

“That wall paid dividends in just a few years” said Oleg Kostin the director of operations for New Jersey American. “If this plant had gone down I guarantee it would cost more than $37 million to bring it back online.”

The experiences at the two water treatment plants illustrate the risks and costs associated with ever-more severe storms that threaten the region’s energy transportation and water infrastructure. Water-industry experts say that extreme weather events caused by climate change pose a growing threat to drinking-water systems many of them located in flood-prone areas along rivers.

In the aftermath of Ida water utility operators are reassessing their systems’ vulnerabilities and whether it is more cost-effective to harden existing facilities or to move equipment or plants to higher ground. The risk: more floods greater cleanup costs and possibly the nightmare scenario for a water system -- a prolonged loss of service to a large population. Imagine the run on bottled water and portable toilets.

“What do we keep here?” said Lucca surveying the damage on a recent tour of Pickering West which is near Phoenixville adjacent to the smaller Pickering East plant. “What do we flood-proof here? What about the flood wall? Do we move over to our Pickering East facility where we have space?”

The temporary loss of the Pickering West plant Aqua’s largest suburban Philadelphia treatment facility caused the company to impose a boil-water advisory in two towns for several days and to plead with thousands of customers to curtail consumption so that storage tanks did not empty out. Aqua’s challenges were compounded because several neighboring water suppliers which are interconnected to Aqua’s system also experienced Ida-related outages and had little spare capacity to offer.

In Doylestown and Norristown water-main breaks caused by washouts and sinkholes disrupted service to pockets of customers.

In Tullytown a chemical treatment system failed at the Lower Bucks Joint Municipal Authority plant as the system struggled to cope with filthy floodwaters from the Delaware River said Vijay Rajput the authority’s managing director. Rajput shut down the plant rather than sending out impure water to Bristol and other surrounding communities but customers were advised to boil water for four days until the system recovered.

In Philadelphia floodwaters damaged the raw water intake pumps on the Schuylkill forcing the Philadelphia Water Department to suspend operations for nearly two weeks at the Belmont Water Treatment Plant. The department was able to make up for the loss of the smallest of its three treatment plants by stepping up output from the two other facilities.

But had a similar outage knocked out the Baxter Water Treatment Plant on the Delaware River which supplies more drinking water than the two other plants combined the outcome for Philadelphia might have been different.

The costs for recovering from Ida and for future fortifications to water systems will inevitably be passed on to customers in the form of higher rates.

“Right now we’re focused on what’s the long-term solution” said Christopher Franklin chief executive officer of Aqua’s parent company Essential Utilities Corp. of Bryn Mawr. “We’ll have to think about what are the trade-offs and the benefits and what it would cost in rates. That’s a real conversation.”

Water customers are already stressed from picking up the tab for infrastructure upgrades. Twelve days before Ida hit Aqua Pennsylvania filed a request to increase water bills for 445000 customers by 17% and sewer bills by almost double that to about $155 a month for a customer with combined Aqua water and wastewater service. A generation ago water bills were so low that utilities billed quarterly.

It’s not just Aqua: Across multiple jurisdictions bills for water and wastewater customers have been increasing in recent years at a quicker pace than fees charged by other regulated utilities such as electricity and gas suppliers. The water bills are magnified by the cost of replacing water and wastewater systems installed five decades ago to meet federal clean-water laws passed in the early 1970s. Those systems are reaching the end of their useful lives.

“A lot of that infrastructure was designed to last 40 or 50 years and it was also designed as if the climate of the future was going to mirror the climate of the past which has proven to be not true” said Scott Berry director of policy and government affairs for the U.S. Water Alliance an advocacy group representing public and private utilities along with community business and environmental nonprofits.

The massive water and wastewater civil works of the 1970s and 1980s were partly underwritten by grants from the federal government. But Washington’s support for water and wastewater infrastructure has diminished over the decades to about 4% of total current costs said Berry. The cost of responding to bigger storms and more floods will largely fall on local users.

There is some hope for financial relief from the federal infrastructure package currently mired in Congress. The legislation initially included $111 billion for water wastewater and storm-water infrastructure a big increase over previous years. That compares with the $473 billion that the Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2015 was needed over the next 20 years just to maintain and improve the nation’s drinking-water infrastructure not counting sewers.

A final version of the infrastructure legislation if it ever passes Congress is likely to contain much less money for water projects. The latest proposal pared water spending down to $48 billion over five years said Berry. And most of the money will likely target programs to replace lead household water supply lines remediate water systems contaminated by PFAS chemicals and invest in small rural water systems through state loan programs rather than addressing climate challenges.

Water-industry advocates say the high cost of responding to climate challenges supports arguments in favor of consolidating smaller systems under the control of larger operators either publicly or privately owned. Consolidation of water and wastewater systems has accelerated in recent years particularly in Pennsylvania where state law enables buyers to pay top dollar to acquire municipal systems. Large water operators say they can connect multiple communities into networks with diverse water sources take advantage of economies of scale and spread the cost of upgrades across a wider population.

“We understand that people can be very parochial and have a lot of feelings about the idea of having their local water system” said Mark McDonough the president of New Jersey American Water whose parent company American Water Works Co. Inc. is based in Camden. One of his pitches to local officials who are considering selling their water systems is that a large operator is more likely to have the resources to respond to a disaster.

“Mayors have so much to think about these days” McDonough said. “Climate variability is causing lots and lots of challenges above ground. They need to really hand off this problem to the experts who can help them run the below-ground stuff.”

The history of New Jersey American’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant in Somerset County is a case study in trying to cope with increasingly hostile climate forces.

The plant which supplies about 150 million gallons of treated water a day to customers in seven counties is on a flood plain at the confluence of the Raritan and Millstone Rivers. Its owners have increased flood barriers twice in the last 20 years in response to big storms.

There was no flood wall before 1999 when Hurricane Floyd inundated the facility so completely that it required a helicopter rescue of the plant’s staff.

Oleg Kostin who now oversees all of New Jersey American’s operations was superintendent of the plant at the time and the last person hoisted out. “I was the captain going down with the ship” he said.

Floyd knocked the plant out of service for six days and cost $17 million to clean out and repair. The plant’s previous owner authorized construction of a flood wall and earthworks to protect the plant from a 100-year flood.

That 100-year-flood wall nearly met its match just a few years later in 2011 when Hurricane Irene’s floods rose to within an inch of topping over the wall. Kostin snapped a photo of the murky water near the top of the wall using a ruler as a prop.

He calls it the “money shot” because it was instrumental in persuading New Jersey regulators to authorize the expenditure of $37 million to raise the wall four feet higher to 500-year flood standards.

Raising the Raritan-Millstone barrier to withstand an epic flood is a more complex engineering challenge than simply adding four feet of concrete on top of an existing wall.

In many places an entirely new wall needed to be erected with a foundation of steel sheet pilings pounded into the soil as deep as 50 feet to form an underground wall down to the bedrock. That raised the project price significantly. That subsurface barrier is designed to thwart the powerful scouring force of a huge flood which can undermine a weaker barrier and cause it to collapse.

The Raritan-Millstone now surrounded by a foot-thick concrete wall and monstrous steel gates resembles a well-fortified correctional institution. “We joke that we’re going to put up turrets and machine guns” said Kostin.

Aqua Pennsylvania’s Pickering West plant in Chester County at the confluence of the Schuylkill and Pickering Creek also has a history of devastating floods. In 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes filled the plant’s interior to about six feet high memorialized in a plaque on the wall of the plant’s control room.

More than a decade ago Aqua spent $20 million to improve the Pickering West plant which included $1 million to raise the earthworks and walls by 18 inches to meet 100-year storm standards.

“We thought we were over-building it at the time” Franklin the Essential Utilities CEO said on a tour of the damaged plant about a month after the storm. “Clearly they weren’t high enough given what we’re facing today.”

The flood which came into the plant from three directions actually outflanked the Pickering West flood wall. The water came up from the Schuylkill as it usually does in a heavy storm.

But the plant’s operators had never seen the water also overflow the nearby Pickering Dam filling up Route 23 and then cascading down the plant’s driveway like an uninvited visitor. Runoff from the nearby Moorehouse residential development poured in from a third direction.

The water converged and filled the treatment plant’s buildings to a depth of six feet coating everything with gooey silt ruining computerized control systems and banks of electrical switches. It stopped a few inches shy of Hurricane Agnes’ high-water mark from 49 years earlier.

The flood’s force snapped trees and crushed the thick steel cover of a million-gallon tank that stores finished water -- a total loss -- and filled the area protected by the flood wall. The earthen wall which was designed to withstand the force of water coming from the exterior collapsed from churning water that eroded the wall from the interior.

After the floods receded the plant was coated with a slippery gunk. A bridge across Pickering Creek that connects the two plants submerged under 15 feet of turgid water during the flood was damaged. Electrical switches and electronics that been submerged needed to be removed and replaced. Muddy river water filled a two million-gallon tank that normally contains treated water. Cleanup workers rescued a carp from the vessel before flushing and disinfecting the tank.

The Aqua executives commended their employees who escaped injury for rallying to restore service in nine days. A damage assessment is still underway. The tally will total millions of dollars though Franklin said some is covered by insurance.

There is a serious discussion underway at Aqua to consider whether it is worth restoring Pickering West to full capacity of 40 million gallons a day or to build new capacity elsewhere at a higher elevation.

“These plants were built to withstand most storms and you never expect to see this” said Franklin. “So now it really challenges you on the engineering side to think about what’s next. What do we have to prepare for?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2JzLmFyaXpvbmEuZWR1L25ld3MvcGx1bWJpbmctcG92ZXJ0eS11cy1jaXRpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plumbing Poverty in U.S. Cities | College of Social & Behavioral Sciences,"A new in-depth report finds an increase in households without piped running water – what the authors call ‘plumbing poverty’ – in some of America’s wealthiest and fastest-growing cities. These cities include the metropolitan areas of San Francisco Portland Austin Nashville and Seattle.

The report identifies a clear link between unaffordable housing metropolitan wealth gaps and plumbing poverty with households of color and renters disproportionately living without piped running water in their homes. This is particularly the case for households that spend 40-50% of their monthly income on rent despite no access to running water.

Analyzing two decades of data trends from 2000 to 2017 the researchers identify San Francisco as having the highest share of households without running water followed by Portland Milwaukee San Antonio and Austin (in ranked order). Piped water access worsened for households in these cities since 2000. Between 2000 and 2017 Los Angeles ‘improved’ to 7th place. But it still has 44200 people without piped water.

Meanwhile throughout the United States nearly 460000 households or some 1.1 million people lack piped running water in their homes. 73% of households without piped water are located in urban areas with 29% in the 15 metros profiled in this report.

The research was led by Katie Meehan with the Department of Geography at King’s College London. Meehan is also a Ph.D. alumna from UArizona School of Geography Development and Environment. Jason Jurjevich associate professor of practice and graduate student Nicholas Chun – both in the University of Arizona School of Geography Development and Environment co-authored the report.

Phoenix is one of the cities featured in the report:

Rates of plumbing poverty have flat lined or “stagnated” since 2000. However the situation has deteriorated for renter households.

Renters are earning less and paying more to live in a home without running water. Renters account for 51% of households without piped water and their rents rose by $250 (38%) while their median incomes fell by $230 (10%) between 2000 and 2017.

The authors argue that “stagnation” equals “no progress” in terms of universal water access.

The Army military police officer was standing guard onboard a cargo ship in the middle of Qui Nhon harbor in central South Vietnam. His watch was nearly over and he was waiting to be relieved. Collins stood by the railing and checked out an approaching boat to make sure it wasn’t an enemy craft. He saw that it was an American water taxi and comrades from the 127th Military Police Company were clustered onboard.

Then something unusual caught Collins’ eye. On the boat amid all the olive drab uniforms and dark green helmets marked “MP” stood a civilian dressed in a madras shirt and white jeans. He had red hair that looked familiar. “Chickie?” Collins thought and shook his head in disbelief. It couldn’t be his friend from the old neighborhood back in the States. Could it?

As the water taxi pulled alongside the cargo ship the MP heard the civilian call out “Hey Collins!” It was Chickie!

A dumbfounded Collins answered: “What the hell are you doing here?”

Chickie pulled a can from his backpack and handed it to his friend. “I came to give you a beer” he said. “This is from the Colonel and me and all the guys in Doc Fiddler’s.”

Collins popped open the still-cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and guzzled it down wondering how John “Chickie” Donohue made it to the war zone in Vietnam thousands of miles from that little bar in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan New York.

“I was shocked” Collins recalled in an interview. “I couldn’t believe he would go in harm’s way just to bring me a beer.”

Donohue also delivered beer to three other friends in Vietnam.

The improbable but true story of his odyssey is recorded in The Greatest Beer Run Ever: A Memoir of Friendship Loyalty and War by Donohue and Joanna Molloy a former New York newspaper reporter and columnist. The book is being made into a movie by producer and director Peter Farrelly who scored three Academy Awards for Green Book in 2019. Initial media reports put Zac Efron Russell Crowe and possibly Bill Murray in starring roles.

Donohue’s journey halfway around the world began on a cold night in November 1967 when he strolled into Doc Fiddler’s seeking brew and brotherhood. Then 26 the former Marine was in between jobs as a seaman on merchant ships. The mood was low in the bar. News filtered in about how badly things were going in Vietnam and how protesters were taking it out on the military men who had served there.

“We got to do something for them” growled bartender George Lynch nicknamed “the Colonel.” He had made it only to private first class but patrons of the bar promoted him out of respect for his deep patriotism. “Somebody ought to go over to ’Nam track down our boys from the neighborhood and bring them each a beer” the Colonel proclaimed. “We gotta support them!”

After more than a few beers everyone in the bar was in raucous agreement with the Colonel—including Donohue who said he would go. “Get me a list of the guys and what units they’re with and I’ll do it” he heard himself saying.

The next thing he knew Donohue was headed to Vietnam with a burlap sack full of American beer and a list of six buddies from Inwood. To carry out his unauthorized mission he used his seaman’s card to get a spot on the merchant ship hauling ammo. Donohue had no idea what he was going to do once he got to Vietnam.

“There was no plan” he remembered. “There was nothing material to plan with! I just kept going. How could you plan to get on a couple of planes and helicopters and find these guys? It’s not plannable!”

Donohue left New York on the merchant ship in late November 1967 and got to Vietnam on Jan. 19 1968. He hitched rides on jeeps trucks aircraft and water taxis to search for his pals. All he had to do was find six guys from Inwood New York in a haystack of some 500000 American service members.

Donohue’s quest was complicated by bad timing. He stumbled into the communists’ Tet Offensive launched on Jan. 31 1968 when the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong struck bases and cities throughout South Vietnam inflicting thousands of casualties.

His unlikely success amid all of those hurdles sounds like a tall tale concocted after drinking too many beers—or perhaps the story of a miracle bestowed by a heavenly hand.

“Do I think God sent me there? No” Donohue now 79 said in a thick New York City accent. “I think George Lynch sent me. But if there was any divine intervention he did it in my favor.”

Almost immediately after the ammo ship docked at Qui Nhon Donohue grabbed the burlap sack of cold beer from the vessel’s refrigerator and jumped on a water taxi ferrying troops around Qui Nhon harbor. Immediately he noticed the soldiers on the boat had the same insignia as Collin’s unit: 127th MP. On a lark Donohue asked if anyone knew his friend who had a fairly common name.

“Yeah we know Collins” one of them said. “He’s on that ship right over there.”

Donohue couldn’t believe his luck. He walked up the cargo ship’s gangway to his stunned friend who asked what was going on. “I came over to buy you a beer” Donohue recalled saying. “The Colonel sends his regards. Oh and your mother says you better write to her so she knows you’re OK.”

After Collins downed the beer he brought Donohue to his barracks where the latter explained his mission. Next on the list was Rick Duggan who was somewhere up north with the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) near An Khe in South Vietnam’s Central Highlands.

“How the hell are you going to get up there?” Collins asked.

Earlier in the day Donohue had spoken with a pilot scheduled to go to An Khe on a mail run the next day. He hitched a ride on the pilot’s Grumman HU-16 Albatross plane and landed at the base only to find that the 1st Cav had moved to a remote location closer to the Demilitarized Zone border between North and South Vietnam.

Donohue found out where the unit had gone then hitched a ride in a jeep headed in that direction. He hopped in the back with two soldiers and began speaking to the driver who asked his unexpected passenger what he was up to. Donohue explained.

Suddenly the jeep screeched to a halt. The driver turned around. “Holy Christ Chick! What the hell are you doing here?”

Donohue was now looking at Kevin McLoone another friend from the neighborhood on the list. The two Inwood drinking buddies had a short reunion and toasted each other with beer before McLoone a Marine in the transport helicopter squadron HMM-261 “Raging Bulls” took Donohue to the An Khe airfield.

At the airstrip Donohue jumped on a two-engine prop plane and asked if anyone knew how he could find Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry Regiment.

Two young soldiers piped up that they were with that unit. Donohue asked if they knew Duggan. They said they did. After the plane landed at Phu Bai about 10 miles south of Hue Donohue tagged along as the troopers marched on their own mission.

The beer delivery man soon learned that Bravo Company was at Landing Zone Jane near Quang Tri city about 30 miles north of Hue. Donohue managed to wrangle another ride on a flight this time a Huey helicopter The major in charge of flight operations at LZ Jane asked very few questions.

Donohue who served in the Philippines and Japan when he was in the Corps from 1958 to 1964 was surprised to see the deference received by a civilian without papers in a war zone. He soon realized that most officers thought he was someone else.

“They didn’t know how to treat me” Donohue said. “They just assumed I was some sort of government agent for the CIA or another group. That’s how I was able to talk my way onto so many planes.”

Donohue eventually made it to LZ Jane. He found out that Duggan was just beyond the perimeter at an ambush post. When the two men met Donohue got the typical greeting from one of his neighborhood friends: “Chickie! What are you doing here?”

Duggan took Donohue to his post. They had to wait on the beer toast because the enemy was so close. Duggan handed a poncho to his friend who was wearing the same clothes as the day he arrived in Vietnam.

“That outfit is like wearing a sign that says ‘Shoot me I’m from New York’” Duggan told him.

In the middle of the night they were awakened by sounds in the dark. It was the North Vietnamese Army. The Americans sent up flares and a firefight started. Donohue was handed an M79 grenade launcher and told to take cover which he did deep in a hootch.

Eventually the shooting quieted down and the two men made their way back to LZ Jane where they were finally able to toast their friendship. Duggan’s unit was ordered to a new position in the A Shau Valley so Donohue left on another chopper.

By some remarkable stroke of luck the Inwood native had tracked down three buddies in Vietnam in four days bunking down with them in barracks tents and outposts. Donohue set out for Saigon. He had missed the return voyage of the merchant ship so now he was stuck in Vietnam with no papers—and no way out. It took some time but Donohue got a passport and visa through the U.S. Consulate. He arranged a flight to Manila in the Philippines so he could book passage on another freighter returning to the States.

While waiting he walked into a bar and—in another roll of the dice that turned up a “Lucky 7”—spotted a merchant mariner from New Jersey. He had previously sailed with the man who helped Donohue get fresh clothes and food from his ship.

As they walked through South Vietnam’s capital Donohue’s friend pointed to a tiny sliver of the moon and noted that it was New Year’s Eve on the Vietnamese calendar. “They call it Tet” his buddy said. “They’ve called a truce! It’s party time man!” They didn’t stay out too late though. Donohue had an early flight to catch the next morning—Jan. 31 the dawn of the Lunar New Year.

Shortly after midnight a massive attack by the NVA and Viet Cong engulfed the country. The launch of the offensive during a truce caught American and South Vietnamese troops off guard. Saigon was one of the many places under attack.

Donohue on his way back to the hotel at first thought the explosions were fireworks displays to mark the start of the Tet holiday. However it soon became apparent that this was no celebration.

“There was firing everywhere” Donohue recalled. “There were bodies lying in the street in front of the American Embassy. I hid behind a tree for safety.”

In his hunt for friends from the bar in Inwood New York Donohue found Rick Duggan far left of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) at Landing Zone Jane in northernmost South Vietnam.

The Viet Cong blew a hole in the wall around the U.S. Embassy but were immediately confronted by Army MPs and Marines. The enemy never got into the building itself. After several hours of fighting inside the compound the MPs and Marines eliminated the VC threat killing 18 of the 19 intruders. Four MPs and a Marine also died.

Just before the Tet Offensive started Donohue had managed to track down a fourth friend on his list. Bobby Pappas a communications specialist in the Army was stationed near Saigon at Long Binh the largest ammunition supply depot in the world.

Donahue hitched a ride to the massive base. He told MPs at the gate his crazy story about buying beers for his buddies in Vietnam. They laughed and escorted him directly to Pappas who was in a bunker. Donohue greeted him with “Hey buddy!”

Pappas looked at him and said “Chick? What the hell are you doing here?” Donohue handed him one of the last beers in his bag. They talked about Vietnam and Donohue said he thought the war was about over.

When Tet erupted Donohue became concerned about his friend. On the morning of Jan. 31 while dodging bullets and hiding behind trees Donohue saw a huge mushroom cloud in the sky to the northeast of Saigon.

He knew it could only mean one thing: Viet Cong commandos had attacked the ammo dump and blew it up. He feared for Pappas’ life and headed back to Long Binh.

“There were shells all over” Donohue remembered. “The place was a wreck. I went into the bunker and Bobby was standing there. He looked at me and said ‘You? You told me this freaking war was over!’ He was so mad at me. I looked at him and said ‘Thank God!’ I thought he was dead.”

There were still two names on his list to toast with beer. Although he didn’t know it at the time one of them Marine Richard Reynolds had been killed in combat on Jan. 20 in Quang Tri province. Another friend Joe McFadden had been shipped home by the Army with a bad case of malaria.

That was the end of Donohue’s beer-delivery mission. Now he had to get back home. As usual he had no plan. Given that fierce fighting was still raging around Vietnam U.S. government officials had more pressing concerns than helping him get out of there. Fate once again played a hand. Donohue learned that a merchant ship had been attacked in the Saigon River. An oiler in the engine room had been injured and couldn’t make the return trip. Donohue’s job in the merchant marine? Oiler. He signed on.

“I knew the union rules” Donohue said. “A ship can’t sail short of a full crew if there is a qualified seaman in port. I convinced the captain he had to hire me.”

Donohue sailed to the West Coast flew to New York City and took a taxi to Doc Fiddler’s on April 1 1968.

“I got out of the cab—I will never forget that—and was paying the driver when someone walked out” he recalled. “He yells back in the door ‘Hey! It’s Chickie! He’s back alive!’ By that time some of the guys I met in Vietnam were back in the old neighborhood. They knew I was there but didn’t know what had happened to me.”

The Colonel was overjoyed. He poured himself and everyone in the bar a brew and gave a toast: “To Chickie who brought our boys beer respect pride—and love goddamn it!”

Life slowly returned to normal in Inwood. All the men who received American beer in Vietnam returned home. They went on with their lives got jobs and raised families. Donohue purchased Doc Fiddler’s in 1970 and ran the bar for several years.

Not much was said about what happened mainly because the veterans didn’t want to dredge up painful wartime experiences. Donohue Collins McLoone Duggan and Pappas met from time to time but little was said about what took place in Vietnam in January 1968. The shared experience created a mutual bond nonetheless.

The men did start talking about that crazy adventure after Molloy proposed writing a book and documentarian Andrew Muscato made a short film entitled The Greatest Beer Run Ever for Pabst in 2015. They even gathered in 2019 to mark the occasion during the 50th anniversary commemoration of the war. Now the five friends talk regularly with each other about what happened and how it shaped their lives.

Today Donohue shakes his head when he thinks about how the journey of a lifetime all fell together so incredibly. He realized at the time—and still acknowledges today—it was something he just had to do.

“I was often asked ‘Why did you do that?’” he said. “Simply put it was the right thing to do. As outrageous as the idea sounded coming from the Colonel and as difficult as it would have been to accomplish it was just the right thing to do—or at least try to do it. So I did it.”

And when he did it the guys from the neighborhood were very impressed. As McLoone said just before guzzling his PBR in Vietnam “Wow! That’s a helluva beer run!” V

Investments in each category have opportunities and challenges for investors to consider when crafting an optimal financial strategy. With so many choices at your fingertips how can you best capitalize on what the markets have to offer? There is no right answer for everyone but in many cases it may make sense to use both active and passive investments to effectively build and manage a diversified portfolio.

Defining active and passive investing

Active investing is an approach that seeks to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market by identifying individual securities that don’t currently appear to be priced based on their true underlying value. Success using this approach generally requires in-depth research and analysis by knowledgeable investment professionals. Many traditional mutual funds fall into this category. Active fund managers who oversee these funds seek to generate returns that outperform a benchmark or a specific measure of market performance such as the S&P 500 index. They make investment decisions based on a defined approach or strategy.

On the other hand passive investing is an approach that seeks to match the performance or a specific benchmark or segment of the market. Many passive investors choose for example to put their money to work in an index fund that invests in a broad segment of the market. Perhaps the most common passive investments are funds that track the performance of the S&P 500 Index an unmanaged index of large capitalization U.S. stocks. The premise is to own a broad cross-section of the market or of a segment of the market rather than trying to identify specific securities that may outperform a benchmark or segment of the market.

It’s worth noting that there are increasingly more investment options offering a middle ground between active and passive strategies. Called strategic or smart beta this investment strategy is intended to combine the transparency consistency and cost-efficiency of passive investing with the investment insights found in active management.

Considerations for each approach

There are benefits and shortcomings to each approach. Actively managed investment strategies offer the opportunity for outperformance versus a specific segment of the market. They can also take steps to defend against the impact of down markets that inevitably occur from time to time often by avoiding individual securities or sectors that have challenges. To accommodate the research and expertise involved actively managed investments typically come with higher expenses which detract from the net returns they generate. Also because they are using a selective approach to investing there are times when they will choose to invest in securities that don’t perform to expectations and perhaps miss out on the full benefit of broader upward trends in the market.

A key benefit of passive investing is that fees tend to be lower than other investment strategies. They also tend to be tax efficient because trading is minimized in the fund as it continues to track an index over the long term. A downside to passive funds is that by simply investing in a benchmark an investor foregoes the opportunity to outperform that index. This means returns tend to match those of the market minus any fees. Also in volatile periods or when markets trend down index fund investors will see their investments follow a similar path.

A case for both strategies

Is one approach the best choice for your portfolio? The reality for many investors is that a combined approach may be an effective solution. Investors should pay close attention to factors that can affect their investment results including fees different sources of potential investment return and the benefits of a diversified portfolio.

You may determine that part of your portfolio should generally track with the market. If that’s the case a passive fund may make sense. At the same time you may want to take advantage of specific opportunities in segments of the market where selectivity may help you reach your goals. If so active strategies may offer a better path to success.

The good news is that you have a tremendous opportunity to effectively diversify and tailor your portfolio to help you achieve your long-term goals. A financial advisor can work with you to determine what approach and investments work best given your financial goals investment time horizon and risk profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was Hepatitis-A. He had gotten it from a place he had eaten in Mexico. He remembered more about how determined she was to track the source of the infection than he did about how sick he was then.

“Science and research wasn’t just a profession or a job to her” he said. “She was all in from the beginning.”

With the Covid-19 pandemic having its grip on the world for more than a year-and-a-half now Menchaca thinks about what his sister might be doing about that today. He said he imagines she’d be on the front lines of trying to understand and explain the science behind the virus. He can almost hear her talking about how exciting the vaccines were and how she’d be urging the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing.

And then he starts to get choked up because even 20 years later the death of his sister remains raw.

Dora Menchaca was 45 when she boarded American Airlines Flight 77 headed from Washington D.C. to Los Angeles the morning of Sept. 11 2001. He said she was supposed to land that day and see her husband Earl Dorsey and their two children Imani and Jaryd.

But like nearly 3000 others on that day she never made it home.

Instead John said all he has now are photos and a tribute binder he can’t quite bring himself to put together. He relies mostly on his memories of her now. But while the nation remembers collectively the tragedy of 9/11 John said he remembers Dora every day.

“She still comes up in conversations all the time with my family” he said. “Something always seems to bring her to mind.”

And he is reminded again how much he misses her.

Growing Up

John Menchaca was four years younger than Dora but he remembered growing up in San Antonio with her and how she was always there to help him with his studies. Education was a premium ideal growing up in the Menchaca family.

“She was a voracious reader. Constantly reading” he said. “Not just textbooks either. Every Sunday her and my dad would sit and go through the entire newspaper in San Antonio – front to back – and discuss what was going on for two or three hours. She had this inquisitive mind and was incredibly curious.”

He said he remembered her being patient with him while helping with his math homework. He said it was no surprise to anyone that as she went through high school she was going to college. Menchaca said she was always a high achiever and when she was accepted to the University of Notre Dame the whole family drove up with her in an old Volkswagen bus to see her off.

Menchaca said it was the first time they’d ever been outside the state of Texas.

“I remember when we crossed the Mississippi and it took us by surprise at how big it was” he said. “We thought the bridge would never end.”

The drive back after dropping her off felt longer. He missed her. But he said they drove up again for her graduation from the University of Notre Dame in 1977 and their parents were proud. So was her younger brother who could see she was on her way to bigger things.

Staying Close

Even as their careers diverged – she went on to the University of North Carolina for her master’s in public health and then UCLA for a doctorate in epidemiology and he was studying to become an accountant – they stayed close.

In the early 1980s the two shared an apartment together in West Los Angeles while she was still at UCLA and when she gave birth to Imani he said he got to spend time with his niece while in that apartment. She completed her doctorate in 1986 according to the UCLA Daily Bruin.

The time in the apartment he said was filled with great memories. She had plants in the apartment – a foreshadowing of a gardening hobby she would continue at her home in Santa Monica. John mostly recalled how she seemed to balance so much with patience and grace.

He didn’t know it at the time but he said at a memorial for Dora after the 9/11 tragedy a woman approached him. She told him about how Dora had played soccer with a bunch of guys and that when one of the player’s wives had gotten ill Dora wrote the husband a letter in Spanish and sent coupons to restaurants and supermarkets.

“The woman told me Dora gave the gift of time” he said. “Instead of wasting time running around to stores and restaurants that time could be spent with his sick wife.”

When John Menchaca got married in 1987 he said Dora's daughter was the flower girl at the wedding. After Dora married he would visit his sister in Santa Monica. He said his two older daughters would visit “Aunt Dora” and always had a good time with her.

He said she was always great with his children – and especially with hers.

“She would be proud of them” he said. “They’re both good quality people. Very caring and very responsible and very in touch with life. They took up professions that are meaningful and are going to help humanity.”

Moment Frozen in Time

Dora Menchaca worked hard at Amgen as a director of clinical research and had this inner drive to research a cure for cancer. Her father had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and she was relentless in her pursuit of finding a cure to help those with similar illnesses.

Dora Menchaca was in Washington D.C. briefing U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials on some cancer research the day before on Sept. 10. But John Menchaca said she had been talking about wanting to spend more time with her family and so she caught an earlier flight home on the morning of Sept. 11 2001.

It was American Airlines Flight 77.

John Menchaca said he can still remember everything about that morning. He woke up and both he and his wife watched in disbelief as the smoke poured from the World Trade Center. He said he remembered talk of Los Angeles being a possible target and how he was going to get to the office to make sure everyone there was OK.

“I hadn’t sat down two minutes and my phone rang” he said. “It was my dad and he says right away he’s got some bad news; Dora was on one of the planes. He started crying.”

The world shifted at that point for John Menchaca. His sister was dead at 45. The pain that began that day would never really leave.

A year after the attacks he went to a memorial at Amgen and saw the marker that honors her. Five years after the attacks he turned 46 – one year past his older sister’s final age. Ten years after he was going to several memorials for 9/11 victims. Last year because of COVID-19 he stayed at home with his family – something for which he believes she would have advocated.

But 20 years seems like a long time ago and alternately not long ago at all. And for John Menchaca it’s a moment frozen in time thawed by grief and scarred forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,
APH,Amphenol,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvcGNpZS01LXBvd2VyLWNvbm5lY3Rvci1kZWxpdmVycy02MDB3LW5leHQtZ2VuLWdwdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PCIe 5 Power Connector Emerges That Delivers Up To 600W For Next-Gen GPUs,"

Proving once again that there is no such thing as true future-proofing your power supply is about to become obsolete! Okay that might be overstating things. However there really is a new power connector standard on the horizon designed for the shift to PCI Express 5.0 and with it comes the ability to draw up to 600W of power for next-generation GPUs from AMD NVIDIA and Intel (yes don't forget about Intel which is getting into discrete graphics next year).





Whether this gains widespread adoption or not time will tell. But here's what we know. The power connector is a deviation from the typical MicroFit Molex standard. Even though it looks somewhat similar the measurements are different so backwards compatibility goes right out the windows. The key change is the spacing—the connectors measure 3.0mm apart rather than 4.2mm and the entire thing is 18.85mm long.







A company called Amphenol ICC has already posted images and schematics of the new 12VHPWR connector. As you can see in the images up top there are 12 main pins plus another four smaller contacts underneath the primary housing. So that is 16 pins in total up from 12 pins on the updated connector NVIDIA has been pushing on its latest-generation Founders Edition models.







Click to Enlarge (Source: Amphenol ICC)







There are various diagrams to digest but the general breakdown is that each of the power contacts can deliver 9.2 amps resulting in 55.2 amps of juice over the all-important 12V rail. That equates to 662.4 watts though the standard officially supports up to 600W.





This design raises several questions. One of them is what exact purpose those four smaller contacts will serve. We also don't know yet if AMD and NVIDIA will push the 12VHPWR standard on its next-gen GPUs for sure and if so whether it will apply to professional graphics data center GPUs consumer cards for gaming or all three (or a combination of the three).





One thing to bear in mind is that only Intel is embracing PCI 5.0 in the near future. It's a very near future as in Alder Lake and its accompanying Z690 chipset. Rumor has it (by way of leaked documents) that AMD will stick with PCIe 4.0 for another round meaning Zen 4 will not welcome PCIe 5.0 into the fold. Plans can change though so we'll see.





Anyway this new connector could muddy the waters a bit for future builds. It might also encourage GPU makers to play fast and loose with power requirements. We'll see.

A rumor about a new power connector for next-gen GPUs finds its confirmation.

Earlier this week we shared a published an article about the upcoming flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card which is now set to launch in January. The graphics card is supposedly the first card to feature a PCIe Gen5 power connector a new standard that will ultimately solve one of the biggest drawbacks of the current 8-pin power connector an insufficient power it can provide (up to 150W).

Igor Wallossek from Igor’sLAB managed to obtain the schematics and the information on the new connector confirming that there is indeed a new standard coming possibly to all new graphics cards in 2022.

Just as we said the power connector has 16 lanes in total (12 power and 4 signal lanes) but it’s not a MicroFit Molex standard but something entirely new. The standard defined as has smaller spacing than existing connectors a change from 4.2 mm to 3.0 mm. The connector has a width of 18.85 mm so it is not exactly small but much smaller than dual or triple 8-pin connector configuration. This will greatly simplify the circuit and PCB design process not to mention all the space that will be saved.

The PCI-SIG specs define that each pin can sustain up to 9.2A which means a total of 55.2 A at 12V. This gives a maximum power of 662W but the specs officially go up to 600W Igor notes. Along with twelve pins for power there are additional 4 signal lanes right underneath the connector. At this moment it is unclear what is their purpose or whether they are required or optional.

Amphenol ICC Minitek PWR CEM-5 PCIe

Some manufacturers such as Amphenol have already begun listing the specs of the 12VHPWR connector:

Amphenol ICC introduces the Gen 5 Minitek® Pwr PCIe® connector system. This new introduction CEM 5.0 PCI Express® 12VHPWR auxiliary hybrid connector and cable assembly support the 600W GPU cards. The 12VHPWR connector is not designed to mate with legacy PCI Express® 2×3 and 2×4 12V Auxiliary Power connectors. The 12VHPWR connector power pins have a 3.00mm pitch while the contacts in a legacy 2×3 and 2×4 connector lie on a larger 4.20mm pitch. New PCIe® Connector System (CEM5) is designed for power applications with current rating upto 9.5A/pin (12 pins energized) and the 4 signal pins supporting signal transmission. Rated current up to 9.5A per contact with all 12 power contacts and 4 Signal contacts

Fully isolated terminals

Positive locking on housing with low thumb latch operation

Low level contact resistance: 6mΩ max.

What this also means is that NVIDIA’s 12-pin power connector will end up just like Virtual Link no one will use it anymore and it will eventually be phased out. The first card to feature this connector is likely the rumored GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. So far no other card has been rumored to offer this standard.

CULVER CITY Calif. (CNS) -- Apple announced plans Friday for a 500000-square-foot office facility in Culver City that will serve as a regional headquarters for the tech giant's local operations which include Apple TV+ and Apple Music.

The complex will consist of two buildings connected by a shared wall actually straddling Culver City and Los Angeles at National and Venice boulevards adjacent the Metro Expo Line's Culver City Station.

The project is part of a $430 billion expansion plan announced by the company in April. At that time Apple indicated it plans to have more than 3000 employees in Culver City by 2026.

Apple established operations in Culver City in 2014 and currently has more than 1500 employees in the area according to the company.

No timeline was announced for the completion of the new buildings.

According to Apple the facility ""will incorporate environmentally sustainable building features and be powered by 100 percent renewable energy.""

Company officials noted its proximity to the Metro station along with various transit lines and added that Apple will ""be offering shuttle service support for cyclists and other commute alternatives for our teams.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDkvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1lbG9uLW11c2stb3RoZXJzLWJlc3QtbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tc3RldmUtam9icy5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMTAvMDkvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1lbG9uLW11c2stb3RoZXJzLWJlc3QtbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tc3RldmUtam9icy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates Elon Musk and 4 other business leaders on the best lessons they learned from Steve Jobs,"Apple Inc.'s former CEO the late Steve Jobs announces the new iPad on January 27 2010 in San Francisco California.

Ten years ago Steve Jobs died at age 56 after a years-long fight with cancer — an untimely death for one of tech's most influential presences. Collaborators and competitors alike have credited their success to the Apple co-founder from current Apple CEO Tim Cook to Bill Gates and Elon Musk. Even some of today's younger workers whether software engineers or not look to Jobs' creativity and success for inspiration. Here's what six of today's top business minds say they learned from the tech titan:

Bill Gates: He 'mesmerized' a crowd

Bill Gates and Steve Jobs might still be tech's most well-known ""frenemies."" While Microsoft and Apple battled over the span of 30 years Gates and Jobs became friends. After Jobs' death Gates posted on Twitter: ""For those of us lucky enough to get to work with Steve it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely."" Since then Gates has opened up about his jealousy of his self-described rival — particularly when it came to motivation and public speaking. ""He was such a wizard at over-motivating people"" Gates told the Armchair Expert podcast. ""I was a minor wizard so I couldn't fall under his spells — but I could see him casting the spells and then I would look at people and see them mesmerized."" In a September 2019 interview with the Wall Street Journal Gates noted that Jobs always had a natural talent for capturing an audience even while pitching an underwhelming product. ""Steve Jobs was always more of a natural at [public speaking]"" Gates said. ""He could talk about what in the case of NeXT Computer was not that good of a machine yet mesmerize people to death if they happened to be in the auditorium.""

Tim Cook: 'Your mentors may leave you prepared but they can't leave you ready'

Shortly before his death Jobs handed Apple's CEO reins to Tim Cook. But even Cook who spent 14 years learning directly from Jobs says he didn't feel ready to replace his predecessor. In a 2019 graduation address at Stanford University Cook shared a valuable lesson from his mentor: ""Fourteen years ago Steve stood on this stage and told your predecessors: 'Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.' Here's my corollary: 'Your mentors may leave you prepared but they can't leave you ready.'"" Cook described the loneliness he felt after Jobs died saying the experience taught him the critical distinction between being ""prepared"" and being ""ready."" He warned the gradates that when the time came to lead in whatever capacity they wouldn't be ready — and that's OK. ""You're not supposed to be"" Cook said. ""Find the hope in the unexpected. Find the courage in the challenge. Find your vision on the solitary road.""

Meg Whitman: 'Simple can be harder than complex'

Jobs died nine months into Meg Whitman's seven-year tenure as CEO of Hewlett Packard — but clearly left a mark on Whitman's leadership philosophy. Less than a year later Whitman told the Wall Street Journal that she'd be ""taking a cue from Apple."" ""I don't think we [have] kept up with the innovation"" Whitman said. ""The whole market has moved to something that is more beautiful…Apple taught us that design really matters."" Jobs' approach to product design is arguably among his most well-known legacies. ""Simple can be harder than complex"" Jobs told Business Week back in 1998. ""You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there you can move mountains.""

Jony Ive: 'Wanting to learn was far more important than wanting to be right'

At Jobs' funeral longtime Apple chief designer Jony Ive delivered a eulogy referring to Jobs as ""my closest and my most loyal friend."" His greatest memory: how Jobs saw the world. ""He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met"" Ive wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Monday. ""His insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his knowledge or expertise nor was it casual or passive. It was ferocious energetic and restless. His curiosity was practiced with intention and rigor."" This curiosity Ive wrote was vital to Jobs' success especially because other people were often tempted to only explore what they already knew and what felt safe. ""Our curiosity begs that we learn"" said Ive. ""And for Steve wanting to learn was far more important than wanting to be right.""

Elon Musk: 'The ability to attract and motivate great people is critical'

On Monday Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk tweeted out a wish: the chance to speak with Jobs just once. At a Computer History Museum event in 2013 Musk shared that Google co-founder Larry Page once tried to introduce him to Jobs at a party but he got the cold shoulder. ""I did try to talk to him once at a party and he was super rude to me"" Musk joked. ""But I don't think it was me I think it was par for the course."" Musk who is sometimes compared to Jobs for his moonshot visions of the future said in a 2018 interview with Autobild.tv that he long admired Jobs. His ability to grow Apple by attracting top talent and earn employee loyalty is something Musk said he tries to do at Tesla. ""The ability to attract and motivate great people is critical to the success of a company because a company is just a group of people that are assembled to create a product or service"" Musk explained noting that people sometimes forget this ""elementary truth"" of business.

Washington: Nearly a month after Apple announced its Series 7 smartwatch the company has now finally removed the Series 6 Apple watch from its official lineup.As per The Verge for those wanting to buy a brand new Apple Watch from the tech giant they now only have three options: the Series 7 which starts at USD 399; the still-very-good SE which was introduced last year and starts at USD 279; and the years-old Series 3 which starts at USD 199.However there are still a few ways to get a Series 6 and given how many features are shared between the Series 7 and the Series 6 the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if one wants to save some money.Apple's refurbished store has three different Series 6 models for sale right now for example and Amazon is currently offering many refurbished Series 6 watches at a lower price."

The “new normal” dictates business continuity plans include effective remote or hybrid working models and acceleration of digitization automation and virtualisation to cater to the evolving needs of an organisation in an expanding virtual and hybrid environment. Businesses have experienced a profound upheaval in the past few months accentuating the need for innovative and productive work models. In these challenging times organizations and business leaders have looked to human resource leaders to help them perform with agility and scalability.

Keeping up with the changing times effective HR leaders have ensured timely transitions by reimagining the basic tenets of the organization with a focus on purpose value and culture. There has been a reshaping of HR functions with the integration of technology such as automating workforce analytics which leads to insights on employee work hours performance management talent acquisition and a host of other factors.

Rethinking the role of HR: The Digital HR

Darwinbox’s report on the ‘State of HR Technology in the post Covid workplace’ revealed that only 17% of the organizations were prepared to handle remote work prior to the pandemic while another 60% had taken or planned to take measures to cater to remote working needs. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a litmus test for HR to support business continuity by bringing overnight changes in company policies to align with the needs of the moment.

This has been further facilitated by the integration of technology in the core aspects of HR activities for smooth execution of operations. The role of HR from talent acquisition to employee engagement underwent a massive change prompting organizations to focus more on productivity and skills through digitized mediums. Interestingly 43% of the organizations in Darwinbox’s research either introduced or upgraded their digital onboarding process since the pandemic started. Some organizations are also working in the area of video interviews with cognitive intelligence speech and sentiment analysis.

To avoid the pitfalls of remote work communication between leaders and teams paves the path for social cohesion. Approaches introduced by HR leaders such as virtual coffee rooms online social events and virtual learning sessions conducted on collaborative technology platforms have enhanced the connection between employees and their leaders in the remote office environment.

Recreating the future office

The evolution of technology in the workplace is a constant process. Resetting work trends requires HR leaders to rethink the application of technology and equip employees with the right tools to be successful at work while ensuring their emotional and physical well-being.

Today human-centric technologies seem to be one of the key drivers in ensuring business continuity and employee efficiency. Cloud native HR-technology solutions are likely to be adopted by some organizations as part of the future workplace. The transformation will build the right bridges within the HR function with the end goal of optimization across processes and divisions in this hyper-connected age. While HR leaders have left no stone unturned in helping employees cope with a rapidly changing work environment technology has played an equally important role in enhancing employees’ overall work experience and well-being over the course of the last year and a half.

HR professionals the world over have embraced new technologies and are more tech savvy today than ever before. However we do need to remember that building a constantly improving work culture requires not just the adoption of technology but also flexible and agile work environments to keep pace with the demands of the pandemic/post-pandemic world.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ADM,Archer-Daniels-Midland,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkLWdyYWluLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xNTgyMS1hZG0tcmVjZWl2ZXMtZ3JhbnQtZm9yLWJpb2Z1ZWxzLXJlc2VhcmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ADM receives grant for biofuels research,"DECATUR ILLINOIS US — Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) will receive a $3.4 million grant from the US Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office for biofuels research.

The goal of the research is to improve the availability of data that will support bioprocessing separations development as well as to develop supporting technologies to improve bioprocessing separations.

Researchers are looking to produce isobutanol as a precursor for sustainable aviation fuel using waste pea starch from the production of alternative proteins as the biomass feedstock.

This award is one of 22 nationwide totaling $64.7 million in an effort to develop technologies and processes that produce low-cost low-carbon biofuels for heavy-duty forms of transportation like airplanes and ships.

“Biofuels are a critical component of our nation’s energy portfolio and our agriculture economy” said US Representative Rodney Davis who announced the grant. “They help reduce emissions while promoting American energy independence. This DOE grant will assist ADM and others in developing new innovations in the biofuels sector. I look forward to watching ADM utilize this grant and continuing to partner with industry stakeholders to further promote the production and use of biofuels.”

Todd Werpy senior vice president and chief science officer at ADM added “ADM is on the cutting edge of new research and technologies to accelerate more sustainable and cost-effective production of biosolutions. “This project will help continue to advance our innovative work and expand the frontier of responsible plant-based products that consumers are increasingly using every single day.”

Jennifer Granholm Secretary of Energy said “Decarbonizing transportation is an essential part of the path to a net-zero carbon future. While electrification of smaller vehicles is gaining momentum larger vehicles like planes will still rely on liquid fuels for the near future. This investment will accelerate the deployment of bioenergy technologies and mobilize public clean energy investment in the biofuels chemical and agricultural industries which can lead to new good-paying jobs across the bioenergy supply chain and increased investment in rural economies.”

It marks the first time in the private company’s 170-year history that it will operate with ownership outside the family. LDC announced its intention to sell the equity stake to ADQ last November.

“The transaction completed today represents the start of a new chapter for LDC as we welcome ADQ into our shareholder group and initiate a new phase of growth for the company guided by a shared vision for LDC’s future” said Margarita Louis-Dreyfus chairperson of the company’s supervisory board.

LDC said it remains focused on putting its strategy into action while fulfilling its key role to keep essential agricultural product supply chains moving safely reliably and responsibly. It said a portion of the transaction proceeds has been invested into LDC in the form of an early and full repayment of a $1.05 billion intragroup long-term loan granted by LDC to its parent company originally maturing in 2023.

These funds will support the pursuit of the company’s long-term business plan and strategy.

“This partnership with ADQ reinforces LDC’s position and financial strength to accelerate strategic investments as part of our growth plans and ambitions including in new areas such as plant-based proteins as well as in projects to move further downstream in several of our existing business lines” said Michael Gelchie group chief executive officer of LDC. “I look forward to continuing to work alongside the supervisory board to advance our shared ambitions for investment in innovations and technologies that can transform food and agricultural production sustainably building on LDC’s leading position in core merchandizing activities and strong performance in 2020.”

The transaction price was not disclosed but the companies in November said a minimum of $800 million will be invested into LDC.

ADQ’s broad portfolio of major enterprises spans multiple sectors among them food and agriculture. As part of its strategy for the sector the company seeks to generate financial returns and strengthen the economic cluster in the UAE.

Louis Dreyfus is one of the so-called “ABCD” quartet of the world’s leading commodity trading houses along with US-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. Bunge Ltd. and Cargill.

""And I don't mean go out there and try to get 40 or 35 but be really locked in and be in the moment and that's what I'm trying to do every single time we get together right now. Because these moments don't come very often.""

Taurasi had another stellar outing on Friday with 24 points on 50% shooting as the Mercury topped the Aces 87-84 and advanced to the Finals. Hours later her wife Penny Taylor gave birth to their second child.

""At 4:24 am baby GOAT #2 arrived"" the Phoenix Mercury wrote Saturday morning on Twitter. ""Congratulations to Dee and Penny on the birth of their beautiful healthy baby girl. #FamilyOf4TheValley""

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

""La peine de mort est abolie"" dit l'article 1 de la loi du 9 octobre 1981. Portée par le ministre de la Justice de l'époque Robert Badinter la promulgation de cette loi il y a aujourd'hui quarante ans jour pour jour est un événement historique majeur en France.

""Demain grâce à vous la justice française ne sera plus une justice qui tue"" avait lancé le garde des Sceaux plaidant devant les parlementaires. ""Demain les pages sanglantes de notre justice seront tournées"".

Mais quarante ans après la France semble avoir encore un peu de mal à clore ce chapitre. Dernièrement c'est le polémiste Éric Zemmour qui a évoqué la possibilité du retour de la peine capitale en se disant ""philosophiquement"" favorable à son rétablissement et en assurant qu'une ""majorité de Français"" l'était aussi.

Le retour de la peine de mort faisait également partie du programme du FN (aujourd'hui RN) jusqu'en 2012. Et si le terme ""peine de mort"" n'apparaissait plus dans les propositions de Marine Le Pen en 2017 elle avait expliqué laisser la possibilité aux Français de faire un référendum d'initiative populaire à ce sujet.

Une opinion divisée

Dans les derniers sondages parmi ceux qui se prononcent en faveur de la peine de mort on retrouve une forte majorité de personnes de droite et surtout d'extrême droite. Selon la dernière enquête d'Ispos datée d'août 2021 80% des personnes se déclarant proches du RN étaient ainsi favorables à son rétablissement contre 29% pour les sympathisants de La France Insoumise.

Ce sujet ""est en effet un marqueur politique fort de la droite et en particulier de l'extrême droite mais cela ne veut pas dire que tous les militants y sont favorables ni que ceux de gauche y sont forcément défavorables"" souligne auprès de BFMTV.com Nicolas Picard historien et auteur de Le Châtiment suprême.

Globalement ces dernières années les Français apparaissent très divisés sur la question: les enquêtes d'opinion donnant à chaque fois autour de 50% de pro et 50% d'anti peine capitale avec quelques oscillations d'une année sur l'autre.

""Nous sommes ici dans la psychologie des foules"" analyse pour BFMTV.com Jean-Yves Le Naour historien et auteur de Histoire de l’abolition de la peine de mort. Deux cents ans de combat. ""La peine de mort depuis ses origines vise à rétablir un ordre qui a été troublé par le crime. La peur et la colère envahit le corps social et la mort du criminel en compensation vient soulager l'angoisse collective.""

Rétablir ""l'ordre du monde et la sécurité""

Dans les sondages on note ainsi une forte augmentation des personnes favorables à sa remise en place en 2015 après les attentats qui ont frappé la France. ""Si vous posez la question après un crime horrible les réponses vont évidemment être différentes"" note Anne Denis responsable de la commission sur l'abolition de la peine de mort pour Amnesty International France. ""L'opinion publique réagit aux crimes violents avec de la violence"".

Elle ""est attachée à la mort car elle y voit une vengeance cela apaise son courroux cela lui donne l'illusion qu'elle est en sécurité"" estime Jean-Yves Le Naour. Mais il s'agit pour lui ""d'un réflexe archaïque de sacrifice pour rétablir faussement l'ordre du monde et la sécurité"".

Or ""il n’existe aucune preuve crédible que la peine de mort soit plus dissuasive qu’une peine d’emprisonnement"" explique Amnesty International. On tuait par le passé pour ""le vol même d'un mouchoir par une domestique l'homosexualité l'abattage d'un arbre dans une forêt appartenant au roi etc.. 115 cas relèvent de la peine de mort avant 1789"" rappelle Jean-Yves Le Naour. ""Et ces sociétés étaient extrêmement violentes et criminogènes"".

Et aujourd'hui? ""Dans les pays qui ont interdit la peine de mort les chiffres relatifs à la criminalité n’ont pas augmenté. Dans certains cas ils ont même baissé"" selon Amnesty International. ""Au Canada le nombre d’homicides en 2008 était inférieur de moitié à celui de 1976 lorsque la peine de mort y a été abolie.""

""La volonté que les coupables souffrent""

Nicolas Picard explique que cette volonté de plus de fermeté vient en partie du fait que notre société actuellement ""supporte de moins en moins les atteintes aux personnes"". Il donne l'exemple des ""atteintes sexuelles considérées aujourd'hui comme gravissimes"" ce qui n'était pas le cas ""pendant la majeure partie du XXe siècle"". Avec la peine de mort ""il y a la volonté que les coupables souffrent de façon proportionnelle à ce qu'ils ont pu faire aux victimes"".

L'évolution du jugement à ce sujet s'accompagne de ce que l'historien appelle un ""'populisme pénal' qui se développe depuis les années 1970 avec une accélération dans les années 2000 (notamment lors des années Nicolas Sarkozy) qui réclame des peines plus fortes plus longues pour réprimer la violence"".

Il note également ""une promotion importante de la figure de la victime"" dans les tribunaux depuis les années 1970. Elles ont obtenu plus de place et prennent davantage la parole parfois pour ""dénoncer les insuffisances de la justice"". ""Cela a pu être utilisé pour aggraver la répression de certains crimes insuffisamment considérés mais aussi pour réclamer des peines plus fortes"" explique-t-il.

En ce sens la question de la peine de mort et de sa remise en place s'apparente davantage aujourd'hui pour lui à ""un marqueur autoritaire pour évaluer la demande de sécurité de la population"" qu'à une véritable volonté du retour de la guillotine.

Les Français ""ne savent plus ce que c'est de vivre dans un pays"" avec la peine de mort

D'autant que 40 ans après certaines générations de Français n'ont jamais connu la peine de mort. ""Ils ne savent pas ou plus ce que c'est de vivre dans un pays où on tue des condamnés"" note Anne Denis. Si les ""sondages permettent de voir l'évolution des réponses à une même question des années 1970 à aujourd'hui le contexte n'est plus du tout le même"" abonde Nicolas Picard.

Pour Jean-Yves Le Naour les enquêtes d'opinion n'ont de toute façon que peu de valeur pour la peine de mort car ""il s'agit d'une réponse à une question posée au téléphone par mail ou encore dans la rue"". ""Elle ne nous engage pas. On y répond vite et on passe son chemin"". Le ""vrai sondage"" selon lui ""c'est celui des jurys populaires des assises qui jugeaient les criminels au temps de la peine de mort"".

La dernière personne condamnée à mort en France a été exécutée le 10 septembre 1977 et dans les 20 années précédant l'abolition on compte 17 condamnés à mort sur plusieurs milliers d'affaires pouvant la réclamer explique l'historien.

""Être juré ce n'est pas être sondé c'est écouter toute une histoire avoir un homme en vie devant soi et selon sa décision lui ôter la vie et rester seul avec cette sentence"" analyse-t-il.

""Pas de retour en arrière"" possible

Pour Nicolas Picard si la question de la peine de mort ressurgit de temps à autres elle reste un sujet secondaire dans notre société. Et Anne Denis rappelle que de toute façon cette sentence ne peut en réalité pas être remise en place dans notre pays.

Outre l'inscription de cette interdiction dans la Constitution en 2007 la France a signé plusieurs traités internationaux qui interdisent la peine de mort comme les protocoles 6 (en 1983) et 13 (en 2007) de la Convention européenne des droits de l'Homme (CEDH) qui proscrivent la peine de mort. Or ""ces deux protocoles additionnels ne comportent pas de clauses permettant un retrait de la Convention"" explique Amnesty International. Décider de ne plus les respecter reviendrait ""probablement"" à ce que la France quitte la CEDH entrainant une fracture très forte au niveau européen.

Certes dans les faits la France pourrait briser les traités auxquels elle est raccordée ce ne serait pas une première dans l'histoire des accords internationaux. En revanche cela signifierait qu'elle ""se retirerait de toutes les instances internationales"" explique Anne Denis alors que l'on sait que la France ""a besoin de la communauté internationale sur plusieurs niveaux le coût diplomatique serait bien trop fort"".

Robert Badinter lui-même en est convaincu: dans une récente interview à Libération il jugeait que ""la peine de mort en France c'est fini"" et ce ""comme dans toutes les démocraties européennes.""

Pétanque: le maintien en jeu pour la PSG,"Très bon résultat obtenu par l’équipe vétérans lors de la dernière journée du championnat régional des clubs (CRC) chez les voisins de Lécussan assurant le maintien du club pour la saison.

En effet les protégés des présidents Guy Guezello et Daniel Népos se sont retrouvés très tôt au boulodrome Jean Carlotti pour un court débriefing et une belle séance de motivation. Classés sixième sur huit clubs pour cause de mauvais goal-average l’équipe se devait de gagner au minimum l’équipe de Valence d’Agen dès le matin pour espérer se maintenir et ce fut fait de belle manière. Mais pour éviter de calculer avec les résultats des autres équipes il fallait gagner aussi l’après-midi face au club de Sainte Christie très bien classé. Grâce à un esprit d’équipe exemplaire le coaching effectué avec tact par le sélectionneur Guy Guezello la formation a relevé le défi avec panache : 4 tête à tête 2 doublettes et 1 triplette ont été gagnés.

Le club se classe troisième et est ainsi assuré de se maintenir dans cette catégorie très relevée. Superbe journée où l’on a retrouvé avec beaucoup de plaisir les vraies valeurs d’une équipe où le plus important n’est pas toujours la pure valeur technique.

Ne vous arrêtez pas ». Sur le bord du terrain ce mardi 5 octobre Garance Robine n’a pas besoin d’élever la voix pour se faire entendre. Face à la dizaine de joueuses de la section collège du Stade Briochin  la coache est dans son élément. Garance qui entraîne depuis trois ans et demi n’a pourtant que 20 ans.

« C’est arrivé un peu par hasard » raconte celle qui a commencé le foot à 13 ans à Plérin avant de rejoindre le club phare de Saint-Brieuc trois ans plus tard. « L’année de mon arrivée je me suis blessée. Comme je ne pouvais pas m’entraîner on m’a proposé de donner un coup de main pour coacher les petites de 10 ans ».

Arrivée au club à 16 ans Garance Robine voit le Stade Briochin comme « une grande famille ». Ce qui lui a donné envie de s’investir au quotidien. (Le Télégramme/Julien Molla)

« Envie de me rendre utile »

L’expérience est courte mais Garance qui fait partie des quatre coaches femmes du club accroche de suite. « Au début l’autorité ce n’était pas facile. Mais ça c’était vraiment très bien passé ». De quoi pousser la jeune joueuse à se lancer dans la foulée dans une formation d’animatrice fédérale.

C'est un séisme dans la vie politique tchèque. L'alliance de centre-droit Ensemble a remporté de justesse samedi 9 octobre les élections législatives face au Premier ministre populiste milliardaire Andrej Babis selon des résultats presque complets.

Les résultats partiels publiés par le site officiel électoral donnaient Andrej Babis confortablement en tête conformément aux sondages mais l'écart a fondu et le résultat a basculé au fur et à mesure que les bulletins de vote des grandes villes étaient décomptés.

Après le dépouillement de plus de 999 % des votes l'alliance Ensemble regroupant le Parti démocratique civique de droite TOP 09 (centre-droit) et l'Union chrétienne démocrate (centre) a obtenu 2778 % des voix lui assurant 71 sièges. Elle devance le mouvement populiste ANO de Andrej Babis qui a recueilli 2714 % et obtiendrait 72 sièges.

Ensemble dont le chef de file s'est positionné immédiatement pour former le prochain gouvernement disposerait d'une majorité 108 siège au Parlement (qui compte 200 élus) s'il forme une coalition plus large avec le Parti pirate anti-système et le mouvement centriste des Maires et indépendants (STAN).

""Il semble que les deux coalitions démocratiques parviendront à obtenir une majorité parlementaire ce qui signifie très probablement que Babis devra partir"" a déclaré Otto Eibl directeur du département des sciences politiques de l'université Masaryk de Brno.

Un quatrième parti siègera au Parlement le mouvement d'extrême droite et anti-musulman Liberté et démocratie directe (SPD) dirigé par l'homme d'affaires Tomio Okamura né à Tokyo qui a obtenu près de 10 % des voix et devrait pouvoir compter sur 20 élus.

Le taux de participation a atteint plus de 65 % contre 6084 % lors des précédentes élections législatives en 2017.

Andrej Babis 67 ans a fait fortune dans l'agroalimentaire la chimie et les médias. Il est accusé de fraude présumée aux subventions européennes et l'Union européenne lui reproche un conflit d'intérêts entre ses rôles d'homme d'affaires et d'homme politique.

L'enquête internationale Pandora Papers publiée le 2 octobre a révélé qu'il avait utilisé l'argent de ses sociétés offshore pour financer l'achat de propriétés dans le sud de la France en 2009 dont un château. Andrej Babis a rejeté toutes ces allégations criant à la diffamation.

Selon Otto Eibl les révélations des Pandora Papers n'ont pas particulièrement pesé dans le vote : ""Il y a eu tellement d'affaires de corruption que beaucoup d'électeurs y sont devenus insensibles"" dit-il.

Andrej Babis préside actuellement un gouvernement minoritaire avec les sociaux-démocrates tacitement soutenu par le Parti communiste qui avait dirigé l'ancienne Tchécoslovaquie totalitaire de 1948 à 1989.

Les communistes exclus du Parlement

Avec un score de 36 % les communistes n'ont pas franchi samedi la barre des 5 % et seront exclus du Parlement pour la première fois depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale.

""C'est une grande chose enfin !"" a commenté auprès à l'AFP Alexandr Vondra membre du Parlement européen dissident anticommuniste dans les années 1980.

""Mais c'est aussi la fin d'Andrej et c'est encore plus grand"" a ajouté Alexandr Vondra un proche collaborateur de l'ancien président tchèque Vaclav Havel.

Constitutionnellement c'est au président pro-russe Milos Zeman qu'il revient de désigner le nouveau Premier ministre. Avant le scrutin il avait laissé entendre qu'il choisirait Andrej Babis son ancien allié.

Malade le président Zeman a été contraint à voter de chez lui mais son entourage a indiqué samedi qu'il rencontrerait Andrej Babis pour des entretiens dimanche matin.

""Nous verrons ce que le président dira"" a déclaré le Premier ministre sortant. ""Je suis un manager ma place est au gouvernement"" a-t-il insisté devant les journalistes.

Mais le président de l'alliance Ensemble Petr Fiala a de son côté déclaré sous les ovations que son mandat pour former le prochain gouvernement était ""fort"". ""Le président devra en tenir compte"" a-t-il insisté.

Djokovic the world No 1 had signed a cap and then a sheet of paper as he headed for the exit when a metal bottle fell onto his head.

Djokovic was clearly in a lot of distress as he fell to the floor and he stayed on the ground for more than 30 seconds before being escorted out by ground staff.

Initially it was thought that the bottle might have been thrown deliberately because footage of the incident obscured where the bottle had come from.

However video shows the bottle slipping out of a spectactor’s backpack as they bend over to attempt to get the attention of the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

New angle all clear now Novak is fine 👇 pic.twitter.com/LWhhpTN0DY — Saša Ozmo (@ozmo_sasa) May 10 2024

Djokovic’s post-match press conference was cancelled but the tournament issued a statement saying: “Novak Djokovic on leaving the Central court at the end of his match was hit on the head by a water bottle while signing autographs to spectators.

“He underwent appropriate medication and has already left the Foro Italico to return to his hotel; his condition is not a cause for concern.”

Djokovic later issued a statement of his own on X. “Thank you for the messages of concern” he said.

“This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday.”

Djokovic has won the Italian Open six times and it will be his final warm-up event before he attempts to win his first Grand Slam title of the year at Roland Garros in Paris.

He is currently scheduled to play Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo in the third round on Sunday.

Jeff Bezos amassed his wealth through Amazon stocks and owns hundreds of millions of dollars worth of real estate but one of his most valuable possessions may surprise you: art. Among his collection is the renowned piece ""Hurting the Word Radio #2 (1964)"" by Ed Ruscha purchased by Bezos for almost $53 million. This artwork a prime example of Ruscha’s text-based paintings stands as a signature piece in Bezos’ collection.

As concerns over stock market volatility persist the world’s wealthiest individuals including not only Bezos but media mogul Oprah Winfrey and acclaimed actor Leonardo DiCaprio are increasingly turning to art as a strategic investment avenue. Art investment often viewed as exclusive to the ultrawealthy offers a unique combination of cultural prestige and financial resilience. It has demonstrated remarkable stability serving as a hedge against economic downturns inflation and currency devaluation.

What Makes Art Appealing to Billionaire Investors?

Art investment holds a strong appeal for billionaires due to several critical factors:

Wealth Preservation: Art as demonstrated by the works of iconic artists such as Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat embodies enduring value providing a dependable means of safeguarding wealth across generations. Diversification: Unlike conventional financial assets art frequently operates independently of stock markets. This independence offers stability during times of market turbulence making art an attractive component of diversified investment portfolios. Privacy: The discretion of the art market enables investors to execute transactions without the public disclosure requirements associated with securities trading. This confidentiality adds an extra layer of privacy to their financial activities appealing to those who value discretion in their investment strategies.

Can Individual Investors See The Same Returns As The Ultra-Wealthy?

According to the UBS Billionaires Report 2022 30% of billionaires possess art collections averaging $300 million in value. Despite these impressive figures many wonder why more people don’t invest in art.

The reality is that most individuals lack the financial means to invest in art on such a scale. However platforms like Masterworks are changing that. Masterworks an award-winning platform facilitates investment in multimillion-dollar paintings by renowned artists like Banksy and Picasso.

Pokémon adventures are often steeped in the atmosphere of the great outdoors whether you’re watching Ash wander from region to region as he tries to catch ‘em all or doing the same in one of the video game installments. But what if you want to make your own personal indoors a little greater with Pokémon flourishes?

Then you’ll be happy to know that the Pokémon franchise is teaming up with Japanese furniture and interior furnishings company Karimoku for a new lineup to Poké-fy both your bedroom and living room.

Making the collection especially appealing is that to the untrained eye at first glance they might look like abstract patterns. Fellow fans though will quickly be able to spot Gengar and other Ghost-type Pokémon on the curtains sheets and floor mat here.

Too spooky for you? You’ll also be able to choose patterns with Pikachu Eevee starter Pokémon or the Poké Ball emblem and both blackout and lace curtains are on offer.

Moving into the living room there’s more adorable subtlety with…

…the Pikachu sofa! From far away it gives the impression of being just a bright fabric with something like a houndstooth pattern but in reality…

…that’s the franchise’s Electric-type mascot en masse almost like they’re gathering for a Pikachu Outbreak inside your home.

In addition to the two-seater sofa model there’s also a one-person easy chair. Either pairs nicely with the round Poké Ball side table and if you’d like to leave no ambiguity as to the inspiration for your décor the gigantic Snorlax rug will instantly grab the attention of anyone who walks into the room.

To be clear these aren’t kiddie playroom supplies but genuine for-adults furnishings and are priced accordingly at 199100 yen (US$1825) for the Pikachu sofa 154000 for the chair 111100 for the side table and 44000 for the Snorlax carpet. That does get you a level quality that should let you use them all for years to come though meaning you’ll be able to come home and relax on them after making the trip to Universal Studios Japan’s future Pokémon attractions and events.

The lineup goes on sale October 14 through the Pokémon Center Online store and the sofa and side table will also be on display at the Pokémon Center Mega Tokyo superstore in Toky’ Ikebukuro neighborhood from October 14 to November 14.

In many cases over the last 40 years Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (today PARC) has been that hidden player inventing many of today's ubiquitous technologies or refining them from abstract concepts.

Launched as a development arm of Xerox Corporation in 1970 PARC has played an instrumental role in the engineering of laser printing and many of the technologies that compose the personal computer – most famously the graphical user interface (GUI) used in the Xerox 8010 Star Information System in 1981 followed by the Apple Lisa. The team included many of the world's top computer scientists not least of which were former employees of the Stanford Research Institute.

Despite its vast industry contributions the group has been criticized for failing to capitalize on its many innovations. While some of our older readers might be familiar with the prolific Palo Alto Research Center we think its accomplishments have largely escaped the younger tech crowd. We'd like to take a few and give credit where credit's due.



Ethernet and Internetworking The networking platform that ships with virtually every modern computer was born at PARC around 1973 with Robert Metcalfe and three of his colleagues credited as inventors. An early experimental version of Ethernet ran at 2.94Mb/s and was outlined in a 1976 paper co-authored by Metcalfe called ""Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks"" (PDF). In 1979 Metcalfe convinced Xerox Intel and Digital Equipment Corporation to promote 10Mb/s Ethernet through the ""DIX"" standard. Early Ethernet used coaxial cables but they were eventually ditched in favor of twisted pair and fiber optic cables. Countless other networking-related advancements unfolded during the creation and improvement of Ethernet including the PARC Universal Packet (PUP) an internetworking protocol suite that influenced the early work of TCP/IP and served as the cornerstone of Xerox's later XNS protocols. Moreover PUP was a core component of PARC's prophetic ""office of the future"" concept (check out this early ad).

Ball and Optical Mouse It's debatable who developed the first mouse but it wasn't PARC. Yeah yeah that's supposed to be the theme of this article but read on. A mouse-like bowling ball contraption was created as a secret military project in 1952 while Stanford's Douglas Engelbart independently produced a wheel mouse in the early 60s. Only weeks before Engelbart planned to demonstrate his device in 1968 the German company Telefunken revealed a ball mouse – though it barely resembles modern designs. Bill English who assisted Engelbart with his original concept later built the ""Alto"" ball mouse we're more familiar with while working for Xerox PARC in 1972. Its rectangular shape button placement and top-protruding wire set the standard we still follow today. The device was created for PARC's early ""Alto"" machine which was arguably the first modern personal computer with a mouse-driven GUI but it never hit the retail market. PARC's Richard Lyon went on to build the first optical mouse in 1981.

GUI and WYSIWYG Having a point-and-click interface is useless if you can't well point and click. PARC had to pioneer much of the graphical environment we take for granted all the way down to coining the ""desktop"" metaphor (conceptually speaking Engelbart beat PARC here too). The group's early GUI featured icons pop-up menus check boxes and overlapping windows controlled with a mouse. That opened the door for some innovative software including many of the first WYSIWYG applications – a luxury in those days to say the least. Among those new applications was Bravo the first WYSIWYG word processor (laid the foundation for MS Word). PARC also developed the first WYSIWYG integrated circuit editor the Sil vector graphics editor the Markup bitmap editor (a paint program) as well as programming languages like Interlisp InterPress and Smalltalk – the latter of which influenced C++ Objective C CLOS Java and more. By the late 70s PARC invented linguistic technologies for spell-checking and created one of the first networked multiplayer games Alto Trek.

First Laser Printer Invented by Gary Starkweather at Xerox's Webster research center in 1969 the first laser printer prototype was fabricated by modifying a xerographic copier. Although it was technically birthed just ahead of PARC's founding Starkweather collaborated with the Palo Alto team over the following couple years to refine his original design. The first commercial unit was introduced in 1975 (the IBM 3800) but it wasn't until 1981 that the market received its first office-bound laser printer the $17000 Xerox Star 8010. HP's 71lb LaserJet hit the mainstream market in 1984 and printed at a whopping 300dpi/8ppm. It was quickly followed by competing devices from Brother IBM Apple and others but even the early ""consumer"" implementations were incredibly expensive by modern standards. The LaserJet sold for $3500 – equal to roughly $8500 today. Laser printing grew into a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox easily funding all of its other projects.

The Personal Computer Many of the above technologies were present in PARC's experimental Alto computer but that system wasn't meant for prime time and was used mostly internally through the 70s. The Alto was greatly refined and commercialized in 1981 when Xerox shipped its first office workstation known as the Xerox Star or the Xerox 8010 Information System. Intended to realize Xerox's ""office of the future"" vision it was marketed as part of a complete ""personal office system"" that included other workstations and file/print servers. The Star itself sold for $16000 but Xerox's full office setup cost more than $50000. Not only was it expensive but it was an entirely closed system which meant all the hardware and software had to be built by Xerox. Only about 25000 units were sold and many consider the Xerox Star a commercial failure. Others argue that it was simply ahead of its time. A few years later Apple launched the Macintosh which borrowed many concepts from PARC and is considered the first commercially successful GUI/mouse-equipped PC.

Thinking Beyond the PC Not only was Xerox's Palo Alto group ahead of the curve with personal computers but it envisioned an era beyond the traditional PC nearly 30 years ago. PARC coined the term ""ubiquitous computing"" in 1988 to outline a future where technology would recede into the background of our lives and people would use mobile devices to seamlessly access resources and control environments. Sound familiar at all? PARC developed some of the earliest functional examples of the ""pads"" and ""tabs"" that flood today's computing scene. The PARCTab prototype was built in 1991 and measured 9x11x1 inches weighed five pounds had a Motorola processor 4MB of RAM a pen interface a keyboard and an integrated mic. It also had near-field communication tech a.k.a NFC which is widely used today. A similar device called the PARCTab was a palm-sized computer that allowed researchers to access the Internet read their email check the weather and many other basic handset functions. Further back PARC's Alan Kay described the ""Dynabook"" in 1972.

Other Advancements With so many bright minds exploring seemingly every facet of computing there's no way we can list all their achievements. Along with everything above the group also created or greatly contributed to: Amorphous silicon (used across various technologies including LCD backplanes).

High-power laser tech that is the backbone of our telecommunications network.

The computer worm (created while experimenting with distributed computations).

Non-erasable magneto-optical storage technologies (commercialized via Optimem).

A 16-bit coding system that lead to the ISO/IEC 10646 and the Unicode standard.

LambdaMOO one of the oldest standing real-time multi-user Web environments.

The IPv6 and HTTP-NG protocols that govern and define how the Internet works.

Xerox PARC Today

Although PARC may never become a household name there's no denying that it's been a driving force in the computing industry for decades. When it was originally established the research body was tasked with designing an ""office of the future."" By all accounts it accomplished that mission and more.

The division was spun off in 2002 but remains an independent subsidiary of Xerox. Many former PARC employees have formed their own companies including Adobe 3Com (bought by HP in 2010) and Spectra Diode. Also three of its eminent researchers are Turing Award winners the ""Nobel Prize of computing.""

PARC continues to tinker with bleeding edge technology from artificial intelligence (AI) and human-machine collaboration to Internet of Things digital manufacturing and the digital workplace.

Who is going to win the 2021 Bank of America Roval 400?

Odds provided by Tipico Sportsbook; access USA TODAY Sports’ betting odds for a full list. Lines last updated at 9:10 a.m. ET.

ELLIOTT (+220) is worth a play for the chance to double up. He has dominated on this setup winning the last two stops at the Roval. There is no reason not to like him here.

ALEX BOWMAN (+2000) is worth a roll of the dice at this price based upon his tremendous showings in the past. While he hasn’t won he has a runner-up finish and has never been worse than eighth.

In addition play BOWMAN TOP 10 FINISH (-120) for a much stronger value.

Stewart-Haas Racing driver KEVIN HARVICK (+2000) is on the bubble for the playoffs entering the weekend nine points back of the eighth spot. He’ll be racing with urgency and has finished third ninth and 11th in his previous three stops at the track. I really like HARVICK TOP 5 FINISH (+320) for a chance to more than triple up.

CHRISTOPHER BELL TOP 5 FINISH (+210) is another driver who is on the bubble heading into the weekend and in need of a strong finish. He isn’t a great play for the straight-up win but for a Top 5 finish he’s a nice play for a chance to more than double up your initial stake.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vMTAxNjI5Ny9qb2NoZW9uLXlva2phbmctYmF0aC1hdGVsaWVyLWl0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jocheon Yokjang Bath / Atelier ITCH,"+ 24

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

WORCESTER MA — Sally Baxter Day 96 passed away peacefully at the Knollwood Nursing Center in Worcester on October 1 2021 after a long and fulfilling life as a daughter wife mother and community leader. Sally was born in Worcester in 1925 to parents John Ross and Olive (Schiller) Baxter. Her father's occupation as equipment installer for New England Bell Telephone necessitated frequent relocation of the Baxter household and required young Sally to adjust to no less than 25 different schools before graduation. Not long out of North High School in Worcester in November 1943 Sally married Warren Southwick Day also of Worcester who had begun training as a U.S. Navy aviator.

Sally was predeceased by an infant brother her parents a son and her husband of 45 years. She leaves sons Steven of Yarmouth Port MA Stuart (Alison Bevin) of Worcester Spencer (Lois Brown) of Milton MA Kenneth (Diana) of Worcester and daughter Elizabeth (Jim Buss) of Middleton WI. Sally's third-born son Clifford passed away in 1981 as a result of Agent Orange exposure during Naval service in Vietnam. Sally also leaves grandchildren Benjamin (Flavia Castelino) of Brookline MA Matthew (Megan Wilson) of Portland ME Tyler of Milton MA Lowell (Margaret) of Worcester Laura (Alex Gadberry) of Los Angeles CA Kimberly (Tim Loftus) of Somerville MA Alan (Emily) of West Brookfield MA and Tristan Buss of Middleton WI. Additionally she leaves great-grandsons Callum and Phineas of Portland ME and great-granddaughter Louise of Brookline MA.

In 1946 Sally joined Tatnuck Congregational Church in Worcester (now known as First Congregational) where she served in many capacities including: choir member Sunday school teacher Deacon and Trustee; Mission Committee Chair and President of Women's Fellowship; and for many years chairman of its annual church fairs. Sally also served in a regional capacity as President of the Worcester District Women's Fellowship a member of the State Board of Women's Fellowships and of the Nurture and Fellowship Committee of the Worcester District United Church of Christ. She also was a 20-year member of the Worcester YWCA and past President of its Nereids Swim Club.

Truly her life's passion after her family and church Sally was an active member of Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) for 80 years. She served 47 of those years as a troop leader for girls of every age level but mostly as an Advisor to high school age Senior scouts. She took her troops overseas to visit British Girl Guides who then came to the US to be hosted by her Girl Scouts. She shepherded her Senior scouts through nine countries and two International Centers for Scouts and Guides in London England and Adelboden Switzerland. Upon retiring from troop leadership Sally served as a trainer of GSUSA leaders for 25 years and was the recipient of many awards including the ""Thanks Badge"": the highest award conferred in adult scouting. She also served on the Board of Directors of the Montachusett Girl Scout Council and on the History Committee that curated memorabilia and created the council's Girl Scout Museum. Sally finished off her career as an inaugural member of Alumnae Adult Troop 2016 supporting local programming council initiatives and the growth of Girl Scouting in Central and Western MA.

Sally was especially proud of the many lives she touched through Girl Scouting having been instrumental in turning more than a few young women toward more positive futures than the trajectories on which they had begun their lives. ""Mrs. Day"" continued to receive frequent calls visits and correspondence from her grateful former scouts and scouting associates right up until her passing. For the love and attention she received from all those she touched in this part of her life along with those in her church family her children are indebted and extremely thankful.

Sally's family would also like to thank the Briarwood community where she resided for almost 16 years her wonderful caregivers at the Elms and JHC Home Hospice.

A memorial service and celebration of Sally Day's life will be held at a later date to be announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2005 India’s mass immunisation programme has used only auto-disable syringes whose safety locks break off after a single use ensuring they are not reused. Conventional disposable syringes on the other hand can be reused posing a risk of infection.

In their letters the manufacturers noted that India lacked the capacity to produce the volume of auto-disable syringes required for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. Later in January the health ministry invited them for a meeting.

“But nothing happened beyond that” said Deepak Arora the managing director of Bio-Med Healthcare Products Ltd a company that makes conventional disposable syringes. “Officially no orders came. We could not block any quantity for the government or scale up capacity.”

On July 1 as India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive was intensified the government invited bids for 125 crore auto-disable syringes. It did not get enough bidders and was able to place just one order for 10 crore syringes.

The same month the government finally did what the manufacturers had asked for in January – it relaxed the criteria to allow bids from even companies making conventional disposable syringes and invited bids for 90 crore syringes.

But by then many companies had already made export commitments to other countries.

Export restrictions

Of the 90 crore syringes the Indian government sought it was able to place orders for only 68 crore-70 crore said several manufacturers who participated in the process. Senior government officials involved in the procurement process declined to comment on the number of syringes procured.

The shortfall eventually led to the government restricting the export of syringes last week – a move that has sparked concern around the world since Indian manufacturers export syringes to 149 countries many of which are dependent on these instruments for Covid-19 vaccinations and other medical needs.

In India the shortfall led to Covid-19 vaccinations being temporarily halted in cities like Pune and Kochi for a day each.

The government has justified the export curbs arguing it needs to prioritise the needs of India’s people. “The export restriction is temporary to help create a stock of syringes” a senior official from the health ministry said on condition of anonymity.

But Scroll.in has examined correspondence sent to the government by syringe-makers as well as a series of tender documents issued this year. They suggest that Indian manufacturers could have met India’s needs and supplied to other countries as well if the government had assessed domestic demand and availability of auto-disable syringes and placed advance orders for conventional ones.

“We have been raising red flags since last April” said Rajiv Nath managing director of Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd the world’s largest auto-disable syringe manufacturer.

Scroll.in sent an email to the health ministry on Friday asking for comment on the situation. There was no response till the time of publication.

Manohar Agnani additional secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare who oversaw the procurement process and Suresh Puri who heads the Central Medical Services Society an agency under the ministry that issued the tenders declined to comment on the syringe purchases that were made. But the senior official in the ministry who did not want to be identified insisted that they had been “in regular touch with manufacturers” and that the country had no shortage of syringes.

India has more than 20 syringe manufacturers that have capacity to produce 50 crore syringes per month. These syringes vary in size from 0.5 ml to 60 ml. But only three of these companies are capable of producing auto-disable syringes – Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd Iscon Surgicals Ltd and Becton Dickinson India Pvt Ltd. Together they can produce fewer than 15 crore auto-disable syringes per month.

In April 2020 Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd wrote to health secretary Preeti Sudan asking the government to plan for the timely availability of syringes ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine launch “to avoid having a status of availability of vaccines but shortage of syringes for vaccination”.

Nath from Hindustan Syringes said he did not receive any response. “We kept following up and finally had a meeting last October” he said. “The government placed orders by December.”

In December 2020 the government issued a tender for 35.12 crore auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml size. The three manufacturers that produce auto-disable syringes participated. Hindustan Syringes won a bid for 26.5 crore syringes BD India Pvt Ltd for 4.38 crore syringes and Iscon for 4.24 crore. They were given four months to deliver.

In January 2021 soon after India’s vaccination drive began the managing director of Bio-Med Healthcare Products Ltd Deepak Arora wrote to the health ministry highlighting the limited availability of auto-disable syringes. “In these constrained circumstances it can lead to heavy shortage of the product and hence delays in executing [the] vaccination program” his letter said.

Other companies that manufacture conventional syringes wrote similar letters urging the government to buy their syringes along with auto-disable ones. Among them was PH Healthcare Pvt Ltd director Ritesh Brahmecha. “Conventional disposable syringes of all sizes have received worldwide acceptance for use in vaccination drive against Covid-19…” he wrote. “Even WHO [World Health Organisation] has released a press note clarifying that each country should follow whatever is convenient to ensure massive outreach.”

‘Adequate stocks’

But the government did not modify its policy saying that it had an adequate stock of auto-disable syringes. In February the health ministry asked Hindustan Syringes to supply more auto-disable syringes at the same rate Nath said. Iscon’s vice president Sandeep Bhandari said his company was also asked to supply more syringes.

However the government did not share any projections about demand with the companies which the companies said was necessary to plan capacity addition.

In April 2021 Nath wrote a second letter to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan saying Hindustan Syringes could produce 84 crore auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml size per annum and ramp up production to 30 crore syringes per year if the government provided clarity on orders for 2022.

But this did not happen Nath said.

Iscon’s managers also wrote to the government asking for its annual forecast for syringe requirements. “We didn’t know how long the vaccination drive would continue” said vice president Sandeep Bhandari. “We did double our capacity last year but that was planned well before the pandemic began. The government gave no projections.”

By the time the government issued a tender for 125 crore auto-disable syringes (of 0.5 ml and 1 ml size) on July 1 Iscon could not participate – it had already accepted other orders. Hindustan Syringes too had made other commitments and could only supply 10 crore syringes to the government. “Even that 10 crore we diverted from UNICEF to supply to the Indian government” Nath said.

The same month the health ministry contacted UNICEF seeking its assistance to arrange supplies from other countries on behalf of India. Within days UNICEF invited bids for 50 crore syringes but it remains unclear how much stock it was able to procure.

Struggling to procure enough auto-disable syringes on July 9 the government invited bids for 90 crore syringes this time expanding from 0.5 ml and 1 ml auto-disabled syringes to conventional disposable syringes in sizes of 0.5 ml 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml.

The Covid-19 vaccine is administered in India in doses of 0.5 ml so syringes of 0.5 ml or 1 ml size are best suited to the task since they avoid the possibility of wastage. But left with limited options the government had to invite tenders for bigger syringes.

Despite the expanded criteria according to the manufacturers the government was able to place orders for only 68 crore-70 crore out of 90 crore syringes leaving a shortfall of more than 20 crore syringes.

Vaccination interrupted

While the government struggled to source syringes monthly vaccination numbers continued to rise depleting the stockpile of syringes.

Until July 1 India had delivered 33.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses. That month alone it administered 13.45 crore vaccinations which went up to 18.35 crore in August and 23 crore in September.

In Odisha immunisation officer Dr Tapas Patra said that he state faced a shortage of syringes for over three days in September.

In Rajasthan a senior health official said the state’s buffer stock of syringes was depleted by September. “Every night we used to take stock of syringes left in vaccination centres and the diversion would begin from one centre to another” the official said requesting anonymity. “A month or so ago the [Central] government asked us to use 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml syringes if 0.5 ml syringes were not in stock.”

Odisha and Rajasthan did not shut down the vaccinations due to the syringe shortage but Pune in Maharashtra had to halt vaccinations on October 1 and Kochi on August 16.

Kerala Tamil Nadu Rajasthan Maharashtra are among the few states that are making local procurements. “It is true that the [Central] government is unable to fulfil our requirements” said Dr Archana Patil who heads the Directorate of Health Services in Maharashtra. On October 6 Maharashtra received 30 lakh syringes from the Central government a stock that will last three days.

India has administered 94.5 crore Covid-19 doses so far. In addition regular immunisation programmes continue – 12.7 crore children and 3 crore pregnant women are immunised in India annually.

KL Sharma a former joint secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said the normal procurement process for syringes is based on the previous year’s trend. “This is a very uncertain time for the government to plan in such a dynamic situation” he said. “What the government could have done is taken stock every three months for syringes and kept manufacturers informed.”

Setback to exporters

Since the two tenders for syringes in July yielded little response on September 21 the government wrote to the Syringe Manufacturer’s Association of India about a possible “partial control on export”.

Within a week several manufacturers wrote back to the government in alarm.

In its letter Lifelong Meditech Private Ltd India’s biggest syringe exporter pointed out that it had participated in government tenders and even started supplying syringes to the government ahead of the delivery schedule. It has committed to supplying 10.75 crore syringes to the government before December.

In 2020-’21 Lifelong was responsible for 47% of syringe exports from India exporting 67.3 crore syringes.

“We have established our customer base after many years of efforts and against stiff competition from China” said H Srivastava Director and CEO of Lifelong. “This industry takes years to develop if they put restrictions like this for even four months the entire business will move on to Chinese firms.”

Altogether in 2019-’20 India had exported 106 crore syringes which rose to 143 crore in 2020-’21. Between April and July this year the country has exported 55.2 crore syringes – a 15% rise in monthly exports between last year and this year. Average monthly exports have risen from 8.8 crore in 2019-’20 to 11.9 crore in 2020-’21 and 13.8 crore since April this year.

On October 4 the Directorate General of Foreign Trade restricted exports for up to four months for all kinds of syringes including those that are not even used for immunisation. After manufacturers asked for those syringes to be exempted on October 9 the government restricted exports only of syringes with sizes of 0.5 ml 1ml 2 ml and 3 ml. But it allowed the export of syringes with a capacity of 5 ml and more which are used for other medical purposes such as administering insulin shots to diabetic patients. The duration of the restrictions was reduced to three months.

The curbs will still affect Brazil and Argentina which are India’s biggest clients followed by the United Arab Emirates Sudan Russia Nigeria Germany Philippines. Manufacturers say this will setback India’s efforts to compete with China which remains the biggest exporter in the global syringe market.

Chart supplied by manufacturers.

This year Iscon has so far taken orders for 22 crore auto-disable syringes to be delivered by March 2022. Hindustan Syringes has accepted orders for 67.5 crore syringes and already supplied 48.4 crore. Becton Dickinson Ltd has supplied 4.38 crore syringes.

Arora from Biomed said he has orders for 3 crore syringes for October including from Ethopia and Palestine that rely on Indian manufacturers for supplies. In a letter to the health ministry he wrote: “Non-honouring of our export contracts can bring legal liability on us and will be set back to Government of India’s Atamanirbhar Bharat Program.”

Instead of banning exports Arora said the government should force all manufacturers to compulsorily supply a minimum of 20% of their production for local use.

But scaling up production itself will take time. Nath from Hindustan Syringes said the full capacity of a manufacturing unit can’t be utilised at short notice since inputs like needles cannulas rubber gaskets stainless steel tubing and plastics need to be arranged. Most of these raw materials need to be imported a process that could take weeks. A batch of syringes could take 20 days-24 days from production to pass quality tests.

Manufacturers say this situation could have been averted had the government taken a decision to use conventional disposable syringes for Covid-19 vaccinations in January itself.

“We would have enough syringe capacity in India if this was well thought of six or nine months ago” said Srivastava the CEO of Lifelong.

Haunted Homes in Illinois

I recently went on the hunt for some of the most haunted homes in Illinois when I came across the story about the infamous Schweppe Mansion located just outside of Chicago in Lake Forest Illinois. Now I have to admit I'm stuck in the weird place of wanting this beautiful home and being terrified of it.

The Sordid Story Behind the Schweppe Mansion in Illinois

Upon starting my Google search about the Schweppe Mansion located at 405 N Mayflower Rd. in Lake Forest Illinois I came across an article from onlyinyourstate.com titled ""13 Spine-Tingling Haunting Said To Be True In Illinois"". Here's what they had to say about the Schweppe Mansion;

This 24500-square foot mansion named Mayflower Place was an extravagant wedding present for Laura Shedd and her new husband Charles Schweppe. Tragic struck this couple not long after when Laura Schweppe died from a heart attack in 1937. In 1941 Charles was found dead in his bedroom from a gunshot wound to the head. His suicide note read “I’ve been awake all night. It’s terrible.

Ok so that's freaky right? Just wait there's more...

An article on Patch.com says that after Laura Shedd and Charles Schweppe passed away this beautiful mansion sat vacant for nearly 50 years because rumors say Charles Schweppe demanded it to be so in his will. Schweppe's son-in-law finally sold the home to a couple in 1987 who did a massive restoration of the place but then got divorced 2 years later. (Did Laura Shedd and Charles Schweppe's ghosts make that happen?!?)

Schweppe Mansion was listed again in 2007 for $18 million dollars and sat on the market until it finally sold in 2020 for $8.5 million. I get that the mansion is beautiful but would you want to live here?!?!

Billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk reached new record levels of wealth last year.

Billionaires are also less generous than ever in terms of share of wealth they've given away.

Of the Forbes 400 a record 156 – including Bezos and Musk – have given less than 1%.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

While Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk feud over who is wealthier and who is more litigious the business titans are among a group of billionaires in the running for an even less desirable title: World's Stingiest Billionaire.

Although the pandemic era's surging stock market has ballooned the fortunes of billionaires to new heights the wealthiest people in the world have chosen not to keep pace with their charitable giving according to the Forbes Philanthropy Score.

The team at Forbes adds up all of the lifetime ""out-the-door"" giving a person has made and divides that number by the sum of their total current wealth and the total giving amount. The results are categorized into five tiers: less than 1%; between 1% and 5%; between 5% and 10%; between 10% and 20%; and 20% or more.

Private foundations and donor-advised funds don't count for the Forbes measure since those ""donations"" effectively remain under the control of the donor and also come with generous benefits that enable wealthy people to avoid paying taxes.

Of the 400 billionaires on this year's list just 19 have given away 10% or more of their wealth while a record high 156 have given less than 1%. While Bezos and Musk have yet to crack out of the 1% MacKenzie Scott has left them in the dust by giving away 13% of her fortune. Even with her pace of giving Scott is wealthier now than she was last year.

Bezos did make headlines this summer with $400 million gifts to the Smithsonian Van Jones and Jose Andres and has given $865 million from his pledge to fight climate change. But his actual gifts are a tiny fraction of the $22 billion gain he made this year alone to bring his total net worth to $201 billion.

Warren Buffet continued as the list's most generous giver having parted with $4.1 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock in June to bring his lifetime total to $44 billion. He's now halfway through his pledge to give away all his Berkshire shares.

The most prolific giver in the Forbes ranking was George Soros whose $16.8 billion of giving has outsized his $8.6 billion net worth. Former president Donald Trump was not ranked since he fell $400 million shy of making the top 400 list."

Following repeated complaints of faulty devices from viewers CBC's Marketplace purchased 12 of what Best Buy calls ""Grade A"" refurbished devices from its third-party marketplace and had them independently reviewed by industry experts. Five of the devices were found to have cosmetic or functionality issues.

In response to CBC's findings Best Buy said in an emailed statement: ""Your investigation prompted another round of scrutiny and development on [Best Buy's] Marketplace content."" Specifically ""enhancing product descriptions to ensure consistency so that customers are clear on what they are purchasing.""

WATCH | Marketplace's full investigation:

Testing “Best Buy” Duration 22:30 We're investigating the truth about their refurbished tech and heading undercover inside stores to reveal what Best Buy employees really think.

Markus Giesler an associate professor of marketing at York University in Toronto said for consumers to comfortably purchase refurbished devices companies like Best Buy need to take more responsibility for their third-party sellers.

""The number one rule is underpromise overdeliver"" said Giesler after CBC shared the results of its investigation. ""Today's case was about the exact opposite.""

Best Buy's Marketplace hosts a variety of third-party sellers offering new and refurbished devices. The company claims that all sellers featured on its site are thoroughly vetted and approved offering only ""Grade A"" refurbished products that can be "" more reliable than a brand new version "" of a device.

Markus Giesler an associate professor at York University told CBC the lack of standardization around the definition of ‘refurbished’ means customers don’t always know what they are purchasing. (Jeremy McDonald/CBC)

It's a claim that Giesler finds problematic.

Part of the issue says Giesler is that there is no standard definition for what a ""Grade A"" product or even a ""refurbished"" product is.

""Consumers should absolutely be critical"" said Giesler. ""Refurbished products have a better price-value relation.... On the other hand however there are also a number of risks because these are devices that might have had previous issues that may or may not have been addressed.""

4 tablets 4 smartphones 4 laptops tested

Marketplace heard stories from viewers about products they purchased from Best Buy's third-party sellers including smartphones having audio issues and faulty fingerprint scanners. In one case a customer received an iPhone that developed a battery issue within a few months. When she took it in to be repaired an Apple authorized service provider said the phone was actually supposed to have been destroyed because of a previous defect.

Marketplace purchased four tablets four smartphones and four laptops from Best Buy's third-party sellers. All listings stated the devices were refurbished.

Alex Sebastian co-founder of the Toronto-based refurbishing company Orchard analyzed the tablets and smartphones. He said that two phones and two tablets did not meet his company's standards for refurbished devices.

""Refurbished is language that's thrown around a lot and depending when you're buying it's going to mean something different"" said Sebastian whose company also sells on Best Buy's Marketplace. ""Refurbished would certainly mean that they're fully functional and they're in a very high cosmetic grading.""

Two smartphones — an Apple iPhone XR and a Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime — both had notable cosmetic damage said Sebastian. The J3 Prime had ""deep scratches"" on the backplate while the iPhone XR had ""significant scratches"" on the front screen according to Sebastian's report.

""I don't think that they had a proper cosmetic grading done before they were put up for sale"" said Sebastian.

Sebastian said all four smartphones worked. But Giesler says function isn't enough.

""[The J3 Prime is a] clear violation of promises that were made in the narrative that Best Buy claims to be a representation of the service that we're dealing with"" he said.

Without disclosing they were journalists CBC producers reached out to both sellers about the issues Sebastian found in the phones. The seller of the Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime offered a phone case to hide the scratches on the backplate. The seller of the iPhone XR said a refurbished phone can have ""cosmetic imperfections"" that don't affect the phone's functionality.

Sebastian had a different take: ""What we've found based on feedback from our customers is that the screen is the most important.""

WATCH | Expert outlines flaws in refurbished tablet:

Clicking noise on refurbished iPad demonstrates 'problematic' workmanship: expert Duration 0:42 Electronics expert Alex Sebastian says that one of the tablets purchased by CBC had an improperly replaced screen resulting in an audible clicking noise.

Sebastian said that two of the four tablets purchased by CBC had more concerning issues. An Apple iPad Pro had a ""problematic"" screen that made a clicking noise when pushed said Sebastian. He said the sound was the result of improperly applied adhesive during a screen replacement.

Sebastian went on to say that if the iPad was dropped there is a risk that over time the screen could come out of the body of the tablet.

Sebastian said that poor workmanship and pressure applied to the back of a screen left 'bright spots' on the display of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A. (CBC)

Sebastian said the second tablet a Samsung Galaxy Tab A also had a screen replacement done but poor workmanship and pressure applied to the back of the screen left ""bright spots"" on the display.

When CBC producers posing as customers contacted the sellers the iPad Pro seller offered a refund with free shipping. The Galaxy Tab A seller also offered a shipping label for return but said it would ""inspect the return and issue you the refund/replacement accordingly.""

When the producers revealed themselves as journalists the seller of the iPad Pro with the ""loose"" screen took ""full responsibility"" for the ""defect"" and revealed that it doesn't refurbish the devices it sells. Instead it purchases them and does the grading testing cleaning and packaging.

""In most cases the devices we purchase from the [distributors] are not refurbished devices but devices that were used and traded back"" said a statement.

Sebastian found that out of four smartphones and four tablets CBC’s Marketplace purchased refurbished from Best Buy half had issues. (Jeremy McDonald/CBC)

Sebastian found no issues with the other two tablets purchased. However he was unimpressed with the outcome of the products he tested overall. ""This is not the refurbished product that we want to be seeing going into market"" he said.

Refurbished products have at least a 90-day warranty

The laptops CBC's Marketplace purchased were analyzed by Maaz Kamani of Ask Computers. Out of four laptops purchased he noted the Asus Chromebook C223NA had ""heavy"" scratches which he called ""Grade B"" in terms of cosmetic condition. The listing online for the Chromebook did warn of possible imperfections.

When a CBC producer contacted the seller of the Chromebook as a customer the seller offered a refund with free shipping or a 10 per cent refund to keep the item.

Kamani said all of the laptops worked properly but he did note that some had been modified. For example he says the motherboard was repaired on the Chromebook and noted that the RAM and hard drive were changed in an HP EliteBook 830.

The online listing for this Chromebook warned of ‘possible imperfections.' (CBC)

On Best Buy's Marketplace the return period can vary but all refurbished products have at least a 90-day warranty. Depending on the reason for return there could be restocking or shipping fees.

Joanne Nixon and her partner Richard Horst found that if that refurbished product fails after the 90 days you're out of luck. The couple purchased an $800 refurbished iPad Pro from one of Best Buy's third-party sellers. Within months the device had issues.

""You'd go to turn it on and you'd get like nothing"" said Nixon. ""[Richard] would reboot it … it would work for a couple of days and then it would do that again.""

The seller of the iPad told Horst that since 90 days had passed there was nothing they could do. Best Buy said it could not intervene for the same reason.

They also took the iPad to a Best Buy location but employees couldn't offer any help because it was a marketplace purchase.

""[The staff] all said 'Oh never buy on marketplace big mistake. It's third-party sellers and you never know what you're getting'"" Nixon recalled. The couple said the in-store employees confirmed the device was not functional.

Giesler said that Best Buy should be more involved with issues with third-party sellers.

""Best Buy is the market actor here that is in charge of managing the platform. It's in charge of bringing resellers together or sellers together with consumers and they're the chief responsible actor in this particular market system.""

After being contacted by CBC's Marketplace Best Buy reached out to the couple and offered an open-box iPad replacement.

Best Buy store employees critical of third-party marketplace

Producers from CBC's Marketplace went undercover at five different Best Buy store locations in the Greater Toronto Area to inquire about returning products purchased from its third-party sellers.

Despite the company boasting about the success of Best Buy's Marketplace including advertising that one in four orders shipped from bestbuy.ca are from third-party sellers in-store employees were critical.

""Personally I don't buy from there"" said one employee. ""You don't know what you're buying.""

At another location an employee said they warn customers to only purchase new products directly from Best Buy.

""Then you know you're getting what you actually see on the website rather than a refurbished item from a company that fixed something but didn't fix it properly.""

In response to this Best Buy said in an emailed statement: ""We are launching a program to help our stores effectively communicate about [the marketplace] to our customers.""

Tips on how to buy refurbished

In addition to limiting electronic waste purchasing a refurbished device can be a great way for a customer to get a deal Sebastian said. For consumers shopping for refurbished devices he suggested researching the seller including reading reviews considering the number of reviews a seller has and ensuring sellers offer an acceptable warranty period.

""If you can't find anything on the [sellers] that's a huge red flag"" Sebastian said.

Here's what you need to know,"Below Select looks at the consumer protections offered by credit cards  debit cards and some major BNPL providers to help you decide which is better for you.

In fact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently warned consumers about the tendency to overspend when using BNPL services the negative impact they could have on credit scores  their late fees and the lack of consumer protections.

""BNPL loans are still new and government regulations haven't fully caught up. That means that the short-term financing options generally offer consumers fewer protections"" says Leslie Tayne founder and managing director at Tayne Law Group.

Yet as consumers flock towards this new financing method they should be cautious about them.

BNPL also known as point-of-sale loans  are installment loans that allow consumers to split up the cost of their purchase over time. BNPL options are available nearly everywhere that you shop with a number of big-name retailers like Walmart Amazon Target and Sephora using them. A recent Credit Karma study found that 44% of respondents had used a BNPL product at least once.

Will you have to keep making installment payments on the item even after you return it? What company do you contact in order to resolve the issue: the BNPL provider the merchant or the credit or debit card issuer that you used to finance the BNPL loan?

But what happens when you purchase the sweater using a ' buy now pay later' loan (BNPL)?

Have you ever purchased a winter coat online only to discover that it looks nothing like the images you saw on the website when it arrives? While you'll have to file a complaint with the merchant and possibly the credit card company before being refunded returning an item and being refunded is usually straightforward when you buy it on a credit card.

Consumers are offered a number of credit card protections through the Fair Credit Billing Act. There are two types of complaints consumers can file with their credit card issuer: A billing error or an issue with the quality of a good or a service. A billing error may be an authorized charge an incorrect charge or a math error. If you have a 'billing error' the FCBA requires that credit card issuers conduct an investigation if a consumer files a complaint within 60 days of receiving their account statement.

While the FCBA does not apply to issues with the quality of a good consumers can still file a complaint with their issuer. Since this type of complaint falls under state laws consumers are more likely to resolve their issue or be refunded if they meet certain requirements such as having purchased the item in their home state.

The FCBA only applies to 'open end' credit accounts such as credit cards or retail cards with revolving accounts so these rules do not apply to debit cards or installment loans like BNPL loans.

It's also worth noting that certain cards like The Platinum Card® from American Express have benefits that include return and *purchase protection which can help you get reimbursed after a retailer's return policy has expired or if your purchase has been lost stolen or damaged. Terms apply.

However people who use debit cards also have protections when it comes to fraud charges through the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Much like credit cards these protections do not apply to issues with the quality of the product. If consumers do have problems with the quality of a good or service they bought with a debit card they'll have to resolve the issue with the merchant before contacting their debit card issuer some of which have their own zero liability policies.

BNPL loans on the other hand are not subject to the regulations that credit or debit card issuers fall under. While countries like Great Britain are rolling out regulations on the BNPL industry that would allow consumers to escalate complaints to a national agency there are no special regulations for BNPL providers in the U.S. Some of the major BNPL providers such as Affirm Klarna and Afterpay have their own dispute resolution policies in place.

""If you buy a faulty item with a BNPL loan you're subject to the policies of both the merchant and the BNPL lender which can make it tricky to navigate the return process"" says Tayne. ""In some cases you may have to continue paying an item until the merchant informs the lender that you've successfully returned it.""

For example Affirm has a dispute resolution procedure that works similarly to a credit card dispute resolution procedure: Consumers have 60 days to open a dispute with Affirm. After both the consumer and merchant submit information to substantiate their claims Affirm will then rule in favor of either the merchant or the consumer.

Consumers should also check if they're required to make payments on returned items. Klarna Affirm and Afterpay all offer consumers the ability to delay payments. Klarna will allow you to pause payments if you report a problem with your order while Affirm will not require continued payments on a purchase if you open a dispute with them within 60 days of the transaction. Afterpay allows customers to push the original payment due date back by two weeks while the return is processed.

Furthermore depending on how you're financing your purchase through BNPL you might have to contact the merchant the BNPL provider and the debit or credit card issuer to resolve issues. (Though some providers like Affirm just allow you to link your checking account for payments.)

Since Afterpay only allows consumers to pay with credit or debit card consumers are subject to the same protections they would be had they used their payment cards directly at the retailer says Amanda Pires Vice President of Communications at Afterpay.

This means that if you buy an item using Afterpay and are making payments with a debit card then you're subject to the protections offered by your debit card issuer. According to Pires 90% of Afterpay transactions are financed with debit cards.

For consumers figuring out which companies they need to contact when returning an item or reporting a faulty item that they purchased with a BNPL loan can be confusing.

Tayne suggests that consumers contact the retailer to understand the return policy research the BNPL's return policy and as a last resort reach out to the card issuer if they need additional help.

""If a retailer won't accept the return or the BNPL service is not cooperating consider contacting the credit card company. Credit card companies will often ask if you have attempted to resolve matters with the seller so do your best and dispute a transaction as a last option"" says Tayne.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvbW9iaWxlL3lvdS1jYW4tbm93LXByZW9yZGVyLXRoZS1hcHBsZS13YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtNy13aGVyZS10by1idXktd2hlbi1pdC13aWxsLXNoaXAtYW5kLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You can now preorder the Apple Watch Series 7: Where to buy when it will ship and more,"Apple announced the new Apple Watch Series 7 weeks ago at its ""California Streaming"" product launch. Now Apple's new smartwatch is available for preorders. This upgrade comes with a larger screen -- 41mm and 45mm sizes each 1mm larger than Series 6 models -- and a more durable frame with IP6X dust resistance.

The Watch Series 7 also has a full QWERTY keyboard interface instead of using your finger to draw each letter on the screen. Additionally there's a brighter screen and faster charging if you'd like to keep it on overnight for sleep tracking. And it's available in 10 different case finishes and three types of material so you can again choose aluminum stainless steel or titanium. You can preorder the watch now but some models are already backordered until early November. That said it hits store shelves on Friday Oct. 15.

As usual you won't find many sales or deals on a brand new Apple product. But following on the heels of the iPhone 13 launch there are trade-in options: Verizon is giving up to $200 off but you'll need a to commit to a cellular contract. We'll give you the full price breakdown for the different watch styles and the retailers that are carrying Apple's latest gear.

Watch this: Apple Watch Series 7: Here is what's new 05:40

When is the Apple Watch available to preorder? Apple opened Watch Series 7 preorders on Friday Oct.8 soon after 5 a.m. PT (8 a.m. ET 1 p.m. BST). All versions of the Apple Watch will be available to preorder at the same time using the same checkout system on either the website or the Apple Store app on your phone. The Apple Watch Series 7 will start shipping on the following Friday Oct. 15. If you're able to order early you'll get your watch on the 15th. The longer your preorder takes the further out your delivery will be.

How much does Apple Watch Series 7 cost? Apple had previously announced that the Series 7 would start at $399 but now that preorders have started the pricing for the full line have been fully revealed. By and large the pricing model from last year's Series 6 remains intact: Apple Watch Series 7 (aluminum): Starts at $399

Apple Watch Series 7 (aluminum): Starts at $699

Apple Watch Series 7 (titanium): Starts at $799

Apple Watch Series 7 (Nike): Starts at $399

Apple Watch Series 7 (Hermès): Starts at $1249 For each of those add $30 when jumping to the 45mm size and $100 when jumping to a cellular model (which will also require a monthly wireless plan if you want to access services and make calls outside of Wi-Fi hotspots).

Where can I buy the Apple Watch other than Apple? Yes. Now that preorders have opened you can preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 at authorized Apple retailers including Best Buy Target and Walmart. As of Oct. 15 the Series 7 will also be available in stores.

Will my old Apple Watch bands and accessories still work? For the most part yes. Despite the larger screen size the Series 7 is designed to be backwards compatible with existing watch bands from earlier models. It should also work with older chargers though they won't charge it as quickly as the newer one that comes in the box with the Series 7. That one will charge up to 33% faster than Series 6 models according to Apple.

Apple Apple Watch Series 7 aluminum Starts at $399 While it's frequently seen as the ""base model"" Apple Watch it's also the version with the most colors available. And with Apple's promise that Series 7 is the most durable Watch to date there's an even lower chance the softer metal would take any serious damage during your ownership of it. It's also nice that anyone upgrading from a previous Apple Watch to this new model can bring their favorite strap with them to this new Apple Watch. The aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 will be available in Product Red midnight (black) starlight (silver) green and blue. See at Apple

Apple Watch Series 7 stainless steel Starts at $699 If Apple is promising an even more durable body with the Aluminum model why pay extra for the stainless steel body? This upgrade is actually more than a status symbol. Stainless steel is considerably more durable than aluminum so if you work or play harder than most this design will keep you from developing scratches on the body long term. It's a must-have option for people who want an Apple Watch but need something a little sturdier than the average user on top of looking smart in more formal settings. The stainless steel Apple Watch Series 7 is available in silver graphite and gold colors. See at Apple

Apple Apple Watch Series 7 titanium Starts at $799 While it's true that titanium is stronger and conducts heat better than stainless steel so it is technically possible for the titanium body of the Apple Watch to survive more damage and run slightly cooler than its counterparts the differences would be almost undetectable on something this size. Instead you get the titanium body Apple Watch because it looks like nothing else and feel like you have a classic timepiece on your wrist. But if the technical benefits help you justify the added cost go for it. The titanium Apple Watch Series 7 is available in natural (gray) and space black. See at Apple

Apple Apple Watch Series 7 Nike Edition Starts at $399 While the physical body and internal mechanics are all exactly the same as the aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 listed above the Nike Edition features one of several custom Nike-themed fitness bands and access to fitness software and watch faces exclusive to this model in partnership with Nike. So if the Apple Watch is all about fitness for you and you love Nike products this is the one to get. The Nike Apple Watch Series 7 is available in silver and space gray colors.

It's designed to be your workstation video gaming center Netflix screen and sketching slate. That's a tall order and tackling too many use cases is often a recipe for succeeding at none of them.

But the Surface Laptop Studio surprises. It's not perfect but it's pretty good at all of those tasks. It's a shame the operating system it runs keeps it from excelling.

Design Chops

Apple gets all the design credit but Surface devices really cemented the hybrid laptop-tablet concept which is now a billion-dollar business for Microsoft and has been picked up by Dell Lenovo and others.

The Surface line remains the leader though and the new Surface Laptop Studio continues the tradition of successful Surface experimentation. Exactly where Microsoft is headed with this device isn't entirely clear but the Studio is at the very least the best-performing Surface available and the unusual design mostly works. Unlike the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Go 3 the screen doesn't detach from the keyboard.

The first thing you notice about the Laptop Studio is that the keyboard hangs about a quarter inch over a recessed base. The extended upper surface—the same level as the keyboard—is where all the Studio's ports live. Two grills sit on either side of the recessed base. It looks somewhat bizarre when you first pull it out of the box but it's not all that noticeable when the Studio is sitting on a flat table.

Carrying it around does feel very different than any laptop I've ever used but despite the odd design this is a very good-looking machine. The silver magnesium/aluminum shell reminds me of the Macbook Pro but the Surface has a slightly chunkier feel to it. The rounded corners also feel fitting with the more rounded interface in Windows 11.

The comparison to the MacBook Pro is also apt in the sense that this is not a svelte lightweight Surface that doubles as a tablet. This is a powerhouse laptop that happens to fold down to a completely flat tablet-like screen. At 4 pounds you aren't going to use this the way you'd use an iPad or a Surface Go but that might be OK because you have significantly more processing power at your disposal.

If you've ever tried to for example create or work with a complex multilayer document in an Adobe app on the iPad and found it wanting you're one of the people most likely to enjoy the Surface Laptop Studio.

All the World’s a Stage

Opened up as a laptop the Surface Laptop Studio looks just like well a laptop. To move the Surface into Stage Mode you pull the bottom half of the lid forward so that it covers the keyboard until you feel it lock in place with a satisfying magnetic click. The hinge is a complicated affair from an engineering viewpoint but it's surprisingly easy to use once you get the hang of it. It does require two hands to move though."

However the enzootic or sylvatic cycle in triatomines across all continents together with the wide distribution of household-invading triatomines is now responsible for most CD transmission in countries like Brazil Argentina Colombia and Nicaragua [14 17 18 31 32]. A scenario where the restriction of a given multi-host parasite based on the control of one single vector species will always be insufficient because parasite transmission rarely relies on a single system [27 54]. Therefore the sustainability of successful control strategies for CD requires more accurate knowledge of environmental factors that underlie the enzootic transmission cycle of this parasite [55]. In Colombia aspects determining the current epidemiology of CD are still unknown and the potential risk of enzootic transmission inside overcrowded settlements and installations such as work camps or military barracks located in endemic areas has not been explored. Here we described the potential risk for spillover infections in the military population by a well-established T. cruzi enzootic cycle due to: (i) a high rate of T. cruzi infection of triatomine bugs collected; (ii) increased contact between T. cruzi-infected triatomines and humans according to blood source analysis; (iii) selection and dominance of mammalian species with high competence for being a reservoir; and (iv) close proximity of infected triatomines and infected D. marsupialis to accommodations and kitchens (Table 1; Fig. 2).

Determining the spatial distribution of the elements that form this epidemiological chain in the enzootic cycle and suitable contact with humans are of pivotal importance for determining trends and risk evaluation. The present study was developed in four BITERs located in four municipalities with historical reports of infected triatomine bugs [36 37]. However differences in potential risk intensities of T. cruzi transmission were found at these locations. BITER 10 (La Loma) and 17 (Carepa) could be considered to have a lower potential risk of T. cruzi transmission while BITER 5 (Aguachica) and 16 (Yopal) display comparable patterns regarding the presence of naturally T. cruzi-infected R. pallescens and R. prolixus respectively. These patterns include the positive selection of generalist mammal species with high transmissibility competence such as D. marsupialis. These eco-epidemiological characteristics could increase the opportunities for contact between humans domestic animals and the sylvatic cycle. These findings in BITERs with a higher potential risk are in accordance with the epidemiological situation reported by the SIVIGILA for these areas (Fig. 1) and agree with previous outbreaks of CD caused by oral transmission due to spillover of the enzootic cycle described in recent years in the municipalities of Aguachica Yopal and Paz de Ariporo (Casanare) [18 56 57].

BITER 5 located in Aguachica municipality in the Caribbean region of Colombia presents an epidemiological profile that enhances the chances of transmission to humans thereby representing a potential risk for around 30000 active members of the National Army who participate in training and re-training activities each year. The results of this study show a close proximity between the enzootic transmission cycle and the quartered population. Molecular analysis supports the notion that R. pallescens actively participates in the enzootic transmission showing the high-frequency infection with the TcI Sylvatic (46.8%) genotype and the high frequency of feeding on D. marsupialis (66%) and other sylvatic mammals. However the presence of human blood in 18.6% of the analyzed insects and 11.45% infection with TcI Dom  reveal an active interplay between sylvatic and domestic transmission as previously reported in other regions of Colombia [18]. The same ecological situation was found in BITER 16 where we found R. prolixus in A. butyracea palms infected with TcI Sylvatic that fed on human blood which can lead to a potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to more than 30000 active members present in the Orinoco region. These findings are in agreement with those of previous studies and support the premise that in Colombia there is a high risk of R. pallescens intrusion supported by the high presence blood-feeding on humans and T. cruzi infection [18].

The spatial convergence found in the BITER 5 location facilitates triatomines reaching human installations by being attracted by artificial light in the search of food [17 58]. A similar eco-epidemiological situation has been described in some regions of Colombia and Panama where this species has been found to be a T. cruzi vector [16 38 59 60]. The higher number of triatomines found in the dry season added to the higher infection rates in this season increasing the risk of an oral outbreak in this period [17 18 56]. These ecological characteristics reveal the ability of R. pallescens to participate in complex transmission dynamics that may exhibit local peculiarities and lead to the emergence or re-emergence of outbreaks.

On the other hand the dominance of D. marsupialis with high transmissibility as shown by hemoculture supports the high potential risk inside BITER 5 and 16. The reduced diversity and the selection of suitable reservoir hosts of T. cruzi have been reported as common traits and possible factors related to human outbreaks by the oral route [27 54]. In these military installations the sympatry of the common opossum R. pallescens and R. prolixus and humans near the kitchen enhanced the risk of oral transmission through the consumption of food or juices contaminated by triatomine feces or food/beverages contaminated with animal secretions that contain metacyclic trypomastigotes [32 61 62]. The outbreaks due to accidental food contamination in these BITERs would be challenging to manage due to the large number of people affected. Future studies should include high-resolution molecular tracking to unravel the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi infection within these settlements.

BITER 17 and 10 located in Carepa (Antioquia) and La Loma (Cesar) respectively were found to have the lowest potential risk of CD transmission. In the Uraba region of BITER 17 we collected only two triatomine bugs: one infected R. pallescens and one non-infected T. dimidiata. Contrary to BITER 5 and 16 triatomines captured in this BITER were found by military personnel in forest areas far away from the installations inhabited by military personnel (Fig. 2). These results show the existence of enzootic transmission with R. pallescens. Regarding T. dimidiata metapopulations of this species distributed in the Urabá region are considered to be of low epidemiologic relevance [63 64]. Finally we believe that we did not capture mammals inside this military installation due to the ready availability of banana crops around the BITER [65]. All these factors support a low potential risk of T. cruzi in this area.

In addition no triatomine bug was collected in BITER 10 and even the two potential reservoirs (P. semiespinosus) collected there were not infected [55]. BITER 10 is in La Loma a rural area of the municipality of La Jagua de Ibirico (Cesar) a zone with a high abundance of A. butyracea palms and reports of vectors such as R. pallescens Erathyrus cuspidatus and T. dimidiata with their ecotopes in this palm species [36 37]. Our results show the absence of triatomine bugs in palms near the bedrooms and kitchen of BITER 10 but the enzootic cycle could be happening in palms forest not included in the present study. However it is necessary to mention that BITER 10 is in an area of high mining exploitation and accelerated desertification processes where environmental characteristics such as vapor pressure can affect the abundance of stenohydric species like R. pallescens [65 66]. We suggest that both hypotheses should be evaluated in the future studies.

The serological evaluation of the working dogs showed that one of the working military dogs was infected with T. cruzi. In the Colombian National Army the function of the guard dog is fundamental for troop protection in mission activities where both soldiers and guard dogs remain for long periods within sylvatic areas. These activities have been related to the infection of working army dogs with canine cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia [60]. To our knowledge few studies have explored the CD infection levels in dogs of Latin America. Here we reported a T. cruzi infection in military working dogs of Colombia. However the epidemiological relevance and the veterinarian importance of infected dogs should be determined in the future. Finally the presence of infected stray dogs inside the studied BITER is a finding that draws our attention due to the known role of domestic dogs as synanthropic reservoirs that could generate new transmission foci inside BITERs [67686970].

There are some limitations to the present study. First the results are not supported by a seroprevalence study in the military population present in the four BITERs evaluated. This aspect could be considered in the future. Second Colombia’s National Army has 14 BITERs with many located in municipalities with ecological conditions for T. cruzi transmission and other pathogens transmitted by insects such as leishmaniasis malaria and dengue. We did not include these BITERs in the present study nor did we assess the risk of infection of other diseases transmitted by insects. Future studies should expand the number of BITERS included in the analysis.

This study provides new insightful information on T. cruzi transmission dynamics and the potential risk of oral transmission in an area with non-domiciled vectors in some locations in Colombia including the presence of triatomines adapted to A. butyracea forests and coexisting with synanthropic mammal reservoirs as D. marsupialis. These scenarios require an alternative eco-health (One Health) approach for reducing human–triatomine bugs and human–D. marsupialis contact through: (i) the managing the environment by eliminating palms near lodgings and kitchens; (ii) proper care of area inside battalion or cantonment centers; and (iii) proper waste management. Finally it is necessary to achieve active community participation with the military population an entomological surveillance program led by the staff of each battalion and health educational during the training and re-training activities as a sustainability strategy including regular testing for CD.",,,,,,,,,,,,

BlackRock has been hit by large outflows from some of its best-known US fixed income exchange traded funds this year even as the sector has posted near-record net inflows of $161bn since the turn of the year.

The world’s largest asset manager registered year-to-date net outflows of between 22 and 25 per cent of assets from its iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) according to data from FactSet.

All three ETFs have witnessed greater outflows than any other US bond ETFs this year a total of $23.8bn. Largely as a result the combined assets of the funds have tumbled from $98.6bn to $73.3bn the FactSet figures show. Another BlackRock ETF iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) has seen the fifth-largest outflows as its assets have slipped from $18.9bn to $15.6bn.

“We are on track for potentially another record breaking year breaking 2020’s net inflows record but the heavyweight products from BlackRock have not been the driver” said Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.

The overall US fixed income ETF market remains in rude health. The year-to-date inflows of $161bn equate to 13 per cent of the current AUM of $1.2tn outstripping the equivalent 9.2 per cent figure for equity ETFs.

Industry number two Vanguard has garnered $61bn of this equivalent to 23.6 per cent of its prior assets aided by having the two hottest bond funds the Total Bond Market ETF (BND) and Short-Term Bond ETF (BSV).

The 5.8 per cent net inflows BlackRock has recorded by this metric across its entire US bond ETF range also lag behind those of the next largest participants in the bond ETF market: third-ranked State Street (8.3 per cent) Charles Schwab (24.4 per cent) Invesco (15.2 per cent) Allianz via its Pimco brand (6.5 per cent) and JPMorgan Chase with 29.1 per cent.

BlackRock’s relative weakness does not appear to be due to its product mix. For instance while BlackRock has seen outflows from its range of ETFs that track investment grade corporate bonds with broad maturities such as LQD its rivals’ universe of equivalent funds has taken in money.

The same applies for HYG and TLT’s categories although not for the ultra-short term Treasury bonds and bills targeted by SHV where Goldman Sachs’ equivalent Access Treasury 0-1 Year ETF (GBIL) has also seen sizeable outflows.

Rosenbluth said BlackRock and Vanguard had to some extent “different audiences” which could help explain their divergent fortunes.

“The BlackRock products tend to be used more by institutional investors. Retail and wealth management are often using the Vanguard products. Maybe institutional investors are investing less whereas retail investors are holding steady” Rosenbluth said.

Elisabeth Kashner director of global fund analytics at FactSet agreed saying “even though in some instances their products can be quite similar BlackRock really emphasises trading and liquidity whereas Vanguard lives and breathes for long-term buy and hold investors”.

As a result “BlackRock has designed all of these products to be trader friendly that is more friendly to tactical usage and by golly they are being traded” she added.

“These funds’ flows are notoriously fickle” said Ben Johnson director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “They’re likely to be used by traders looking for liquidity or short-term exposure to a particular corner of the bond market and less likely to be used by long-term allocators.”

Another factor may be the US Federal Reserve’s decision to sell the $6.8bn of corporate bond ETFs it bought to help stabilise the market during last year’s pandemic-driven chaos Johnson said.

LQD had been one of two main beneficiaries of this buying spree. However the other major recipient Vanguard’s Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH) has still taken in a net $6.4bn this year despite the Fed offloading its position.

Vanguard has been growing more quickly than BlackRock more broadly fuelled in part by an internal push to encourage clients to switch from its mutual funds to the equivalent ETFs “so not all of [the inflow] is new money” Kashner said.

Deborah Fuhr founder of ETFGI a consultancy pointed to Vanguard’s cost advantage with its largest ETFs having an asset-weighted total expense ratio of 5 basis points versus 15bp for iShares.

“Vanguard has an ethos of being the low-cost provider. For many as they move to ETFs even from within Vanguard’s mutual fund products that has been a driver of net inflows for them and they get significant income from financial advisers” said Fuhr.

BlackRock’s own data indicated that the bulk of the outflows from its worst-hit ETFs occurred in the first quarter of this year with outflows slowing in the third quarter or even turning positive in some cases. Moreover it noted that some of its US bond ETFs such as the iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (IUSB) and iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) have proved popular this year.

“Our clients from retirement savers to institutional investors turn to iShares for a combination of value and liquidity that helps them to quickly and efficiently transfer risk reposition portfolios or implement hedges” it said in a statement.

“iShares ETFs are a diverse offering of trading and allocation tools to enable critical versatility when navigating a wide range of market environments.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLWFuZC1zdHlsZS9yb3NzLW8tY2Fycm9sbC1rZWxseS10aGUtaGF0ZWZ1bC10aGluZ3MtdGhlLWJsYWNrcm9jay1jcm93ZC11c2VkLXRvLXNob3V0LWF0LW1lLTEuNDY5MDcxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ross O'Carroll-Kelly: The hateful things the Blackrock crowd used to shout at me,"We’re suddenly enjoying the kind of relationship that I had with my old man – in other words standing outside in the pissing rain flinging the old Gilbert around

Sorcha's gone to her old pair's for Sunday dinner while I'm at home looking after the kids – which I honestly don't mind? The triplets are like six years old now and reaching that lovely age where I actually want to spend time with them instead of just throwing a Wagon Wheel into their bedroom locking the door and letting them fight over it to the point of exhaustion.

Yeah no my children are storting to grow on me – and I’m going to shock a lot of people when I say that that has a lot to do with them going to Willow Pork.

Since they storted school there it's been – honestly? – rugby rugby rugby with not a mention of soccer anymore. The search histories on their tablets are filled with Drico and ROG's best bets instead of that I don't know Ronaldo dude and we're suddenly enjoying the kind of relationship that I had with my old man – in other words standing outside in the pissing rain flinging the old Gilbert around.

And it’s lovely for me as their – I suppose – father seeing little flashes of myself in each of them. Leo for instance has my famous side-step while Johnny has my signature acceleration from a standing stort. Randomly it looks like Brian – not Johnny – might end up being my kicker certainly judging from the way he puts his foot through the ball. It’s classic classic me.

I’m showing him how to put more spin on the ball to give his passes more distance and accuracy. I go “Like this Brian” and his little face lights up with the joy of learning something new.

I sometimes think that I should have been a teacher except I’ve got a brain the size of a packing peanut.

“I want to go inside” Johnny goes. “I’m focking storving.”

Yeah no I haven’t given them lunch – or breakfast – just like I always storved myself to give me an extra edge.

I'm there ""You couldn't be storving"" because I gave them each a Dioralyte before we came out – just to keep their electrolyte levels up? ""Give me another hour then I'll let you eat.""

As a coach I would describe myself as firm but fair.

The triplets are like six years old now and reaching that lovely age where I actually want to spend time with them

“Can we phone for a Deliveroo?” Leo goes.

Brian’s like “Five Goys!”

And Johnny's there ""Eddie Rockets! ""

But I’m like “It won’t be burgers and chips goys. I’ll do you some chicken and pasta.”

“Fock that shit” Leo goes.

I’m there “That’s what professional rugby players eat goys – and I’m saying that as someone who’s had the guided tour of the Leinster Rugby Academy. It’s about loading up on protein and corbs.”

""I want McDonalds! "" Leo goes.

I'm there ""No empty calories goys. These are the sacrifices you have to make if you want to play Senior Cup rugby for – yeah no – Blackrock College one day.""

There's a definite quiver in my voice when I say it and I have to admit to having one or two – it might be a word – qualms about training kids to one day wear the colours of the school I hated more than any other. But then I have to rise above it. I have to be mature enough to accept that my rugby-playing days were a long time ago and my children have to make their own histories? If that ends up being in the blue and white stripes of Blackrock then I'll have to accept it and persuade my brain that they're playing for Orgentina.

“Brian” I go “when you make the pass aim for the space in front of the player rather than the player himself. Give him something to run on to – otherwise he’s static when he receives it.”

“Fock this” he goes – he’s definitely not captain material. “I’m going inside.”

Leo’s like “Yeah it’s focking raining” before following his two brothers into the gaff.

I’m there “Do you know why the Leinster Schools Senior Cup is played in January and February instead of April and May? To weed out the wusses!”

But at that stage I’m just a 40-year-old man standing in a downpour shouting to himself.

I follow them into the kitchen. I fill a pot with pasta and water and I throw six chicken breasts under the grill while trying to hide my disgust with them – my children not the chicken breasts.

I’m there “We might look at maybe doubling your daily magnesium and calcium allowance.”

“I want to put my jersey on!” Brian goes.

I’m like “No remember what I said – not in the house.”

But he won’t be told anything – none of them will. They all go chorging upstairs together. And that’s when my phone rings. It ends up being the old dear.

“Hello Dorling!” she goes. “How are the twins settling into their new school?”

I’m like “They’re triplets.”

“What?”

""Er there's three of them?""

“Three? Are you sure?”

""Yeah I think I know how many children I have – under this roof anyway.""

“Why did I think they were twins?”

“Because you haven’t been sober since the Millennium. Who knows what you see half the time – you scrag-faced gulper fish. They’re getting on fine by the way. I’m just cooking dinner for them here.”

""Cooking it? Why don't you just phone for a takeout?""

“Er because I want my kids to know the difference between good calories and bad calories.”

She sort of like chuckles to herself.

She’s like “You sounded just like your father there!”

I’m there “No I didn’t. I’m nothing like him.”

“Chorles had you out in the gorden in all weathers throwing that ridiculous ball around. And he wouldn’t let you eat breakfast or lunch.”

“It was the hunger that made me the rugby player that I very nearly–”

I stop mid-sentence. I literally can’t say another word. Because my three sons are suddenly standing in front of me in their blue and white jerseys and my entire body turns cold. I hang up on the old dear and I realise that I’m actually shaking.

Suddenly it all comes back to me. The hateful things that the Blackrock crowd used to shout at me when I was flashing The Six at them after scoring a try.

There’ll be days when I’m okay with this and there’ll be days when I’m not. Today I’m not. I switch off the grill and I tip the pasta into the sink.

The Navi Mumbai-based scheduled commercial bank is a fully-owned subsidiary of Fino Paytech which is backed by marquee investors such as Blackstone Group Mauritius-based Headland Asian Ventures Fund 3 Ltd (HAV 3 Holdings) Intel Capital World Bank unit and global development finance institution International Finance Corporation (IFC) ICICI Group and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL).

The decision on shareholding dilution will be decided by November.

New York-headquartered Blackstone Group had first invested ₹150 crore (approximately $33 million) in Fino Ltd now Fino Payments Bank for a significant minority stake in July 2011. With an expected valuation of ₹5300 crore for the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) its 15.13% stake in the company is now valued at more than ₹800 crore.

Thus the investor is set to make annualized returns of close to 18% with its initial investment growing by more than 5.3 times according to VCCircle estimates.

IFC has made a cumulative investment of ₹31.28 crore since 2007. That stands at more than ₹413 crore now. This translates into over 21% annualized returns and 13 times return on cumulative investment in absolute terms.

Intel Capital has invested just over ₹36 crore in Fino Paytech till date. Its stake value exceeds ₹406 crore at the given valuation which is more than 11 times its cumulative investment. This sums up to annualized returns of 21%.

Headland Asian Ventures (formerly HSBC PE Asia) has put in ₹69 crore and is sitting on more than ₹608 crore at the time of IPO. This turns out to be annualized returns of over 20% and close to nine times returns in absolute terms.

Emailed queries sent to the investors and Fino did not elicit a response till press time.

Fino has already expressed its intent of looking to raise a pre-IPO round and a rights issue of ₹75 crore at the holding company level (Fino Paytech). “The proceeds of this rights issue will go to a microfinance subsidiary Fino Finance Pvt. Ltd"" a senior executive familiar with the deal said on condition of anonymity. “The asset-light model is helping us scale up faster. We operate a three-layered pyramid which is helping us to digitize cash for remitters merchants logistics and e-commerce firms and individuals"" the person said.

If the listing goes ahead as planned it will be the third IPO for a Blackstone portfolio company this year after Sona Comstar and TaskUS.

A fourth portfolio company Aadhar Housing Finance has also filed for a listing.

IFC Intel Capital and other investors are also likely to rake in near-benchmark returns with Fino’s IPO which received the go-ahead from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) last week.

Fino however will be required to collapse the holding company Fino Paytech which it plans to do with the help of a reverse merger of the entity with the bank. A merger of Fino Paytech with the payments bank could help shareholders realize value said the executive mentioned above. However there may not be any “major exits by strategic investors"" the executive said.

Fino is slated to be the first payments bank and likely to be the first profitable fintech player to hit the Indian stock exchanges. The bank turned profitable in Q4FY20 and has remained profitable since then. For FY21 Fino made a profit after tax of ₹20.5 crore compared with a loss of ₹32 crore in FY20. It had filed the preliminary IPO papers in the last week of July. Since then the senior management has been doing road shows meeting 5-8 investors every day.

The IPO includes a fresh issue of ₹300 crore and an offer for sale component of up to 1.56 crore of equity shares according to the draft red herring prospectus. It also intends to do a pre-IPO fundraise aggregating to ₹60 crore.

It hurts the core of us.”

The group Native Green is inviting community members and government officials to gather from noon to 4 p.m. Monday at the Pawtucket Veterans Memorial Park near City Hall and across the street from the recently erected statue of the white settler for whom the Blackstone Valley and Blackstone River are named.

PAWTUCKET R.I. — Members of the Narragansett Indian tribe and other advocates will rally on Indigenous Peoples’ Day demanding the removal of a statue of the Rev. William Blackstone the first English settler in what is now Rhode Island.

Noka said the statue of Blackstone who owned 200 acres is a constant reminder of the land taken from the Narragansett tribe. And Native Green said the statue will stand as a reminder of “the Doctrine of Discovery that fueled the land-stealing and slaughter of our Indigenous People.”

“This is the Doctrine of Discovery and later Manifest Destiny” Native Green steering committee member Cristina Cabrera said. “This is the narrative behind colonizers — that this colonizing force on this land was driven by God sanctioned by God that they were entitled to these lands and they held little to no regard for the existing culture the aboriginal peoples.”

But Robert Billington president and chief executive of the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council said: “We don’t know him as a colonizer. We have been doing research and not finding him to be anything other than this odd loner that found his way here.”

Billington noted that Blackstone is considered the first white settler in what is now Rhode Island arriving before Roger Williams Rhode Island’s founder. But he said he has seen no evidence that the minister tried to organize colonists against Native Americans. “From what we are reading he lived peacefully” he said.

If research unearths negative information about Blackstone that should be presented to the public too Billington said. He said the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council is supporting the project that includes the statue because it helps educate people about the region “and that is what we are chartered to do.”

“To whitewash a story or clean up a story — that is not what we are engaged to do” Billington said. “So if there is any truth about Blackstone in a negative light we will tell that story. The great thing about the sculpture is the intent is to inspire questions and wonder and stories. Whether it’s a good story a bad story an ugly story it’s going to be told.”

The 14-foot stainless steel statue was erected in August depicting Blackstone riding a bull while reading a book. According to the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame Blackstone owned an “extensive library” and “the eccentric cleric sometimes visited Providence for supplies books and other necessities traveling to and fro perched on the back of a large white bull.”

The statue’s concept began taking shape more than five years ago with a discussion between Pawtucket businessmen Louis Yip and Sunny Ng and designer Morris Nathanson according to The Valley Breeze newspaper. Yip and Ng paid about $40000 for the statue which was created by Peruvian-born Rhode Island sculptor Peruko Ccopacatty and it is on land owned by Yip and Ng.

Critics are objecting not only to the statue but also to the city’s decision to spend $1.8 million in federal Community Development Block Grant funds to improve the area around it.

Emily Rizzo spokeswoman for Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said the city was not involved in choosing the statue and she said work on the surrounding area which hasn’t been completed represents an extension of the Blackstone River Bikeway and will provide greater public access to the Blackstone River.

But Cabrera questioned the decision to spend a significant amount of federal funds for this kind of work when the community is grappling with the pandemic and has an urgent need for housing and other services. She said the public was not given an adequate opportunity to provide input and she said the application for federal funding did not mention the statue.

“So here money is being given to the city with the intent of supporting outdoor activities the bike path but under-girding all of this is a political statement” Cabrera said. “This is a public statement in downtown Pawtucket at a crucial intersection. It’s on private property but it’s on a public corner — not in someone’s backyard where no one sees it.”

Grebien issued a statement on Friday saying he met with the Native Green group to hear their concerns.

“They stated that they felt the city’s involvement and the process was not transparent or public” he said. “The city believes the process was followed. We are in the final stages of bringing in an outside attorney to assess the documents and process related to the project to ensure transparency and create a trust that the process was followed.”

Meanwhile Grebien said “The city has been working with the Native Green group to support the Indigenous People’s Day event to make sure their event at the Veterans Amphitheater is successful.”

Blackstone was a priest in the Church of England the precursor to the Episcopal Church in America.

But the Rt. Rev. W. Nicholas Knisely bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island issued a statement saying that in 2009 the Episcopal Church repudiated the “Doctrine of Discovery” which he described as “the world-view which allowed Blackstone and his followers to take land from its inhabitants.”

“It is regrettable that such a monument would be approved and given municipal funding without seeking more input from our Indigenous neighbors” Knisely said. “Colonizers like Blackstone are a troubling feature of our American history and we would do well to reflect on the opinions of those who were on this land before us when considering such commemorations.”

Looking ahead Knisely said “We can only hope that this statue does indeed spark more conversation and a deeper look into the wrongdoing of the past as the organizers of this effort say is their intent.”

Then They Disappear. (Published 2021),"“If you remember me at all you remember the shy slight discomfited and fatherless soul known to inhabit every little nothing town like ours” Wayland Maynard ex-resident of Shireburne Vt. writes to his former neighbors in 2020 in a confessional manuscript describing events that took place more than 40 years earlier.

It was then that 8-year-old Wayland saw his father the town’s “gentle prim fastidious” barber shoot himself in the head. The note he left behind also serves as the title of this strange and engrossing novel I AM NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM (Blackstone 229 pp. $25.99) the sixth by the reliably creepy Eric Rickstad. It’s both an intriguing message and a red herring. The reader will entertain many incorrect theories before arriving at the shocker of a finale.

Among the many extant mysteries: Why did Wayland’s mother toss out all her husband’s belongings and never mention him again? Who was the menacing sharp-faced stranger dead leaves swirling at his feet who threatened his father at his barbershop? (“Who do you love more?” his father asked Wayland after the stranger left. “Your mother? Or me?”)

Rickstad has an elaborate old-fashioned style of narration. He sends us hurtling down one path before yanking the reins and pulling us in another direction. Soon we are in a tale not just of profound misunderstanding but also of dynastic wealth and dysfunction of how money and power can warp a community. The creepiest thing of all: when we discover the true meaning of the mysterious note."

""Additional spacecraft and component testing will be conducted in the coming weeks to further explore contributing factors and necessary system remediation before flight.""

In 2014 NASA's Commercial Crew Program selected Boeing and SpaceX to provide astronaut transportation to and from the space station awarding both companies multibillion-dollar contracts. SpaceX has already launched two operational missions to the orbiting lab with its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule and is gearing up for a third liftoff on Oct. 30 . The company also launched a crewed test flight to the station called Demo-2 in May 2020.

Starliner has yet to carry astronauts however and cannot do so until it aces an uncrewed test flight to the space station.

As its name suggests OFT-2 will be Boeing's second crack at that crucial mission. On the first try which launched in December 2019 Starliner suffered multiple glitches  got stranded in the wrong orbit for a meetup with the station and landed after circling Earth solo for three days.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9sYW5kLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvYXJteS1hd2FyZHMtYm9laW5nLWNoaW5vb2stY29udHJhY3QtZGVzcGl0ZS1saW5nZXJpbmctdGVjaG5pY2FsLWlzc3Vlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Army awards Chinook contract to Boeing despite lingering technical issues,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army has awarded Boeing a $391 million contract to build the first lot of five CH-47F Block II aircraft for the active force as the service and the company continue to address technical issues with the program.

Boeing said earlier this year it was confident it would win a first production contract in fiscal 2021 to produce the latest variant of the cargo helicopters. The company said the program is still on track to deliver CH-47F Block II aircraft to the first Army unit in 2025.

Boeing is already in the midst of delivering the first of the special operations variant — the MH-47G. The contractor has 24 on order.

The Block II version features new rotor blades fuel system and electrical system and it has a stronger airframe that brings the Chinook up to a maximum gross weight of 54000 pounds.

The contract kicks off a series of production purchases the Army did not want to make. The service proposed only buying G-model versions of the newest variant to free up funding for its future vertical lift endeavors.

But Congress disagreed.

In the FY21 budget lawmakers funded five Block II variants for the active force. Both chambers indicated they would like to include funding in FY22 bills to buy more of the variant but the defense policy and budget bills are yet to become law.

The Army originally planned to conduct a limited-user test in March 2021 but canceled it after testing in 2020 identified issues including excessive vibration from the new Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades.

“The Army delayed execution of the CH-47F Block II Limited User Test (LUT) previously scheduled for March 2021 due to technical challenges” the service said in a recent statement. “The Army is working with Boeing to address these technical challenges.”

A report from the Pentagon’s chief weapons tester noted the vibrations present in the ground hover and forward flight could pose “safety of flight risk.” Boeing has maintained the problems are not safety issues.

“We’re working closely with the Army on a mitigation system or an adjustment to existing mitigation systems to account for that different vibration frequency” Andy Builta Boeing vice president and H-47 program manager told Defense News earlier this year. “It is in no way a safety of flight risk but it is an issue that needs to be addressed going forward.”

The company may adjust or add dampeners to address the problem.

“This is a low-risk well-known activity that we’ve done across multiple platforms” he noted.

Boeing also encountered problems with the fuel cell failing to self-seal in ballistic tests but the firm is now testing a redesigned version at Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland.

The Block II variant returned to some testing this past spring and began to log flight hours again. The company proved the new variant’s rotor blades can handle an additional 2500 pounds of lift and the company continues to run ground tests on the new blades.

The test is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program which sees the space agency working with private companies like Boeing and SpaceX to shuttle astronauts to the station.

NASA said Friday that the team behind OFT-2 ""is working toward launch opportunities in the first half of 2022."" That follows a scrubbed launch this past August. In December 2019 the first major Starliner flight test didn't go as planned with the uncrewed spacecraft launching but experiencing a timing glitch and failing to reach the ISS. It did however safely return to Earth.

The issue now with OGT-2 has to do with an ""oxidizer isolation valve issue on the Starliner service module propulsion system"" NASA said Friday in a blog post.

""This is a complex issue involving hazardous commodities and intricate areas of the spacecraft that are not easily accessed. It has taken a methodical approach and sound engineering to effectively examine"" Steve Stich manager of the Commercial Crew Program at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida said in the post.

In addition to trying to achieve NASA's goal of ""safe reliable and cost-effective access to and from the International Space Station and low-Earth orbit"" the Commercial Crew Program ties in with the space agency's Artemis and moon to Mars plans. Artemis calls for putting the first woman and next man on the moon sometime soon and eventually setting up sustainable exploration there. Knowledge gained from Artemis will be put to use in getting ready to send astronauts to the red planet.

So far SpaceX and its Crew Dragon spacecraft have had better luck than Boeing when it comes to the Commercial Crew Program. After some delays of its own the Elon Musk-founded company completed its Demo-1 uncrewed test mission in 2019 and has since shuttled astronauts to the ISS several times. Earlier this week NASA said it was reassigning a pair of astronauts from Boeing missions to an upcoming SpaceX mission. In April NASA announced it had selected SpaceX to provide the human landing system for the Artemis program.

There's a space-tourism angle for SpaceX as well. In June the company signed a deal to send space tourists to the ISS starting next year (at a reported $55 million price tag per seat). And last month SpaceX took a step in that direction when its Inspiration4 mission sent a crew composed of private citizens orbiting around the Earth.

It's not clear when exactly Boeing's Orbital Flight Test-2 will happen.

""Potential launch windows for OFT-2 continue to be assessed by NASA Boeing United Launch Alliance and the Eastern Range"" NASA said in its post.

Across the East River from the Lower East Side the Brooklyn-side shoreline zigzags inward to form Wallabout Bay. This funky stretch of waterfront once home to Lenape tribespeople and early Dutch settlers began its modern life as an innovation hub in 1801 when President Adams designated it one of the country’s first Navy yards; during its World War II heyday it operated six dry docks and employed 70000 workers. More recently the since-decommissioned site has been reborn as a hotbed of tech companies and creatives the home address of healthcare incubators furniture startups small-batch juice purveyors cutting-edge military-gear makers film sound stages and the country’s largest rooftop soil farm.

Until now the majority of redevelopment in the Brooklyn Navy Yard has entailed adaptive reuse of its industrial warehouses. Enter Dock 72 the first ground-up commercial office building to be erected right on the waterfront (and in fact one of the largest such structures to be built in the city’s outer boroughs in many decades). The 16-story volume with base building design by S9 Architecture sits prowlike on a skinny pier sandwiched between two former dry docks and culminating in a new ferry terminal. In 2015 as construction documents were being drawn up codevelopers Boston Properties and Rudin Management tapped Fogarty Finger to start conceptualizing interior architecture—from FF&E to art curation—for the entry-level lobby and commissary second-floor fitness center and penthouse-level conference center totaling some 60000 square feet of amenities. WeWork had already signed on as anchor tenant and the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation was naturally involved too meaning there were many stakeholders to please—and to align. “Those many players had so many different opinions which is so New York right?” says Fogarty Finger director Alexandra Cuber who led the project with associate director Candace Rimes. “From that delightfully tangled knot of ideas and individual preferences we had to come up with a strong concept that had enough nuance and depth that everyone could see themselves in it and find a piece they’d contributed to.”

Capped by a wood-slat drop ceiling the 170-foot-long terrazzo-floored lobby corridor with a Dan Funderburgh mural and custom benches doubles as a lounge.

Ultimately the design team sought to channel both the can-do spirit of the 300-acre industrial park and what Cuber calls its “nautical messaging”: the unique sun-bleached rust-tinged palette and omnipresent visual language of ship details and graphics. As a guiding narrative she and Rimes homed in on the Plimsoll Line a technical symbol on every ship’s hull that denotes the proper immersion level given its load and the density of the water it’s traveling through. FF commissioned a rendering of Plimsoll markings in yellow neon which now glows beaconlike at the Dock 72 entry—setting the stage for the subsequent journey.

Guests check in at a blackened-steel reception desk in the lobby.

It’s quite a journey indeed from the front door to reception at the far end of the building accessed via a 170-foot-long corridor with a glass wall directing eyeballs to the active adjacent dock. “To make that lengthy pathway an enjoyable process required breaking it up into ‘rooms’ that could be occupied and experienced” Cuber explains. Changes in ancillary seating (from low- to high-back) and flooring (dark- to light-gray terrazzo) demarcate a series of vignettes along this promenade. So do blackened-steel screens and portals that cast a spirited shadow play and reflect the linearity of ship cables sails and razzle-dazzle camouflage.

Farther down the corridor a custom steel screen joins Andrew Neyer’s Astro pendant globes and Sputnik stools by Mattias Ljunggren.

In addition to subdividing space the steel portals also frame wall murals by area artists who were given free rein to devise compositions that spoke to the context but assigned a specific color palette reflecting a different type of water from the Plimsoll Line. Bryce Wymer’s depiction of ship-wrangling in a tropical storm pays homage to women who worked in the yard during wartime; an abstract color field by Kristin Texeira who has a studio in the complex is painted in summer-water hues.

The murals reflect another guiding principal of the project: a commitment to

locally made design. All art and much of the custom furniture were produced in or near the Navy Yard. “We were passionate about finding the right partners and a diverse group of collaborators” Rimes notes. “It pushed us to go the extra mile: We walked all around Crown Heights Bushwick Greenpoint and throughout the Navy Yard to find who can make what or submit an idea.”

And elevator cabs function as intimate viewing rooms for large-scale Navy Yard photographs by Harrison Boyce.

The 16th-floor conference center with a subdividable 200-capacity town hall space plus various lounge and meeting areas is no exception to the city-made mandate with shapely mirrors by Bower Studios and stacked-stone tables by Souda. What’s different up here is a shift in vibe and materiality from the pre­dominant white-oak millwork of the lower levels to warmer walnut tones and a darker palette. “The colors become saturated and inky as if they’ve been soaked in water” Rimes says. “It’s like being on the deck of a vintage yacht.” A perfect launching point for next-gen captains of industry.

The five-year grant to Bridge Over Troubled Waters from the Liberty Mutual Foundation will help the nonprofit address some pre-existing infrastructure needs; expand housing that allows young people an opportunity to live independently as they build the financial resources to find an apartment; and boost outreach.

“We are so grateful to Liberty Mutual for its investment in our comprehensive approach to helping vulnerable young people experiencing homelessness” CEO Elisabeth Jackson said in a statement.

Bridge Over Troubled Waters said homelessness among people between the ages of 14 and 24 is growing and many of them are physically and sexually abused.

Developer pays $10M for Becker College properties

A developer who paid $10 million for 27 properties in Worcester once owned by now-closed Becker College said he plans to return some buildings to single-family homes affordable market-rate apartments and student housing.

Russ Haims of Hampton Properties LLC closed on the sale Friday The Telegram & Gazette reported. The purchase includes 24 buildings and three parking lots.

He said he wants to protect the neighborhood known as Elm Park.

“It’s still such an attractive neighborhood it doesn’t have to be rebuilt — it has to be repositioned” Haims said.

The city previously bought some Becker College properties. Leicester has agreed to pay $20 million for Becker’s campus in that town.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvc3BvcnRzL2Jhc2ViYWxsL2RhdmlkLXJvYmVydHNvbi10YW1wYS1iYXktcmF5cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Robertson's Journey from the Olympics to the Rays' Postseason Roster,"BOSTON — The pitching arm is extremely demanding. You can’t just ignore it and expect it to work when you need it. Thankfully though it isn’t picky. Just ask David Robertson.

Ten weeks before he returned to the majors with the Tampa Bay Rays to face the Boston Red Sox Robertson needed somewhere to pitch. It was late June and he had already helped the United States Olympic team qualify for the Tokyo Games. But the international tournament was weeks away and Robertson’s arm was begging for competition.

So Robertson suited up for an amateur men’s league team at Cardines Field in Newport R.I. not far from his home in Barrington. He pitched two innings but does not remember the name of his team.

“I had to give my jersey back; I didn’t want to take it from ’em because I wasn’t coming back” Robertson said on Sunday before a somewhat higher-profile game at Fenway Park. “I know it was the Sunset League though and I was definitely the oldest guy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xMC90cmF2ZWwtc3Rvcnkv0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9uaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL3RyYXZlbC1zdG9yeS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cliff House Maine is the essence of getting away far away,"Escape is subjective when it comes to vacation vibe.

For some escape means finding a spot where you can just be; where you need not do much more than settle into a magical spot you’ve found that just feels completely away.

For others it’s setting up a comfortable base camp centered around all kinds of side trips like hikes biking trails shopping dining; whatever strikes your mood.

And then there’s me: I want to have my settling-in spot but leave it too. But does such a spot — one that combines the very best of both of those goals — exist?

As evidence I present the Cliff House Maine (cliffhousemaine.com) where on a crisp early-autumn getaway I found all the magic I could want — and even left some aside to discover next time.

It’s no surprise that the Cliff House has sat on its dramatic 70-acre jaunt of craggy coast for nearly 150 years.

Opening in 1872 the Cliff House was very much a family project. Just after the Civil War the Boston and Maine Railroad announced they’d be adding a spur to York Maine.

Eliza Jane Weare wealthy wife of Capt. Theodore Weare lived nearby and saw the opportunity.

She invested their money and purchased Bald Head Cliff planned a resort and enlisted her brother to build the original hotel.

It was built with wood cut from nearby family land and milled in their sawmill in Ogunquit as locally sourced as could ever be.

Her goal then was to provide comfortable rooms and settings fine food relaxation and excursions all on and along the dramatic setting of Bald Hill.

While the Cliff House has seen many incarnations since that time (including being taken over by the military as a radar station to look for Nazi submarines during World War II) my recent visit proved that Eliza Jane’s vision is still intact.

Today’s Cliff House which includes a spa added in the early 2000s and a major recent renovation that not only added a wing but lifted ceilings expanded windows and more maintains the original vibe in a nautical yet modern setting.

I headed to the Cliff House on a Sunday morning in late September.

A quiet coastal road winding along the seashore led me to the entrance of the Cliff House less than two hours from Boston proper. The entry road winds through thick trees and then pops out on a magnificent rocky cliff where the resort is tucked perfectly into the landscape.

“Every movie ever should be shot here” I thought as I sat out on my room’s balcony and watched the ocean do a dance off the rocky cliffs and ledges that are the foundation of the property as a whole.

You could plant yourself at the Cliff House for an entire visit (weeks even) and never tire of it.

There are — in season — two pool areas; one for families and one for all. There are multiple dining choices from the farm-to-table joy of The Tiller to the old-school Maine (but with a twist: lobster tater tots? Be still my heart!) of Nubb’s Lobster Shack and things in between (like Bald Head Coffee and the Cove Bar and Grille).

Their spa is worthy of an entire day — when you visit set aside that time. I treated myself to an amazing facial and savored the sauna and fitness room (Pelotons and more).

Their relaxation room needs no piped-in music; the sound of the sea is the most soothing thing one can imagine. I sat sipping an herbal tea and staring out at the crashing waves and dramatic coast.

I chose to leave my room slider open each night just to be lulled to sleep by that same sound. It’s truly nature’s music.

You can walk the grounds as well taking in views up and down the Maine coast. It’s not unusual to spot amazing seaside wildlife as you walk too.

Like I said I could tuck in and stay there forever (and this winter when it is open Thursdays through Sundays I can imagine taking a winter escape there to do just that).

But there are places to go and things to see so I did what I love just as much and set out to explore.

Ogunquit is a perfect little Maine town. It has a fun and walkable downtown area where you can poke through galleries and shops — and find every kind of dining. There’s Nubble Lighthouse a breath-taking spot that reminds me of the feel I get on the southwest coast of Ireland.

There are beaches too from expansive ones that draw many visitors to tiny inlets with sand that feel like your own private spot.

I walked Marginal Way a kind of mini Newport Cliff Walk that not only took me past amazing properties but gave me a chance to watch a gaggle of surfers practicing their sport on a bright autumn day.

Perkins Cove just down the road from the Cliff House is a tiny peninsula of fun food and the foamy sea of Maine. (Photo by Moira McCarthy)

There’s Perkin’s Cove a spot that’s like a mini version of Rockport. With little shops great lobster rolls at The Lobster Shack and a cool footbridge to walk over it’s a special place.

I spent three days savoring the resort itself and the sites around it and left wanting more.

Alone on this escape I chose to dine at the bar of The Tiller on night one. There while savoring seared scallops on lobster fried rice (bartender’s suggestion; one of the best meals I’ve had in years) I made friends. One couple had just been married the night before. Another was on their last day of an escape from Boston. Everyone it seemed knew one another.

As I walked back to my room that night I saw an open seat at the fire pit. I settled in and asked a couple next to me where they bought their glasses of champagne.

“The Tiller!” the man told me then said “But we have an extra glass and more bubbly!” He poured me one because at the Cliff House everyone is a friend.

I felt welcomed comfortable and happy.

As I dozed off to the sound of the crashing waves that night I thought “As Eliza Jane meant it to be.”",,,

People with AFib are at a high risk for stroke because their heart rhythm is abnormal. Chaotic electrical impulses can cause blood to pool in the heart which can lead to blood clots. An AFib diagnosis can often mean a lifetime of blood thinner medications but in David’s case the WATCHMAN™ was a better option.

What Is a WATCHMAN?

The WATCHMAN is a device designed for people with AFib to close off the part of the heart where blood clots that can lead to strokes are most likely to develop. This area is a small pouch in the left atrium called the left atrial appendage (LAA). Its purpose is not well understood because it does not serve a cardiovascular or other physiological function. However blood cells tend to stick together inside the LAA and can form clots. When a WATCHMAN device is implanted in the LAA it expands and closes the LAA off to the rest of the heart preventing blood from pooling and a potential clot from escaping thus eliminating the need for blood thinners.

“Studies have shown that the WATCHMAN is effective in preventing strokes related to AFib without being on blood thinners” said James Oujiri MD electrophysiologist with the Froedtert & MCW health network. “For patients who cannot tolerate blood thinners or who have a high bleeding risk this device may be a great alternative.”

WATCHMAN for Atrial Fibrillation

David Fleming atrial fibrillation patient

David was diagnosed with AFib and atrial flutter in 2018. His primary care doctor referred him to Dr. Oujiri after an episode of AFib sent David to the hospital. Dr. Oujiri performed an ablation procedure at Froedtert Hospital to relieve David’s AFib symptoms and prescribed blood thinners to reduce David’s risk of stroke.

Around the same time as the ablation David was being treated for an enlarged prostate. When he noticed blood in his urine he brought his concerns to his urology and cardiology teams at Froedtert Hospital. With this new increased bleeding risk they agreed that closing off David’s LAA with a WATCHMAN would be the best way to protect him from a potential stroke.

After the procedure people are required to take blood thinners for 45 days while the lining of the heart grows over the device to prevent clots. But a national clinical trial that was enrolling patients at Froedtert Hospital was designed to evaluate the WATCHMAN without blood thinners after the procedure only anti-platelet therapy and aspirin. David was approved for the device through the ASAP-TOO clinical trial.

“My doctors had extensive knowledge about the latest treatments” David said. “I truly appreciated that because it meant this clinical trial was available to me.”

The WATCHMAN Procedure

David’s WATCHMAN procedure was in August 2020 at Froedtert Hospital. The implantation took about an hour and was done under general anesthesia. The first step was a transesophageal echocardiogram so that Dr. Oujiri could visualize the LAA. LAA anatomy can vary in size and shape for each individual and the echocardiogram ensures the device will be a good fit. The imaging is also important to guide the placement of the device.

The procedure does not require any incisions in the chest. Instead through a small incision in the femoral vein near the groin a catheter is used to guide the device into position inside the LAA where it will expand and seal off the opening.

The team at Froedtert Hospital has been implanting the WATCHMAN since 2015 when the device was approved for use by the FDA and is a leading implanter of the device in the state of Wisconsin. Froedtert & MCW patients benefit from the combined expertise of an interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist during the procedure.

“My team was top notch” David said. “I felt very well taken care of every step of the way.”

David spent one night recovering in the hospital after his procedure. After a few days at home he went back to work as an attorney. A month later he returned to Froedtert Hospital for another echocardiogram to check the positioning of the device and to ensure the medication regimen set by the clinical trial without blood thinners was working well.

Long-term results from two randomized clinical trials found that people with a WATCHMAN reduced their risk of a disabling or fatal stroke by 55% compared with people who are being treated with blood thinners. David said he has also been able to stay more active than he was on the blood thinners which helps him be a caregiver to his elderly mother. He feels an overwhelming sense of relief.

“Having peace of mind and knowing that I’m not going to have a stroke takes away so much anxiety” David said. “Having this device gives me a great sense of comfort.”

They hire the chief executive are stewards for its thousands of vulnerable patients organize big-ticket fund-raisers and in some cases give millions of dollars themselves.

While the volunteer board position carries complex demands it also puts the trustees in direct contact with the institute’s doctors and scientists who are on the front lines of the race to cure cancer.

And with that it has also given some trustees a unique opportunity for personal enrichment.

The Globe Spotlight Team has identified at least seven trustees who have personally invested in Dana-Farber startups including one trustee who cofounded five startups and saw his stock shares in one soar by tens of millions of dollars this fall.

Dana-Farber has long supported its trustees who decide to invest in its research believing the work of its scientists could be better leveraged into pathbreaking treatments and profits with access to the venture capital and financial expertise some trustees could bring.

But it is a practice by trustees that is prohibited at two of the nation’s major cancer centers and that raises ethical questions about the appropriate role for leaders of a nonprofit hospital.

And on Wednesday after Spotlight reporters had been questioning hospital leaders on its investigative findings Dana-Farber abruptly reversed course and two longtime trustees resigned.

“We continue to refine our approach” trustee chair Josh Bekenstein and trustee vice chair Richard Lubin wrote the Globe “to ensure that when someone with cancer walks through Dana-Farber’s doors they know they can trust that the entire organization is completely focused on helping them achieve their best possible outcome.”

The new policy they said bars all trustees from newly investing in or serving as a board member or executive of a company primarily created to license Dana-Farber technology.

Bekenstein and Lubin in the letter denied that there had been any trustee improprieties or that any member of the board had unduly profited from Dana-Farber research.

The Spotlight investigation focused on several potentially lucrative ventures joining trustees’ wealth and market expertise to Dana-Farber’s scientific findings.

FOR ONE COMPANY THAT TRUSTEE MARC COHEN LAUNCHED

BASED ON DANA-FARBER DISCOVERIES

THE VALUE OF HIS SHARES WENT UP BY

ABOUT $85 MILLION

AS OF LATE SEPTEMBER.

Marc Cohen a longtime trustee entrepreneur and venture capitalist launched five startups grounded in Dana-Farber research between 2008 and this year raising some eyebrows when he participated in negotiations with the hospital’s licensing officials over the financial terms for his first three such firms. For one company that he launched based on Dana-Farber intellectual property C4 Therapeutics the value of his shares had gone up by roughly $85 million as of late September.

C4 based in Watertown has just started clinical trials targeting multiple myeloma and lymphoma.

Cohen who made his fortune as a technology entrepreneur resigned from the board after the policy change saying he planned to focus instead on advising a Dana-Farber venture philanthropy fund an initiative he is “incredibly proud of.”

Marc Cohen who became a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute trustee in 2004 has founded five startup companies based on discoveries made by Dana-Farber scientists.

The Spotlight Team’s examination of publicly available documents identified seven people who were invested in startup biotechnology companies based on the institute’s discoveries while serving as trustees.

Also at least nine trustees have leadership positions in venture capital or other investment firms that have shares in at least one startup born of Dana-Farber research.

Because most of these startups are privately held and not required to disclose investors the number of trustee-investors could be higher. Dana-Farber officials have declined to give the Globe a full list of trustees who have invested in the institution’s roughly 50 startups.

The hospital’s engagement in such ventures is of itself no surprise. Boston is among the world’s capitals in biomedical discovery an economy of innovation that begins at the intersection of laboratory research and finance where ideas become companies with dreams of bringing new healing technology to the sick — and profits to investors. It is work that begins with the glimmer of a concept and often federal research dollars but eventually needs private financing to bring to market.

Many of the major hospitals in town are engaged in this work partnering with existing pharmaceutical companies or licensing their discoveries to investors in exchange for cash or a stake in the new startup. But Dana-Farber has been among the most aggressive and entrepreneurial in pursuing venture capital money which has helped propel the hospital to a leading place in the world of cancer research — and the hope of capitalizing on it — but also opened it to hard questions.

When pressed by the Globe over the past several months Dana-Farber officials consistently defended the institute’s policy of allowing — even explicitly supporting — trustees who decide to invest in its biotech startups saying that trustees had been increasingly interested in such a role and that prohibiting the practice would hurt the institute’s ability to attract qualified trustees.

But after Globe reporters asked executives and trustee investors for details on this largely confidential practice board leaders wrote to the Globe Oct. 6 to announce a change in the rules.

Bekenstein and Lubin who revealed the change rejected with vehemence any “insinuation or allegation” that trustees have ever put the potential for personal gains above their duty to safeguard the interests of Dana-Farber and above all its patients.

But these types of investments by hospital trustees which have faced little public scrutiny until now have troubled even some inside Dana-Farber — including on its board.

“This has always been controversial” said one trustee who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to talk about board deliberations. “Trustees are not supposed to gain anything from being a trustee. The idea that trustees could make money from research didn’t look good to people. But others felt that trustees should be permitted to take a risk on this research.”

The Dana-Farber trustees include some of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in Boston and beyond and their role on the board gives them direct access to some of the institute’s top cancer researchers. Many trustees come from the world of venture capital and private equity: Bain Capital for instance has five top executives on the Dana-Farber board.

These broader ties have been applauded by some as the reason why Boston has become a vibrant hub of innovation; others including some rank-and-file physicians worry that this is contributing to a focus on profit-seeking in medicine that can distract from patient care.

Investing in pharmaceutical startups is far from guaranteed profit — many lose money. But some investors such as Cohen have enjoyed generous returns even when the new treatments didn’t pan out.

It can take many years for any scientist’s novel idea for a drug treatment to be tested on patients and then potentially brought to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval. Hospitals engaged in such work typically provide lab space and help pay the scientist’s salary but it takes another infusion of cash often by an established drug company or a startup based on private investors to run the costly clinical trials and see if the results merit seeking regulatory approval.

It was Cohen’s involvement in negotiations with Dana-Farber on behalf of his startup drug companies from around 2008 through 2015 that legal experts say raised conflict-of-interest questions. The negotiations concerned the financial terms on which he licensed Dana-Farber’s intellectual property for three of his companies. Legal experts say this may have conflicted with his role as a trustee — as he would be vying to get the best deal for his private companies but also had a loyalty to Dana-Farber.

Cohen in a 90-minute interview with Spotlight reporters late last month defended his dealings and said that since becoming a trustee in 2004 he had always followed Dana-Farber’s lead on what was and was not allowed.

“Had they said you can’t do this I obviously wouldn’t have done it right? I was looking to them to guide me” he said in the Zoom interview. “I was focused on how do I get this [intellectual property] out there so we can create new therapies for patients.’’

Later in 2017 the board adopted a policy that attempted for the first time to manage conflicts involving trustees who invest in the institute’s startups. The policy specifically barred them from negotiating with Dana-Farber personnel on behalf of a startup including on licensing deals as Cohen had done. However that policy was notable for supporting trustee investments.

He told the Globe in late September that he didn’t know about the policy until last year when he reached out to the licensing office regarding another deal with a Dana-Farber related startup.

During the interview in which he was joined by Dr. Kenneth Anderson a renowned multiple myeloma researcher at Dana-Farber with whom he has formed several companies Cohen acknowledged that he knew his personal role in creating startups drawing on Dana-Farber research while a trustee could raise objections. As a result he asserted that he went out of his way to give Dana-Farber “better-than-market terms in all those deals’' when it came to the amount of equity granted to the institute.

He declined to disclose the actual terms.

Bekenstein and Lubin in their Oct. 6 letter to the Globe offered some support on this score saying the institute received “substantial and fair value’' in its licensing deals with Cohen and others.

“The financial arrangements have been consistent with industry standards and previous [intellectual property] licensing arrangements’' said Bekenstein co-chair of Bain Capital and Lubin co-founder of the private equity firm Berkshire Partners. “Implications otherwise are not true.”

Bekenstein and Lubin declined Globe requests for interviews.

Access to trustee investments and market expertise can as the hospital has contended expedite research and new treatments at great potential benefit to desperate patients. But this process of trustee engagement is nonetheless largely opaque to patients who may receive experimental doses of the new drugs and to the public generally and it is controversial at some leading US medical centers. It creates potential conflicts of interest at the highest level of an institution and worries about whether trustees’ financial interests can influence governance of the hospital including research priorities.

Some at Dana-Farber believe that the sizable presence of venture capitalists hedge fund managers and private equity investors on the institute’s board as well as the investments by some distorts the institution’s sense of its mission.

“At worst it’s pay to play’’ said one longtime scientist at Dana-Farber who did not want to be identified because he is concerned about repercussions for speaking out against his employer. “They make donations and get advantages that allow them to capitalize on early discoveries.”

THE SPOTLIGHT TEAM IDENTIFIED

SEVEN PEOPLE

WHO INVESTED IN STARTUPS BASED ON DANA-FARBER DISCOVERIES

WHILE SERVING AS TRUSTEES.

The Globe analyzed hundreds of publicly available records including Securities and Exchange Commission filings tax filings and the market data website Pitchbook and identified seven current or former Dana-Farber trustee-investors.

Among them are Malcolm Salter a Harvard Business School professor who is now retired and who invested in three of Cohen’s Dana-Farber startups: $150000 in C4 Therapeutics starting in December 2015 $25000 in Raqia Therapeutics in 2020 and $25000 in NextRNA Therapeutics in 2021. His shares in C4 Therapeutics were worth nearly $650000 as of late September; that information is not public for Raqia and NextRNA.

Salter who joined the board in 1998 also resigned this past week after Dana-Farber changed its policy saying he like Cohen will focus on advising the institute’s venture philanthropy program.

New England Patriots owner and longtime trustee Robert Kraft well-known for his philanthropic support for cancer care helped bankroll at least two of Cohen’s Dana-Farber startups. The extent of Kraft’s investments was unavailable through public documents. Kraft did not respond to the Globe’s questions.

The Globe review also found that three of the trustees who have top jobs in firms that have invested in Dana-Farber startups specialize in overseeing health care portfolios: Phill Gross of Adage Capital Management and Andrew Kaplan and Christopher Gordon of Bain Capital. Gross declined to comment and a Bain spokesman said the firm’s Dana-Farber trustees were not directly involved in the decision to invest in these startups.

Dr. Steven Joffe interim chair of the Department of Medical Ethics & Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said the public may question trustees’ motivations in stepping up to make these investments.

“You want them to become trustees because they care about the institution not because they want to get in on the ground floor of these deals’’ he said.

Dana-Farber’s trustee-investment policies are unusual

Dana-Farber has long stood out when it comes to managing trustee investments: It was the only hospital contacted by the Globe that had adopted a written policy that explicitly supported trustees who decide to invest in its startups. At the same time however its 2017 policy also attempted to mitigate conflicts and additional rules for trustees were added in 2020.

The Globe surveyed the top 10 cancer hospitals ranked last year by US News & World Report as well as Boston’s six other academic medical centers. Spokespeople at five institutions said they have not had trustees investing in hospital startups.

Two major cancer centers Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles prohibit trustees from investing in startup companies.

Boston Children’s Hospital also adopted a policy in 2020 that prohibits trustees from investing in spin-off companies “developed by or in close collaboration with Boston Children’s in which we have significant equity ownership or participate in company governance” a spokeswoman said.

The Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Medicine said they have “a few’' trustee investors but they would not provide details. The remainder of the institutions did not respond or said they have no idea whether trustees invest in this way and face ethical conflicts.

Despite having more than 300 biotech startups based on researchers’ discoveries Mass General Brigham the parent company of the two hospitals could not provide a list of trustee-investors because it “does not have a formalized process to track this” practice said Rich Copp then a spokesman for the organization. The Globe identified at least one trustee-investor there Jonathan Kraft president of the Kraft Group and chair of the Mass General board of trustees which invested in Spero Therapeutics.

In Boston these investments are occurring in a city where academic medical centers are frequently allies with the turbo-charged biotech industry — in ways beyond trustees investing in startups.

Marc Cohen (left) and Malcolm Salter had been longtime Dana-Farber Cancer Institute trustees before stepping down from the board this past week. Cohen and Salter flanking Dana-Farber chief executive Dr. Laurie Glimcher created a program that invites wealthy individuals to invest in a venture capital fund - if they agree to donate money to support Dana-Farber's research. Dana-Farber

A Globe Spotlight report published in April found that Boston’s hospital presidents as a group including chief executive Dr. Laurie Glimcher at Dana-Farber worked as paid corporate board members for for-profit drug and health care companies far more than their counterparts in other major cities.

Glimcher for instance receives $1.8 million in annual compensation from Dana-Farber and also works as a paid board member at GlaxoSmithKline and Analog Devices positions in which she receives a total of more than $300000 annually in cash and stock.

Glimcher declined to comment for this story.

Those who support the practice of trustees investing in hospital startups argue that these individuals are making a financial gamble and should be allowed to do so as a show of support for Dana-Farber.

Salter the longtime trustee who taught at Harvard Business School said he invested in C4 and joined the company’s board of directors in 2015 because he was impressed by the company’s novel approach to not just inhibiting disease-causing proteins but actually destroying them.

“When I invest in these companies I don’t ask myself how much money I can make. I’m asking myself how much money I can lose? How much money can I lose to support this project?” Salter said during an interview at his Cambridge home.

The 2017 Dana-Farber policy was clear about the potential for “actual or perceived conflicts of interest” when trustees invest. It also pointed out that the practice might be more common at Dana-Farber in part because it has a large board.

A Globe survey found that Dana-Farber has the largest board among the nation’s top cancer centers — a size that some institutional governance specialists say is designed more to boost fund-raising than offer strong oversight. The board includes 62 “governing trustees” who have voting power and another 100 or so trustees who can attend meetings join special committees and participate in forums with Dana-Farber scientists.

Not all trustees have embraced the chance to risk their money on a Dana-Farber startup.

Michael Champa a retired technology entrepreneur who served as a Dana-Farber trustee from 2009 to 2018 declined the opportunity. “I just didn’t see the need to mix my investment activities with my philanthropy’’ Champa said. “To me they are sort of two different worlds.’’

In general the widespread infusion of venture capital and private equity money into cancer research has brought applause but also some unease. Some top hospital researchers worry about how this superheated market may skew clinical research priorities.

Not long ago Dr. Dan Vogl a blood cancer specialist and director of the Abramson Cancer Center Clinical Research Unit at Penn Medicine said a biotech company asked him to review their clinical trial plans. He suggested broadening the criteria for eligible patients even including those who had previously gotten no benefit from similar drugs. That he said is the best way to find out if a drug works in the real world. The company did not see it that way.

“They wanted to strictly limit which patients could enter to those most likely to have a response’’ he said. “They needed to be able to show investors the drug would work to get more money in the early stages” for further trials. That he warned “can subvert the scientific process.’’

Marc Cohen: Dana-Farber’s active trustee-investor

Among Dana-Farber’s outsized roster of trustees none appears to have been as active as Marc Cohen when it comes to betting on the institution’s pioneering cancer research.

A 58-year-old Harvard University graduate who lives in McLean Va. just outside Washington D.C. Cohen started making his fortune through a technology company that he and his brother Alain founded in the 1980s. OPNET Technologies started as a “tiny garage operation” based on a data network modeling and simulation system that Alain made as a project while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology according to media accounts.

Marc Cohen told the Globe that several family members have died of cancer sparking his interest in helping to develop potential treatments. His relationship with Dana-Farber began in the early 2000s when development office staff invited him to a presentation for donors and potential donors given by scientists to discuss their research.

Dana-Farber Cancer Institute along with its partner Brigham and Women's Hospital is the fourth best cancer hospital in the country according to a 2021 survey in the US News & World Report. About 75000 patients a year come to Dana-Farber for chemotherapy and other treatments. Many are enrolled in the institution's more than 1000 clinical trials. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff

One of those scientists was Anderson the multiple myeloma specialist who would later become a key collaborator of Cohen’s in creating startup companies.

“I expressed a lot of interest in how we get these ideas out the door to patients’’ Cohen said in the interview with the Globe. “There was so much research going on and very little of it going out.’’

He said he was asked to join the board as a governing trustee in 2004. He also co-chaired the Dana-Farber committee on blood cancers and was a member of the trustee science committee. Both committees host meetings in which trustees have direct access to scientists.

Several years after joining the board Cohen made his first foray into launching a biotech company with a promising experimental drug developed by top Dana-Farber and Harvard Medical School scientists including Anderson.

Together they founded Acetylon in 2008. At least two other trustees were among those who helped bankroll the company in its early days: Robert Kraft who endowed a Kraft Family professorship given to Anderson and Rebecca Sanders a real estate broker who stepped down from the Dana-Farber board last year.

Soon the company began to test its potential treatments part of a class of drugs called HDAC inhibitors praised by one investigator involved in the clinical trials as “closer to a cure” for multiple myeloma.

Other HDAC inhibitors hadn’t been widely used due to their toxic intestinal side effects and Cohen and Anderson hoped Acetylon’s drugs could sidestep these harsh symptoms by more narrowly targeting certain enzymes that play a role in cancer.

At the time the onus fell more heavily on scientists at Dana-Farber to recruit investors to help move their discoveries from the lab through clinical trials. It was a system that gave potential advantages to scientists with personal connections in Boston’s venture community said Anthony delCampo a consultant who was vice president of Dana-Farber’s Office of Research & Technology Ventures from 2002 through 2011.

DelCampo said Cohen’s ability to drum up millions of dollars in private investments for Acetylon was something of a miracle coming on the heels of the financial crash when traditional capital had largely disappeared.

DelCampo said he worked with Cohen on the deal but that a confidentiality agreement bars him from disclosing the details. But delCampo said the terms were as beneficial to Dana-Farber as they would have been had it been done with an investor without connections to the board.

“I was working on behalf of Dana-Farber and getting the best deal possible for Dana-Farber regardless of the person on the other side of the table” he said.

Cohen said Harvard a co-licensor with Dana-Farber “made the ultimate decision in the deal terms” so he had less of a direct conflict.

Anderson as an inventor and Dana-Farber stood to make millions of dollars if Acetylon’s drugs were successful. Both Anderson and Dana-Farber officials said they were mindful of conflicts of interest notifying patients in Acetylon clinical trials of the institute’s financial interest among other measures.

Acetylon’s HDAC inhibitors did not turn out to be the blockbuster treatments Cohen and Anderson had hoped for. A larger drug company Celgene eventually bought Acetylon for $196 million in 2016 with potentially billions in royalty payments if any of the company’s drugs became a successful cancer medication. But Celgene soon closed most of the clinical trials.

Dana-Farber received $5.7 million from the sale institute spokeswoman Ellen Berlin said in an e-mail and records show that Anderson was paid $1.9 million.

Cohen would not say how much he received in the sale.

C4 Therapeutics located in the Arsenal Yards neighborhood in Watertown was created in 2015 based on discoveries by scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Cohen also participated in negotiations for the licenses from Dana-Farber for two other biotech companies he helped found OncoPep in 2010 and C4 Therapeutics in 2015. As with Acetylon these negotiations mostly involved how to divide any profits between the hospital and the startup.

In 2014 the year before he started negotiating for the C4 license Cohen said he got a call from Dana-Farber’s general counsel at the time Richard Boskey asking him to modify his role at the institution.

“I had no inkling that this was going to come” Cohen said. “[Boskey] basically said that there was another category called the non-voting trustee and because I was involved in company formation that it would just be a lot simpler if I transitioned to that new category.”

Cohen said he immediately agreed. “My focus isn’t to attend meetings but to help to figure out how to bring out new therapies to patients” he said.

This scenario involving a trustee with conflicting roles in negotiations raises red flags among health care law experts. “This is not an ethically ideal way to do this” said Harvard Law School professor Glenn Cohen.

Douglas Mancino a health care lawyer in Los Angeles who represents nonprofit organizations including hospitals said that a trustee negotiating this type of deal is legally permissible if the institution can show the trustee did not obtain the license for less than market value. But these investors can put up a tough fight he said. “Venture capitalists in my experience extract a pound of flesh.’’

In the end though these types of insider negotiations can look suspect Mancino said and “should be subject to heightened scrutiny’’ such as hiring an outside consultant to value the intellectual property and requiring other trustees not just hospital staff who might feel intimidated by a trustee to approve the deal.

Cohen declined to answer questions about his personal investments in each of the companies and how much he has gained or lost.

Dana-Farber officials also said the Acetylon clinical trials conducted at Dana-Farber were reviewed by a special External Safety Monitoring Board composed of specialists not affiliated with the institution.

And a conflict-of-interest management plan prohibited Anderson who directs the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber from “participating in overseeing or taking part in any decisions about this trial” spokeswoman Berlin said.

The trials at Dana-Farber were instead conducted by Anderson’s close colleague Dr. Paul Richardson.

DANA-FARBER HAS BEEN PART OF

ABOUT 50 START-UP COMPANIES

BASED ON ITS SCIENTISTS' WORK.

HOSPITAL OFFICIALS DECLINED TO SAY

HOW MANY OF ITS TRUSTEES ARE INVESTORS

IN THOSE COMPANIES.

C4 Therapeutics becomes popular among trustees

Another Dana-Farber startup company launched by Cohen attracted significant interest from trustees or their investment firms. In 2015 he incorporated C4 Therapeutics and soon after secured the license to Dana-Farber technology developed in the field of targeting disease-causing proteins for destruction.

With this license the company was able to woo tens of millions in investments.

Federal securities filings show that more than a dozen Dana-Farber trustees have financial connections to the company either through direct investments or through their investment firms. Salter joined as an early board member — he said because the company included his sister’s disease as one of its targets — and has seen the value of his investment in the company soar.

The Globe estimates that Cohen himself invested no more than $14 million of his own cash along the way. His shares were worth nearly $100 million as of late September not including the substantial value of his stock options. Cohen in an interview did not dispute the Globe’s calculations.

C4 Therapeutics ended its licensing agreement with Dana-Farber last year and Berlin said the institution sold its stock in the company earlier this year for $29 million.

Underscoring its support for trustee-investments Dana-Farber included in its 2017 policy a reference to a special fund designed for high-wealth individuals — then-called the Gemini Fund — that would enable trustees as well as others to invest in a for-profit fund as long as they first contributed to a philanthropic fund.

This fund was the brainchild of Cohen and Salter and was more than 10 years in the making they told the Globe.

The executive committee argued that this plan would ameliorate the potential for conflicts of interest because trustees would not choose the specific research and companies that would receive those funds.

Gemini evolved into a partnership between Dana-Farber and MPM Capital that launched in 2017. MPM manages a $100 million venture capital fund designed to invest in startups from Dana-Farber and elsewhere and the hospital manages a $26 million philanthropic fund that investors must donate to in order to participate.

But in keeping with the general secrecy around trustee investments Dana-Farber would not share details on which trustees have put their own money in the funds.

Cohen acknowledged that he participated explaining that he needed to “put my money where my mouth is” when pitching the funds to other investors but he declined to share the size of his contribution. “It’s personal” he said.

Salter said he couldn’t afford the $250000 minimum for the investment fund in tandem with the $125000 minimum for the philanthropic funds. “I’m not in that category” Salter said.

Dana-Farber policy reversal a significant shift

The new policy that prohibits trustees and their immediate family members from making new investments in startups based on Dana-Farber technology among other restrictions marks a major shift.

It will also impact dozens of trustees who help run investment firms that in some cases have substantial biotech portfolios. The new policy says they must “take appropriate steps” to ensure that confidential information they learned on the Dana-Farber board isn’t used to make investment decisions.

Bekenstein and Lubin asserted that Dana-Farber has long shown strong oversight in managing trustee conflicts of interest.

“When potential conflicts of interest arise we have managed them diligently based on strong policies and oversight and we regularly review these policies to ensure that they are aligned with our commitment to our patients and the independence of our research” they wrote.

Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on October 11 2021

Dorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. In recognition of his research on climate change MIT invited him to deliver the John Carlson Lecture which takes place every year at a large venue in the Boston area and is meant to “communicate exciting new results in climate science to the general public.”

Then the campaign to cancel Abbot’s lecture began. On Twitter some students and professors called on the university to retract its invitation. And sure enough MIT buckled becoming yet another major institution in American life to demonstrate that the commitment to free speech it trumpets on its website evaporates the moment some loud voices on social media call for a speaker’s head.

But there is more to this story than meets the eye. For although most outlets have covered Abbot’s disinvitation as but the latest example of an illiberal culture on campus it is qualitatively different from other recent instances in which invitations have been rescinded—and suggests that the scope of censorship is continuing to morph and expand.

Is Abbot a climate-change denier? Or has he committed some terrible crime? No he simply expressed his views about the way universities should admit students and hire faculty in the pages of a national magazine.

Back in August Abbot and a colleague criticized affirmative action and other ways to give candidates for admission or employment a leg up on the basis of their ethnic or racial identity in Newsweek. In their place Abbot advocated what he calls a Merit Fairness and Equality (MFE) framework in which applicants would be “treated as individuals and evaluated through a rigorous and unbiased process based on their merit and qualifications alone.” This Abbot emphasized would also entail “an end to legacy and athletic admission advantages which significantly favor white applicants.”

There are rational grounds for criticizing Abbot. In the conclusion to his piece for example he made an ill-advised comparison with 1930s Germany:

Ninety years ago Germany had the best universities in the world. Then an ideological regime obsessed with race came to power and drove many of the best scholars out gutting the faculties and leading to sustained decay that German universities never fully recovered from. We should view this as a warning of the consequences of viewing group membership as more important than merit and correct our course before it is too late.

Abbot seemingly meant to highlight the dangers of thinking about individuals primarily in terms of their ethnic identity. But any comparison between today’s practices on American college campuses and the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime is facile and incendiary.

Even so it is patently absurd to cancel a lecture on climate change because of Abbot’s article in Newsweek. If every cringeworthy analogy to the Third Reich were grounds for canceling talks hundreds of professors—and thousands of op-ed columnists—would no longer be welcome on campus.

Meanwhile Abbot’s beliefs about affirmative action right or wrong are similar to those held by the majority of the American population. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for example 74 percent of Americans believe that in making hiring decisions companies and organizations should “only take qualifications into account even if it results in less diversity”; just 24 percent agreed that they should “also take race and ethnicity into account in order to increase diversity.” Similarly in a 2020 referendum on affirmative action 57 percent of voters in California—a very liberal state that also happens to be majority minority—voted to uphold a ban on the practice.

Campaigns to cancel public appearances by controversial figures are in many cases motivated by the expectation that they will express some of their offending views at the event. When violent protests stopped far-right polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at UC Berkeley in 2017 for example the organizers had every reason to believe that he would repeat his most inflammatory claims.

Even when protesters oppose appearances by controversial public figures who are set to speak on topics that are not in themselves controversial they normally object to them because there is some connection between a speaker’s controversial views and their general area of professional expertise. Those who oppose talks by Charles Murray about topics that are unrelated to race for example argue that his writings on the supposed differences in average IQ between racial groups call his expertise as a social scientist into doubt.

Even though I strongly disagree with Murray’s views on race and find Yiannopoulos to be a trollish provocateur I have also disagreed with attempts to stop either of them from going through with their talks. As the Yale professor Nicholas Christakis succinctly put it “There is no right to be invited to speak at a college. But once a person is invited a college should never yield to demands to withdraw an invitation.”

But Abbot’s case is far more shocking than that of either Murray or Yiannopoulos. That’s partly because his opinions are much less extreme. It is also because the views that provoked such controversy are completely unrelated to the subject on which he was invited to lecture. “Omg how did *anyone* in @eapsMIT think this was ok?” read one tweet calling for the cancellation of Abbot’s lecture referring to MIT’s Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “As an alum I’m asking you to fix this—now. Totally unacceptable and sends a message to any student that isn’t a white man that they don’t matter and that EAPS isn’t serious about (and is actively hostile towards) DEI.”

MIT did not rescind its invitation to Abbot in the expectation that he would repeat his views about affirmative action. Rather he was disinvited from one of the most important research universities in the world because it could not tolerate that a scientist be permitted to speak about his uncontroversial research after daring to express unrelated views that although controversial happen to be held by a majority of the American public.

In the end a conservative professor invited Abbot to hold his lecture at a small academic center at Princeton on the same day. MIT when it cancelled his lecture invited him to give a scientific presentation to a much smaller audience of EAPS professors and graduate students. As is frequently the case with these kinds of controversies any one instance can viewed in isolation come to look like a big storm in a small teacup.

And yet the principle that MIT has effectively established is deeply worrying. For it would if other institutions should follow the university’s example amount to a severe restriction on the ability of Americans to disagree with a specific set of beliefs about how to remedy injustice without raising the risk that they might no longer be able to carry on their work even if it is completely unrelated to politics. In effect this would create a prohibition on controversial political speech for all academics—and eventually perhaps professionals in other highly visible domains.

MIT’s decision is not just another in a long series of campus controversies then. It sets a precedent that will unless it is forcefully resisted pose a serious threat to the maintenance of a free society.",,,,,,

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS9jcmltZS9zdGFyci1icm93bi10cmFuc2dlbmRlci13b21hbi1raWxsZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black transgender woman Starr Brown shot to death in Memphis. Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

The guy who told me this once adopted King Kong Bundy’s cat so I figured it was good advice. It was. Lots of hardcore wrestling matches use fluorescent light tubes; when broken they create a massive plume of glass and dust and apparently mercury vapor. I knew this—even the part about the mercury vapor—but I was warned the hotel ballroom had terrible ventilation. It does. The advice was solid. In fact: From now on whenever I watch one man smash a fluorescent tube over another man’s head I will wear a mask.

I needed that advice because last night I attended a wrestling show at the Showboat Hotel in Atlantic City N.J. In its later years Showboat was actually the boardwalk’s most fun casino but it closed as part of Apollo Global Management’s driving of Caesars Entertainment into bankruptcy. It’s now owned by a Philadelphia developer Bart Blatstein. There’s an arcade and a bar. And there’s a ballroom which in the last few months has become the East Coast mecca for “hardcore” wrestling—matches featuring weapons like light tubes barbed wire panes of glass etc.

The company that’s led this charge is called Game Changer Wrestling. You can tell it’s a hardcore wrestling company because it has a stupid name. No matter. It has been putting on shows since 2015 when indie wrestler Danny Demanto and former Combat Zone Wrestling referee Bret Lauderdale bought Jersey Pro Wrestling and renamed it GCW. It has expanded a bit since then but its “home” seems to be the stupid ballroom at the stupid former casino that’s now just a hotel and arcade.

It’s great. Last night was packed. The crowd was hot for much of the night. One of the reasons was GCW’s top star Nick Gage a hardcore wrestler who robbed a bank on a whim in 2010 and became a much bigger star after getting out of prison. But yeah. There was another actual reason this was the hottest indie show I’d been to in some time: Jon Moxley was wrestling Gage.

Moxley before he became a star as Dean Ambrose in WWE was a wrestler in smaller more violent outfits like CZW. I have seen him wrestle in arenas in dingy halls in a ring in the middle of a field I think and now at a closed casino in A.C. Since leaving WWE he’s done a bunch of hardcore matches—his wife understands though she tweeted “I absolutely hate this” yesterday—and last night was his second appearance in GCW. Last month Moxley actually won the GCW world title from Matt Cardona who wrestled for 15 years in WWE as Zack Ryder.

Moxley is no longer in WWE. But he is still a big star! He was AEW’s champ for most of 2020 had some great feuds and his loss to current champ Kenny Omega really helped kick off AEW’s hot run in the last year. His “death match” in AEW was a bust; last night Gage ripped his forehead open with light tubes sent him into barbed wire and used a pizza cutter on his forehead. It's harder to screw that up than an elaborate pyrotechnic display. This stuff can be pretty gross made even grosser by seeing dozens of fans in front of you recording it on all on their phones so they can go back and watch the blood later. Of course I was doing that as well. I am gross too.

Dan McQuade

Isn’t this just wild? Moxley a star on a weekly national TV show who was the focal point of it for nearly all of 2020 wrestling in a former casino getting bloodied up maybe getting mercury poisoning fighting this dude who robbed a bank a decade ago. Moxley's AEW contract allows him to freelance basically and so he’s wrestled in several independent shows since leaving WWE in 2019.

He wasn’t the only AEW wrestler on last night’s show. Recent AEW signee Lio Rush a GCW regular was on the opening match. Joey Janela and Marko Stunt who are regularly on AEW wrestled as a tag team. (Stunt appeared to injure himself midway through the match and at one point mouthed something like “What am I supposed to do?”; Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful later reported “he’s OK.” I later walked into Stunt while looking at my phone like an idiot and he seemed fine when we both said “Excuse me.”) Thunder Rosa also an AEW regular was a surprise entrant into one match. And it wasn't just AEW wrestlers. Chris Dickinson and Alex Zayne wrestled on both Ring of Honor TV and at last night’s GCW show. The Briscoes a longtime ROH tag team came out as a surprise at one point to challenge GCW wrestlers

A match where Thunder Rosa locks up with a wrestler named Gringo Loco would not really be all that exciting to me normally. (Your mileage may vary.) But a match in an indie fed at a weird venue with Rosa as a surprise entrant somehow becomes fascinating. You’re getting to see a wrestler you normally see on TV and in the wrong place! There’s something special about that.

In the summer of 2019 I went to a match run by the EVOLVE promotion at the 2300 Arena in South Philly the old ECW Arena. As part of a working agreement it was broadcast live on the WWE Network and a few WWE wrestlers were on the show. Matt Riddle faced Drew Gulak and Adam Cole defended the NXT title against Akira Tozawa. Great. At the end of the show NXT’s Johnny Gargano came out to talk about all the different wrestlers on the show. “Professional wrestling in two thousand nineteen is pretty freakin’ cool” he said.

If you watch this clip on Peacock you can see me in the center of the crowd in a bright blue cat shirt scoffing at the speech giving my friend a look and covering my face with my hands. Gargano may have been corny. But he was right! This can help the big promotions too. One of the reasons AEW has been so hot recently is Kenny Omega showing up in Impact with the AEW title (and winning Impact’s belt as well before losing it to Christian Cage another AEW guy). Thunder Rosa was more over last night than I’d ever seen her. Ring of Honor is probably going to get a boost by letting the Briscoes appear in GCW.

Wrestling promoters are justifiably scared of letting their talent work other promotions—after all a big star might be booked to lose making the promotion look weak. But come on. Everyone watching wrestling knows it’s scripted. It will be fine when Jon Moxley eventually loses back the GCW title to Nick Gage. It won’t hurt him in AEW. When wrestlers get to do a little freelancing—wrestling in Japan wrestling in American indies whatever—everybody wins.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However in many cases cannabis construction in these municipalities has led to the multi-million-dollar rehabilitation of obsolete industrial facilities.

Chicago-based Cresco Labs LLC had its first harvest two weeks ago at its newly opened 110000-square-foot facility at 210 Oliver Drive in Marshall the former site of a Win Schuler and Campbell Soup Co. factory.

“A ton goes into (choosing the location) because the building has to function as an indoor horticultural facility so it’s unique in that it has to have facilities for horticulture product manufacturing a distribution hub with warehousing and you need office space too” Cresco Labs CEO and co-founder Charlie Bachtell told MiBiz.

Securing the vertically integrated cannabis company’s first Michigan location took nearly four years and a collaboration with local investors Bachtell said. The Southwest Michigan location was appealing in part because it is a short drive from the company’s Chicago headquarters he said.

At some point Cresco plans to get into the retail side of cannabis in Michigan whether that means opening its own dispensary or acquiring existing locations Bachtell said.

“There are groups that are well-established and buying up smaller (retail and industrial) locations that couldn’t make it” said Stephanie Goodman CEO and founder of Waterford Township-based Bricks + Mortar Group LLC real estate development company. “We’re also seeing larger investment firms moving in and seeing leasebacks at some locations.”

Among the recent cannabis M&A deals Cloud Cannabis Co. in early September acquired a 70000-square-foot commercial grow facility in Kalamazoo Township from cannabis company KKind. The acquisition was the next step for Cloud cannabis to become fully vertical.

Rehabbing properties

Meanwhile long construction lead times and high materials costs are causing larger operators to buy up properties with a building on it that can be redeveloped or existing cannabis businesses said Bill Bussey senior broker for retail at Bradley Co.

“It’s several million dollars to build out a grow facility” Bussey said. “If you find one that’s already up and running and has customers already that puts you in business a lot sooner than building from scratch.”

Also municipalities are increasingly zoning dilapidated buildings and stretches of industrial property for cannabis uses to improve parts of the city.

“Muskegon treated it kind of how cities did with opportunity zones” Bussey said. “They picked areas they have been trying to redevelop for years and it’s really paying off. They are renovating and rejuvenating whole areas of the city because of that.”

Over the past year Grand Rapids had six industrial properties in various stages of redevelopment for commercial cannabis growing operators. Company executives have said that while new tax revenue from retail sales garners public attention rehabbing industrial properties has been an often overlooked positive aspect of the industry.

“A lot of municipalities say ‘no’ at first and then when they see the sky doesn’t fall and there are great benefits from a community workforce and revenue standpoint they start to get more and more comfortable with opting in” Bachtell said.

Bricks + Mortar Group’s transaction rate tends to trend upward when a new municipality has opted in to allowing recreational uses Goodman said.

“We’ve done about 140 transactions over the past couple years and it increases as a city opts in and we’ll have a flurry of activity” Goodman said.

The overwhelming majority of deals Bricks + Mortar Group works on are located on the east side of the state with only about 10 to 15 sales in West Michigan Goodman said.

“The west side was slower to opt in but there are municipalities opting in” Goodman said. “It is also more densely populated in the Detroit area. We have more property available in Muskegon but it’s been a lot slower and when we list one in Detroit it’s gone in two days.”

As well Goodman hopes to see an increase in facilities that lease industrial space to cannabis growers. These property owners can still charge more per square foot than typical industrial uses but it also could remove barriers for companies that couldn’t afford their own building.

“There is a big need for facilities for lease as a lot of people might be getting cut out of the industry because they are not able to get into a space” Goodman said.",,,,,,,,,

The sleek and modern Capital One Hall is nestled in the triangle marked off by the beltway the Dulles Toll Road and Route 123 in Tysons Virginia. On Saturday night the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra returning to live performance for the first time since the start of the pandemic christened the venue’s main auditorium a 1600-seat hall that will host Broadway productions comedy and concerts by local groups including the National Philharmonic and the Virginia Chamber Orchestra.

Access by car was easy with ample parking and the McLean Metro station on the new Silver Line is a short distance away. Although it was like a ghost town at street level on the rooftop of the complex is an open-air green space called The Perch. In the hours before the performance it was bustling with people eating and drinking at two restaurants listening to live music in an amphitheater space and letting children run around all eleven floors above the ground.

Conductor Christopher Zimmerman described the program as centered on rhythm and dance works of music celebrating the return to something like normal after a year and a half of online listening. Audience size was limited to allow social distancing and proof of Covid vaccination was required to enter the building. The audience sang along with the traditional season-opening rendition of the national anthem the sound invariably muffled by their masks.

The opening work Suite No. 1 from Manuel de Falla’s ballet The Three-Cornered Hat had a solid trumpet fanfare in the “Introduction.” The dance rhythms of the other four movements were not always ideally coordinated but Zimmerman’s crisp gestures kept the ensemble on track. The string sound was often quite thin among the violins and especially the violas but there were fine solos from bassoon flute and oboe.

Balances fared better in the Cello Concerto No. 1 by Camille Saint-Saëns with Zimmerman helping to craft a cozy envelope of sound for his soloist Amit Peled. The cellist projected his sound clearly in the opening salvos of the first section with a creamy tone on the lyrical passages high on the A string and fierce double-stops.

The strings danced delicately in their serenade introduction to the second section with Peled soaring on a dulcet legato adding resonant bass notes in the transition to the finale. At a breakneck tempo managed skilfully by Zimmerman Peled rocketed through the tricky sixteenth-note licks adding a mournful poignancy to the lament sections. Minor weaknesses appeared here and there in the accompaniment but overall this was a powerful rendition.

At the start of the second half Zimmerman introduced a piece not on the program. He took the piano part in his own arrangement of the Geistliches Lied of Johannes Brahms with four principal string players taking the choral parts of this gorgeous motet (“Laß dich nur nichts nicht dauren mit Trauren”). Dedicating this lovely prayer to the 700000 victims of the pandemic Zimmerman asked for silence at its conclusion creating a quasi-liturgical moment.

It was a bit of a shock to shift gears then into Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony the work Wagner labeled “the Apotheosis of the Dance” for its “blissful insolence of joy.” Zimmerman aimed for quick pacing which his players could accommodate for the most part with some imprecision in the first movement in the strings and flute. The entrances by the French horn were hit and miss. The high point was the second movement a crisply marshaled funeral march with expressive phrasing.

The rambunctious third movement had better coordination across the orchestra including much more reliable horn playing in the pastoral Trio. Zimmerman’s tempo for the exuberant finale was overly optimistic perhaps but in spite of some shortcomings the ensemble held on valiantly.

The acoustic of this new auditorium is quite clear without being truly warm so that the solo cello carried well without being clothed as it would be in a more resonant space. This left a sense of distance between the players on a proscenium stage with a shell wall behind them and the listener. Like most multi-use spaces it is likely generally suitable for all the types of music that will be heard there.

(Rain Date Sunday October 17th)

Music Dancing Artisans Food Vendors Crafts Patios and Beer Gardens!

It’s back! The Harvard Square Business Association is excited to announce the return of the 42nd Annual Oktoberfest on Sunday October 10th.

This annual celebration of Fall will present four stages of live music featuring an eclectic array of genres including Funk Gospel Latin Swing Classic Rock Traditional New Orleans Jazz Folk and World music. In addition we’re thrilled to introduce Floor Lords a world-renowned hip-hop dance group who have shared the stage with notable performers such as Run-DMC Madonna and Jennifer Lopez!

We’re also welcoming back a Harvard Square classic The Rocky Horror Show. This live stage musical whose cast will perform selections from their production makes a triumphant return on October 14th for a two-week run.

Within and beyond the festival grounds Harvard Square’s favorite restaurants have taken to the streets with outdoor dining patios. Deliciousness awaits you from casual to high-end and everything in between! Order a cocktail or a beer and raise a glass to this beloved and boisterous Fall tradition!

Denise Jillson executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association said “Oktoberfest 2021 will be unlike those of recent memory. As always there will be lots of music dancing artisans food vendors crafts and beer gardens. This year we’re also spotlighting square-wide eateries and retailers. To help support our businesses who have been struggling over the past 19 months we are making it easy and fun for folks to seek out old favorites and discover new ones.”

Jillson went on to say “For the first time ever in lieu of our traditional Oktoberfest beer gardens we are highlighting established patios and eateries both inside and outside of the festival area. We will not place vendors in front of existing businesses giving both greater visibility. We’re enthusiastically encouraging our retailers to open their doors wide decorate their windows light up their storefronts and spill out onto the sidewalk!”

Additionally the Rotary Club of Cambridge “Chalk-on-the Walk” art installation will transform Church Street into a colorful display of artistry and creativity.

Oktoberfest in Harvard Square was started in 1978 by the late Frank Cardullo a Square mover shaker and owner of the renowned Wurtshaus which served up traditional German food from 1917 until it closed in 1996. The early festivals were in keeping with old world customs. Over the years the festival has taken on a more discerningly Cambridge vibe to become an Oktoberfest unlike any other! Sadly this year the HONK! Parade will not take place due to ongoing COVID concerns. We look forward to next year and are delighted to showcase this year’s entertainment line up!

In the century since the cupola atop the Carondelet Street building — especially when illuminated at night — has become an icon on the city’s skyline.

Hibernia was founded in New Orleans in 1870. At the turn of the 20th century bank leaders unveiled plans to erect a new bank building. At the time it was completed in October 1921 the 23-story Renaissance-style building was not only the tallest building in New Orleans but also tallest in the state (until the State Capitol was built a decade later). In the 1940s Hibernia’s height made it the perfect choice as home for WDSU-TV the city’s first television station. In its early years the station’s transmitting tower was located on the roof of the building with a studio and offices inside.

Originally the bank’s cupola — 355 feet in the air — was lit as a navigation beacon for ships traveling the Mississippi River. Over the years lighting the cupola for various holidays became a tradition. It was lit in the appropriate colors for Christmas Hanukkah Mardi Gras St. Patrick’s Day the Fourth of July and Halloween.

Capital One acquired Hibernia in 2006 and the office building closed soon after although the bank on the first floor remained open. HRI Properties acquired the building and began a $57.3 million renovation in 2011 converting it into luxury apartments. The cupola was restored and LED lights were added."

The funds come from different settlements Attorney General James has negotiated following her March 2019 lawsuit against the various manufacturers and distributors responsible for the opioid crisis. Attorney General James’ tour will make stops in dozens of New York counties throughout the month of October with up to $1.5 billion in funds going to counties across New York state.

“For more than 20 years the Capital Region has seen the dangerous and deadly results of opioid addiction but today we are bringing good news to the area by announcing that we will deliver up $32 million to the Capital Region to combat the opioid crisis” said Attorney General James. “With these funds we can heal New York and turn the tide on the opioid crisis by investing in opioid prevention treatment and recovery.

“While no amount of money will ever make up for all those we have lost to this lethal addiction these funds will be vital in helping to prevent future deaths.”

The lawsuit Attorney General James filed in 2019 was at the time the nation’s most extensive lawsuit against the various manufacturers and distributors of opioids. These manufacturers and distributors were responsible for heavily marketing opioids to doctors hospitals health care systems and others which led to the overprescription of the drugs across New York and the rest of the nation over the last two decades. The manufacturers named in Attorney General James’ complaint included Purdue Pharma and its affiliates as well as members of the Sackler Family (owners of Purdue) and trusts they control; Janssen Pharmaceuticals and its affiliates (including its parent company Johnson & Johnson); Mallinckrodt LLC and its affiliates; Endo Health Solutions and its affiliates; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. and its affiliates; and Allergan Finance LLC and its affiliates. The distributors named in the complaint were McKesson Corporation Cardinal Health Inc. Amerisource Bergen Drug Corporation and Rochester Drug Cooperative Inc.

Last month a settlement with Endo was announced that has already delivered $50 million to New York State and Nassau and Suffolk counties to combat the opioid crisis and remove the opioid manufacturer from New York’s ongoing opioid trial.

Also last month a settlement that secured more than $4.5 billion — at least $200 million of which will be earmarked for New York — from the Sackler family and foundations that they control ends the Sacklers’ ability to manufacture opioids ever again and will shut down Purdue Pharma was announced.

In July a settlement with McKesson Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen that will deliver up to $1 billion to New York state to combat the opioid epidemic was announced.

In June a settlement that ended Johnson & Johnson’s sale of opioids nationwide and that will deliver $230 million to New York alone was announced. The deals with Johnson & Johnson McKesson Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen have a global value of approximately $26 billion.

The cases against Mallinckrodt and Rochester Drug Cooperative are now moving separately through U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

The trial against the two remaining defendants — Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and Allergan Finance — is currently underway and continues in state court.

Pursuant to the new law establishing the opioid settlement fund all funds collected by the state from opioid settlements or litigation victories will be allocated specifically for abatement efforts in communities devastated by the opioid epidemic and will not go towards the state’s general fund.

Every region in the state will receive millions of dollars for prevention treatment and recovery programs to combat the opioid crisis.

The figures listed below represent the minimum and maximum amounts each county can receive from the settlements with Johnson & Johnson McKesson Cardinal Health Amerisource Bergen and Endo. The more localities across the state that agree to the terms of these different settlements the more each locality is eligible to receive. The figures below do not include payments from Purdue Pharma or the Sackler family as the regional split for those payments are still being finalized. Those funds as well as any funds from future or ongoing litigation would be in addition to what is listed below.

Capital Region Total: $17812303.23 – $32524114.04*

• Albany County: $3237298.22 – $5725907.53**

“The opioid epidemic has devasted our communities across New York state” said State Sen. Neil Breslin. “The ‘HealNY’ tour is desperately needed and the funding is critical for the reduction of opioid use in our state. Attorney General James has been relentless in her battle against opioid use and holding the pharmaceutical companies responsible.”

“I would like to express my gratitude for a job well done by New York Attorney General Letitia James as it relates to the agreements reached with the large multinational players that were involved in fueling the opioid and heroin crises” said State Assemblymember John T. McDonald III. “As one of the few practicing professionals in health care that is a member of the Legislature I am keenly aware of the practices that fueled the crisis and as a former mayor and current legislator I am even more familiar with the impacts this crisis has had on individuals their families and our communities.

“The up to $1.5 billion secured by Attorney General James will be spent wisely and appropriately in the areas of education treatment and recovery in accordance with legislation I sponsored to make sure there is a dedicated fund for the money secured. As much as money will not bring back the lives lost nor heal the pain suffered I am confident that appropriate use of the funding will help prevent more deaths and pain for many families.”

“I am pleased to join Attorney General Letitia James as she visits the Hope and Healing Recovery Center in Hudson Falls” said State Assemblymember Carrie Woerner. “The opioid crisis took a turn for the worse in our region during the pandemic. I am grateful to the attorney general for her work in pursuing lawsuits against the manufacturers and distributors of these highly addictive drugs and securing the opioid settlement funds.

“As the sponsor of the legislation that created the ‘lock box’ for these funds I worked closely with the advocates and recovery warriors who have the insights to know what programs are needed to address the challenges. The resources that will now be available to fund services for prevention treatment harm reduction and recovery will make a significant difference in the lives of people struggling with the disease of addiction.”

“I’m proud that Albany County was one of the first in the state to take on manufacturers and distributors for the damage caused by highly addictive opioids. But to have an ally in Attorney General James who hit the ground running with the filing of a lawsuit on behalf of New York once she took office has helped to truly hold Big Pharma accountable” said Albany County Executive Daniel McCoy. “We lost nearly 100 Albany County residents in 2020 alone as COVID-19 has thrown gasoline on the overdose fire. These settlements won’t bring back our loved ones but the actions we’ve taken will change the way these companies do business and this funding will be used for treatment recovery and education programs that can help prevent future tragedies.”

“The resources obtained from these settlements will go a long way in providing care for those laboring under addiction and I am thankful to Attorney General James for continuing this fight for communities that need it most” said Albany County District Attorney David Soares.

“The opioid epidemic has been devastating for our communities throughout Albany County” said Albany County Legislature Chairman Andrew Joyce. “The Albany County Legislature recognizes that in order to prevent more overdoses we need to be proactive. That’s why we’re working on legislation that would provide for the safe disposal of opioids. We need to make it harder for those who don’t need these drugs to get them that’s the first step in tackling this epidemic. I am glad to see that these funds are going where they are needed the most.”

“I commend Attorney General James on her perseverance to hold the producers of opioids accountable for the torment caused to so many New York families and others” said Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple. “These settlements will undoubtedly save lives through education awareness and recovery efforts.”

“We are honored to have New York Attorney General Letitia James visit Hope House’s Elizabeth House a 16-bed intensive residential program for women located in Troy New York” said Kevin M Connally executive director Hope House Inc. “Attorney General James is visiting this program as part of her ‘HealNY’ tour’ where she will begin delivering up to $1.5 billion to combat the opioid epidemic. These funds have been collected from various opioid manufacturers and distributors that were responsible for the devastating opioid epidemic. We are grateful to Attorney General James for her tireless efforts to help New Yorkers battle the opioid epidemic especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which has significantly impacted those in need of quality treatment services.”

Separately but related to her work on opioids this past February Attorney General James co-led a coalition of nearly every attorney general in the nation in delivering more than $573 million — more than $32 million of which was earmarked for New York state — toward opioid treatment and abatement in an agreement and consent judgment with McKinsey & Company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWxldGVpYS5vcmcvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9wb3BlLXByYXlzLWZvci10aG9zZS13aXRoLW1lbnRhbC1pbGxuZXNzLWFuZC12aWN0aW1zLW9mLXN1aWNpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pope prays for those with mental illness and victims of suicide,"The pandemic has made a tremendous tragedy even worse.

On the occasion of World Mental Health Day Pope Francis turned his thoughts to those with mental illness and to victims of suicide.

After praying the midday Angelus on October 10 he said:

I would like to remember our brothers and sisters who suffer from mental illness and also victims – often young people – of suicide. Let us pray for them and their families so that they are never left alone or discriminated against but instead are welcomed and supported.

One billion people affected worldwide

In a message published this October 10 for World Mental Health Day the Prefect of the Dicastery for Integral Human Development Cardinal Peter Turkson expressed concern that the pandemic had exacerbated the suffering of people with mental illnesses.

“It is estimated that before the Covid 19 pandemic nearly a billion people around the world suffered from mental disorders” he said lamenting that the pandemic has exacerbated the difficulties.

Deploring the very wide disparities in the management of these diseases across the world – in some countries “between 75% and 95% of people with mental disorders cannot access mental health services” – the Ghanaian cardinal pleaded for a strengthening of the health system “in particular by supporting organizations engaged in scientific research on mental illnesses and by promoting models of social inclusion.”",,,,,,,,,

It’s a short stop mainly to refuel the ship. Carnival Pride arrived in port while it was still dark and all-aboard was set for 1 p.m.

Paradise Cove

Today was another early wakeup call day so we ordered room service to arrive at 7 a.m. We ordered an array of breads fruit yogurt and caffeinated beverages and ate it on our balcony while watching the container ships and forklifts on the cargo pier across from us.

Image

Image

The port of Freeport Bahamas is an industrial port and is walking distance to absolutely nothing. A straw market sets up in the port area when ships are docked but unless you want to purchase souvenirs you need to take a tour or catch a cab.

The first and last time I visited Freeport on a ship I had no plans and asked at the tourist information booth in port for options. I didn’t love the beach the reps sent us to so I decided to do my own research ahead of time for this visit.

Image

Image

I looked online for resorts that offered day passes to cruise visitors. Many of them were all-inclusive but we didn’t want to pay a flat fee that included drinks and food we wouldn’t consume because we’d be leaving at noon. Also many of the resorts were a cab ride away adding another expense to the day’s tab.

Somewhere in my wanderings around Google I found Paradise Cove. It claims to be a resort but it’s a beach with two rental properties on site you can book for a few nights. Its Beachgoers pass cost $50 per adult for beach access a lounge chair a rum drink and – this was key – transportation to and from the cruise port. We also had the option to go snorkeling or rent kayaks and standup paddleboards.

I emailed with the owner to confirm the beach was open and what time we would need to leave to get back to our ship on time. He responded within a few days and I booked our visit online plus a shade umbrella for $7.

Upon disembarking the ship we walked to the Harley Davidson store by the cruise tour departure area to wait for our ride. We were the only pickup from the port and it was just us and our driver Mr. Talker on the half-hour ride to Paradise Cove. He pointed out sights of interest including his house along the way.

Image

Image

Image

Image

At Paradise Cove we checked in and the owner Barry set up the chairs and umbrella for us. The beach is small but we had the pick of chair locations because we were the only guests there. That’s right with tourism still suppressed due to the pandemic we had the beach all to ourselves. Four other snorkelers arrived about a half before we left.

The beaches in Freeport are not like Half Moon Cay. The water by the Paradise Cove beach was murky with sea grass and seaweed floating on the surface. Our view looked out on cargo ships and some kind of offshore rig. It didn’t look like paradise. We weren’t sure we wanted to get in the water. Had we set ourselves up for disappointment?

Then again the weather was perfect warm with a slight breeze and the music coming from the deck area was festive without blasting. We could move our chairs around to follow the shade without bumping into other sunbathers. No one was hounding us to buy things or annoying us with their loud music or conversations. We could sunbathe all morning in peace. Things were looking up.

Image

We asked Barry about the snorkeling at Paradise Cove since we’d brought our snorkels with us. He pointed out three areas of interest. Straight ahead was a grassy area where a group of sea turtles lived. To the left was a section of reef balls a type of man-made planter made of organic materials that encourages new reef life to grow and attracts fish. On the other side of the rocky outcroppings we could see was a natural reef with lots of fish called Dead Man’s Reef.

Unlike our Nassau trip we’d have to swim a ways to get to the underwater attractions. Barry said we were welcome to swim out on our own or we could book a private guided snorkel tour for $10 per person. That seemed like a good deal to us and we also rented flippers and flotation belts.

It was the best $20 snorkel tour I’ve ever been on. Barry helped us adjust our new snorkels and even held our hands to guide us over the reef balls and around the coral formations. He spotted a sea turtle swimming in the sea grass that I would not have noticed and pointed out a young turtle resting in the sand by the reef. When I found a sting ray he helped us swim after it at a safe distance.

Image

He named the various fish for us from snappers to rainbow fish and found us safe places where we could stand up and rest without damaging the coral. Even though the water was murky in some areas it was lighter the farther out we swam and we saw a lot in only an hour. If we had gone in alone we wouldn’t have known where to find the best sea life and might have given up and turned back early.

Back at the beach we cashed in our drink tickets for Bahama Mamas. (The other options were beer bottled water and soda.) The drinks didn’t look like much served in plastic cups but they were fruity and strong. This is not a resort that cheaps out on its included drinks.

Image

Paradise Cove is a family-run operation and a local lady runs a gift shop there as her own business. We decided we’d rather spend our souvenir money at the place where we’d had such a nice morning rather than at the cruise port shops so before we left we browsed around. I picked up a bottle of locally made hot sauce and my friend bought small paintings of the beach done by a local artist.

By the time we had paid for our purchases and packed up it was 12:30 p.m. With jumped back in the van and arrived at the port just a few minutes before all-aboard. When we paused by the fence around the port looking for the gateway to the ship the enthusiastic pier runner spectators called down to us with directions. But they couldn’t embarrass us because we were onboard at 1 p.m. on the dot. That counts as on time in my book even if we were the last people back on the ship.

Now that’s what I call making the most of a short stay in port!

Halloween

Unbeknownst to us Carnival is celebrating Halloween on every cruise that departs in the month of October and tonight the second formal night is All Hallow’s Eve onboard. A few spooky decorations are up including an animatronic witch and the formal night photo backdrops included one with the grim reaper peering over your shoulder. Other cruisers got the message and had costumes at the ready.

Oddly it’s also ‘80s night with an ‘80s themed show in the theater and hits from that decade performed by the band in the Red Frog Pub. Had I known I would have packed an ‘80s-style costume for Halloween but instead I’m rockin’ my formal attire.

Before the fun got started we had to eat. The dining room menu is so varied that we often have trouble deciding between options. We have succumbed to the common cruise phenomenon of handling indecision by sampling one of everything.

For appetizers we each ordered a salad which was healthy enough but then I ordered the pumpkin soup and my friend ordered the vegetarian Indian entree because she wanted to try tonight’s surprise dishes. Our two-top table was barely big enough for all the plates. The pumpkin soup was nicely flavored and the Indian food mixed surprisingly well with our salad.

We managed to clear enough plates for the waiters to bring the main dishes. My friend said the shrimp was delicious and the portion perfectly sized. My spanikopita (Greek spinach pie) was served over a potato and vegetable stew and the combination was delightful.

Even after we got up and danced with the waiters to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling” we didn’t think it was a wise idea to try and eat dessert. We did it anyway because well we’re on a cruise ship!

The grand marnier souffle tasted like warm pancakes softened with a creamy vanilla sauce. It was comfort food bliss. My friend gobbled up her no-added-sugar key lime mousse as if it had real calories in it. At this point my Halloween costume was destined to be The Blob.

Image

After dinner we went to see the hits of the ‘80s show in the theater. Carnival shows are big on special effects and the show designers used the LED curtain to do its own take on the cartoon romance of Aha’s “Take on Me.” Sparks literally few during Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation.” The audience had fun singing along to all their favorites.

Rumor has it that we are about to cruise into a “developing weather system” and the bad weather started during dinner with lightning visible outside. The Lido Deck Halloween costume party which was scheduled for after the show was moved to the Beauties nightclub. The two-deck space was not intended for big events and I couldn’t find a good vantage point that wasn’t already taken so I snapped some photos and left.

Favorite costumes including an undead bride and groom ghostly pirate wench a married cop and robber and an 84-year-old woman in a flapper dress with lightup ghost earrings.

We spent the evening at our favorite late-night hangout the Red Frog Pub. A cover band plays there every evening and the lead singer Marisko from Jamaica has an amazing and versatile voice. He can sing any genre of music it seems and knows how to connect with his audience. The pub has a fun vibe too with round tables built around faux palm trees and it feels like a destination rather than a generic cruise ship lounge.

Tomorrow is our last sea day and I’ll give some final thoughts about the Carnival Pride cruise experience. Unfortunately our last chance for sun and pooltime may be dashed by the developing storm.

Today's towel animal is a...ram? They get more difficult to guess every day!

SILVER SPRING Md. – Organization Day (O-Day) kicked off on Aug. 20 at WRAIR’s Daniel K. Inouye Building after being relocated due to inclement weather.



“O-Day is one of the many traditions in the Army where units companies battalions brigades get together and build on the esprit de corps and the morale for the unit” Staff Sgt. Jessica Prewitt NCOIC Blast Induced Neurotrauma Brain Trauma Neuroprotection and Medical Readiness Systems Biology said.



This year’s event was open to Soldiers and civilians and featured a face painter fortune telling booth photo booth individuals dressed in tiger and clown costumes and games such as cards and checkers. There was also food galore including a barbecue lunch popcorn and cotton candy and a Dessert War competition. Many took a break from the office and interacted with colleagues in a relaxed setting which was something that O-Day planners had hoped for.



“It’s just nice to get out and see people who you haven’t seen in a while” said Capt. Jennifer Burns military deputy Pilot Bioproduction Facility. “Whether it’s just having a chat and saying hi or engaging in some good old competition and trash talking at the end of the day we’re doing it for the organization for everyone to come together enjoy each other and show appreciation for each and every one of the people that work at WRAIR.”



WRAIR’s last O-Day was downsized to a lunch in the auditorium due to the coronavirus pandemic and the 2019 O-Day was held at Fort Meade.



“It’s the first O-Day since a lot of the major restrictions have been lifted” Capt. Shanee Allen HHC Commander said. “I think just the fact that it’s coming off the cusp of a time where a lot of people were isolated and not getting to spend time with other people is what makes this unique and very important more so than any other O-Day ever.”



No carnival would be complete without some sweet treats which is where the Dessert War came into play. Capt. Richard Kevorkian Deputy Chief of Wound Infection Research Center for Military Infectious Disease Research took the top prize with his “corona-cake” a dome-shaped chocolate walnut cake that featured a neon green fondant coat and Blow Pops arranged atop it to represent spike proteins.



In the past O-Day has brought WRAIR soldiers and staff together like a family and this year’s event seemed to live up to expectations.



“In my two years here at WRAIR I’ve come to think of it as a family” Cpl. Brittany Kociuba research technician Center for Enabling Capabilities research technician said. “I really think it’s great to step out of our labs and interact with each other in a fun positive way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYW5zLmNvbS8yMS1zdHVubmluZy1waG90b3MtZnJvbS1taWFtaS1jYXJuaXZhbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,21 Stunning Photos from Miami Carnival 2021,"The Miami Carnival was held on October 10th 2021 at the Miami-Dade Fairgrounds in South Florida.

Navy photo

The San Diego-based USS Carl Vinson joined the forward-deployed USS Ronald Reagan and carriers from the United Kingdom and Japan in a show of allied force in the Philippine Sea earlier this month the Navy reported on Saturday.

The exercise which took place on Oct. 3 included the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopter carrier JS Ise and brought together 15000 sailors from six nations.

Unspoken was the message that democratic countries in the Pacific can work together against any threat from the autocratic and communist regime in China which recently flew waves of jets near Taiwan to intimidate that country.

In addition to the four carriers the group included the guided-missile destroyer USS The Sullivans two destroyers from Japan two destroyers and two frigates from the United Kingdom and a frigate each from the Royal Canadian Royal New Zealand and Dutch navies.

The force conducted flight operations and air defense exercises as well as simulated strikes against maritime targets using F/A-18 Super Hornets from the Ronald Reagan F-35B Lighting II stealth jets from both the Royal Air Force and U.S. Marines operating from the Queen Elizabeth and F-35Cs from the Carl Vinson.

“This is Carl Vinson strike group’s fourth exercise with allies and partners since entering 7th Fleet and we have continued to improve our ability to conduct prompt and sustained operations at sea with a more mobile agile and flexible force” said Rear Adm. Dan Martin commander of Carrier Strike Group 1. “Through alliances and partnerships we have developed the right operational concepts plans proficiencies and capabilities to bolster our maritime advantage.”

Commodore Steve Moorhouse commander of the British strike group said “working with our close allies to develop operating procedures and capabilities while concurrently showcasing the agility of land and carrier-based aviation in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates our commitment to the region.”

Rear Adm. Konno Yasushige commander of Japanese Escort Flotilla 2 said the exercise demonstrated that his country “will work closely with the naval forces of the U.S. Britain the Netherlands and Canada which share the same objectives to respond to global challenges and defend maritime order based on the rule of law.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL211bHRpcGxlLWFsbGllZC1jYXJyaWVyLXN0cmlrZS1ncm91cHMtb3BlcmF0ZS10b2dldGhlci1pbi1wYWNpZmljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multiple Allied Carrier Strike Groups Operate Together in Pacific,"Multiple Allied Carrier Strike Groups Operate Together in Pacific U.S. Navy carrier strike groups led by flagships USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) and USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) joined with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s (JMSDF) Hyuga-class helicopter destroyer JS Ise (DDH 182) and the United Kingdom’s carrier strike group (CSG 21) led by HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) to conduct multiple carrier strike group operations in the Philippine Sea Oct. 3.

U.S. Navy press release

The integrated at-sea operations brought together more than 15000 Sailors across six nations and demonstrates the U.S. Navy’s ability to work closely with its unmatched network of alliances and partnerships in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.

Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 5 from Ronald Reagan is operating with CSG 1 from Carl Vinson for the first time during its 2021 deployment and marks the second time operating with UK CSG 21 and JS Ise this year.

“We are picking up right where we left off in 5th Fleet with the Queen Elizabeth team and building on what we started with the JMSDF after first leaving Japan” said Rear Adm. Will Pennington commander Carrier Strike Group 5/Task Force 70. “Adding the fantastic Vinson team to this potent force dynamically displays our capabilities across all domains keeping us ready to respond to a range of maritime challenges.”

The strike groups conducted flight operations and air defense exercise scenarios as well as simulated strikes against maritime targets. The operations brought together F/A-18 Super Hornets from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 aboard Ronald Reagan along with F-35Bs from both Royal Air Force and U.S. Marines operating from Queen Elizabeth and F-35Cs from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 aboard Carl Vinson.

“Interoperability across air platforms to include the addition of the Air Wing of the Future is just one way we have integrated operations for enhanced lethality readiness and maneuverability across our collective forces” said Rear Adm. Dan Martin commander Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG)/CSG 1. “This is Carl Vinson strike group’s fourth exercise with allies and partners since entering 7th Fleet and we have continued to improve our ability to conduct prompt and sustained operations at sea with a more mobile agile and flexible force. Through alliances and partnerships we have developed the right operational concepts plans proficiencies and capabilities to bolster our maritime advantage.”

Vinson and UK CSG conducted joint interoperability flights together in 7th Fleet in August the first time CSG-21 engaged with the F-35 “C” model assigned to CVW-2. The two F-35B squadrons have been deployed together aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for her inaugural global deployment demonstrating the interoperability the F-35 provides.

“The UK Carrier Strike Group offers the largest 5th Generation air wing afloat today and working with our close allies to develop operating procedures and capabilities while concurrently showcasing the agility of land and carrier-based aviation in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates our commitment to the region” said Commodore Steve Moorhouse OBE Royal Navy Commander UK Carrier Strike Group.

The training and events provided commanders the chance to practice capabilities across the maritime domain as participating forces focused on anti-air anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare tactics and procedures.

“In addition to the two carrier strike groups of the U.S. Navy I feel very honored to be able to train with the Royal Navy’s most advanced carrier strike group which is an extremely valuable experience” said Rear Adm. KONNO Yasushige Commander of JMSDF Escort Flotilla 2. “Through this training we enhanced our tactical skills and interoperability with the participating navies. In order to realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific the JMSDF will work closely with the naval forces of the U.S. Britain the Netherlands and Canada which share the same objectives to respond to global challenges and defend maritime order based on the rule of law.”

A joint military exercise off the Japanese island of Okinawa this past weekend brought together three western aircraft carrier strike groups and a Japanese helicopter carrier that's now able to launch F-35 stealth fighters.

The assembly which included 17 ships from six different countries sent an unmistakable message to China.

In an exclusive interview the commander of the United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) task force told CBC News that the one-day exercise was a demonstration of solidarity and of how western allies can work seamlessly together.

""It's an important message for those here that nations like ourselves really do believe in the freedom of navigation in the freedom of trade and really are alarmed at the militarization of the area"" said Royal Navy Commodore Steve Moorhouse.

Message received

He said he has no doubt that the message was understood.

""Chinese intelligence-gathering vessels were in the region"" he said. ""So I have absolutely no doubt the message would have been relayed back to China quite quickly.""

The exercise was a milestone in several ways. Since the end of the Second World War the Japanese have not possessed aircraft carriers and their military has maintained a defensive posture. Last weekend's fighter jet trial saw a US Marine F-35B land on and take off from the helicopter carrier JS Izumo — making it a de-facto fixed-wing aircraft carrier.

The exercise was also one of the largest gatherings of aircraft carriers in the Pacific in decades.

Commander Doug Layton the skipper of HMCS Winnipeg told CBC News that the sight of so many big warships and so much firepower gathered in one space left the sailors aboard his frigate in awe.

""You should have seen the looks on their faces"" Layton said adding that at one point ""twelve fighter jets overflew us a combination of F35s and F18s.""

The Canadian frigate was edged in beside and escorting HMS Queen Elizabeth the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier which is on a world tour.

""I've been in the navy for 20 years and I have never been in such a showcase of naval power"" said Layton.

The British have been largely absent from the Pacific Ocean for nearly two decades. Moorhouse said the Royal Navy has been re-learning how to operate in that vast expanse. The voyage is helping to lay the groundwork for the semi-permanent stationing of two British warships in the region he added.

It was reported late Thursday by international media that a U.S. nuclear submarine that was not part of the large exercise collided over the weekend with an ""unknown object"" while submerged in the South China Sea.

It was not clear what caused the incident on Saturday but American officials said the USS Connecticut remains ""fully operational."" The accident injured 11 sailors.

While the exercise was taking place China's People's Liberation Army Air Force was in the midst of a series of sorties into Taiwan's air defence zone.

Over several consecutive days some of Beijing's most advanced fighters and bombers skirted the disputed island's actual airspace — within the buffer zone around it.

As many as 150 planes took part in the incursions.

The flights started on Friday China's national day and were described by the U.S. State Department as ""provocative"" and ""destabilizing.""

Many experts said the timing of the flights was not surprising — but the number of warplanes involved was.

Julie Clark a fellow with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute said Beijing likely felt compelled to put a forceful display after the recent announcement of a security arrangement involving the U.S. the U.K. and Australia which will see the latter acquire nuclear submarine technology.

China pushes back

The incursions ""seem to be a strong message to the West — particularly to the United States with some of their recent moves with strategic security alliances — to indicate they're not a country in which they can be pushed around"" said Clark.

The recent summit in Washington of the so-called Quadrilateral (Quad) nations — a strategic security dialogue involving the United States India Japan and Australia — also probably got under China's skin Clark suggested.

On Wednesday it was announced that the presidents of the U.S. and China will hold a virtual summit later this year.

Clark said that event will be a very important opportunity to reduce the growing tensions in the region. Many of China's neighbours have been rattled by Beijing's military buildup and provocative actions — but equally Clark said those countries are being given a stark choice as allied military displays become more noticeable.

""There have been moves from other Asian countries — or at least pressure on them — to take a side"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9vbWlub3VzLXNpZ25zLWZvci1jaGluYS1hZnRlci03NS15ZWFycy1qYXBhbi1vcGVyYXRlcy1wb3dlcmZ1bC1maWdodGVyLWpldHMtZnJvbS1pdHMtbmF2YWwtY2Fycmllci_SAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vb21pbm91cy1zaWducy1mb3ItY2hpbmEtYWZ0ZXItNzUteWVhcnMtamFwYW4tb3BlcmF0ZXMtcG93ZXJmdWwtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLWZyb20taXRzLW5hdmFsLWNhcnJpZXIv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ominous Signs For China? After 75 Years Japan Operates Powerful Fighter Jets From Its Naval Carrier,"For the first time in 75 years fixed-wing combat aircraft landed and took off from the deck of a Japanese navy carrier recently. The last time this happened was during World War II. Naturally China hasn’t welcomed this and an article in the state-owned Global Times termed the move “dangerous”.

This development is significant as after decades it gives Japan the ability to project power far from its shores especially in highly-contested waters bordering China and also in the western Pacific Ocean.

Though this ‘offensive’ capability is forbidden by the country’s pacifist constitution drafted after World War II the world has changed much since and newer and immediate threats are looming large over the horizon necessitating a change in the Japanese military’s posture from being a defensive force to one which is acquiring an offensive capability.

Bound To Stir Controversy

Japan was a leading carrier operator in World War II but in the decades since leaders balked at the idea of carriers as they weren’t compatible with the country’s post-war strictly defensive orientation. That’s why this move has generated controversy.

However as China keeps building naval ships at breakneck speed and keeps extending territorial claim across the Western Pacific Japanese leadership and military brass thought it prudent to rethink their stance.

So in 2018 they took the politically bold step of ordering conversion of helicopter carriers Izumo and Kaga into carriers which could host fixed-wing aircraft.

The aircraft which took part in the exercise weren’t Japanese but F-35B of the US Marines from the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 242 based in Japan.

STOVL Capability Vital

The USMC F-35s showed off their short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability as they first hovered on the side of the carrier and then slid sideways and landed vertically. Later they took off without any hiccups from the short runway of the carrier JS Izumo.

The trial took place a few months after the first of two stages of modification which has so far cost about $30 million was finished on the former helicopter-carrying 813-foot-long carrier to make it suitable for embarking fixed-wing aircraft.

Kaga which is Izumo’s sister ship is also being outfitted similarly starting this year.

Japan has ordered a total of 147 F-35s from the US including 42 F-35Bs for carrier operations which will start arriving from 2023 onwards. This makes the Asian nation the biggest foreign customer of the Lockheed Martin-produced stealth jet.

Each of the ships can carry 12+ of these 5th generation stealth jets fighters. The Japan Air Self-Defence Force operates F-35A.

The unique ability to land vertically and launch from a short distance makes the radar-evading F-35B suitable for small carriers like the Izumo and Kaga.

F-35s To Enhance Japan’s Strike Options

Speaking on the occasion Rear Admiral Shukaku Komuta of the Japanese Navy said “The trial has been successful and it proved that Izumo can support landing of V/STOL aircraft at sea. This capability will give us the option of providing air defense in the Pacific Ocean.”

On October 3 the #KokuJieitai participated in #F35B take-off and landing verification test on #JSIzumo conducted by #JMSDF and US Forces in collaboration. The Koku-Jieitai will continue to make steady preparations for the introduction and joint operation of F-35B.@jmsdf_pao_eng https://t.co/2rrnj0nBvl — Japan Air Self-Defense Force (@JASDF_PAO_ENG) October 5 2021

The Admiral didn’t mention most probably for not antagonizing the Chinese that the F-35B’s primary role is that of a very capable strike aircraft which can breach the enemy’s air defense umbrella without being picked up by its radar.

The F-35 is so stealthy that in July 2018 it was reported that three Israeli Air force F-35s flew to Tehran on a test mission and then back to their airbase in Tel Aviv without the Iranians knowing they were overhead. The Iranian air defense failed to detect them.

In the event of hostilities between Japan and China in the future the F-35B will be used more for striking targets both at sea and on the mainland than air defense.

The maturing of Izumo and her sister ship as flat-tops capable of carrying probably the most lethal combat aircraft today couldn’t have come at a better time when a belligerent China is trying to become the predominant power in the Indo-Pacific by embarking on a massive upscaling of its military and threatening neighbors.

In this scenario it helps that Japan is rushing to qualify the carriers and the deck crew for frontline service with help of US Marines till their own F-35Bs arrive.

According to Japan’s naval strategy in event of war with China the Japanese fleet will be tasked with blocking China’s fleet from breaking out of South China Sea through the northern route and accessing the main Pacific Ocean.

Edge Over Chinese Aircraft

As the battle would rage far away from the Japanese mainland most probably beyond the range of land-based combat aircraft the two carriers with their embarked F-35Bs would play a crucial role in not only providing air cover to the entire fleet but also carry out strike missions against surface targets.

The F-35B with its stealth features advanced sensors avionics and countermeasures would prove extremely useful for the opposing Chinese fighters.

It easily outclasses all combat aircraft in China’s arsenal including the 5th gen J-20 which according to aviation experts is still a work in progress.

Even in peacetime China will no doubt be concerned when Izumo or Kaga with F-35B onboard embark on freedom of navigation patrols in the heavily contested South China Sea which China considers its own.

No doubt the move by Japan to place potent fixed-wing platforms on small erstwhile helicopter-only carriers is brilliant though politically sensitive which will certainly prove its worth in the long run and push the Chinese on the backfoot and force them to think twice before embarking on any misadventure against Japan its territories or allies in the Western Pacific Ocean."

The celebration of northern Ohio’s fuzzy winter weather predictor rebounded after a year off due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Cloudy skies in late morning seemed not to deter those who gathered to enjoy woollybear races and the Wonderful Wacky Woollybear Parade along with live music vendors and food.

There were costume contests for those who wear their woollybear enthusiasm on their sleeves. And pants and bodies and heads.

Fox 8 TV personality Lil’ John Rinaldi and Cliff German owner of German’s Villa event center in Vermilion served as masters of ceremonies. They noted the judges were scattered out in the crowd so the final decision was not theirs.

Carlee Law 3 of Vermilion was crowned the 2021 Woollybear Queen. Michael Jessel Jr. 17 months of Vermilion was crowned the 2021 Woollybear King.

Sprinkle a long-haired chihuahua from Oberlin took the top prize for best animal or pet dressed like a woollybear without actually being a caterpillar.

‘It had to be fuzzy’

Carlee and her brother Aaron 1 made their Woollybear Festival debuts on stage together with their mother Sarah Law. Her mother Patti Law — Mimi to the little ones — assembled the costumes.

Carlee’s costume had a trailing tail making it longer than she was tall.

“It had to be fuzzy we had to have some fun googly eyes and we had to have a train” Patti Law said. “Every woollybear should have a train. And it had to be easy on easy off.”

The family missed the festival in 2020 because each year they hold a party for the day. Sarah Law said her husband Scott a Vermilion native was at home entertaining the guests.

“We do look forward to this every year” Sarah Law said.

‘Super excited’

Michael Jessel Jr. was not yet born the last time the Woollybear Festival happened in 2019.

He is the son of Samantha and Michael Jessel Sr. They were inspired by finding a woollybear at the Wakeman home of his grandmother Dede Jessel.

“She was like you should enter him in the Woollybear contest” Samantha Jessell said. “So I got super excited.”

They attended with Samantha Jessel’s parents Monica and Jerry Kilby of North Ridgeville.

The plan was to buy premade pom-poms and fuzzballs for the costume but Monica Kilby suggested making them. The family used five skeins of yarn on a project that kept Samantha Jessel up late the night before.

“You just keep wrapping and wrapping and wrapping and then you just make your pom-poms out of them. A lot of work” she said. “But I’m doing good I’m not that tired.”

The prize was fun for the family especially because Michael Jr. is the first child for his mother and father Samantha Jessel said.

“I was really excited. I was like oh my gosh” she said. “I would say definitely prep ahead. Don’t do last-minute. I’m a last-minute person but I was excited so I did it I had to just finish it.”

Made with love

Sprinkle 1 made her Woollybear debut with dog-mom Wendy Bissett and dog-dad Larry Solak a wife-husband team from Oberlin.

Sprinkle had her own costume and rode inside a covered wagon tricked out with fur leaves and fuzzy woollybears to be a rolling cocoon.

A rescue from Vermilion Solak found Sprinkle as a Valentine’s Day gift and she joined the family in March. The couple has another rescue dog a curly coated retriever named Grace.

They also have a festival pedigree: Their late chihuahua Tootsie won the pet and animal costume contest at ages 1 5 and 10.

In the past they got to ride in the parade on a float with the late Dick Goddard the Fox 8 meteorologist staunch animal lover and longtime Woollybear Festival promoter.

They would ride in the parade on Oct. 10 and offered their advice on crafting a woollybear lookalike.

“Be creative and spend a lot of time” Solak said.

“Creative time make it fit the animal” Bissett said. “Of course she’s petite and small that’s why I went with not so much gaudy but a little bit more petite.

“And love” she added.

The forecast

WJW Fox 8 meteorologist Scott Sabol and the station’s weather team provided this year’s winter forecast based on the black and brown coloration of this year’s woollybears. It stated:

“We’ve had a super wet and humid summer and a warm and dry fall. It’s been five years since we’ve had above normal snowfall across northern Ohio.

We’ve dodged a bunch of snow bullets over the last few winters. Will our luck continue with an unprecedented sixth straight winter with below normal snowfall or will it run out? Our prognosticating caterpillar has spoken.

“November will start out pretty quiet. We’ll have some warm days but don’t be fooled.

“Look for winter to start off relatively strong with plenty of snow in late November and December.

“After the first of the year winter will be more on and off with plenty of nice breaks.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm90dHBsYXkuY29tL25ld3MvYWlzaHdhcnlhLW1ham11ZGFyLW9qYXMtcmF3YWwtd2lsbC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1oaXMtd2F5LXRvLXdoZXJlLXlvdS1hcmUtYXQtYS1wYXJ0eS9lM2E4N2ZhYTAxNjAz0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm90dHBsYXkuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2Fpc2h3YXJ5YS1tYWptdWRhci1vamFzLXJhd2FsLXdpbGwtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXItaGlzLXdheS10by13aGVyZS15b3UtYXJlLWF0LWEtcGFydHkvZTNhODdmYWEwMTYwMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aishwarya Majmudar: Ojas Rawal will caterpillar his way to where you are at a party,"Renowned singer Aishwarya Majmudar who is also a famous social media influencer had visited Ojas Rawal-hosted show Har Ghadi Mauj but ended up roasting him instead.

Average home prices are rising at the fastest pace since February 2015 with transaction volumes surging nearly 77% in August from a year earlier -- up over 56% when compared with the same period in 2019 before the pandemic hit according to real estate adviser CBRE Group Inc.

But it's the legacy of chronic oversupply that could determine how long the boom will last. Mohamed Alabbar chairman of Dubai's largest developer Emaar Properties has warned that the current industry exuberance could come back to haunt Dubai as it now exits a seven-year price downturn made worse by its property glut.

""The real estate market is a very funny market"" Alabbar said in an interview. ""There is oversupply. People get excited. Customers start taking the inventory and then everybody starts building again.""

The issue briefly vaulted near the top of the government's agenda last year when a committee was set up to manage supply and demand while property developers temporarily halted new projects. The sentiment has shifted however as Dubai's economy reaped the benefits of a faster reopening.

Even as the market stages a dramatic recovery pockets of underperformance suggest demand is still insufficient to soak up the excess supply. Average rental rates edged lower in the first eight months falling 2.7% from the same period last year.

Apartment rents meanwhile dropped 5.2% at a time when developers are adding to the supply of homes in the city. About 24595 new homes were completed in Dubai so far this year and the construction of another 24700 is expected to be finished by the end of 2021.

""Right now I think the supply situation is good"" Alabbar said adding that Emaar is on course to achieve record sales this year. ""It's natural businessmen will start again and they will flood the market but that will take few years.""

Dubai's average home prices climbed 4.4% in the year to August average apartment prices rose 2.5% while single family homes known locally as villas soared 17.9%.

""Overall sales volumes in the first three quarters of 2021 have already surpassed total annual transaction volumes in all but two of the last 10 full years"" said Taimur Khan head of research at CBRE.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFiODI5ZjU0LWUxYjQtNGFmMS05MjhmLWJmZDk1ZGZhYzc3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real estate group swoops for Hilton hotels in sign of recovery,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The Chicago-based fund manager has raised close to $1.07 billion for LaSalle Asia Opportunity VI the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System said in a report of its board of trustees’ 27 September meeting which noted that LaSalle is targeting a fund size of $1.5 billion.

LAO VI aims to deliver a net internal rate of return of 18 percent over an eight-year fund life with a maximum 70 percent loan-to-value ratio said the US state’s teacher pension fund which approved a $50 million commitment to the vehicle at the meeting.

The latest fundraising win for LaSalle comes amid a surge in capital commitments to Asia real estate investment strategies including a $1.74 billion closing announced by CBRE Investment Management last week and Nuveen winning $213 million in fresh backing in early September.

Record Haul

Should the firm reach its $1.5 billion target for LAO VI it would represent LaSalle’s biggest haul for the strategy since before the 2008 financial crisis. According to the report the LAO V iteration achieved a net IRR of 17 percent through 25 investments.

The recipe for this latest iteration of the strategy is a diversified risk-adjusted portfolio across Asia in sectors and markets with proven resiliency and liquidity the company said. Showing the vehicle’s opportunistic nature activities will include the development of core assets the repositioning of existing properties and the restructuring of distressed properties.

Investors in LAO VI include Asian and Middle East sovereign wealth funds and US public pension funds according to the report which said the fund was targeting a first closing in September 2021. As of the time of publication LaSalle has yet to announce an initial fundraising milestone for the strategy.

Core Asian Markets

The Arkansas announcement outlined 15 pipeline investments for the fund requiring an estimated $964 million in equity with Japan representing the biggest target geographically in garnering 43 percent of the expected total. Next on the list for LaSalle is mainland China which is in line for 37 percent of the capital committed with South Korea set to receive 12 percent and Singapore 8 percent.

By sector LaSalle is focusing 44 percent of the vehicle’s capital on office with another 28 percent headed into logistics. Residential is close behind with 27 percent of the cash set to be allocated to housing investments and just 2 percent is going to the region’s long-suffering hotel sector.

Three acquisitions in the pipeline are already in advanced stages of due diligence including a 5772 square metre (62129 square foot) Tokyo multi-family asset described as undermanaged. The other two properties in advanced discussions are a 17656 square metre freehold office redevelopment project in Singapore’s CBD and a 128037 square metre logistics development site near Beijing.

The combined equity requirement for the three pipeline projects is $140 million.

Fundraising Muscle

In 2018 the previous fund in the series LaSalle Asia Opportunity V closed on $1.15 billion from 20 external institutional investors based in Asia the Middle East and the US topping its initial target of $750 million.

LaSalle an independent affiliate of property services firm JLL said the capital raised for LAO V would provide buying power for $3.3 billion worth of assets in key Asian cities across the office retail hotel/serviced apartment and logistics segments.

In June 2018 LaSalle announced LAO V’s acquisition of the Hotel Ibis Styles Tokyo Bay for an undisclosed amount. The fund scooped up the 216-room property near Tokyo Disneyland at a time of enthusiasm for hospitality assets but LAO VI’s roadmap is signalling a more bearish view of the segment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last week LaSalle announced the $972 million final closing of the LaSalle China Logistics Venture fund the fund manager’s first dedicated China logistics vehicle. LCLV and its co-investment vehicle have already committed $423 million across 15 investments including three recent acquisitions in Shanghai Nanjing and Tianjin.

LaSalle rival CBRE Investment Management has flexed its own fundraising muscle of late. The company formerly known as CBRE Global Investors revealed this week that it has received capital commitments of $1.74 billion for the Asia Value Partners VI fund which will pursue build- and reposition-to-core opportunities in the most developed and liquid markets of Asia Pacific.

The total amount raised exceeds the initial target of $1.2 billion for the fund and excluding co-investments represents a hard cap CBRE IM said. The news came just one year and seven months after the private fund division of CBRE closed on $900 million for the fifth fund in the Asia value-add series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL3N0Yy1iYWhyYWluLXNlbGVjdHMtYWxzYXlhaC1zcXVhcmUtdG8tb3Blbi1pdHMtZXhwcmVzcy1zaG9wLXlycHV1Nmhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,stc Bahrain selects Alsayah Square to open its express shop,"Alsayah Square has internationally recognized brands such as McDonald’s Dunkin' Krispy Kreme Baskin Robbins and includes regional and local favorites such as Mega Mart Hashem Restaurant Riffai Roastery Cine Café Khafayef Eye Vision to name a few

The energy crisis combined with labour shortages and supply chain problems has hit meat production ahead of the Christmas rush when millions of shoppers normally fill up their trolleys turkey ham and other festive foods.

Surging wholesale energy prices a shortage of workers at meat processing and packing plants and insufficient numbers of HGV drivers to transport produce to supermarket depots means some households could go without their favourite festive fare this Christmas.

The situation is so precarious that at least one major supermarket chain has warned officials that it is considering rationing some produce in the run-up to Christmas to block panicked shoppers from buying up what meat it does have it is understood.

Supermarkets have also been urged to start offering festive promotional deals earlier than usual this year according to the Sunday Times. This would help to spread out consumer demand over a greater period avoiding official hope enormous spikes in the last weeks before Christmas.

As well as driving up household bills surging gas prices are negatively affecting range of industries including food production.

Carbon dioxide a byproduct of the production fertiliser plays a vital role in the food industry – the gas is used to stun animals before slaughter and for vacuum-packing meat products.

But rocketing natural gas prices across Europe recently prompted a major fertiliser producer CF Industries Holdings to suspend operations at two UK plants cutting off the CO2 supply upon which the meat industry depends.

Following an intervention from the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng who promised a short-term financial bailout the US firm agreed to restart production. However on Friday the British Meat Processors Association reported that several slaughterhouses and meat processing plants had reported dwindling supplies of CO2 and warned that the industry could be “back to square one” this week.

Public could be told: Put on a jumper The British public could be asked to turn down their thermostats to lower the risk of cuts to power supplies if the fuel crisis continues during the winter months. The suggestion is reportedly included in plans drawn up by officials intended to steer the country through the crisis. Ministers have also allegedly been told they may have to offer their backing to a campaign to urge people to put on a jumper according to The Sunday Times. Asked whether he would personally encourage the public to wear more layers instead of turning up the heating Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “It’s up to people – it’s amazing how different people’s cold thresholds can be very different.” Mr Kwarteng added that the public should “be sensible…[and] do what they feel comfortable with”. Speaking on Sky News Mr Kwarteng insisted that his job is “not to tell people how many layers of clothing they should wear.”

Labour shortages at abattoirs have compounded the problems caused by the gas shortage leaving farmers facing the prospect of having to cull hundreds of thousands of healthy pigs. Animals killed on-farm are typically shot with either free bullet weapons such as rifles or by captive-bolt stunning whereby a blank cartridge fires a captive retractable metal bolt into the brain followed by bleeding.

Hundreds of healthy pigs have already been culled because of overcrowding on farms caused by the backlog of growing animals that cannot be sent away for slaughter.

The Prime Minister has been accused of failing to understand the nature of the situation after he said the pigs would have died anyway and become “bacon sandwiches”.

Tom Bradshaw vice president of the National Farmers Union said Mr Johnson had shown a “lack of respect” to farmers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8xNTAzNjQzL2Zvb2Qtc3VwcGx5LWNoYW9zLWNvMi1zaG9ydGFnZS1tYXJpLWdvdWdlb24tc2F1c2FnZXMtaG9seXJvb2TSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMTUwMzY0My9mb29kLXN1cHBseS1jaGFvcy1jbzItc2hvcnRhZ2UtbWFyaS1nb3VnZW9uLXNhdXNhZ2VzLWhvbHlyb29kL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sausage chaos! Urgent meeting demanded over CO2 shortage,"CO2 shortage: Meat industry boss warns of Christmas food supplies

Scotland's rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon has called for an urgent meeting with the UK Government. Ms Gougeon said a short-term deal with carbon dioxide manufacturer CF Fertilisers is drawing to a close with no future plan in place.

The MSP for Angus North and Mearns said there is concern over the impact of CO2 shortages on the country's food and drink sector. The gas is used in food packaging of perishable foods such as meat and salads to inhibit the growth of bacteria. It typically prolongs the shelf life of products such as beef steak by about five days. CO2 is also used in the stunning of animals before slaughter.

Supplies of pork products including sausages could be affected by the CO2 shortage

Scotland's rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon

Slaughterhouses and meat processing plants across the UK started to report shortages of carbon dioxide. This means pork products such as sausages could soon start disappearing from supermarket shelves. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said Britain could be ""back to square one"" next week with several of its members reporting dwindling supplies of CO2. A spokesperson said: ""We're getting reports our members are starting to run short of supplies again."" READ MORE: Sturgeon holds private meetings with top EU chief

Ms Gougeon said: ""Carbon dioxide plays a key role in our economy and failure to secure adequate supplies will have a significant impact on our agriculture sector wider food and drink manufacturing and also our hospitality industry. ""The failure of UK ministers to address meaningfully the crisis for Scotland's food and drink industry is unacceptable.

It might be slightly easier in the Lone Star State.

According to a new study from enterprise cloud software platform Approve.com Texas is the country's least expensive state for running a business. The study weighed factors like average annual wage top corporate income tax rate and average prices for utilities like electricity and internet. The study included the District of Columbia but omitted Alaska and Hawaii due to ""unavailable data.""

Here are the country's five least expensive states for running a business according to the study:

Texas Oklahoma Kentucky Nevada Georgia

Texas tops the list thanks to its tax policies and utilities costs. The state does tax businesses with annual revenues above $1180000 at a rate of 0.375% but its corporate tax laws are considered to be among the friendliest to businesses in the country.

Perhaps that's why Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk announced last week that his company is moving its headquarters from Palo Alto California to Austin. Tesla will join Oracle Hewlett Packard Enterprise Charles Schwab and plenty of other companies that have moved their headquarters to Texas recently.

Of course it's not always only about the money.

Now one of the most recognizable companies in those fields is taking its headquarters elsewhere. Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California. (AP)

Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California the electric-car maker’s home since its founding 18 years ago. It joins companies including Oracle Corp. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Charles Schwab Corp. in relocating their corporate hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state in the past two years.

They all are keeping a large presence in California underscoring the importance of the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the shifts of companies born and bred in the state show how many of its intractable issues from the nation’s most expensive housing costs to high taxes and climate catastrophes pose a threat to continued economic growth if corporate departures multiply.

And losing Tesla -- a long-shot clean-energy startup that upended the auto industry and embodies much of the state’s economy -- delivers a particularly symbolic hit.

“Tesla as a brand represents not just Motor City USA it represents Silicon Valley and Hollywood” said David McCuan chairman of Sonoma State University’s political science department. “Tesla is really a California-centric thing. But Elon Musk represents something larger than life and that’s really Texas.”

Musk Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer pointed to some of California’s issues when he announced the move from Palo Alto to Austin. The company’s Fremont factory is jammed with workers and equipment with little space to build around it.

The billionaire clashed with local public officials over lockdown policies during the pandemic. He defied local orders by restarting production at the plant. Musk said that Tesla isn’t leaving California and will continue to expand there – but he made clear that he saw more opportunity for growth in Texas.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away” said Musk who last year said he was moving to Texas himself. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”

That region in particular has long been seen by companies as a difficult place to do business. Employers have had to offer ever more generous compensation so that workers can keep up with sky-high housing costs. Many workers have simply been priced out of living near their work forcing them into long commutes before the pandemic.

California’s Association of Realtors forecast this week that the state’s median single-family home price will jump to a record $834000 next year more than twice the national level. The median sale price of homes in Santa Clara County -- the heart of Silicon Valley – was $1.66 million in August an almost 11% jump from a year earlier according to the industry group.

Newsom – a Democrat who last month beat back a recall effort that was in part driven by anger about the state’s cost of living crime and homelessness -- on Friday emphasized that the state has created more than 750000 jobs since January. He said California’s policies encouraging innovation and investment in electric vehicles contributed to Tesla and Musk’s success.

“Our regulatory environment helped create that company and grow that company” Newsom said at a press briefing. “I have reverence and deep respect for that individual. But I also have deep reverence and respect for this state and what we’ve done.”

Strong Economy

Tesla’s move is more a symbolic blow than an economic one. While the tech industry is a significant part of the state’s economy California reaps the rewards of other lucrative sectors such as trade and entertainment. The state has notched a $75.7 billion surplus and revenue is again running ahead of projections -- by about 18% -- for the fiscal year that began in July. Its credit ratings are at their highest in about two decades.

Silicon Valley also remains a magnet for tech investment. In the third quarter there was a record $27.1 billion worth of venture deals struck in the region a 17% increase from the previous three months according to a recent report on venture capital from CBInsight.

“The tech sector is so big that Texas can grow and we can grow” said Stephen Levy director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. But “the exoduses do have a real concern if they’re based on the high housing prices and lack of housing.”

The state has few answers for how to fix its most pressing problems. Construction remains way below Newsom’s goals for addressing the housing shortage. Taxes are unlikely to go down. Climate change has contributed not only to record-setting wildfires but drought power outages and smoke-filled air.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise whose Silicon Valley roots go back to the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in a Palo Alto garage eight decades ago said last year that cutting real estate costs were a major factor in its decision to relocate to Houston already its largest US employment hub. The company which has maintained much of its tech and innovation workforce in the Bay Area also said the pandemic and the changing nature of work contributed to the move.

In many ways Covid proved to companies that they could effectively operate elsewhere or at least with a smaller footprint. Silicon Valley’s office vacancy rate has continued to climb reaching 15 per cent in the third quarter as more employers looked to offload space they’d previously leased according to real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

The region still remains key for the tech industry with its depth of talent and access to renowned universities said Robert Sammons senior director of research at Cushman in San Francisco.

“Certainly the business climate has room for improvement” Sammons said citing regulations and the high cost of living. “Those are all difficulties that California has and has had for years.”",,,,,,,,,

In a letter threatening legal action New Yorkers for Clean Livable and Safe Streets co-founder and president Steve Nislick said he was blindsided when Charter Communications rescinded its prior approval of the ad narrated by Falco.

“We are writing to inform you that NYCLASS is exploring aggressive legal action in response to Charter’s decision to approve – and then inexplicably remove – our recent television ads from your cable networks” Nislick said in a letter to Charter Communications president & CEO Tom Rutledge.

“The advertisements in question include narration from Emmy-award winning actor Edie Falco and feature footage of injured carriage horses captured by bystanders on the streets of midtown Manhattan. In recent weeks these very images have been broadcast on many networks in your system including Spectrum News NY1 PIX11 WCBS and others” Nislick said in the letter a copy of which was obtained by The Post.

The Post reported on the ad last week and posted videos in it of fallen and injured horses. Some of the same videos were posted in prior stories about injured horses — provocative but not gruesome. One showed a horse bloodied after crashing into the back of a BMW sedan in Midtown.

Nislick said Charter executives approved the ads last Wednesday to appear on NY1 MSNBC CNN Animal Planet CNBC and Lifetime “without raising any concerns about their content.”

“Two days later we were informed that the ad buy was being pulled from the air with only a vague verbal explanation that the content was `too graphic.’ Charter refused to provide any details about what specifically was considered too graphic and offered no guidance on what actions needed to be taken to return the ads to the airwave” the NYCLASS honcho said.

He called Charter Communications’ sudden about-face “puzzling” given the footage featured in the ads has already been widely shown on television.

“Furthermore” Nislick said “the ads are currently running on other platforms that approved their content without any hesitation – making Charter an extreme outlier in terms of censorship.”

Nislick said he seeks “further clarification” about Charter’s cancellation of the six-figure ad buy and an explanation as to what specifically was “too graphic” with its content.

“If the advertisements are not returned to the air we reserve all rights to pursue any and all available legal remedies including initiating legal action and/or submitting additional ads on the same subject matter” he said.

A Charter Communications spokeswoman Maureen Huff would only say “The ad doesn’t meet our guidelines.”

NYCLASS has used its financial muscle to help influence city elections.

Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned on banning horse carriages in 2013 — and NYCLASS helped get him elected — but he still failed to get the City Council to go along and has pushed to keep the rides inside Central Park instead of trafficked streets.

The animal rights group aided de Blasio’s first campaign for mayor by running ads attacking a rival former Council Speaker Christine Quinn.

In the recent June Democratic primary for mayor the group ran ads attacking candidate Andrew Yang. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams won the primary and is the Democratic nominee favored to win the mayoralty against Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Sliwa supports NYCLASS’ campaign to ban horse carriages and proposed switching to electric-powered carriages around Central Park.

Adams opposes a carriage ban but is open to discussions on reforming the industry a spokesman said.

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljbmV3c2FnZW5jeS5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTc2NTgvdGFiZXJuYWNsZS11bnRvdWNoZWQtYXQtb2tsYWhvbWEtcGFyaXNoLWhpdC1ieS1wb3dlcmZ1bC10b3JuYWRv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2F0aG9saWNuZXdzYWdlbmN5LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yNTc2NTgvdGFiZXJuYWNsZS11bnRvdWNoZWQtYXQtb2tsYWhvbWEtcGFyaXNoLWhpdC1ieS1wb3dlcmZ1bC10b3JuYWRv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tabernacle untouched at Oklahoma parish hit by powerful tornado,"CNA Staff May 11 2024 / 06:00 am

A rural Oklahoma parish hit this week by a powerful tornado suffered serious damage especially to its parish hall. But amid the rubble broken glass and winds possibly as high as 175 mph the church’s tabernacle containing the body of Christ remained intact.

Father Emmanuel Nduka who pastors three local churches including St. Mary’s told CNA that the tabernacle’s survival served as a sign of God’s presence amid the devastation in the small Oklahoma town of Barnsdall.

“God is in control. There’s no reason why our church should be standing after what happened in Barnsdall Sunday night” the priest told CNA.

Nduka lives in a neighboring town 30 minutes from Barnsdall but early on May 7 as soon as he heard about the damage to the church he raced over. No one was in the church building at the time of the tornado; the stone structure of the church building itself survived while the parish hall next door was “completely leveled.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0dm0uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbXQtb2xpdmUtYmFwdGlzdC1jaHVyY2gtcGl0dHN2aWV3LWFsLWJ1cm5zLWRvd24tYWZ0ZXItYW4tb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWZpcmUv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3R2bS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9tdC1vbGl2ZS1iYXB0aXN0LWNodXJjaC1waXR0c3ZpZXctYWwtYnVybnMtZG93bi1hZnRlci1hbi1vdmVybmlnaHQtZmlyZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

Taking place on May 2 Orthodox Holy Thursday the ordination was conducted at St. Nektarios Mission Parish near Harare Zimbabwe by the archbishop of Zimbabwe Metropolitan Serafim.

The St. Phoebe Center for the Deaconess a U.S.-based organization that has advocated for reviving the ancient female diaconate said in a press release that Molen’s ordination would prepare the way for the restoration of the role in other branches of the Orthodox Church. The group’s board chair Dr. Carrie Frost wrote: “Being the first to do anything is always a challenge but the Patriarchate of Alexandria has courageously chosen to lead the way with Metropolitan Serafim laying his hands on Deaconess Angelic.”

According to the release Molen said: “At first I was nervous about going into the altar but when Metropolitan Serafim blessed me to enter the altar as part of my preparation this week those feelings went away and I felt comfortable. I am ready.” According to the St. Phoebe Center Molen was well received by her community and parish.

“The Alexandrian Patriarchate in Africa felt the need to revive this order to serve the daily pastoral needs of Orthodox Christians in Africa” the release read. Metropolitan Serafim said that Molen will have both liturgical and pastoral roles. He said: “She is going to do what the deacon is doing in the liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.”

Serafim added that “one of the most important fields of work of the deaconess was the exercise of the works of love. They were the angels of mercy and the visiting sisters of the sick the ‘grieving’ and poor women imparting to them the gifts of Christian love.”

One of the important functions of deaconesses will be to distribute the Eucharist even while their role will not be identical to the work of their counterparts of more than 1000 years ago. However he noted that “we must admit that women can offer the Orthodox Church a great missionary work” as well as evangelism and teaching and highlighted their missionary catechetical and teaching work. After her ordination Molen distributed the holy Eucharist which in the Byzantine rite is given via spoon and includes the body and the blood.

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa has been on the way to diaconal ordination of women for several years. At a 2016 synod in Alexandria Egypt the Patriarchate voted to reinstate the female diaconate. In 2017 the Patriarchate ordained six sub-deaconesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Among the functions of deaconesses may be baptism which in Orthodox churches is conducted by full immersion. In the early Church full immersion for adults was followed by anointing of the whole body which required the assistance of deaconesses for the sake of propriety.

According to the 1917 Catholic Encyclopedia the only mention of a deaconess in the Bible is in St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans (16:1) which refers to Phoebe as diakonos or “servant” even while no official status was implied. However citing testimony by Roman author Pliny the encyclopedia says “there can be no question that before the middle of the fourth century women were permitted to exercise certain definite functions in the Church and were known by the special name of diakonoi or diakonissai.” The fourth-century apostolic constitutions include instructions for the ordination to the female diaconate.

Despite the ancient practice Pope Francis has declared it is impossible for women to be ordained to the priesthood or diaconate."

However it was the other way around recently in Scranton Pennsylvania.

The U.S. Marshals Service announced on Monday that it conducted what it dubbed “Operation Dunder Mifflin” — “an effort to verify the registered addresses of convicted sex offenders.” The name of the operation was a hat tip to the popular NBC mocumentary-style comedy which aired between 2005 and 2013. Though nearly all of the show was recorded in California it was whimsically set in Scranton.

Beyond the name however the U.S. Marshals Service operation — a joint effort with the Scranton Police Department and the Pennsylvania State Police — bore no semblance whatsoever to the plot of the critically acclaimed television series. Between August 2nd and September 17th agents fanned out across the city in Northeastern Pennsylvania’s coal country “to verify the registered home addresses of 219 registered sex offenders living in and around Scranton” the Marshals Service said in a news release.

“Thirteen of these offenders were found to be in violation of sex offender registration laws” the news release said. “[N]ine were arrested and four are sought for the violations.”

According to the news release verbatim among those arrested were:

Evan Bolthouse a 22-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Indecent Assault. Israel Capeless-Medina a 39-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Indecent Assault. Christopher Cigna a 44-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Sexual Abuse of Children. Heather Laracuente-Ellingwood a 41-year-old Scranton woman who was required to register for a conviction of Statutory Rape in New York. Joseph Maurer a 24-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Corruption of Minors. Charles Prymock a 35-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Indecent Assault. Dale Thomas a 48-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Indecent Assault. Kevin Sanford a 43-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for Sexual Abuse in New York. Ronald Williams a 53-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Involuntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse.

An additional collection of individuals were “sought for outstanding warrants.” Their images are at the top of this report. Again from the news release:

Rafael Aguilu a 43-year-old Scranton who was required to register for a conviction of Involuntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse. Ricardo Reid a 47-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of a 2nd degree sex offense in North Carolina. Bradley Runk a 20-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Corruption of Minors. Almond Santos a 30-year-old Scranton man who was required to register for a conviction of Indecent Assault.

“Anyone with information about these or other fugitives is asked to contact the U.S. Marshals at 1-800-336-0102 or [email protected]” the organization said.

“The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 designated the USMS as the federal agency responsible for helping local and state authorities locate and arrest convicted sex offenders who fail to comply with their Megan’s Law requirements” said Martin J. Pane the U.S. Marshal for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. “It’s a mission that receives top priority and constant attention within our agency.”

“This joint operation was successful in ensuring those required to register remain compliant and those who are in violation are brought before the court to answer for their non-compliance” added Scranton Police Chief Leonard A. Namiotka. “The cooperation between the Scranton Police Department and our law enforcement partners is paramount in making our community safe for all citizens.”

The Bengals announced the news after the game though didn't say how Burrow suffered the injury or how serious it is. Burrow finished the game and didn't show any outward signs of injury on the field though NBC Sports' Mike Florio reported during ""Sunday Night Football"" that Burrow was poked in the throat at some point during the game.

The Cincinnati Enquirer's Kelsey Conway reports that Burrow was having trouble speaking. He did not appear for his regular postgame media session.

Burrow visited medical tent in first half

Burrow briefly left Sunday's game for a sideline medical tent after taking a big hit at the end of a second-quarter scramble.

The hit happened on a drive-ending third down and Burrow was back on the field for Cincinnati's next possession where he completed two passes for 75 yards and a touchdown. He didn't miss a snap.

Burrow finished the day completing 26 of 38 pass attempts for 281 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. He was sacked three times in addition to the hit on the second-quarter scramble.

Browns LB Owusu-Koramoah also hospitalized with throat contusion

Burrow wasn't the only player taken to a hospital for a possible throat contusion on Sunday.

Cleveland Browns linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah was taken to a local hospital in Los Angeles via ambulance as a precaution after he suffered a throat contusion in their 47-42 loss to the Chargers the team said.

Story continues

It’s unclear when he suffered the injury specifically though he did leave the contest briefly before returning. Owusu-Koramoah had four total tackles in the loss.

The 21-year-old rookie out of Notre Dame has had 17 total tackles so far this season. He had a career-high seven last week in their win over the Minnesota Vikings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Source: Cisco Secure)

- As businesses digitalise their operations in response to COVID-19 cyberattacks are on the rise too. Over half of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam have been victims of cyberattacks in the past year according to a study by Cisco Secure.According to its study 59 percent SMEs in Vietnam suffered a cyber attack in the past year of which 86 percent lost customer information to malicious hackers.The study is based on an independent survey of over 3700 business and IT leaders across 14 markets in the Asia-Pacific including 152 in Vietnam. The survey highlighted the multitudes of ways in which attackers can try to infiltrate online systems.Thirty-nine percent of affected SMEs in Vietnam have said that the biggest reason these attacks are successful is that current cybersecurity solutions are not adequate. Thirty-two percent said they have no cybersecurity solutions in place.Luong Thi Le Thuy Managing Director of Cisco Vietnam said that SMEs in the country have increased their pace of digitisation over the past 18 months. This has been driven by the need to leverage technology to continue to operate during the pandemic.This digitisation has created a critical need for SMEs to invest in capabilities that safeguard themselves against cyberattacks. The more digital they become the more attractive a target they are for malicious actors she said.Besides the loss of customer data SMEs in Vietnam that suffered a cyber incident also lost employee data (67 percent) internal emails (61 percent) financial information (58 percent) intellectual property (56 percent) and sensitive business information (51percent). In addition 61 percent admitted that cyberattacks have hurt their reputation.Disruptions caused by cyber incidents can have serious implications for SMEs. Downtime of less than one hour usually has a severe impact on revenue while downtime of more than a day can result in permanent closure.“We are living in a world where customers seek instant gratification. They no longer have the patience for lengthy downtimes. SMEs must be able to detect investigate and block or remediate any cyber incident in the shortest time possible” said Juan Huat Koo Director Cybersecurity Cisco ASEAN.Cisco’s study found that while SMEs in Vietnam are worried about cyberattacks they are taking steps to improve their cybersecurity.According to the study 88 percent of SMEs have completed scenario planning or simulations for potential cybersecurity incidents in the past 12 months. The majority have a planned response to cyberattacks (89 percent) and recovery plans (88 percent) in place.Vietnamese SMEs are also increasingly aware that the biggest cyber threat comes from unsecured laptops and the use of personal devices.The good news is there are now strong levels of investment by SMEs regarding cybersecurity. Some 87 percent of Vietnamese SMEs have increased their investment in cybersecurity since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.“Cybersecurity is evolving rapidly. This is being driven by trends like expanding attack surfaces moving to multi-clouds the rise of hybrid work as well as new security requirements and regulations"" said Kerry Singleton Managing Director Cybersecurity Asia Pacific Japan China Cisco./.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlb3BsZW1hdHRlcnMuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS9sZWFkZXJzaGlwL3N0cmVzcy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWlzLWEtdGVhbS1zcG9ydC1sZWFkZXJzLXRha2Utb24tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC0zMTIyMdIBcWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlb3BsZW1hdHRlcnMuaW4vYW1wLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtc3RyZXNzLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtaXMtYS10ZWFtLXNwb3J0LWxlYWRlcnMtdGFrZS1vbi1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLTMxMjIx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keeping a check on Mental Health: Leaders’ side of the story,"In the last 19 months many companies in India have introduced mental health benefit schemes and working professionals feel more supported than ever before.

70 percent of professionals in India said their employer supported their mental well-being compared to 65 percent globally as per the latest ADP report ‘People at Work 2021: A Global Workforce View’.

However the stress caused by the pandemic has still been a significant challenge for professionals in India. Especially for leaders as they face stress to ensure business continuity manage their emotions as well as teams and ensure workplace safety.

But often we have skipped talking about how and what leaders have been doing to address this. Leading by example how are leaders taking care of their own mental health?

Leaders don't have to be perfect. They don't have everything figured out. They deal with different kinds of stress on a daily basis. Yet they are expected to always be calm and sorted. Let's break this stigma.

Helping us break the glass ceiling of misconceptions around mental health some of the business and HR leaders shared with us how they cope with stress and take care of their mental health:

Remember you are not alone!: Balajee Sowrirajan MD Samsung Semiconductor India R&D Center (SSIR)

“I feel looking at every challenge as an opportunity and not as a stress point makes the difference. To stay positive in challenging situations I look back at situations that I tided over successfully. Though our job as leaders is like a sponge to absorb the pressure but not to pass it down to the next level. However I have learnt that leaders should normalise leaning on their people and acknowledge the power of the team to solve problems. Remember you are not alone! It’s also important for leaders to realise that they are vulnerable you are not a superhuman. it’s okay to make mistakes and accepting that makes you human. Being real removes a lot of stress!”

Set healthy boundaries at work: Piali Dasgupta Senior Vice President – Marketing Columbia Pacific Communities

“I have lived with chronic depression and anxiety for the past 23 years. Dealing with illnesses has become a way of life. However even after over two decades of fighting this disease I don’t think it gets easier to live with it. What does happen is that you learn to identify trigger points at work and at home and try to protect yourself from these trigger points. Work stress is inevitable for any leader because with added responsibilities come added stress. That’s not something one can run away from unfortunately. But what is of utmost importance is to set healthy boundaries at work and try to stay away from situations that can be potential triggers or stressors. Obviously this is much easier said than done. But leaders need to look after themselves first in order to look after their businesses and verticals well.

Share your vulnerabilities with your peers & team members: Jai Balan Head – Human Resources Bharti AXA Life Insurance

“With added responsibilities and work pressure as a leader bottling up emotions and anxieties under the misplaced notion that a leader needs to always appear strong and resilient just multiplies stress. Therefore for a leader it is important to exhibit and share your vulnerabilities with your peers and team members to create a safe space for them to know that it’s okay to feel stressed or anxious about work. Further to manage workplace stress and anxiety it is important to compartmentalize your thinking so that work-related matters do not stress you during your time-off.”

Yoga & prioritising family time keeps mental health in check: Sarada Vempati SVP & Head of Technology Infrastructure Wells Fargo India & Philippines

“I was in my first week on the job at Wells Fargo. My daughter was away studying in the U.S. adding to my personal anxieties. As part of the leadership team at the bank we were pretty much on 24x7. Balancing that with personal stressors pushed all our coping resources to the limit including mine. How did I cope? I chose something I could do together with my daughter thousands of miles away – we both joined a yoga class! It was early in the morning for me and late evening for her. We felt closer and also connected doing it together while relaxing and also keeping our mental balance during a very stressful time.”

Breaks binging on Netflix & gratitude keeps stress away: Anupam Trehan Senior Director People & Communities Cisco India & SAARC

“As a leader and a mother I have to focus on keeping myself strong-mentally and emotionally to be able to support the well-being of our employees and our community networks while also managing home. A few things that I try to do to help me cope is - blocking time on my calendar for breaks. I may not always be successful but I have realized that when you can manage your calendar you can get more done feel less overwhelmed and be more relaxed. Secondly I consciously step away from work for a few hours to spend time with family. Thirdly I keep 30 minutes to get some exercise read a book or to do any activity that acts as a de-stressor. Sometimes that may just be binging on Netflix. Lastly two things that get me through when I am stressed or upset are square breathing and gratitude. Gratitude to be surrounded by amazing people at work & home who are there with me behind me to lift me up.”

Having a mentor for guidance is enabling: Suma PN Director HR Otis India

“Early in my career I realized that taking care of ‘self’ is important for me if I have to take good care of people around me including the teams that I lead and the people I am responsible for. Staying physically active and paying attention to my dietary habits has helped me enormously over the years. Practicing Yoga keeps me focused and improves my concentration. Having a mentor for guidance enables me to share and learn from the experiences of the person I trust in and who has confidence in my abilities as an individual and as a leader.

Have some me-time: Mubarak Begum HR Head of Kristal.AI

""As an HR professional handling a workforce spanning multiple countries the challenges are manifold. Add to that the pandemic and most days I feel there aren’t enough hours in the workday. I've learnt that having some me-time is crucial for your mental health. I begin my day with meditation and go for a run on alternate days. On weekends I enjoy quality time with family or just go for a drive. I also take time out to read. On weekly calls with my team we've started taking some time to talk about anything but work. This helps keep things light.""

Unwind holistically for better mental health: Nimisha Das Director – HR Kellogg South Asia

""My personal mantra is to ensure I unwind holistically so it invariably includes activities that help me de-stress physically mentally and socially. I love spending quality time with my loved ones and my cat Tango. I practice yoga as it caters to my internal as well as external well-being. Whenever I get time off from work I travel away from the city because I truly believe travelling teaches one a lot.""

Nothing is more important than 'you' and 'your mental wellness': Rajesh Rai VP – People Team and Head of HR India GlobalLogic

“In every individual's life one would find themselves grappling with stressful times and such experiences can be overwhelming. In the present times stress is something we all have to manage by taking approaches that are personalized to us. In stressful situations I manage stress by disassociating myself from the triggers and seeking things that I love doing to bring more positivity for myself in that very moment. These could be immersing myself in meditation listening to music spending quality time with loved ones going for a run or sometimes even simply indulging myself with a sweet treat. This little time of self-care enables me to process my thoughts and realign myself to tackle the stress head-on.

Don’t stress the could haves: Ruhie Pande CHRO Godrej Housing Finance

“I read this at the tube station during my travels and it stayed with me – ‘Don’t stress the could haves  if it should have it would have’ ! I truly believe stress is often an outcome of trying to control things and my focus is to embrace the process and give things my 100% without trying to influence outcomes. Pursuing a hobby helps as well. I have an active interest in volunteering for animals reading & writing and I ensure to take time out to invest in them.“

Work is not a sprint but a marathon: Ramya Sampath Sharma Chief People Officer GreyOrange

""The fact remains that for all the excitement of the VUCA world the relentless nature of our lives today [work and personal] has a massive impact on our mental health. As leaders it is critical that we balance the demands of our work and organization with the need to be empathetic to employees. This requires the ability to understand that work is not a sprint but a marathon. This is my own mantra and the secret to my ability to keep going in this fast paced work.""

Pay close attention towards your own mental well-being: Sushant Patnaik Head-HR Aeris Communications

“Last 18 months has literally condensed decades of learning in a few months. Adapting to a new normal shifting from brick and mortar to online grocery shopping online education and healthcare and so on. It is normal to end up in a condition of tight strain with life slowing to a standstill at times stuck between the four dividers of your room and the sorry state of affairs around. As a wellness trainer myself I am acutely aware of this stress that many of us feel. Also as the bridge between the business and employees I keep reminding myself continuously that I have a greater responsibility to undertake. Therefore I pay close attention towards my own mental well-being and also encourage my colleagues and loved ones to do the same. These have been testing times requiring each one of us to be calm and empathetic towards others. Every leader has to wear numerous hats and in my case I have to ensure employees' stability and help them through grievances. That is only possible if I take good care of my personal well-being.”

Spend quality time with family: Ruchi Bhalla Country Head - Delivery Centers India & Vice President Human Resources (Asia Pacific) Pitney Bowes

""As a leader I understand my responsibility to set the tone for good mental well-being at the workplace. While managing my own mental health I’ve tried to be cognizant of the impact the pandemic has had on me and my family with lines between home and work blurring. I’ve been conscious about inculcating habits such as regular yoga practice and exercising. I make it a point to keep some time each evening without my phone and emails to spend quality time with family. As an organization we keep a high focus on human interaction albeit in the digital space so that people continue to feel that sense of connection and bonding with team members. It can also help alleviate the stresses of long-term technology fatigue.""

I religiously take long walks to decompress: Chaitanya Ramalingegowda Director and Co-founder Wakefit.co

""Running a startup brings with it a different set of challenges. As exciting as the role of a founder is it is also stress-inducing because there are so many different moving parts and you want to instinctively control every single aspect of the business to give the startup the best chance of success. Over time we've hired highly qualified and reliable people in leadership roles that take ownership of business units which has alleviated a lot of stress for my co-founder Ankit and me. Personally I religiously take long walks to decompress and like to write my thoughts down at the end of the day to unwind. I am also a voracious reader and love exploring different genres. I am currently reading a biography of Leonardo Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson. These small but habitual routines help me take care of my mental health amidst the hectic schedule of my day.""

Take time off to spend with oneself: Maria Rajesh CHRO Embassy Group

“Today organizations are facing workforce disruptions at an unprecedented scale across the world. The rise of a virtual workplace has emphasized the need for a better work-life balance with an increased expectation from employers. Employee wellness is no longer limited to just covering employees’ medical expenses today it is about having an overarching approach. As an individual I believe it is important that one must take care of themselves. I ensure on having my consistent workout regime which leaves me fulfilled the entire day. One must take time off to spend with oneself as well as their families to ensure the required balance for having a stress-free life. The pandemic has proven and given us an opportunity to inculcate a healthy lifestyle – be it a routine a diet and regular sleeping patterns – without the hassle of commuting. We advocate such a lifestyle strongly among our colleagues and friends and as an organization believe it is imperative for overall well-being.”

Leaders need to act as role models who champion mental health: Ashok Gupta Head – Talent Acquisition and Business Partner HR AirAsia India

“The iconic adage ‘health is wealth’ has been redefined especially over the past 18 months as we have experienced times that truly tested our mettle both emotionally and physiologically. It is imperative to take care of our physical and mental health now more than ever before. On a personal level I do take some time out to join the meditation sessions that we conduct internally for all our Allstars (as AirAsia employees are fondly called). I likewise practice yoga as it conditions your brain and body at the same time and has been known to show phenomenal advantages. Most importantly to expunge the stigma around mental health and well-being we as leaders need to take initiatives and act as role models who champion mental health and are advocates of our own mental well-being as well as the mental health and well-being of each and every one.”

Incorporate open conversation in the organisation: Sajan Pillai Chief Executive Officer Season Two Ventures

""The mental health of a business leader is not just restricted to managing his own emotional well-being it is about ensuring the mental well-being of the organization by nurturing psychological resilience of the team. Being in the leadership position practicing self-care and protecting yourself from the potential threat of stress causing elements is the key to mental health and leading by example is really important. By carefully incorporating healthy practices involving open conversations in the organization work-related stress can be reduced and generate better output.""

Casual interactions with colleagues helps de-stress: Siddharth Das Vice President Sales India & APAC Brillio

“Here are a few things which have worked well for me to cope with work-related stress and anxiety. Engage in some casual interactions during the week without any specific agenda/formal purpose and connect with customers peers bosses and subordinates through open conversations. Additionally these interactions allow you to create empathy and space to be transparent about the challenges that each has faced. They even provide a common outlet to resolve these problems rather than just formal agenda-based meetings. In the pandemic and in the absence of office “water-cooler” meetings these conversations matter a lot in building trust confidence and reducing anxiety.”

Encourage your team to take time off for themselves: Anjali Rao Senior Director HR Intel India

""Leaders today have an even greater responsibility to arm themselves with the right strategies and role model behaviors that will help their teams thrive. I’ve made a conscious effort to focus on my own mental and physical health and be open about it with my team to encourage them to take time for themselves and their loved ones. Practicing gratitude and yoga have helped me be more present when I’m at work and extend grace to those around me in the toughest of hours. It’s important to remember that everything may not always work the right way but we can solve things together and with kindness.”

Rehearsing the art of recovery is imperative: Shruti Tandon Director People Enablement Nagarro

“In the course of time there are certain practices that I have followed and they have helped me cope with stress and take care of my own mental health. Firstly self-reflection and self-care which is a conscious effort and practice has helped me in dealing with everyday stress. Secondly I prioritize myself for my own self where I make sure to exercise regularly to keep my body at its functional best. Thirdly as leaders we are used to juggling a lot of important details where our mind is constantly working and we are pushing ourselves hard at 100% capacity all the time. Therefore rehearsing the art of recovery is imperative where I ensure to take small frequent breaks and timely vacations. Lastly to cope with stress one should never hesitate to ask for help. This can be cathartic! At the end of the day we all need someone to talk to and encourage us to believe in ourselves.”

Practicing empathy and compassion while dealing with any problem: Shradha Lohia Co-Founder Ekaanta - Mindversity on the Ganges

""Whenever I am faced with sorrowful painful stressful experiences I hark back to this wisdom and tell myself I have to learn from this experience and let it pass with patience. And surely this knowledge brings a lot of peace to me and helps me deal with any challenging situation with strength and calmness. This is a simple technique that once learnt and practiced can be so helpful to guide our actions more mindfully and meaningfully at work and in our personal lives. Even in very stressful work environments like large corporations or manufacturing sites most of the stress is generated by people themselves - due to the way a situation is handled. As a business leader I am very conscious of this. I always make it a point to practice empathy and compassion while dealing with any situation or people and their problems – knowing well that like any situation even challenging situations will pass if we practice patience.""

Avoiding the need to create a state of needless rush: Prerna Kohli - Director of HR Cyware

“Managing stress effectively is critical for not only our productivity but also our overall wellbeing and happiness. Personally for me meditation and deep breathing exercises that foster mindfulness can help melt away stress. Every day I do not miss investing a few minutes on simple activities like walking or enjoying a meal. What also works for me is the philosophy of acting instead of reacting or creating a state of needless rush. At Cyware also we have fostered a culture wherein we relish every moment together as a team indulge in promoting healthy food habits and connect as a team for regular fun activities. We have also built a culture of open-communication with the leadership so any team member can directly talk if they feel stressed about anything.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvd29ybGQtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1kYXktaW5kaWEtaW5jLWhhc3RlbnMtcGxhbnMtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1tZW50YWwtd2VsbC1iZWluZy1vZi1lbXBsb3llZXMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODY4OTg1MTYuY21z0gGwAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbXBhbnkvY29ycG9yYXRlLXRyZW5kcy93b3JsZC1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLWRheS1pbmRpYS1pbmMtaGFzdGVucy1wbGFucy10by1wcm90ZWN0LW1lbnRhbC13ZWxsLWJlaW5nLW9mLWVtcGxveWVlcy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODY4OTg1MTYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Mental Health Day: India Inc hastens plans to protect mental well-being of employees,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Special to the Rockford Register Star

In a recent report the FBI says senior citizens are getting scammed at unprecedented rates. In 2020 older Americans 65 years and older lost almost 1 billion dollars.

A total of 105301 people over the age of 65 were scammed with an average loss of $9175 and almost 2000 older Americans lost more than $100000 the report said.

Those numbers are compiled from the reported cases. There are some estimates that yearly loses could be as high as $3 billion if you consider the unreported cases of fraud. There are many reports that place the number of victims in the millions.

Seniors are often targeted because they tend to be trusting and polite.

They also usually have financial savings own a home and have good credit — all of which make them attractive to scammers.

Scams targeting senior affect nearly everyone not just the victims. Many of us are either in that age group or have relatives who are. When a parent or grandparent loses their life savings it impacts the entire family.

Don't fall for these scams:Cooler weather brings scam artists touting home repairs.

Here are the most common scams that con artists will try to use against seniors:

Romance scam

Criminals pose as interested romantic partners on social media or dating websites to capitalize on their elderly victims’ desire to find companions.

Tech support scam

Criminals pose as technology support representatives and offer to fix non-existent computer issues. The scammers gain remote access to victims’ devices and sensitive information.

Grandparent scam

Criminals pose as a relative — usually a child or grandchild — claiming to be in immediate financial need.

Government impersonation scam

Criminals pose as government employees and threaten to arrest or prosecute victims unless they agree to provide funds or other payments.

Sweepstakes/charity/lottery scam

Criminals claim to work for legitimate charitable organizations to gain victims’ trust. Or they claim their targets have won a foreign lottery or sweepstake which they can collect for a fee.

Home repair scam

Criminals appear in person and charge homeowners in advance for home improvement services that they never provide.

TV/radio scam

Criminals target potential victims using illegitimate advertisements about legitimate services such as reverse mortgages or credit repair.

So what’s being done about these scams targeting seniors? There is pending federal legislation the Stop Senior Scams Act and Seniors Fraud Prevention Act. These are mostly educational measures. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul has joined nearly every state Attorney’s General pushing for passage of the legislation.

In part these laws will focus on educating those who interact with seniors such as store employees and money wiring services on how to spot senior fraud and alert potential victims.

“Education” may seem like a half-hearted effort. But in reality it’s a pretty effective tool when used by all of us. It is a key component of preventing scams.

Within every major American sports franchise there are two major American sports franchises.

There is the franchise made up of the people who occupy most if not all of the public’s attention and interest: the athletes the coaches the executives the people on the field or the court or the rink the people who put them there. Theirs is a cutthroat business and everyone engaged in or following that business knows it. Players can and will be traded or cut or waived or forced to retire. They will hold out for more money. Coaches and managers can and will be fired. This is the nature of this territory and those who are part of it understand what comes with it.

But there is also the franchise made up of the people who keep the organization running smoothly who make it go during the day-to-day while having little to no impact on the team’s place in the standings. This is not to say that these people aren’t important. They are essential and they are often the longest-tenured employees in the entire organization. They process your ticket orders. They arrange interviews with players. They open the video room for the starting quarterback or the lineup’s best hitter and keep it open as long as he wants. They are lifers and they are glad to be.

The Phillies laid off four such employees this week: director of baseball communications Greg Casterioto director of video coaching Kevin Camiscioli director of minor-league operations Steve Noworyta and strength and conditioning coordinator Paul Fournier. Each of them had spent at least a decade with the organization. Casterioto Camiscioli and Noworyta had spent at least two.

These layoffs weren’t precipitated by the pandemic by any malevolent economic forces beyond the organization’s control. Dave Dombrowski the team’s president of baseball operations and Sam Fuld its general manager simply wanted new people in those positions. These changes won’t keep Bryce Harper from going 0-for-11 in a critical series against the Braves again or Aaron Nola from posting a plus-6 ERA next September or the Phillies bullpen from embarking on another six-month pyromania tour. They were not intended to. Dombrowski and Fuld wanted these four gone and deemed them dispensable so they are gone.

At another time in their history – during David Montgomery’s 22-year tenure as their president and chairman for instance from 1997 until his death from cancer in 2019 – the Phillies wouldn’t have done something so cold and ruthless. Say what you want about the quality of the teams that they fielded for many of those years. Those things have been said already including by me. The loyalty and sentimentality that Montgomery prized so much bled into the team’s player-personnel decisions led to an insistence on committing to and holding on to beloved superstar players who were about to be past their prime or were already and there’s an argument to be made that the Phillies from a baseball standpoint are still paying the price for those decisions today.

There was ample cause to question and criticize that Phillies franchise but rarely the other Phillies franchise: the Phillies as a city and community institution a place where people wanted to work for a long time and could a place where loyalty and good work were appreciated and rewarded and returned. There was a reason. Montgomery had started with the Phillies in 1971 as a sales apprentice. He was a lifer too.

In March 2018 just 14 months before Montgomery’s death the Phillies held a ceremony in Clearwater to rename their indoor training facility there after him. One lengthy excerpt from his remarks that day is worth quoting in full here because it so clearly speaks to who Montgomery was and how the Phillies operated for so long.

“It was special that the whole organization was here because as you know that’s what I believe in” he said then. “I believe that in whatever capacity you work for us you determine the Phillies family. I believe that. As a family member it’s our responsibility to treat you like family and to get to know you as best we can. That’s something I’ve always believed in.

“My business philosophy is pretty simple. We’re in a service business and we’re trying to do everything we can to attract fans and treat fans right. The best way to treat fans right is to treat the people you work with right. I don’t touch fans but so many people who work for us touch fans directly every day and if they feel that we – the organization the ownership the management – care about them as people then in my mind that’s the best way for those fans to be treated well.

“I’m proud when I’m in Philadelphia and game day staff come up to me and say how much they enjoy working for the Phillies because that means that whoever they are serving a beverage to or serving a hot dog to or if they’re acting as a host or hostess or security guard then they’re going the extra mile because they care about the organization.”

This isn’t David Montgomery’s franchise anymore in any regard. It’s to the Phillies’ discredit that it isn’t.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYnJvYWRzdHJlZXRidXp6LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzA5L2ZseWVycy1hbHVtbmktaGFsbC1mYW1lLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLWdhbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flyers Alumni To Play Special Hall Of Fame Celebration Game,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjExMDA5L29yYW4taGFsbC1maW5hbmNpYWwtc3VwcG9ydC1zZW5pb3ItY2l0aXplbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oran Hall | Financial support for senior citizens | Business,"The Ministry of Labour and Social Security provides significant support to senior citizens through the National Council for Senior Citizens and the National Insurance Scheme a compulsory contributory funded social security scheme covering all employed people in Jamaica.

Additionally our senior citizens get support from organisations such as the Caribbean Community of Retired Persons Jamaica or CCRP churches and some employers.

According to the Planning Institute of Jamaica people 60 years old and over and 65 years old and over accounted for 13.70% and 9.60% respectively of the population in 2019. People living longer and fewer babies being born are factors contributing to the proportion of senior citizens to the general population increasing. Beyond that as people have fewer children the potential for assistance in their later years is reduced.

Living longer also means that senior citizens have more years during which they are inactive and disengaged risk contracting diseases as they get older and risk being sick for a longer time. Some have very little to support themselves during this period of their lives and others watch in anxiety as inflation eats away at the purchasing power of the funds they had set aside to sustain them during the twilight years of their lives.

Although some senior citizens are members of various church communities and citizens groups many risk being marginalised and being exposed to loneliness. The National Council for Senior Citizens – established in 1976 by the Government of Jamaica – has instituted programmes to meet the physical spiritual and socio-economic needs of senior citizens at the different stages of the ageing process so that they can continue to be vital and useful members of the society.

HELPING CITIZENS

Although it has a national committee it also has parish committees to monitor its programmes at the local level and to motivate senior citizens to participate in its programmes. The programmes go beyond helping citizens to keep fit engaged fed cared for and entertained. Citizens are taught skills to help them make an income.

The Government provides the following for these citizens who are in the final stage of the life cycle: a senior citizens’ bus pass ID service handicraft instructors home help/nurse’s aide service senior day activity centres and a feeding programme and laundry service in the Corporate Area.

The National Council for Senior Citizens provides training in handicraft skills and encourages senior citizens to make and sell items. Several income-generating projects are registered with the senior citizens clubs across the island with emphasis on poultry and animal rearing handicraft culinary art horticulture agriculture and trading in dry goods.

The council also runs computer classes for seniors but at the secretariat in the Corporate Area. Other activities include cultural days to showcase the talents of seniors Senior Citizens’ Week to raise awareness of the contribution of senior citizens to national development sports at the local and national level an annual poster and essay competition a debating competition a spelling bee competition and domino tournaments.

The Home Help Service is operated by nurse aides and volunteers who visit senior citizens to assist with their health domestic and personal needs. Additionally seminars health talks workshops and health screenings are used to help senior citizens enjoy an enhanced quality of life.

Senior citizens clubs are organised in all parishes to provide a wide range of activities for citizens 60 and older who live in a particular geographical area and are led by the people they choose. Senior citizens are encouraged to join a senior citizens club or form one in their community.

People who have contributed to the NIS are eligible for certain benefits. Those that are paid for life are generally referred to as pensioners and include the following: retirement/old age benefit widow/widower’s benefit invalidity benefit disability benefit and special anniversary benefit.

The CCRP – a non-profit non-denominational non-political membership organisation – is another organisation that exists for the benefit of senior citizens. Membership is open to citizens who are 50 and over. It is closely aligned with the National Council for Senior Citizens.

Members are entitled to numerous benefits including the following:

• discounts and special offers from over 70 discount partners;

• excursions and ‘wellness & lifestyle’ social events with presentations on topics such as wellness retirement planning learning and leisure personal safety;

• professional networking to provide opportunities;

• rates for motor vehicle and property insurance with the group’s insurance partner; and

• eligibility for enrolment in CCRP group health insurance plans.

So there are provisions to improve the quality of life of our senior citizens. Perhaps the reach of some need to be extended.

Families still need to do what they can to help care for the senior members of their families and individuals as much as they are able to need to provide for the various aspects of their twilight years – which do not have to be dim.

Even in a steady rain at Mountain Ridge the 26-year-old South Korean star made it look easy. She closed with a 5-under 66 for a 4-shot victory over Caroline Masson of Germany.

Ko started the final round with a 4-shot lead and no one got closer than 3 all day. The tournament all but decided it was then a matter of how she finished. Ko ran off four birdies in a five-hole stretch in the middle of the back nine and finished at 18-under 266.

It was her 14th consecutive round in the 60s dating to a 69 in the final round of the Evian Championship. That ties the mark Sorenstam set in the middle of her 10-win season in 2005.

Sorenstam won three of four tournaments during that stretch of 14 straight rounds in the 60s including a major and was runner-up in another. Ko won twice and was runner-up and tied for sixth in the others during her streak.

Ko joined Nelly Korda as the only three-time winners on the LPGA Tour this season and she became the fifth South Korean with at least 10 victories still well short of the record 25 held by pioneer Se Ri Pak.

Next up for Ko who has played the last four weeks is a trip home and short break. She plans to play the BMW Ladies Championship the following week in South Korea -- the only Asia event in the fall because of the pandemic.

""I still have a chance (to) beat Annika and I will try to do my best"" she said after getting a champagne shower.

Ko successfully defended her title at the Founders Cup though it was as different as could be. The tournament was held in Phoenix in 2019 was canceled last year during the pandemic and then picked up a new title sponsor and moved to the Donald Ross design in New Jersey.

Those back-to-back victories came two years six months and 16 days apart on opposite ends of the country. Cognizant also doubled the prize money making it the largest purse among regular LPGA Tour events. Ko earned $450000.

More important she pulled within 20 points of Korda in the Race to the CME Globe with the end of the season fast approaching.

Korda replaced Ko's long run at No. 1 in the world this summer when she won her first major at the Women's PGA Championship. The 23-year-old American also won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

Korda closed with a 73 at Mountain Ridge and tied for 19th. She has three wins in her past six events and those are her only top 10s.

Korda is not playing in South Korea leaving Ko an excellent chance to move past her on the season points list. The LPGA then concludes with two Florida events capped off by the CME Group Tour Championship.

Ko won the season finale a year ago after spending much of the season riding out the pandemic in South Korea. That gives her four victories in the last calendar year.

She was particularly motivated by last week at the ShopRite LPGA Classic when Ko had control of the tournament until missing a series of 10-foot putts on the back nine and finishing 1 shot behind Celine Boutier.

""I was really sad last week. Sunday wasn't good"" she said. ""I tried to do my best for this week and I did.""

After announcing the $771 million acquisition of REC Solar from ChemChina Reliance Industries is also buying Sterling and Wilson Solar from its promoters making a big splash towards its renewable energy foray the company said on Sunday late evening.Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd (SPCPL) and Khurshed Yazdi Daruvala promoter-shareholders of Sterling and Wilson Solar cumulatively own 69.36 per cent of the company with the public owning the rest. The promoters had raised Rs 2850 crore from the public through an IPO in 2019 but subsequently failed to repay the loans of the company a year later though it was promised in the prospectus. This created a future among shareholders who demanded an exit for their investments citing a breach of trust. Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNEL) a wholly owned arm of Reliance Industries will be issued fresh shares of Sterling and Wilson as a preferential allotment of 2.93 crore shares at Rs 375/share representing 15.46% of the company’s expanded equity base. Another 9.70% of the company will be acquired by RNESL from Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd at the same price. It will also trigger an open offer for an additional 25.7% of the company as per Indian takeover regulations and if fully successful RNESL will hold 40% stake involving a total pay out of Rs 3630 crore.The market capitalisation of Sterling and Wilson Solar as on Friday was Rs 6972.45 crore.The company had a consolidated net loss of Rs 76.02 crore against a net profit of Rs 17.22 crore in the quarter ended on June 30 2021.The stock however has zoomed 60% in the last 3 months in anticipation of a deal. On September 29 this year SP Group and SWSL repaid an outstanding debt of Rs. 2563 crore further paving the way for a transaction.ET in its edition dated September 8th was the first to report that Sterling and Wilson’s promoters are looking at divesting their stake and might even give up control and was in talks with players like Adani Group RIL  Brookfield among others.Sterling and Wilson is one of the world's leading EPC (engineering procurement construction) players and has executed projects worth 11 GW across the globe though in the recent past been overtaken by Tata Power’s EPC division as the SP’s Group debt overhang slowed its growth prospects forcing the Mistry family to sell down family jewels like Eureka Forbes. In March the Reserve Bank of India-appointed KV Kamath committee approved a one-time restructuring package for 150 year old SP Group’s Rs 10900 crore debt under the Covid-19 relief framework. The sell offs are part of that exercise.As on August 14 2021 the company’s unexecuted order book stood at Rs 8731 crore which is executable over the period of next 12 to 15 months.With the two transactions Reliance will become among the top players in two crucial areas of solar renewable projects: solar cell manufacturing and EPC a time when the dominance of Chinese manufacturers have come under heightened global scrutiny. It also gives Reliance access to cutting-edge technology and global manufacturing capabilities as well as a domestic base that will help the group with a strong foundation.It also has invested in US-based battery storage technology company Ambri Inc along with Bill Gates and Paulson and Co.These deals come at the heels of Ambani's announcements for ambitious green energy plans with the setting up of the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5000 acres in Jamnagar at the company’s 44th annual general meeting in June. With a $10-billion investment the company plans four giga factories — an integrated solar PV plant advanced energy storage battery manufacturing unit green hydrogen and fuel cell facility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkva2FucHVyL2thbnB1ci1tZXRyby10cmFpbnMtdG8tY29uc2VydmUtZW5lcmd5L2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2OTAxNjYwLmNtc9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkva2FucHVyL2thbnB1ci1tZXRyby10cmFpbnMtdG8tY29uc2VydmUtZW5lcmd5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjkwMTY2MC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kanpur Metro trains to conserve energy,KANPUR: Following the concept of ‘Clean Metro Green Metro’ and to fulfill the objective of energy conservation Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (UPMRC) has claimed another innovation while executing the Kanpur Metro Rail Project.UPMRC claimed that for the very first time in India it has made the provision in the Kanpur Metro Rail Project for installing a special inverter device with the Third Rail DC Traction System to convert the Direct Current (DC) power regenerated through the train’s breaking into Alternate Current and reroute the same to the Metro System for reuse.Kanpur Metro trains will have the energy efficiency of about 40-45% which means at the expenditure of every 1000 units upto 450 units can be regenerated through braking and be used again with the help of ‘Regenerative Braking Technology’. No other Metro Project in India that is running on the Third Rail DC Traction System has such type of arrangement to conserve energy.UPMRC said that at present Bangalore Kochi Ahmedabad Kolkata and Gurgaon Rapid Metro Projects are operating on the Third Rail DC Traction System in the country and none of them have any provision to reuse the Direct Current (DC) energy regenerated through train braking. This is because the energy regenerated is in DC form while the rest of the Metro system runs on AC current. UPMRC has provided the special inverter for the Traction System in Kanpur which can convert 750 volts DC current regenerated through braking of train into 33 KV AC current for reuse in the system.Managing Director UPMRC Kumar Keshav Managing Director said “With the objective of ‘Clean Metro Green Metro’ we have made innovations for energy conservation while executing our projects. In the Metro Projects operating with AC Traction System in the country including Lucknow there is a provision for energy conservation with the technique of ‘Regenerative Braking’ but no such system is available for the Third Rail DC Traction System. With the help of this innovation the Kanpur Metro Rail Project will set an example in terms of energy conservation for all other Metro Projects in the country that are operating on the Third Rail Traction System.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFUdXJraXNoR0VUQVNzaWduTW9VLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEcTQ4eWFyMUtxU3FuNEhhS0d0cWFFWSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEA Turkish GETAS sign MoU,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/SEATurkishGETASsignMoU.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDq48yar1KqSqn4HaKGtqaEY%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFUdXJraXNoR0VUQVNzaWduTW9VLmFzcHg_Y21zPXE4Rm1GSmdpc2NMMmZ3SXpPTjElMkJEcTQ4eWFyMUtxU3FuNEhhS0d0cWFFWSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Need to boost biofuel production to reduce dependence on import of crude oil and fuel gases: Nitin Gadkari,"

Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday stressed the need to enhance the production of biofuel in the country by using the stubble of certain crops to reduce the dependence on the import of crude oil and fuel gases and said he had converted his tractor into a CNG vehicle.Gadkari virtually addressed the International Soy Conclave organised by the Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA) in Madhya Pradesh.“I have converted my (diesel-run) tractor into a CNG-powered vehicle. We should encourage the production of bio CNG and bio LNG using the stubble of crops like soybean wheat paddy cotton etc. to reduce the dependence on imports of crude oil and fuel gases. This will generate additional income for farmers” the Road Transport and Highways Minister said.Gadkari's suggestion came at a time when the retail prices of petrol and diesel have skyrocketed in the country following the rise in the rates of crude oil in the international market.The Union minister said India is currently importing 65 per cent of the total edible oil it needs at the cost of Rs 1.40 lakh crore every year.""Due to import the prices of edible oils are high in the country's retail market while on the other hand domestic oil seed-growing farmers are not getting good prices for their produce” he said.Gadkari stressed the need to develop GM ( Genetically Modified ) seeds for soybean on the lines of mustard to remove its shortcomings to ensure that the country becomes self-reliant in the production of edible oil.""I have also discussed this (issue of GM seeds for soybean) with Prime Minister. I know that many people in the country are opposed to GM seeds. But we could not stop the import of soybean oil extracted from GM soybeans from other countries” he said.Gadkari said the people should be made aware of the development of GM soybean seeds in India.He also underlined the need to conduct detailed research on making food products from Soya oil cake (residue after the extraction of oil from soybean seeds) to address malnutrition especially in tribal areas.“Thousands of tribals in our country are dying of malnutrition due to the lack of protein (in their diet). Soya cake is rich in protein” he said.The BJP MP from Maharashtra also appealed to agricultural scientists in the country to try to initiate a joint seed development programme with top global producers of the soybean crop including the USA Brazil and Argentina to increase the per-acre production capacity of this oilseed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2luZGlhLXR3ZWFrcy1wb2xpY3ktdG8tdXNlLWJpb21hc3MtcGVsbGV0cy1pbi1jb2FsLWZpcmVkLXBvd2VyLXBsYW50cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84Njg4ODI1Mi5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9wb3dlci9pbmRpYS10d2Vha3MtcG9saWN5LXRvLXVzZS1iaW9tYXNzLXBlbGxldHMtaW4tY29hbC1maXJlZC1wb3dlci1wbGFudHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2ODg4MjUyLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India tweaks policy to use biomass pellets in coal-fired power plants,"

McDonald's and Coca-Cola are raising funds in memory of a Southern California woman who suffered from cerebral palsy and died last month.

SUNDLAND LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A McDonald's in Sunland held a fundraiser event for Karen Sydow who passed away in September and suffered from cerebral palsy. Residents and her brother Erik Sydow showed up to support.

""Being able to see Karen with COVID was beyond difficult"" said Erik Sydow. ""I remember her as being very warm to me. We had a relationship that I always got a hug. It was my job to just always get a little smile out of her.""

Her brother wrote an emotional obituary in the Los Angeles Times - which went viral on Twitter. Erik Sydow wrote about the three words his sister knew one of them being 'Donalds' in reference to her favorite place McDonald's.

""If Karen was here she wouldn't care about anything other than getting her cheeseburger and her fries"" said Erik Sydow. ""She wouldn't observe what's going on. But she'd be happy just to be here.""

The tweet caught the attention of McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Two McDonald's franchises have pledged to donate part of their sales. The McDonald's Southern California Group promised to match that up to $15000. The Coca-Cola Company also stepped in to help during the fundraiser. They have pledged any Coca-Cola sale proceeds will be donated. All of the money raised will benefit Tierra Del Sol a nonprofit center for people with disabilities. The nonprofit cared for Karen for over 30 years.

""Karen was a person who would walk into a room and her smile would light it up"" said Rebecca Lienhard CEO of Tierra Del Sol. ""She was a woman of few words but you knew when she was happy.""

Last week the McDonald's in West Hills held a fundraiser and raised more than $8000 for Tierra Del Sol.

""Any amount I think is beneficial and that's great"" said Erik Sydow. ""I want to thank everybody from my heart.""

Earlier this year a Brand Intimacy Study conducted by New York City marketing agency MBLM surveyed 3000 consumers in the U.S. to see how they connect with different companies and Coca-Cola ranked No. 1 in the beverage category. That iconic Coke logo—or Diet Coke or Coke Zero depending on your preferences—is practically synonymous with American culture. So when the company announced on Oct. 8 that they were making a big change to their look one they haven't made in five years it came as a surprise to many. To find out about Coke's latest transformation read on!

Coke is replacing its logo for the first time in five years.

For the first time in five years Coca-Cola is rebranding and that means saying goodbye to the current Coke logo and swapping it for a new one. Under the company's new platform called ""Real Magic"" there will be ""a new design identity for the Coke Trademark—which includes Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Light/Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar—anchored by a fresh expression of the Coca-Cola logo"" the company said in the announcement on its website.

Called the ""Hug"" logo and conceptualized by Wieden+Kennedy London the new design isn't a total overhaul but it does curve around the sides more than the current logo as AdWeek points out. The company says it was ""inspired by iconic Coca-Cola packages wrapped with our signature trademark.""

Coke's new campaign comes as the company tries to revive sales that dipped due to COVID.

Because Coke products—and advertisements—are a staple of many in-person experiences like going to the movies or hitting up a professional ball game the company's visibility seems to have been dampened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Coca-Cola's net revenue fell 28 percent in the second quarter of 2020. (However things seem to be looking up—in the second quarter of 2021 net revenue went up 42 percent.)

""We're at an inflection point"" Manolo Arroyo chief marketing officer for Coca-Cola said in a statement. ""The last 18 months have disrupted every aspect of life and presented us with a once-in-a-generation choice to go back to a binary black-and-white way of seeing the world or help make the world a better place. 'Real Magic' is about creating a movement to choose a more human way of doing things by embracing our unique perspectives.""

Coke's new ads will also reflect that non-binary gray way of seeing the world. ""This is the most diverse visual representation of the Coca-Cola brand in our history"" Rapha Abreu Coca-Cola's global vice president of design said in a statement. ""It is diverse not only in the creatives who helped bring 'Real Magic' to life and the people featured in the work but also in the different photography and illustration styles colors and treatments used.""

The first example of Coca-Cola's new platform is the ""One Coke Away From Each Other"" ad which launched on Sept. 30 and centers on the world of online gamers. It also features the new Coke logo at the end (seen here).

Coke has gotten rid of half of its drinks in the past year.

In Oct. 2020 Coca-Cola announced the company would be cutting 200 drinks about half of its entire product portfolio. ""The company expects to offer a portfolio of approximately 200 master brands an approximate 50 percent reduction from the current number and phase out some products"" James Quincey chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola said in an announcement at the time.

The company got rid of the iconic '70s soda Tab along with some newer beverages like Diet Coke Feisty Cherry Sprite Lemonade and Coke Life. ""Plans to streamline the company's beverage lineup were underway well before the coronavirus outbreak but the pandemic promoted leadership to move faster"" the company said in a statement at the time. ""Ongoing COVID-19 supply chain challenges and shifting shopping behaviors prompted the company to fast-track its plan.""

Then in May 2021 Coca-Cola announced they'd be discontinuing their only energy drink Coke Energy in North America after it failed to compete in a market dominated by Red Bull and Monster. By the time Coke Energy is discontinued at the end of 2021 it will have only been on the market for less than two years as Beverage Digest reported.

But Coke has bought some new products to the table as well.

A Coca-Cola spokesperson told Reuters in May that the company is turning its focus to new better-selling drinks—like AHA sparkling water and Coca-Cola with Coffee which were both introduced in the last two years. AHA was launched in Mar. 2020 and Coca-Cola with Coffee first hit the U.S. market in Jan. 2021. A company spokesperson told CNN in May that they're trying to do ""consistent and constant evaluation of what's performing and what's not.""ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

Coca-Cola also seems to be leaning into the surge of popularity of water and tea sales with the launch of Smartwater+ in February and Honest Yerba Mate in April. They also revamped the flavor and look of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar better known as Coke Zero in July and teamed up with Molson Coors to launch Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in March.

""We love our brands make no mistake [but] we want to make sure that we create space for new"" Cath Coetzer head of Coca-Cola's innovation and marketing operations told The Wall Street Journal in Oct. 2020 when it was announced that Tab was being discontinued. ""It's about meeting our consumers where they need us to meet them.""

He is the face of and focal point of an industry-wide initiative that began in 2019 Daniel’s Amigos to drive awareness and grow the Hispanic and Latino fan base in the sport of NASCAR. Portada talked to Suarez about how he reaches out to the Hispanic sports fan.

As a rising star in the sport that is proud of his Mexican roots Daniel Suarez has teamed with Coca-Cola racing to plan several special moments throughout Hispanic Heritage Month. First Daniel raced on September 18 in the Bass Pro Shops night race in Bristol TN in a sphecially designed car with a Hispanic Heritage Month commemorative paint scheme.

The second event was a Daniel’s Amigos meet-and-greet event with Daniel Suarez before the race in Las Vegas on September 26. This event was also in partnership with Coca-Cola NASCAR Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Trackhouse Racing (Daniel’s racing team). Invitees included Las Vegas Hispanic Chamber of Commerce leaders local Hispanic College leaders and students from the Nevada “SLAM” school a sports leadership-focused charter school. There are several SLAM schools across the country (started in Miami) and Armando “Pitbull” Perez is heavily involved with the SLAM Foundation and the establishment of the schools.

Daniel will wrap up Hispanic Heritage Month in Charlotte North Carolina on October 9. Coca-Cola and NASCAR will be sponsors of the 9th annual Charlotte Hola Festival the largest Hispanic Heritage celebration in Charlotte highlighting Latin American culture and all its richness. Daniel will make an appearance speaking to festival attendees and giving away some tickets to the October 10th race the Bank of America ROVAL 400 which will happen in Concord North Carolina just outside of Charlotte.

Coca-Cola Nascar: Portada interviewed Suarez about his experience as the only Mexican-born driver in the NASCAR Cup Series

Portada: What has your experience been as the only Mexican-born driver in the NASCAR Cup Series and how does it feel to be the face for Hispanics in the sport?

Daniel Suarez: “It’s an honor privilege and a responsibility. I’m proud of where I come from and hope I can serve as an inspiration to those kids who want to come to NASCAR someday as drivers engineers or whatever they want to do in the sport.”

With the Hispanic population growing in the country do you sense a growing interest in NASCAR from Hispanics and does it excite you to be someone those Hispanics can look up to and support?

D.S.: “Oh yes I see more and more Hispanics at the race track every year. We have a strong car culture and family culture that I think fits NASCAR perfectly. I want to show that they are welcome here and that they will have a good time when they visit.”

How do you feel you can help attract your fellow Hispanics to become NASCAR enthusiasts?

D. S.: “I think we can show them they are welcome and this sport’s values are their values. And just how much fun and cool it is to come to watch the racing. I think if we can get them to the track they will keep coming back.”

What can NASCAR and the sport do to attract more Hispanics?

D. S.: “We have to keep showing everyone they are welcome and show them a good time with things to do before and after the race.”



How do partnerships – like yours with Coca-Cola Racing – help to appeal more to Hispanics?

D. S.: “Coca-Cola has gone out of its way to help me show the Hispanic community how welcoming NASCAR is to everyone. We ran a special paint scheme honoring National Hispanic Heritage month at Bristol and they were strong supporters of the Daniel’s Amigos program when we brought several hundred Hispanic fans to Las Vegas Motor Speedway. About 70 percent of the people we brought were coming to a NASCAR event for the first time.”

You recently held an event for Daniel’s Amigos at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a long hiatus due to the pandemic. What is it like to connect with your fans in a city with a large Hispanic population and how do you feel getting to interact with fans again?

D. S.: “The fans are the best part of racing. Getting to meet them hear their stories share your story with them. We had a Mariachi Band and gave away a lot of prizes. It was a lot of fun. I hope we can work with Coca-Cola and NASCAR to do more and more events in the future.”

What was it like to sport your native Mexican colors on your car to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month? What role did you play in helping design the look of the car?

D. S.: “I loved it. Coca-Cola and Trackhouse designed the paint scheme and it was one of the best I have ever seen. That car just looked fast. I got a ton of compliments on how cool our Chevrolet looked that night in Bristol.”

How Coca-Cola Racing NASCAR Driver Daniel Suarez Inspires Hispanic Sports Fans

How has your partnership with Coca-Cola Racing helped raise your profile as a driver?

D. S.: “Coke has used us in so many different ways. From Daniel’s Amigos to sustainability issues to the whole Coke Family of Drivers. It’s been a lot of fun to be part of the Coca-Cola Racing program and look forward to keeping working with them in the future.”

What do you look for when considering a sponsorship like Coca-Cola? Do you look for sponsors that are aligned with your values and mission?

D. S.: “Of course. Coca-Cola has been a huge supporter of mine and I feel like we have been a great team for several years now. They are very good friends. Daniels Amigos would not have happened without a lot of hard work by Coca-Cola. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what they have done for me.“",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvcmVjeWNsaW5nL3BsYXN0aWNzLXJlY3ljbGluZy1tZWV0LWRlYWRsaW5lLzk5L2kzN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will plastics recycling meet its deadline?,"AMP Robotics has a Silicon Valley–type solution to the knotty problem of postconsumer plastics: How do you harvest valuable materials from dirty streams of mixed waste?

In brief Consumer product companies have set ambitious targets for incorporating recycled plastic into their packages—25% of their total packaging by 2025 in many cases. These brand owners seem newly committed to the goals and their suppliers are mobilizing to get them more of the high-purity resins they need for food-grade packaging. Companies are rolling out recognizable brands in 100% recycled bottles and are redesigning packaging to ease recycling. But with just a few years to go companies have made only modest progress toward their targets and will need to accelerate efforts to succeed.

AMP’s technology is based on machine learning and works on the same principles as phone apps that identify wildflowers or sensors in autonomous vehicles that scan the road. “These approaches are fundamentally using a form of pattern recognition that is based on training in an artificial neural network” says Rob Writz AMP’s director of commercial partnerships.

AMP’s machines deployed in 160 recycling facilities across North America “infer in real time” what items are whizzing by on a conveyor belt Writz says. If they identify an unwanted object—a metal can contaminating a stream of plastic beverage bottles for example—a pneumatic arm descends to suck it off the line.

The machines are discriminating Writz says. They can tell polypropylene cups from polystyrene ones recognizing the differences in luster clarity and the patterns they exhibit when bent and distorted. And they can do the job of identifying objects and pulling them off the line twice as fast humans who can pluck out only about 40 objects from a stream per minute.

Plastics recycling desperately needs such innovation. Despite years of lip service to the need to recycle the US plastics recycling rate is still less than 10% according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Other regions perform better but need improvement. In Europe for example the rate is nearly 33% according to Conversio Market & Strategy.

Improving recycling will require new technologies to solve the problems that make plastics difficult to recycle. It will also demand collaboration and investment across the complex ecosystem of brand owners consumers municipalities waste management firms recyclers and chemical companies.

Lofty goals for brands

Facing mounting pressure over plastic waste industry has promised to improve. The world’s largest consumer product companies—Coca-Cola Unilever PepsiCo and others—have set ambitious targets for replacing virgin resins with recycled ones a typical goal being 25% by 2025. The undertaking is massive. Coca-Cola alone produces 112 billion plastic bottles a year enough to buy the world a Coke as the firm’s famous ad campaign suggested 14 times over.

To help hit these targets chemical companies are promoting chemical recycling—processes such as depolymerization and pyrolysis that break down plastics into feedstock that can be converted into new plastics. But chemical recycling is largely untested with the first large-scale plants only starting to come on line.

For now plastics recycling relies almost exclusively on traditional mechanical recycling—as it has for decades.

This decidedly unglamorous process starts when residents leave recyclables for their local trash haulers. Materials recovery facilities sort the metal glass and plastics with equipment such as optical sorters that use infrared light to separate plastics or the newer artificial intelligence machines from AMP. Material reclaimers shred wash melt and repelletize the plastics for sale to molders. Higher-purity resins destined to go back into food packaging go through more meticulous finishing steps.

To reach their ambitious goals consumer product companies will need to draw from this system more than ever before. Coca-Cola aims for 50% recycled content across all its packaging by 2030. But in 2020 it was 22% and just 11.5% for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) the main polymer used in beverage bottles. Keurig Dr Pepper has reached only 2% recycled plastic against a goal of 25% by 2025.

Many of these firms are introducing recycled packaging for their most famous brands to boost their numbers and signal to the public that they care. In 2019 Unilever introduced its Hellmann’s mayonnaise in containers with “Jar Made from 100% Recycled Plastic” printed conspicuously on the label. Coca-Cola launched 100% recycled bottles in the US this year. PepsiCo is introducing them in Europe.

Whether companies will meet their goals—more than doubling in most cases their use of recycled resin in a few short years—is possibly the most important question facing the plastics industry today. Given decades of glacial progress many observers are not confident that they will.

“There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through” says Conrad MacKerron senior vice president of As You Sow an organization that prods big corporations on environmental performance.

For instance according to an As You Sow study Coca-Cola set a goal of 25% recycled content in the early 1990s only to abandon it in 1994. The company unveiled a new target in 2011 of incorporating 25% recycled or renewable content by 2015 but achieved only 12.4%.

PepsiCo had a goal of 50% recycled content in its containers by 2018 that it quietly abandoned. The company later set a target of 25% recycled content by 2025. Just last month the firm tweaked its goal again raising its target to 50% while pushing the deadline to 2030.

But times may have changed. MacKerron says those previous missed goals were set before plastics became the hot topic they are today. “It was more of a back-burner issue and we were working on it but not a lot of groups were working on it” he says. And MacKerron notes companies are more open to collaboration than they were in the past when sustainability initiatives were largely internal.

Moreover companies realize they must invest significantly to achieve recycling goals. Nestlé for example has allocated $1.6 billion to pay premiums for recycled material over virgin plastics. Nestlé aims to motivate recyclers and waste management companies to expand their operations.

“If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge” says Evan Arnold vice president of business development at Glenroy which makes flexible packaging for clients such as Costco Wholesale. Earlier this year Glenroy launched a line of stand-up pouches which boast 48% recycled resin content for food and personal care products.

“We really have to be the one that stands up and says ‘Yeah we’ll utilize this’ ” Arnold says about recycled resin. “We’ll explain to our customers the benefits of using this and face the challenge of using recycled products head-on.”

Passing the quality bar

One of the biggest challenges for consumer product companies is procuring enough of the high-quality resins they need for containers that contact food and beverages. These plastics are a cut above the recycled plastics used for carpet fiber or detergent bottles in terms of purity and performance.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued guidelines on recycled resins for food packaging and sends letters of no objection to companies that meet them. Recyclers must for example demonstrate that only food-contact containers enter their process. The FDA recommends recyclers subject their operations to surrogate contaminant testing in which plastics are spiked with chemicals like chloroform or toluene to see how well they are removed. Ultimately the aim is to keep residue levels below 200–300 µg/kg.

The FDA has issued more than 250 of the no-objection letters for food-packaging plastics in recent years mostly for products containing PET. That resin is recycled more than other plastics with a US recycling rate of 28% according to the National Association for PET Container Resources. But that number hasn’t moved much for years and lags behind the global figure of 50%. Moreover only about 28% of recycled bottles become food and beverage containers again. The rest are downcycled into products like carpet fiber and strapping used to tie lumber together.

Jon McNaull vice president of resins for DAK Americas an Alpek Polyester business and the largest virgin-PET producer and recycler in the Americas says PET naturally lends itself to recycling because it is resilient and less likely than other polymers to break down while being re-formed into finished goods. And any breakdown can be reversed through solid stating a process in which the polymer is heated to just above its glass-transition temperature so its chains react and build molecular weight.

There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through. Conrad MacKerron senior vice president As You Sow

“You can create a consumer product beverage container and you can send it to the consumer and you can bring it back and you can put it through this industry and make it back into a suitable safe consumer container again” McNaull says.

A lot goes into that transformation explains Srinivasan Prabhushankar CEO of recycling for Indorama Ventures the world’s largest PET maker and recycler. Indorama buys bottles that have been collected at curbsides or through local deposit systems. Workers remove errant metals paper non-PET containers and even PET containers that are tinted brown or green. The PET is then chopped into flake and washed.

Such flake at this point might be good enough for strapping or carpet fiber. But to meet the FDA’s food-contact guidelines it needs more treatment. Indorama scans the flake with infrared light that helps machinery identify the remaining contaminants—for instance bits of off-color PET that previously escaped notice.

The flake is then melted. A near vacuum of about 1 mbar of pressure is applied to the molten resin to suck up any remaining volatile compounds. The resin is also filtered to remove microscale particles. Solid stating builds up the molecular chains until the PET has the right viscosity for bottles again. Every Indorama plant has a quality-control lab where resin samples are collected frequently and analyzed in gas chromatographs mass spectrometers and other instruments.

The process is expensive Prabhushankar says. Brand owners are willing to pay more for the recycled PET but recycling still doesn’t make money. “They are only compensating us for the cost that we incur” he says. “There are many recyclers who are unable to continue.” Case in point he notes is the high-end PET recycler CarbonLite which was liquidated recently and sold to competitors.

Two of those competitors were DAK and Indorama both of which are plunging increasingly into PET recycling in a bid to be one-stop shops that offer virgin resin recycled resin and blends to an increasingly environmentally conscious clientele. “Our customers’ requirements change and we are going to modify our capital expenditures and our strategy to service their needs” McNaull says.

DAK has nearly 400000 metric tons (t) per year of recycling capacity some of it from a CarbonLite plant it bought in Reading Pennsylvania. Of that capacity some 120000 t goes into pellets for food and beverage containers. The company aims to make recycled PET 25% of its sales by 2025.

Indorama plans to spend $1.5 billion on recycling to reach a goal of annually recycling about 50 billion bottles—representing about 750000 t of PET—by 2025. To further this goal the company bought a CarbonLite plant in Dallas. That purchase along with other expansion projects should bring the company to half its objective by next year Prabhushankar says.

Recycling polyolefins for food-contact applications is even more challenging than recycling PET largely because those plastics are used in a much wider variety of packaging.

Troy Alabama–based KW Plastics is the world’s largest recycler of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene. The company has 250000 t of annual capacity and is expanding by 65%.

It is also one of only a handful of US polyolefin recyclers to receive a letter of no objection from the FDA. Meeting the agency’s standards is a multistep process according to Scott Saunders KW’s general manager. Workers start by thoroughly inspecting the bales of plastic that arrive from materials recovery facilities. The firm can process yogurt containers for example but must remove the non-food-contact items like kitty-litter buckets and shampoo bottles.

KW carefully shreds and washes the containers and like the PET recyclers applies a vacuum to molten resins to remove volatile compounds. It then adds colorants antioxidants and other food-contact additives to meet customer specifications.

KW’s products don’t go into food packaging but rather personal care containers like shampoo bottles and deodorant sticks for which its customers in consumer products want a high-purity polymer with food-grade quality. Saunders worries that selling into actual food-contact markets might expose his firm to liability.

And business in the personal care segment which KW serves is booming. Not long ago Saunders says KW’s material was sold as a low-cost alternative to virgin plastics. Now big brands are clamoring for high-end polyolefins. “In 2014 or 2015 we couldn’t get an audience with a lot of consumer product companies” he says. “Today we know all of them.”

The solvent solution

If high-volume recycling has been difficult to achieve for PET and polyethylene it has been nearly impossible for polypropylene and polystyrene. Solvent extraction could solve this problem.

The most prominent practitioner of solvent recycling is PureCycle Technologies which is trying to turn polypropylene recycling around. Polypropylene is one of the most ubiquitous polymers found in soft-drink cups face masks and car bumpers. But only 1% of polypropylene is recycled according to the American Chemistry Council. Many municipalities don’t even bother to collect it.

It is polypropylene’s very versatility that hinders its recycling says Dustin Olson PureCycle’s chief manufacturing officer. “The reason it isn’t getting recycled at a higher rate is because of the various applications that it’s in” he says. Each of them requires its own set of dyes fillers impact modifiers and other additives.

I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO Polystyvert

A consumer product company Procter & Gamble developed PureCycle’s process in the early 2010s. In a presentation last November John Layman director of sustainable materials development at P&G said the company uses polypropylene more than any other plastic—for example in items like toothbrush and razor-blade handles nonwoven fabrics and container caps. P&G he said is also a cleaning specialist which led its technologists to wonder: “Can we put our powers of cleaning to work on cleaning recycled resins?”

The process it developed uses supercritical butane to dissolve polypropylene. Olson says PureCycle plays with temperature and pressure so pure polypropylene precipitates out of the solvent and leaves contaminants behind. “What we are doing is dry-cleaning the molecules” he says.

PureCycle went public earlier this year by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. PureCycle is building a plant in Ironton Ohio that will have about 50000 t of annual capacity when it opens next year. The company plans to spend $440 million on a much larger plant in Augusta Georgia. With local partners Mitsui & Co. and SK Geo Centric it is studying operations in Japan and South Korea as well.

Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO and founder of Montreal-based Polystyvert has a similar ambition for polystyrene another notoriously difficult-to-recycle resin with a US recycling rate that also hovers around 1% according to the EPA.

Polystyvert’s technology uses p-cymene a solvent with a particular affinity for polystyrene. After dissolving the polymer and filtering out contaminants the firm precipitates it by adding heptane.

In June Polystyvert completed an investment round that included the European packaging firm BEWI. Brouard Gaillot won’t say how much money Polystyvert raised but she says it is enough to build the company’s first commercial-scale plant a 10000 t unit in Montreal. “We can use it as a showcase to license the technology” Brouard Gaillot says.

The environment for new recycling technology is better than it has ever been. Like others Brouard Gaillot contends that interest by consumer product companies and the public is bringing constructive change.

“I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. People were not ready to put money on the table” she says. “Now the demand for recycled polystyrene is very high and it’s more expensive than virgin. That’s a speedy evolution.”

Big challenges remain

But improving plastics recycling will take more than just new technology and the willingness of consumer product companies to buy more recycled resin. Plastics recyclers say two big advances are needed if the recycling rate is to increase appreciably: a vast expansion in collection and easier-to-recycle plastic goods.

PET firms see the main bottleneck as the collection step. “We will expand our business to the extent we can get bottles to support the expansion but collection expansion is key” DAK’s McNaull says.

Indorama’s Prabhushankar says people often don’t have the options or the motivation to dispose of their bottles responsibly. “Consumers are not fully educated on the value of the bottles that they have” he says. “If they make the wrong choice and put the bottle in the trash bin then it’s gone. That one decision point decides the entire fate of the bottle.”

Bottle deposit systems where people get a monetary incentive to bring their bottles back to the store help but only 10 of the 50 US states have them. In California which has a deposit system the collection rate is nearly 70% Prabhushankar says. In Alabama which has no deposit or even curbside collection in some places it is less than 10%.

If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge. Evan Arnold vice president of business development Glenroy

In a 2020 report the Recycling Partnership says only 32% of the 37.4 million t of commodities of all kinds that could be recycled annually in the US actually are. Only 52% of US households participate in curbside recycling programs either because they aren’t available or because people aren’t using them. The report says $9.8 billion in investment is needed to close the gap.

Experts agree that collection is the rate-limiting step of the entire recycling system. For example KW’s Saunders says that the US recycling rate for high-density polyethylene bottles—the kind used for milk and detergent jugs—is currently 28%. But it could be doubled through additional collection without new processing plants.

“The low-hanging fruit is to maximize the capacity of what’s already installed” Saunders says. “And to do that as an industry and a country and a society we’ve got to convince people that have that container in their hand to put it in a recycling bin somewhere and not in the trash.”

But Saunders has noticed changes for the better. “We’ve seen a tremendous amount of investment happening in sortation” he says. “We’re seeing growth in the material and we’re seeing the quality improve.”

Further improvement advocates say will require consumer product makers to redesign their packaging so it is easier to recycle in today’s mechanical systems. In one example of designing for recycling Unilever modified the black plastic used in its Axe deodorant and TRESemmé hair care brands so they are detected by optical scanners. PepsiCo is eliminating the green tint in its 7Up bottles in Europe. Danone is selling its Evian water in France with no label at all.

Keurig Dr Pepper transitioned its coffee pods from styrenic resins to polypropylene. And the company has been working with AMP Robotics so the new pods will be recognizable to the artificial intelligence machines. Many more and varied collaborative efforts will be needed to make a dent in recycling Writz says. “To make more packaging truly recyclable you have to work on different aspects of the supply chain.”

And more design for recycling is needed to reverse momentum that for decades has made plastic goods complicated and difficult to recycle. For example brands and stores love multilayer packaging for colorful stand-up pouches but the multiple plastics and metallized layers they involve make them tough to recycle.

Glenroy’s Arnold says 95% of his firm’s technical development time is spent tackling such problems and advising clients to adopt simpler packaging. “If the brand feels much safer with a metallized option even if it isn’t needed they would have probably in the past leaned that way just to have the extra protection” he says. Now brands are seeing that they can have sufficient protection in a simpler nonmetallized more sustainable material he says.

Steve Alexander president of the Association of Plastic Recyclers a trade group says consumer product firms need to recognize that in a circular economy they are their own raw material suppliers. “You cannot create a supply of recycled resin if you’re contaminating the very stream of material you want the recycling community to create” he says.

Chemical recycling offers itself as a different solution to the multimaterial problem. Chemical recycling especially pyrolysis is billed as a technology that can break down whatever plastic is fed into a reactor into basic molecular building blocks. But Alexander fears this yet-to-be-realized promise will give consumer product companies an excuse not to design their packaging for mechanical recycling.

Alexander sees chemical recycling as a complement to the current incumbent. “The collection infrastructure we have in this country and how recycling programs work is always going to be mechanical recycling. Where chemical recycling fits in is taking those materials that are not appropriate for mechanical recycling” he says. He’d like to keep that category to a minimum.

And veterans of mechanical recycling are skeptical that chemical recyclers will ever achieve what they have been doing day in and day out for decades. “If somebody builds a chemical plant and they can take a variety of resins blended together in a bale and deal with 20% contamination by rocks dirt glass paper chicken bones—all the things that we deal with—I’ll be a big cheerleader of that” Saunders says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc3RhcnR1cHN0b3J5bWVkaWEuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzLTEwLTIxLWZhc3RyYWNrLWNvY2EtY29sYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fastrack and Coca-Cola team up to launch a co-branded watch collection,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://startupstorymedia.com/insights-10-21-fastrack-coca-cola/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc3RhcnR1cHN0b3J5bWVkaWEuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzLTEwLTIxLWZhc3RyYWNrLWNvY2EtY29sYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Date 10.10.2021 Read time 3 Min The 2021 Turkish Grand Prix is next up for Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team and ahead of the race we're shining the spotlight on a local fan set to experience Formula One live for the first time.

Arman Yetik's passion for Formula One began in 2017 and it's a path that has led him to the fan-favourite venue of Istanbul Park this weekend. This is Arman's story in his own words.

I was always interested in cars and racing as a young boy but the first time I watched a full Formula One race was in the early 2010s. I was just a casual follower until early 2017 but then I started looking into F1 in more depth and became a proper fan.

I admire every driver on the grid but Sebastian is unique. He has already achieved huge milestones in his career and seeing his off-track causes and activism makes me respect him even more.

It's difficult to pick an exact Formula One moment as my favourite but I loved Germany in 2019. What a chaotic race that was. Sebastian's performance was incredible finishing second in wet and tricky conditions.

However I think my new favourite moment is going to be the 2021 Turkish Grand Prix because it will be my very first Formula One experience. I'm very excited for it.

As an unusual anti-clockwise design Istanbul is already a challenging circuit. With those blind apexes uphill and downhill fast corners and long straights it becomes even tougher for the drivers. It all adds up to create the fascinating character of Istanbul Park.

With corners like the incredible Turn Eight Istanbul Park has always been exciting. Felipe Massa's first pole and win (2006) Red Bull's drama (2013) and Lewis Hamilton's great fight back to second from an early spin in GP2 (2006) are all moments to remember.

I often do a lap around the track on my PC and the most difficult part is the first sector with its blind apexes. There are different approaches and different lines which makes it really easy to lose lap time.

There are lots of great places to witness some action at Istanbul Park especially with the rain we saw last year. My first choice would be the grandstands at the first and last corners due to the great viewpoints which means a higher chance of seeing the key moments play out.

Istanbul is a great city to visit and I would recommend it to anyone coming for the race. It's a beautiful city with incredible architecture and so many cultural and historical landmarks. It will make for a great weekend away.

Nothing fouls the rest of your day like a miserable round of golf. Food doesn’t taste as good; your interactions with others don’t seem as upbeat; even your dog avoids you. And those are the feelings of a person who beat it around their home club on a Saturday morning. Imagine if you make 10-footers for a living if your paycheck every week depended on the little numbers on a scorecard the size of a hotdog wrapper.

Masson hasn’t had the best year inside the ropes. Before teeing off at Mountain Ridge where she broke through with a runner-up finish to Jin Young Ko the 32-year-old had six missed cuts and withdrawn from another event after the first round. She’d only had two top-10 finishes prior to this tournament. Her best week of the year before the Founders had come at the Marathon Classic where she finished tied for fifth. After that she hit the airport for a whirlwind run. By October her mind and body were as tattered as her passport.

“I think we all invest so much into golf from a very young age that it's very hard to say it doesn't really matter” Masson said. “It's what we do most of the time and it's super important to us. But as I'm getting older I have a really good balance in my life which really helps. I mean Jason (McDede her fiancé who caddies for Nelly Korda) and we are hopefully getting married soon. We were supposed to be married already for about a year.”

COVID-19 put a stop to that. The couple live in Florida and Caroline’s family is in Germany. November is the first time they will be able to travel to see their daughter.

“A good personal life definitely helps me keep the balance” Masson said. “I do have to remind myself all the time that a bad round of golf doesn't define me.”

Easier said than done. Golf requires such mental discipline that when things go sideways it’s easy to chase bad rounds down a rabbit hole instead of remembering that you are a good friend a good fiancé a good daughter and a wonderful player.

Hopefully this week put a few of Masson’s demons to rest. She put up four rounds in the sixties on one of the most challenging courses of the year a major-championship caliber test that had the entire field raving. Her seven-birdie no-bogey 64 on Sunday was the round of the day in the worst conditions of the week. Rain peppered Mountain Ridge all day and temperatures peaked in the low 60s.

“You would think that I feel right at home being from Germany” she said with a chuckle. “We have a lot of this (weather) at home. But I just had a really good mental approach today. Okay we know it's going to be tough; it’s going to be raining. Take it shot by shot. I was really really calm out there and didn't get ahead of myself. I think that was really the biggest thing. It's not so much how you hit it it's more about embracing the situation.”

Then she got serious. Her face tightened with memories of the struggles she went through earlier in the year especially at the Trust Golf Women’s Scottish Open after the Olympics before the Solheim Cup and wedged between The Amundi Evian Championship and the AIG Women’s Open. That week in Scotland she withdrew to focus on her mental health. Then she put up a couple of miserable rounds at Carnoustie and flew home for a month of rest and mental reset.

“I had a really tough week at the Scottish Open just mentally not in a good place” she said. “I think (when that happens) you have two choices: You can either not say anything and just crawl in your little hole or you can actually be outspoken. I have had great response from (sharing my story). A lot of players people in general reached out and said ‘That was really cool that you did that and I'm proud of you.’ We've all been there or we're maybe there right now. I think the more we can talk about it the more it'll help.

“It's just about accepting that (mental strain) is a real thing and that it can hit anybody. As mentally tough as we all are being out here it can still affect you.”

The problems she described can’t be remedied with cold pitiless numbers on a scorecard. They require something deeper and more profound something that Masson is getting closer to finding.

“I can't tell you how big this is” she said of her runner-up finish at the Founders. “It's been a little bit rough this summer. Honestly mentally it was a really really tough stretch probably the toughest of my career. So to come back out and have a good week last week and feel like I'm getting really close - I know I'm pretty far away from winning this week score-wise but (the game) was pretty close - it’s pretty amazing. I’ve just got to thank everybody on my team for being there for me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9nb2xmL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzIzNzQ1ODYvamluLXlvdW5nLWtvLXdpbnMtZm91bmRlcnMtY3VwLXRpZXMtYW5uaWthLXNvcmVuc3RhbS1yZWNvcmQtMTR0aC1jb25zZWN1dGl2ZS1yb3VuZC02MHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jin Young Ko wins Founders Cup ties Annika Sorenstam record with 14th consecutive round in the 60s,"WEST CALDWELL N.J. -- Jin Young Ko finished off a wire-to-wire victory Sunday in the Cognizant Founders Cup with her 14th consecutive round in the 60s matching a 16-year-old record held by Annika Sorenstam.

Even in a steady rain at Mountain Ridge the 26-year-old South Korean star made it look easy. She closed with a 5-under 66 for a 4-shot victory over Caroline Masson of Germany.

Ko started the final round with a 4-shot lead and no one got closer than 3 all day. The tournament all but decided it was then a matter of how she finished. Ko ran off four birdies in a five-hole stretch in the middle of the back nine and finished at 18-under 266.

It was her 14th consecutive round in the 60s dating to a 69 in the final round of the Evian Championship. That ties the mark Sorenstam set in the middle of her 10-win season in 2005.

Sorenstam won three of four tournaments during that stretch of 14 straight rounds in the 60s including a major and was runner-up in another. Ko won twice and was runner-up and tied for sixth in the others during her streak.

Ko joined Nelly Korda as the only three-time winners on the LPGA Tour this season and she became the fifth South Korean with at least 10 victories still well short of the record 25 held by pioneer Se Ri Pak.

Next up for Ko who has played the last four weeks is a trip home and short break. She plans to play the BMW Ladies Championship the following week in South Korea -- the only Asia event in the fall because of the pandemic.

""I still have a chance (to) beat Annika and I will try to do my best"" she said after getting a champagne shower.

Ko successfully defended her title at the Founders Cup though it was as different as could be. The tournament was held in Phoenix in 2019 was canceled last year during the pandemic and then picked up a new title sponsor and moved to the Donald Ross design in New Jersey.

Those back-to-back victories came two years six months and 16 days apart on opposite ends of the country. Cognizant also doubled the prize money making it the largest purse among regular LPGA Tour events. Ko earned $450000.

More important she pulled within 20 points of Korda in the Race to the CME Globe with the end of the season fast approaching.

Korda replaced Ko's long run at No. 1 in the world this summer when she won her first major at the Women's PGA Championship. The 23-year-old American also won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

Korda closed with a 73 at Mountain Ridge and tied for 19th. She has three wins in her past six events and those are her only top 10s.

Korda is not playing in South Korea leaving Ko an excellent chance to move past her on the season points list. The LPGA then concludes with two Florida events capped off by the CME Group Tour Championship.

Ko won the season finale a year ago after spending much of the season riding out the pandemic in South Korea. That gives her four victories in the last calendar year.

She was particularly motivated by last week at the ShopRite LPGA Classic when Ko had control of the tournament until missing a series of 10-foot putts on the back nine and finishing 1 shot behind Celine Boutier.

""I was really sad last week. Sunday wasn't good"" she said. ""I tried to do my best for this week and I did.""

Masson matched two birdies with Ko on the front nine and then made five birdies on the back nine for a 64 but by then it was too late.

Elizabeth Szokol closed with a 69 and finished alone in third 7 shots behind. Jeongeun Lee6 (67) and U.S. Women's Open champion Yuka Saso (70) tied for fourth."

That news was delivered by Guernsey County Community Improvement Corporation Executive Director Norm Blanchard during a CIC meeting Friday.

""No contracts have been signed at this time for the actual work but they have applied for the building permits and I have been given permission to release that information"" Blanchard said.

The cost to build the AEP Cambridge Service Center is estimated to be nearly $20 million according to Blanchard.

An employee at the Southeast Ohio Building Department in Marietta confirmed the company obtained three permits for the construction of the service center and two sheds described as open storage facilities.

The property is owned by Ohio Power Co.

The proposed facility has been compared to an AEP center adjacent to I-70 in Belmont County.

The architect for the project is listed as MS Consultants Inc. of Columbus.

Blanchard also discussed expansion plans at Ridge Tool and Colgate-Palmolive.

""Ridge Tool has extended their lease with the landlord through 2029 and full expansion plans are due by 2025"" he said. ""That's good news. We were concerned if their lease ran out they might not expand here.""

The company is working with Guernsey County officials to lease an additional 10 acres adjacent to its current location for expansion.

Blanchard said Phase III of a three-part expansion plan at Colgate-Palmolive is still in discussion among company officials.

The company has purchased an additional 14 acres next to the 72 acres at its current location to make expansion possible.

""They have purchased all the land around the building"" Blanchard said. ""They have what they need to complete an expansion project.""

Colgate-Palmolive previously invested $1.2 million in machinery and equipment during Phase I for the production of liquid hand soap at the Cambridge facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion created 24 new jobs.

Phase II reportedly will create eight jobs and $667000 in payroll with a $20 million capital investment.

Initiatives to fill the former Fabri Form and Pomegranate properties in or near Byesville are underway according to Blanchard.

The Fabri Form property has 60000-square feet available and the purchase price for the Pomegranate building on Southgate Road has been lowered to $250000.

""The problem with the Pomegranate site is the soil surface is extremely unstable due to previous use as a coal processing facility"" Blanchard said. ""It would require a lot of site preparation work.""

A $530428 renovation project at Seneca Lake Marina was discussed.

The plan calls for the existing wood deck and deck structure to be replaced with a pre-engineers structure and sidewalk ramps for Americans With Disabilities access.

Blanchard also provided updates regarding plans for expansion at Ohio Bridge in Cambridge the county's strategic plan work at the Otto Luburgh site on Wintergreen Road and the Guernsey County Power Plant.

The power plant remains on target for a cold opening in the spring with operations starting in the fall of 2022.

A $2.1 million funding request through Congressman Bill Johnson's office is still awaiting U.S. Senate approval. The funds are for a $3376269 projects at the D.O. Hall Business Park that includes $2615949 for site preparation and $760300 for wetland mitigation.

A parking lot constructed near the FedEx facility south of Cambridge enabled the company to hire 140 new drivers and package handlers according to Blanchard.

Mike Jacoby president of Ohio SE Economic Development gave a brief presentation regarding development efforts within the 25-county region served by the not-for-profit agency.

One of the topics he discussed was inclusion grants that help small companies with small projects.

Blanchard pointed out D&J Precision Machine in Cambridge is a success story for the inclusion grants after the company received a $25000 grant to improve its computer system.

Jacoby also praised Guernsey County officials for their willingness to work together.

""We have a great partnership with Guernsey County and the officials here work really well together"" he said. ""You have a great track record for success.""

He also alerted officials that JobsOhio has new programs to help communities.

It was late on a July night in 2019 and they’d come through the rainforest armed with guns and metal bars. Men and teenage boys were dragged out of bed beaten and thrown into the mud. Some were arrested held for weeks and interrogated about vandalizing palm trees according to an investigative report by the advocacy group Global Witness.

One Watwat resident told investigators that the SUVs were owned by one of the companies that runs the local plantation.

“The company has a lot of money” she said. “They are able to give it to the police.”

Global Witness said it did not name the villager to protect her safety. The Washington Post did not speak to the woman directly but learned details of her identity from two Global Witness investigators who interviewed her.

Global Witness’s two-year investigation is a rare behind-the-scenes look at the corruption labor abuses and destructive environmental practices in an industry that is clearing carbon-rich rainforests and emitting greenhouse gases at a rate that has become a growing concern for climate scientists. The world’s most common vegetable oil has spawned vast fortunes while coming under scrutiny for its labor practices and environmental impact.

The report includes recordings of oil-palm managers detailing corruption and labor abuses to investigators posing as commodity traders. The investigation has already provoked a response from 17 corporations some of which have pledged to remove the palm oil companies the advocacy group identified as their suppliers.

“A pattern of coercion and violence right across PNG has denied local people the traditional use of forests integral to their culture and livelihoods” the authors of the report write. “Huge areas of tropical forests have been deforested and much more remains at risk unless action is taken.”

The group’s undercover investigators taped an executive from a Papua New Guinea-based company called Tobar Investment Ltd. seemingly confirming the Watwat resident’s account of the police raid of the village which came in response to the destruction of palm trees on the plantation.

Edward Lamur the executive told investigators in a secretly recorded online meeting that his company had approached police after vandalism to get them to send a message to local residents. He said that a close friend of his ran the “special operation police” and that he could call the officer “whenever we want assistance.”

“They did some bashing up” he said. “They know we are owners now.”

The secretly recorded conversations with Lamur and others were broadcast Thursday in Britain as part of a story on Channel 4 News.

Lamur who is a founding director of Tobar and a former deputy provincial administrator of East New Britain province located on a large island off Papua New Guinea did not respond to a request for comment.

The Global Witness report looks at Malaysian companies operating in Papua New Guinea including East New Britain Resources Group (ENBR) and Rimbunan Hijau that it says collectively have cleared tens of thousands of acres of forest in recent years. More than three quarters of the global product from oil palm trees comes from Indonesia and Malaysia and makes its way through supply chains into products familiar to any Western consumer from companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Kellogg’s and Nestlé. Many of the buyers have so-called No Deforestation No Peat and No Exploitation policies (NDPE) but Global Witness found some of the palm oil companies whose abuses they documented on the supply list for those three Western corporations among others.

In a statement Kellogg Co. called the allegations in the report “very concerning” while confirming that three of its palm-oil suppliers had indirectly made purchases from ENBR. The company said it immediately contacted its suppliers when it learned about the allegations and that ENBR is no longer in its supply chain.

“Kellogg is committed to working with our suppliers to support the production of sustainable palm oil from sources that are environmentally appropriate socially beneficial and economically viable” the company said in a statement. “Anything less is not acceptable.”

Nestlé said it confirmed that it has identified nine palm oil mills owned by Rimbunan Hijau in its supply chain but has not been connected to palm oil from ENBR since 2019. The company says it is investigating and will suspend any company shown to be responsible for deforestation or that does not have a policy to obtain consent from Indigenous people before developing. Nestlé said it requires companies to provide data to allow satellite monitoring that would detect deforestation.

“We take allegations of breaches to our Responsible Sourcing Standard very seriously” the company said in a statement.

Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement that it regularly assesses its palm-oil suppliers based on policies of no-deforestation and respect for workers and communities.

“When we learned of issues associated with mills owned by East New Britain Resources Group (ENB) in Papua New Guinea we immediately contacted our direct suppliers with relationships with ENB to investigate” the company said. “As a result we no longer source from these mills.”

Colgate-Palmolive also told Global Witness that it has had supply chain connections to two Rimbunan Hijau mills in Malaysia and would add the group to its “internal grievance log” and investigate further.

As Malaysia came under increasing pressure in recent decades for clearing its forests faster than any country on Earth some of its lumber companies began looking to the virgin rainforests of Papua New Guinea. The mostly unspoiled island country has since become one of the biggest exporters of tropical lumber. And in the wake of all the cutting Malaysian palm oil companies moved in.

Impoverished Papua New Guinea sees its economic future in palm oil. By 2030 it plans to increase the size of its palm plantation tracts tenfold from the 2016 level of about 360000 acres. But the country has also pledged a sharp reduction in carbon emissions from deforestation by the same year in a national commitment to the United Nations.

The Global Witness report suggests that the government may have a hard time reining in the well-connected palm oil companies. Tobar Investment Ltd. the local company behind the raid in Watwat operates under a joint venture with ENBR.

Over a business dinner the undercover investigators taped two managers from a subsidiary of ENBR bragging about corruption of government officials to obtain logging permits and land access. The managers also told the investigators that they had workers as young as 10 on their plantations.

“Sometimes we bend the rules just to make things happen” said one manager identified by Global Witness as Bernard Lolot. It’s illegal in Papua New Guinea to employ children under 16 for heavy labor.

At another dinner Global Witness said the Malaysian chief executive of the company Eng Kwee Tan detailed a scheme to evade import duties in India. He explained that the duties are higher for palm oil coming from Papua New Guinea than from Malaysia.

“We have to make it show like it come from Malaysia” he said in English in another secretly recorded conversation that was also broadcast on Channel 4 along with the video of Lolot.

In a statement to The Post Tan did not deny the veracity of the recorded conversations but said the company had not engaged in bribery or tax evasion. He said the company “provides essential services such as aid posts schools bridges roads basic life skills training to local communities clean drinking water [and] electricity supply to the least developed districts villages and communities within East New Britain Province.”

“Any purported claims of discussions and or responses from our Mr. Lolot is all hearsay and not true” Tan said of the bribery allegations emphasizing that the company did not employ Lolot to apply for logging permits meet the minister of forestry or “pay bribes” to government officials.

“The report from GW is misleading and misrepresents the Company’s actual work value investment and contribution of poverty elevation in the project area” he said. “The allegations are based on secret recordings and unreliable information.”

Global Witness says that Rimbunan Hijau whose name means “forever green” cleared nearly 81 square miles of coastal rainforest in New Britain province. The report also detailed a dozen work-related deaths on the company’s plantations between 2012 and 2020 some of which were not recorded in a government database that catalogues required incidents of workplace casualties that investigators examined..

Rimbunan Hijau did not respond to a request for comment from The Post. But the Global Witness report includes a statement that the company sent to one of its customers about the allegations which emphasized the work the company had done to develop the local economy.

In the statement the company said the allegations in the report were out of context and “without any real basis.” It called Global Witness “a group of economic vandals who do not care about the lives they destroy.”

While the companies stress the economic benefit to communities the report details the cost for local people living in the areas being developed as palm oil plantations. The witness in Watwat who recounted the raid by police in July 2019 was asked by Global Witness what good the development had done for the community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvcmVjeWNsaW5nL3BsYXN0aWNzLXJlY3ljbGluZy1tZWV0LWRlYWRsaW5lLzk5L2kzN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will plastics recycling meet its deadline?,"AMP Robotics has a Silicon Valley–type solution to the knotty problem of postconsumer plastics: How do you harvest valuable materials from dirty streams of mixed waste?

In brief Consumer product companies have set ambitious targets for incorporating recycled plastic into their packages—25% of their total packaging by 2025 in many cases. These brand owners seem newly committed to the goals and their suppliers are mobilizing to get them more of the high-purity resins they need for food-grade packaging. Companies are rolling out recognizable brands in 100% recycled bottles and are redesigning packaging to ease recycling. But with just a few years to go companies have made only modest progress toward their targets and will need to accelerate efforts to succeed.

AMP’s technology is based on machine learning and works on the same principles as phone apps that identify wildflowers or sensors in autonomous vehicles that scan the road. “These approaches are fundamentally using a form of pattern recognition that is based on training in an artificial neural network” says Rob Writz AMP’s director of commercial partnerships.

AMP’s machines deployed in 160 recycling facilities across North America “infer in real time” what items are whizzing by on a conveyor belt Writz says. If they identify an unwanted object—a metal can contaminating a stream of plastic beverage bottles for example—a pneumatic arm descends to suck it off the line.

The machines are discriminating Writz says. They can tell polypropylene cups from polystyrene ones recognizing the differences in luster clarity and the patterns they exhibit when bent and distorted. And they can do the job of identifying objects and pulling them off the line twice as fast humans who can pluck out only about 40 objects from a stream per minute.

Plastics recycling desperately needs such innovation. Despite years of lip service to the need to recycle the US plastics recycling rate is still less than 10% according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Other regions perform better but need improvement. In Europe for example the rate is nearly 33% according to Conversio Market & Strategy.

Improving recycling will require new technologies to solve the problems that make plastics difficult to recycle. It will also demand collaboration and investment across the complex ecosystem of brand owners consumers municipalities waste management firms recyclers and chemical companies.

Lofty goals for brands

Facing mounting pressure over plastic waste industry has promised to improve. The world’s largest consumer product companies—Coca-Cola Unilever PepsiCo and others—have set ambitious targets for replacing virgin resins with recycled ones a typical goal being 25% by 2025. The undertaking is massive. Coca-Cola alone produces 112 billion plastic bottles a year enough to buy the world a Coke as the firm’s famous ad campaign suggested 14 times over.

To help hit these targets chemical companies are promoting chemical recycling—processes such as depolymerization and pyrolysis that break down plastics into feedstock that can be converted into new plastics. But chemical recycling is largely untested with the first large-scale plants only starting to come on line.

For now plastics recycling relies almost exclusively on traditional mechanical recycling—as it has for decades.

This decidedly unglamorous process starts when residents leave recyclables for their local trash haulers. Materials recovery facilities sort the metal glass and plastics with equipment such as optical sorters that use infrared light to separate plastics or the newer artificial intelligence machines from AMP. Material reclaimers shred wash melt and repelletize the plastics for sale to molders. Higher-purity resins destined to go back into food packaging go through more meticulous finishing steps.

To reach their ambitious goals consumer product companies will need to draw from this system more than ever before. Coca-Cola aims for 50% recycled content across all its packaging by 2030. But in 2020 it was 22% and just 11.5% for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) the main polymer used in beverage bottles. Keurig Dr Pepper has reached only 2% recycled plastic against a goal of 25% by 2025.

Many of these firms are introducing recycled packaging for their most famous brands to boost their numbers and signal to the public that they care. In 2019 Unilever introduced its Hellmann’s mayonnaise in containers with “Jar Made from 100% Recycled Plastic” printed conspicuously on the label. Coca-Cola launched 100% recycled bottles in the US this year. PepsiCo is introducing them in Europe.

Whether companies will meet their goals—more than doubling in most cases their use of recycled resin in a few short years—is possibly the most important question facing the plastics industry today. Given decades of glacial progress many observers are not confident that they will.

“There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through” says Conrad MacKerron senior vice president of As You Sow an organization that prods big corporations on environmental performance.

For instance according to an As You Sow study Coca-Cola set a goal of 25% recycled content in the early 1990s only to abandon it in 1994. The company unveiled a new target in 2011 of incorporating 25% recycled or renewable content by 2015 but achieved only 12.4%.

PepsiCo had a goal of 50% recycled content in its containers by 2018 that it quietly abandoned. The company later set a target of 25% recycled content by 2025. Just last month the firm tweaked its goal again raising its target to 50% while pushing the deadline to 2030.

But times may have changed. MacKerron says those previous missed goals were set before plastics became the hot topic they are today. “It was more of a back-burner issue and we were working on it but not a lot of groups were working on it” he says. And MacKerron notes companies are more open to collaboration than they were in the past when sustainability initiatives were largely internal.

Moreover companies realize they must invest significantly to achieve recycling goals. Nestlé for example has allocated $1.6 billion to pay premiums for recycled material over virgin plastics. Nestlé aims to motivate recyclers and waste management companies to expand their operations.

“If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge” says Evan Arnold vice president of business development at Glenroy which makes flexible packaging for clients such as Costco Wholesale. Earlier this year Glenroy launched a line of stand-up pouches which boast 48% recycled resin content for food and personal care products.

“We really have to be the one that stands up and says ‘Yeah we’ll utilize this’ ” Arnold says about recycled resin. “We’ll explain to our customers the benefits of using this and face the challenge of using recycled products head-on.”

Passing the quality bar

One of the biggest challenges for consumer product companies is procuring enough of the high-quality resins they need for containers that contact food and beverages. These plastics are a cut above the recycled plastics used for carpet fiber or detergent bottles in terms of purity and performance.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued guidelines on recycled resins for food packaging and sends letters of no objection to companies that meet them. Recyclers must for example demonstrate that only food-contact containers enter their process. The FDA recommends recyclers subject their operations to surrogate contaminant testing in which plastics are spiked with chemicals like chloroform or toluene to see how well they are removed. Ultimately the aim is to keep residue levels below 200–300 µg/kg.

The FDA has issued more than 250 of the no-objection letters for food-packaging plastics in recent years mostly for products containing PET. That resin is recycled more than other plastics with a US recycling rate of 28% according to the National Association for PET Container Resources. But that number hasn’t moved much for years and lags behind the global figure of 50%. Moreover only about 28% of recycled bottles become food and beverage containers again. The rest are downcycled into products like carpet fiber and strapping used to tie lumber together.

Jon McNaull vice president of resins for DAK Americas an Alpek Polyester business and the largest virgin-PET producer and recycler in the Americas says PET naturally lends itself to recycling because it is resilient and less likely than other polymers to break down while being re-formed into finished goods. And any breakdown can be reversed through solid stating a process in which the polymer is heated to just above its glass-transition temperature so its chains react and build molecular weight.

There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through. Conrad MacKerron senior vice president As You Sow

“You can create a consumer product beverage container and you can send it to the consumer and you can bring it back and you can put it through this industry and make it back into a suitable safe consumer container again” McNaull says.

A lot goes into that transformation explains Srinivasan Prabhushankar CEO of recycling for Indorama Ventures the world’s largest PET maker and recycler. Indorama buys bottles that have been collected at curbsides or through local deposit systems. Workers remove errant metals paper non-PET containers and even PET containers that are tinted brown or green. The PET is then chopped into flake and washed.

Such flake at this point might be good enough for strapping or carpet fiber. But to meet the FDA’s food-contact guidelines it needs more treatment. Indorama scans the flake with infrared light that helps machinery identify the remaining contaminants—for instance bits of off-color PET that previously escaped notice.

The flake is then melted. A near vacuum of about 1 mbar of pressure is applied to the molten resin to suck up any remaining volatile compounds. The resin is also filtered to remove microscale particles. Solid stating builds up the molecular chains until the PET has the right viscosity for bottles again. Every Indorama plant has a quality-control lab where resin samples are collected frequently and analyzed in gas chromatographs mass spectrometers and other instruments.

The process is expensive Prabhushankar says. Brand owners are willing to pay more for the recycled PET but recycling still doesn’t make money. “They are only compensating us for the cost that we incur” he says. “There are many recyclers who are unable to continue.” Case in point he notes is the high-end PET recycler CarbonLite which was liquidated recently and sold to competitors.

Two of those competitors were DAK and Indorama both of which are plunging increasingly into PET recycling in a bid to be one-stop shops that offer virgin resin recycled resin and blends to an increasingly environmentally conscious clientele. “Our customers’ requirements change and we are going to modify our capital expenditures and our strategy to service their needs” McNaull says.

DAK has nearly 400000 metric tons (t) per year of recycling capacity some of it from a CarbonLite plant it bought in Reading Pennsylvania. Of that capacity some 120000 t goes into pellets for food and beverage containers. The company aims to make recycled PET 25% of its sales by 2025.

Indorama plans to spend $1.5 billion on recycling to reach a goal of annually recycling about 50 billion bottles—representing about 750000 t of PET—by 2025. To further this goal the company bought a CarbonLite plant in Dallas. That purchase along with other expansion projects should bring the company to half its objective by next year Prabhushankar says.

Recycling polyolefins for food-contact applications is even more challenging than recycling PET largely because those plastics are used in a much wider variety of packaging.

Troy Alabama–based KW Plastics is the world’s largest recycler of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene. The company has 250000 t of annual capacity and is expanding by 65%.

It is also one of only a handful of US polyolefin recyclers to receive a letter of no objection from the FDA. Meeting the agency’s standards is a multistep process according to Scott Saunders KW’s general manager. Workers start by thoroughly inspecting the bales of plastic that arrive from materials recovery facilities. The firm can process yogurt containers for example but must remove the non-food-contact items like kitty-litter buckets and shampoo bottles.

KW carefully shreds and washes the containers and like the PET recyclers applies a vacuum to molten resins to remove volatile compounds. It then adds colorants antioxidants and other food-contact additives to meet customer specifications.

KW’s products don’t go into food packaging but rather personal care containers like shampoo bottles and deodorant sticks for which its customers in consumer products want a high-purity polymer with food-grade quality. Saunders worries that selling into actual food-contact markets might expose his firm to liability.

And business in the personal care segment which KW serves is booming. Not long ago Saunders says KW’s material was sold as a low-cost alternative to virgin plastics. Now big brands are clamoring for high-end polyolefins. “In 2014 or 2015 we couldn’t get an audience with a lot of consumer product companies” he says. “Today we know all of them.”

The solvent solution

If high-volume recycling has been difficult to achieve for PET and polyethylene it has been nearly impossible for polypropylene and polystyrene. Solvent extraction could solve this problem.

The most prominent practitioner of solvent recycling is PureCycle Technologies which is trying to turn polypropylene recycling around. Polypropylene is one of the most ubiquitous polymers found in soft-drink cups face masks and car bumpers. But only 1% of polypropylene is recycled according to the American Chemistry Council. Many municipalities don’t even bother to collect it.

It is polypropylene’s very versatility that hinders its recycling says Dustin Olson PureCycle’s chief manufacturing officer. “The reason it isn’t getting recycled at a higher rate is because of the various applications that it’s in” he says. Each of them requires its own set of dyes fillers impact modifiers and other additives.

I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO Polystyvert

A consumer product company Procter & Gamble developed PureCycle’s process in the early 2010s. In a presentation last November John Layman director of sustainable materials development at P&G said the company uses polypropylene more than any other plastic—for example in items like toothbrush and razor-blade handles nonwoven fabrics and container caps. P&G he said is also a cleaning specialist which led its technologists to wonder: “Can we put our powers of cleaning to work on cleaning recycled resins?”

The process it developed uses supercritical butane to dissolve polypropylene. Olson says PureCycle plays with temperature and pressure so pure polypropylene precipitates out of the solvent and leaves contaminants behind. “What we are doing is dry-cleaning the molecules” he says.

PureCycle went public earlier this year by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. PureCycle is building a plant in Ironton Ohio that will have about 50000 t of annual capacity when it opens next year. The company plans to spend $440 million on a much larger plant in Augusta Georgia. With local partners Mitsui & Co. and SK Geo Centric it is studying operations in Japan and South Korea as well.

Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO and founder of Montreal-based Polystyvert has a similar ambition for polystyrene another notoriously difficult-to-recycle resin with a US recycling rate that also hovers around 1% according to the EPA.

Polystyvert’s technology uses p-cymene a solvent with a particular affinity for polystyrene. After dissolving the polymer and filtering out contaminants the firm precipitates it by adding heptane.

In June Polystyvert completed an investment round that included the European packaging firm BEWI. Brouard Gaillot won’t say how much money Polystyvert raised but she says it is enough to build the company’s first commercial-scale plant a 10000 t unit in Montreal. “We can use it as a showcase to license the technology” Brouard Gaillot says.

The environment for new recycling technology is better than it has ever been. Like others Brouard Gaillot contends that interest by consumer product companies and the public is bringing constructive change.

“I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. People were not ready to put money on the table” she says. “Now the demand for recycled polystyrene is very high and it’s more expensive than virgin. That’s a speedy evolution.”

Big challenges remain

But improving plastics recycling will take more than just new technology and the willingness of consumer product companies to buy more recycled resin. Plastics recyclers say two big advances are needed if the recycling rate is to increase appreciably: a vast expansion in collection and easier-to-recycle plastic goods.

PET firms see the main bottleneck as the collection step. “We will expand our business to the extent we can get bottles to support the expansion but collection expansion is key” DAK’s McNaull says.

Indorama’s Prabhushankar says people often don’t have the options or the motivation to dispose of their bottles responsibly. “Consumers are not fully educated on the value of the bottles that they have” he says. “If they make the wrong choice and put the bottle in the trash bin then it’s gone. That one decision point decides the entire fate of the bottle.”

Bottle deposit systems where people get a monetary incentive to bring their bottles back to the store help but only 10 of the 50 US states have them. In California which has a deposit system the collection rate is nearly 70% Prabhushankar says. In Alabama which has no deposit or even curbside collection in some places it is less than 10%.

If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge. Evan Arnold vice president of business development Glenroy

In a 2020 report the Recycling Partnership says only 32% of the 37.4 million t of commodities of all kinds that could be recycled annually in the US actually are. Only 52% of US households participate in curbside recycling programs either because they aren’t available or because people aren’t using them. The report says $9.8 billion in investment is needed to close the gap.

Experts agree that collection is the rate-limiting step of the entire recycling system. For example KW’s Saunders says that the US recycling rate for high-density polyethylene bottles—the kind used for milk and detergent jugs—is currently 28%. But it could be doubled through additional collection without new processing plants.

“The low-hanging fruit is to maximize the capacity of what’s already installed” Saunders says. “And to do that as an industry and a country and a society we’ve got to convince people that have that container in their hand to put it in a recycling bin somewhere and not in the trash.”

But Saunders has noticed changes for the better. “We’ve seen a tremendous amount of investment happening in sortation” he says. “We’re seeing growth in the material and we’re seeing the quality improve.”

Further improvement advocates say will require consumer product makers to redesign their packaging so it is easier to recycle in today’s mechanical systems. In one example of designing for recycling Unilever modified the black plastic used in its Axe deodorant and TRESemmé hair care brands so they are detected by optical scanners. PepsiCo is eliminating the green tint in its 7Up bottles in Europe. Danone is selling its Evian water in France with no label at all.

Keurig Dr Pepper transitioned its coffee pods from styrenic resins to polypropylene. And the company has been working with AMP Robotics so the new pods will be recognizable to the artificial intelligence machines. Many more and varied collaborative efforts will be needed to make a dent in recycling Writz says. “To make more packaging truly recyclable you have to work on different aspects of the supply chain.”

And more design for recycling is needed to reverse momentum that for decades has made plastic goods complicated and difficult to recycle. For example brands and stores love multilayer packaging for colorful stand-up pouches but the multiple plastics and metallized layers they involve make them tough to recycle.

Glenroy’s Arnold says 95% of his firm’s technical development time is spent tackling such problems and advising clients to adopt simpler packaging. “If the brand feels much safer with a metallized option even if it isn’t needed they would have probably in the past leaned that way just to have the extra protection” he says. Now brands are seeing that they can have sufficient protection in a simpler nonmetallized more sustainable material he says.

Steve Alexander president of the Association of Plastic Recyclers a trade group says consumer product firms need to recognize that in a circular economy they are their own raw material suppliers. “You cannot create a supply of recycled resin if you’re contaminating the very stream of material you want the recycling community to create” he says.

Chemical recycling offers itself as a different solution to the multimaterial problem. Chemical recycling especially pyrolysis is billed as a technology that can break down whatever plastic is fed into a reactor into basic molecular building blocks. But Alexander fears this yet-to-be-realized promise will give consumer product companies an excuse not to design their packaging for mechanical recycling.

Alexander sees chemical recycling as a complement to the current incumbent. “The collection infrastructure we have in this country and how recycling programs work is always going to be mechanical recycling. Where chemical recycling fits in is taking those materials that are not appropriate for mechanical recycling” he says. He’d like to keep that category to a minimum.

And veterans of mechanical recycling are skeptical that chemical recyclers will ever achieve what they have been doing day in and day out for decades. “If somebody builds a chemical plant and they can take a variety of resins blended together in a bale and deal with 20% contamination by rocks dirt glass paper chicken bones—all the things that we deal with—I’ll be a big cheerleader of that” Saunders says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxpb25oZWFydHYubmV0LzIwMjEvMTAvc2hvcGVlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtMTAtMTAtYnJhbmRzLWZlc3RpdmFsLXdpdGgta2ltLWNoaXUtYXMtaXRzLW5ld2VzdC1hbWJhc3NhZG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shopee celebrates 10.10 Brands Festival with Kim Chiu as its newest ambassador,"Actress Kim Chiu on September 28 was introduced by the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia Shopee as its newest ambassador.

DENVER — For the third straight hockey season--and likely basketball season--local broadcasts of Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets games will be blacked out on major local television providers as Altitude TV the regional sports network that broadcasts both still hasn’t reached a deal with Comcast or DISH Network.

The Avalanche open the season on Wednesday with a game against the Chicago Blackhawks at Ball Arena that will be nationally televised on TNT.

The stalemate between the network and providers started more than two years ago when three major carriage contracts for Altitude TV expired at the same time. The network was able to negotiate a deal with DirecTV months later. That satellite TV provider remains the only major provider able to carry the network’s programming.

“The only one who really loses in this battle are the fans” Rob Silvershein a former television executive turned industry analyst said.

Silvershein has explored the future of regional sports networks which have been struggling with carriage negotiations in recent years.

The blackout includes a large swath of the metro area. According to data from the audience tracking firm Nielsen provided to 9NEWS cable subscribers make up 34.9% of households with television in the Denver market. More than 90% of those cable subscribers are with Comcast. Satellite TV subscribers make up 19.2% of the market.

Last week DISH Network announced it had removed AT&T SportsNet which carries Colorado Rockies baseball games. In a statement DISH Network said the regional sports network model is broken as it charges providers a fee for all of their subscribers even if those subscribers don’t watch the network’s programming.

“Every day week and month with cord-cutting happening they’re starting to lose their edge” Silvershein said. “More and more people are streaming and out of anything regional sports networks are the last vestige of pay TV.”

Silvershein said TV viewing habits are changing by generation. He said while older generations were used to paying for expensive cable packages millennials are different.

“I always use the analogy of--I like to fly. I’m a little older so I like flying United Airlines and I don’t mind spending an extra $100 to make sure I get a free soda and a bag of peanuts” Silvershein said. “Millennials and the younger generations are willing to pay but they only want to pay for what they want.”

Regional sports networks like Altitude have argued their programming is expensive to produce and they need the financial support of the current model to survive. The network sued Comcast in federal court alleging the cable provider was using tactics to try and put Altitude out of business. The suit is still pending which is also hindering negotiations.

“If you ask me what is the future of regional sports networks I don’t have the answer but I can tell you it’s going to more of an oligopoly than a bunch of regional independents and I can tell you that there has to be other revenue streams involved” Silvershein said.

Silvershein said sports networks will have to figure out “a la carte” programs for these younger generations of fans who are willing to pay to see their team but don’t want the extra programming that comes with an expensive cable package.

He also suggests sports betting may influence the debate as well.

“There’s too much money here"" he said. ""There’s just too much money for it not to get resolved.”

Altitude TV has yet to respond to a 9NEWS request for comment on the current status of negotiations with each provider. In a previous statement announcing the season schedule the network said Comcast and DISH Network “continue to deny thousands of fans across a ten-state region access to their hometown teams.”

“Both Comcast and DISH Network remand steadfast in demanding terms that would put Altitude out of business and in the process raise prices for our fans to watch their local teams- something we won’t allow” Matt Hutchins COO of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment which owns Altitude TV said in that September statement.

DISH Network told 9NEWS it stands ready to carry Altitude Sports at a price that is fair to its customers.

“The current regional sports network (RSN) model is broken that’s why we have offered Altitude Sports on multiple occasions the option to provide their programming to our customers on an ala carte basis - similar to premium channel subscriptions” a spokesman for DISH Network said in a statement.

“Altitude Sports could set the price interested customers could subscribe and Altitude Sports could keep all the revenue. It’s a win-win for Altitude Sports and Denver sports fans. Unfortunately Altitude Sports has refused our offers and has not even responded the last few times we reached out. DISH remains open to working with Altitude Sports to offer content in a way that provides choice and value to all customers. We have made similar offers to AT&T SportsNet and Root Sports as well.""

A spokesman for Comcast cited the lawsuit Altitude filed as a stumbling block.

“Instead of focusing its energy on negotiating a mutually agreeable deal allowing Comcast customers to continue watching the Avalanche and Nuggets’ games Altitude chose to file a meritless federal lawsuit which is still ongoing – despite the judge dismissing most of the claims” Leslie Oliver a spokeswoman for Comcast wrote in a statement to 9NEWS.

EFE/Yuri Edmundo/Archivo

Luego de la victoria 2-0 sobre Chile la selección peruana se prepara para enfrentar a su próximo rival por las Eliminatorias Qatar 2022. El siguiente partido de la fecha triple lo jugarán de visitantes contra Bolivia por lo que tendrán que dirigirse a la capital del país altiplánico.

A pesar que solo faltar pocas horas para el próximo encuentro los seleccionados del cuadro nacional siempre encuentran momentos para divertirse en medio de las varias actividades que tienen programadas durante el día.

En esta ocasión el objeto de ‘burla’ de Jefferson Farfán fue el llamativo look que eligió su compañero de equipo Edison Flores. La ‘Foquita’ utilizó su cuenta de Instagram para compartir un video en el que se muestra a ´Oreja´ acostado en una camilla usando una casaca y un pantalón con estampados de fuertes colores que no combinan entre sí.

Farfán subió la historia a Instagram el video con la frase “que daño le haces la moda” haciendo referencia a la falta de estilo de su compañero.

El momento fue compartido en horas de la mañana de este sábado mediante las redes sociales del delantero tan solo un día antes de que la ´blanquirroja´ enfrente a su similar de Bolivia en el segundo partido de la fecha triple de Eliminatorias.

Jefferson Farfán trolea a Edison Flores.

BAJAS DE PERÚ

Como se recuerda ´Oreja´ no participara de los próximos partidos contra Bolivia y Argentina debido a una lesión que se abría agravado durante el partido contra Chile. La noticia fue compartida mediante un comunicado de la Federación Peruana de Fútbol (FPF) en el que también informaron las bajas de Paolo Guerrero y Renato Tapia. Asimismo el comunicado señala que André Carrillo continuará su recuperación en Lima con miras al partido en Buenos Aires.

En total Perú llega al partido contra ´la verde´ con cinco bajas confirmadas: Paolo Guerrero Renato Tapia Edison Flores y Yordy Reyna por lesiones. Además Miguel Trauco tampoco podrá participar del encuentro del domingo debido a que se encuentra suspendido por acumulación de tarjetas amarillas.

NUEVOS CONVOCADOS

Alex Valera fue la primera adición de la ´blanquirroja´ él fue llamado a la selección un día antes del ´Clásico del Pacífico´ como reemplazo de Yordy Reyna que ya se encontraba descartado para el primer partido de la fecha triple.

Debido a la emergencia por bajas Ricardo Gareca ordenó el llamado inmediato de Horacio Calcaterra y Oslimg Mora para que se pongan la camiseta de la selección peruana y acompañen al equipo a La Paz y Buenos Aires para disputar los dos duelos por Eliminatorias.

Tras conocerse la convocatoria de ambos jugadores los usuarios en redes sociales celebraron la oportunidad al juvenil de Alianza Lima y el experimentado de Sporting Cristal.

PERÚ VS BOLIVIA

Tras derrotar 2-0 a Chile en el Nacional de Lima la selección peruana se medirá con el conjunto ‘altiplánico’ en la altura de La Paz. El equipo de Ricardo Gareca sigue con la obligación de conseguir los 3 puntos.

I want ""olive"" it! Corning's 74th Annual Olive Festival kicked off Saturday in the Northstate's very own Olive City.

Hosted by the Corning Chamber of Commerce it was the first year the tradition fully returned after the pandemic. The executive manager for the chamber Christina Hale explains that the event far precedes 2021 1946 to be exact.

""It started with the women from the catholic church. They were raising up money to build a new hall. They got together with some of the olive growers. They made some crafts and bakeries and stuff and started this event"" says Hale standing at the entrance to the event in the Corning Community Park. ""After the hall was built they didn't have the purpose for the event no more so then the chamber and other groups started taking it over and it's grown to this.""

It's Corning's largest event every year. While the event laid idle in 2020 over 90 vendors revived it this year. These farmers artists cooks and other vendors come from as far as Sacramento and Oregon to as near as the community park's backyard.



""Because it has been such a hard pandemic for them this is a great opportunity for them to recover from that for them to sit there and keep their businesses going rather than going under"" says Hale.

Organizers say the event is much more than just the olives. A car show saw nearly 100 entries crowds gathered to listen to live music and overall attendees got a glimpse of the normalcy that they missed last year.

But the event was a harsh reality for farmers who are battling one of California's worst droughts yet. Patrons who attend this event yearly say there were fewer olive vendors than in years prior and that a lack of olives to sell may be the reason why.

Jessanna Levitsky was selling produce from her farm Heartbeat Farm all day but says the drought didn't make it easy. Her domestic well has run dry and her family now depends on their agricultural well to both grow and live. It means less water going to the olive trees and less produce being harvested.



""Some of the trees it seems aren't really producing any ""says Levitsky standing outside her tent. ""It's made us kind of unsure of how much we should invest into planting not knowing what we're going to be able to get from it.""

Despite these difficulties farmers are staying optimistic and hoping for a wetter year ahead. For the time being they're just enjoying the longest-running olive festival in the nation.

It may sound like something from the world of science fiction but Pittsburgh-based PPG and Corning Guardiant are making it a reality.

PPG announced Tuesday that the company has received EPA registration for its Copper Armor antimicrobial paint. It contains special technology from Corning Guardiant which utilizes naturally occurring copper that kills 99% of bacteria and viruses that land on the paint’s surface including the virus that causes COVID-19. It does the job within two hours of contact and it’s effective for up to 5 years.

“Now more than ever our customers are seeking multiple layers of protection from viruses and bacteria on the many surfaces they’re touching while navigating the ongoing pandemic” said Tim Knavish PPG executive vice president in a press release. “PPG Copper Armor with Corning Guardiant technology is the first virus-killing paint in the U.S. and will provide an extra layer of protection on the walls that surround us where we live work and learn.”

The paint is mostly intended for use in high-traffic areas such as healthcare hospitality office and educational environments but can also be used in residential environments. PPG Copper Armor also provides a mold- and mildew-resistant coating on the dry paint film. It will be available in eggshell satin and semi-gloss and can be tinted to more than 600 colors from the PPG paint palette.

“We started development on Corning Guardiant several years ago with the belief that copper is the key to delivering a truly effective antimicrobial coating” said Joydeep Lahiri division vice president and program director Specialty Surfaces Corning Incorporated in a press release. “We’re excited about our partnership with PPG as well as its latest product offering – Copper Armor – which helps make antimicrobial surface technology more readily available to the public.”

PPG will begin selling the product in late 2021 at PPG Paints stores independent retailers and select home improvement stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvc2FmZXR5L2NvbnN1bWVyLXNhZmV0eS9FUEEtYXBwcm92ZXMtQ09WSUQtMTkta2lsbGluZy85OS9pMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EPA approves COVID-19-killing paint from Corning and PPG,"ACS’s Premium Package gives you full access to C&EN and everything the ACS Community has to offer.

LaSalle College bested a loaded field and continues to make its claim for Pennsylvania's No. 1 team spot with a major victory at the Manhattan College Invitational on Saturday. LaSalle became the first Pennsylvania team in six years to win the annual meet at Van Cortlandt Park in New York City.

The Explorers put three boys in the top 25 and five in the top 40 of the Easterns field and scored 104 points to claim an eight-point win over top-ranked New York squad Corning (112 points). Vermont power U-32 was third followed by Rhode Island's Bishop Hendricken (fourth) and La Salle Academy (fifth).

LaSalle College becomes the first PA team to win Easterns at Manhattan since Downingtown West in 2015. That Downingtown West team went on to win the PIAA Class AAA state title and the NXN-Northeast Regional that year.

Drew Brill paced LaSalle with an 11th place finish in a time of 12:49 for the 2.5 mile course. Zachary Brill was 19th in 12:59 and Ryan McGinley took 25th in 13.12. Will Rau was 31st in 13:18 and Josh Lloyd (38th in 13:22) rounded out the top five for LaSalle. The Explorers had a 1-5 gap of just 32 seconds and Lloyd was the best No. 5 runner in the field by five seconds.

Cole Casadei was 48th and Francis Dougherty was 59th to provide some good depth for the LaSalle varsity squad.

It's yet another strong performance for LaSalle which won at the Briarwood Invitational and placed third -- just off the win -- at the Carlisle Invitational so far this fall. Next up will be the Philadelphia Catholic League Championships in two weeks time as the Explorers prepare for the postseason.

It wasn't just the varsity boys making it a big day for LaSalle at Manhattan. The Explorers claimed team titles in the JV C race (scoring the minimum 15 points) the Sophomore C race and the Frosh A race. Matt Dyer won the JV C race in 14:04. Not only is the present going well for LaSalle but the future looks very bright for this program.

For Tina Louise — the actress who played flame-haired Hollywood bombshell Ginger Grant — there was only one sexy choice among the Skipper the Professor the millionaire and Gilligan.

“It’s Jim” she said of actor Jim Backus who played married millionaire Thurston Howell III. “Jim was hilarious. Humor hon. He was so funny and he used to go to the psychiatrist every day and tell me the news of the day … But just in general he had a great sense of humor. He was adorable.

“I think the Professor read too many books” she added. “[Gilligan] was just very nervous and scared to death and talked so fast. He was so shy.”

Louise is the last surviving castaway from the classic CBS sitcom about seven shipwrecked strangers that debuted 57 years ago on Sept. 26 1964.

Today she lives on the island of Manhattan in the Turtle Bay neighborhood and enjoys reading (“My favorite place is Barnes & Noble!”) and walks in the Katharine Hepburn Garden near the United Nations. She’s also ready to meet the right man.

“I’m open. I’m open. I’m open to life” Louise told The Post. “These days I’m still not going out very far. If I go out with a friend it’s once in two weeks.”

She declined to give her age. “Don’t number me. Who needs it?” she said. “Numbers are not what you look like or how you live your life … Buddha said ‘Live in the present moment. Wisely and earnestly.'”

So if she were stuck on a tropical island in real life what kind of guy might she want to be there with — George Clooney? Brad Pitt?

“He’d be funny have a good heart and money wouldn’t matter if we were stuck on an Island” she said. “I like John Oliver. I like his dimples. I like him. He’s terrific. Bright. Cute. Funny.” Louise added of the “Last Week Tonight” host “You have to enjoy each other’s company and have something to talk about. That’s important.”

Also on her deserted island wish list: “a large bag of raw almonds — I live in the health store — albums by Frank Sinatra. No contest. I’d want to hear Frank all day.”

A native New Yorker Louise was born Tina Blacker in 1934. By the time she was 4 years old her parents had divorced and Louise an only child was raised by her fashion model mother. (Her father was a candy store owner in Brooklyn and later an accountant.) Legend has it the name Louise was added during her senior year of high school when she mentioned to her drama teacher that she was the only girl in the class without a middle name and he suggested it.

While studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and the legendary Actors Studio in Manhattan she also began modeling and working as a nightclub singer. Louise made her Broadway acting debut in the 1952 Bette Davis musical revue “Two’s Company” — and appeared in Playboy magazine in the late 1950s. (Proving she was much more of a Ginger than a Mary Ann.)

It was while performing with Carol Burnett in the 1964 Broadway musical comedy “Fade Out-Fade In” that she landed the “Gilligan” role. Originally the character was a secretary played by actress Kit Smythe in the pilot. When producers decided to turn her into a va-va-voom starlet Louise was cast.

She said she played breathy-voiced Ginger as “part Marilyn [Monroe] part Lucy [Ball]” and had a rocky start on the sitcom. At first she was turned off by the “snarky” scripts but after a month or so the show found its footing and grew more “light and funny and charming. I always had fun with the show. Ginger flirted. Flirting is fun! Flirting is good.”

While little was revealed during the show’s run about the characters’ lives back at home it was known that Ginger had been on an episode of the show “Ben Casey” in a number of films and was set to star as Cleopatra on Broadway when the shipwreck happened. All of this at a time when sexism and casting-couch harassment were rampant in Hollywood.

“‘Ginger would have led the [#MeToo] pack” Louise said. “She would have gotten a group together … I would have liked to have played that scene. With a lot of women they hold everything inside. Or have in the past. It’s very positive to get it out about things that may have been hidden and make you feel uncomfortable.”

5 If left on a desert island with someone today Louise’s first pick would be John Oliver. “I like his dimples” she says. AP

Louise would not discuss if she ever experienced handsy producers or had to deflect comments that crossed the line.

“I look to the light. I’m so grateful for everything that eventually happened for me. … I don’t think there’s any woman walking in this business who hasn’t had situations. There are people who got into horrible situations and they should speak on that.”

That said Louise had no issue with men who openly admired her back in the day. “Whistling at women never bothered me. What’s the problem?” she said. “Somebody’s noticing you. It’s not a problem for me.”

The series ran for 98 episodes over three seasons before it was canceled in 1967.

“The writers didn’t want us to get off the Island” Louise said. “The show was in the Top 10 or 20 when it ended. The [network] president wasn’t happy [with the 1967] schedule. He wanted ‘Gunsmoke’ to come back on. So they took our show off” she added. “In syndication it just went on and on and on … and on and on and on.

“When it did end I just got back to what I was doing. Which was more dramatic roles” she said.

Leaving the glam Ginger on the island Louise flipped the script playing a heroin addict on a 1974 episode of the hit cop TV series “Kojak” and starred in the sci-fi 1975 movie “The Stepford Wives.” Later film roles included a co-starring appearance in the Robert Altman comedy “O.C. and Stiggs” (1987) as well as the independently made rockabilly satire “Johnny Suede” (1992) starring Brad Pitt and Catherine Keener. In recent years Louise starred with Stephen Baldwin in the spiritual drama “Tapestry.” She is jazzed about an upcoming audition for a role in a “fun piece a comedy.”

Louise was married to the late radio announcer/TV talk show host Les Crane (“That’s a book and a half!”) for four years — they divorced in 1971 — and they share a daughter Caprice Crane a novelist screenwriter and television writer/producer who lives in Los Angeles. Louise gushes over her two grandchildren (“My two beautiful babies!”).

In 1996 Louise — who attended PS 6 on East 81st Street as a girl — began reading to New York City public school kids a passion project she kept up for the next two decades. “Nobody ever read to me” she said. “It’s really important to empower a child [to learn].” The former starlet performed her labor of love without fanfare. The kids had no clue she was famous. Louise recalled the time a teacher asked the students “Do you know who this is?” One boy raised his hand and noted she was a “helper.”

“That really touched my heart” Louise said. “That’s who I wanted to be. The person who helped.”

She authored her first children’s book “When I Grow Up” which encourages kids to reach for the stars in 2007. The actress is now looking for a publisher to record her 1997 memoir “Sunday” as an audio book.

Reading and walking — “to the market the shoemaker the hardware store. I go to the gym. I walk everywhere” — are what’s kept her going during the pandemic.

“I started going to Katharine Hepburn Park and then gradually I would get up to 51st and then go back and then further up and then one day I got very very brave and went all the way up to Central Park. I just wanted to see what was going on” she explained. “Some people really just stayed home and wouldn’t leave the house. I don’t live in fear. I’ve done everything that you are supposed to do I’ve taken three [vaccinations].”

Louise said she got “a tremendous amount of fan mail when everybody was really shut in. Really great letters. Just people appreciating the work. I started working when I was 18 years old. My first job was on Broadway. Some people are really aware [of her body of work]. A lot of people just love the series but my favorite film I did was ‘God’s Little Acre.’ When somebody recognizes you it’s nice.”

In December she paid tribute to fellow “Gilligan” castmate Dawn Wells who played fresh-faced wholesome castaway Mary Ann following her death. “I’m very sad” said Louise who infamously declined to appear in revivals and reboots or discuss the show over the decades since it ended in 1967.

“Dawn was a very wonderful person. I want people to remember her as someone who always had a smile on her face” said Louise adding “Nothing is more important than family and she was family. She will always be remembered.”

As for that burning age-old question of Ginger or Mary Ann?

“It’s a game people like to play” she said. “Half of the country doesn’t agree. What do you want from me?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fernando Rodriguez CEO of EZZ said: ""EZZ is pleased to confirm that EZZ brand NMN products are now available in 13 Costco stores in Australia and 13 Costco stores in Taiwan China.

On September 27 the reporter walks into a COSTCO store in Sydney. In a core shelf area near the entrance a product with a silver exterior takes center stage. The reporter finds that from time to time there would be customers carrying the products into their shopping carts. The EZZ NAD STAY YOUNG item is the only NMN on sale at COSTCO. A person at the scene tells the reporter. ""In February COSTCO enters into a strategic partnership with EZZ and confirms that EZZ would be listed as COSTCO's brand. Since the brand is a listed company in Australia it has been selling well.""

The reporter learns that COSTCO is the largest membership chain supermarket in the world which is characterized by only receiving members strict selection of brands and large package sales. The extremely strict selection standards make the title of ""COSTCO cooperative brand"" become an invisible trophy. In this collaboration COSTCO goes through a long process of brand selection before deciding to cooperate with EZZ the industry's sales leader.

The strong strength of EZZ is the reason why COSTCO chose EZZ as the only brand in the NMN industry among many NMN brands. It is reported that EZZ was listed on the main board of the Australian Stock Exchange in March 2021. EZZ is a gene-centered life science research company which is committed to life science research in four fields: NMN HPV Helicobacter pylori and weight management. Through the research results of the Gene Research Center of the Auckland University of Technology EZZ provides health solutions based on genes and enzymes and NMN products are jointly developed with New Zealand Gene Research Center and Auckland University of Technology Gene Research Center and are sold in 23 countries and regions around the world.

""Joining forces with COSTCO in a foreign market will help NMN expand rapidly in the global market which I think is more important for EZZ as a multinational public company. ""Analysts says.

Food safety the accuracy of packaging… surely someone oversees all that—right? Well just as data shows that food recalls have risen it's clear not every aspect of grocery production receives oversight with a fine-tooth comb. This weekend Costco shoppers are puzzling over an error on some of the warehouse's packaging. We've got the image—can you spot it too?

This weekend the Costco subreddit is abuzz after u/TheAnemone who seems to identify as a Costco member posted an image of a Kirkland Signature product. ""Just noticed a typo on all Kirkland ham – can you find it?"" they asked.

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

At press time the post had nearly 150 comments and counting with some users quick to nail it. Not to spoil this brain teaser but a careful study reveals the error appears on the sixth line of text. (Go ahead take another minute…)

U/Wenthruurhistory was one user with a clue Scooby inspo and all: ""Ruh roh Shaggy! Yu forgot to rerigerate the ham! [sic]""

Indeed the word refrigerate is missing a key letter: F. ""That's it!"" the original poster said. Good news is it's safe to say that where to store cold cuts is probably common sense for most shoppers.

Other Costco members on the thread were more focused on learning how the product actually is. ""How is the ham though?"" asked u/auntpenney.

""The ham is a little too salty for my taste but quality and freshness are satisfactory"" the original poster said.

(Perhaps a more confounding question is exactly what does Contains up to 22% of a solution mean? Sorry Shaggy… we're not sure we want to know.)

(Getty Images)

Few men would be keen on seeing their wife is the embrace of another and Julianne Moore's husband is no different.

The actress 60 has revealed that her other half Bart Freundlich feels understandably rather uneasy when she films sex scenes.

She told the Mail on Sunday's You magazine: ""He hates it – which I love about him.

""It is funny because I have to say 'It literally is work...' But I understand it and I think it’s healthy.

""If you felt it was OK for people to kiss your wife it would be sort of weird. But yeah he doesn’t love that.""

The actress married Bart Freundlich in 2003. (Getty Images)

Moore – who was previously married in her 20s – met her director husband 51 in 1996 on the set of the film The Myth of Fingerprints.

They went on to wed in 2003 and share son Caleb 23 and 19-year-old daughter Liv.

The Still Alice star noted that she always wanted to be married and have kids and found the idea – that a generation of feminists were taught – that you should ""wait"" for a romantic partner to come along was ""antiquated"".

It comes after Moore who has been a Hollywood leading lady since the mid-1990s shared the secrets behind her youthful looks.

In an interview with The Sunday Times' Style earlier this year she said: ""My mother has a lot to do with it because she wouldn’t let us go in the sun.

""She couldn’t be in the sun and I look just like her. I wear a sunscreen on my face every day and a hat too.""

The star added that she includes lots of fish and vegetables in her diet and also tries to do yoga four to five times a week.

The declaration was made on Thursday by Minister of Tourism and International Transport Senator Lisa Cummins in response to plans by the British government to overhaul its travel traffic light system that determines which countries its citizens should visit and under what conditions particularly during the current coronavirus pandemic.

“Barbadians have to be committed to keeping Barbados safe for all starting with other Barbadians. Then we will have fewer worries when there are discussions about traffic light systems and their impact on us as a destination” Minister Cummins told Barbados TODAY.

“We have to convince more Barbadians to do the right thing and consider getting vaccinated to wear their masks and practice social distancing. Too many of those things are not happening. This is a case where if you want the results you have to put in the work” she insisted.

A BBC report has said that the traffic light overhaul could mean that green and amber categories maybe removed and replaced with a new system.

The report said that system would allow vaccinated travellers to go to countries with similarly high levels of vaccination as the UK without the need for quarantine.

It said the red category which is for countries that the government says should not be visited will remain.

Under current restrictions countries in the “red” category are flagged as destinations not to be visited “except in the most extreme of circumstances” and travellers returning from them must self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.

The British government declined to comment on the plans but said: “Our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority – protecting public health.

“The next formal checkpoint review will take place by 1 October 2021.”

The Barbados tourism minister said that other markets will make decisions based on their own unique circumstances “and those decisions may benefit or disadvantage us”.

“We are at a further disadvantage if we aren’t doing the right things here at home and then baulking when the economic situation isn’t what we want it to be.”

Minister Cummins said that at this time she is hoping to see more travel from the UK and by extension Europe.

“But I’m clear that the UK will make its own decisions that balance their domestic considerations or lives versus livelihoods and we continue to work closely with them in a number of areas. The good thing for us is that the majority of visitors we are seeing out of the UK are vaccinated and that has its own benefits” she stated.

Senator Cummins is of the view that the most important thing right now is for Barbados to focus on what it can do locally to ensure that Barbados is as safe as possible so people can have some segment of their lives back.

“Tourism is the most severely-impacted sector of the COVID 19 pandemic and it is a delicate policy-making balancing act for every single Government. The UK just like Barbados has to make decisions that balance lives and livelihoods while being guided by the science and the resulting ability to get thousands of people back to work“ the minister argued.

“There are so many people in Barbados who need us to be able to benefit from that increased travel so that they can get back to work and support their families” she contended.

Those she listed who stood to benefit include craft vendors farmers beach chair vendors and water sports operators.

“Even the retail stores in local malls depend on travel taking place from our major markets because the people who visit us shop with them right along with the people who are still unemployed or underemployed” Minister Cummins added.

Though it took a while to get here we are proud to see more discussions take place on a topic that for too long has been highly stigmatized.

Observances such as the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Day today help elevate this much needed dialogue. However while these days are important they also remind us to treat every day as a mental health day. People constantly face stressors events and diagnoses that impact our overall well-being a reality that the COVID-19 pandemic has further revealed making it critical that our approach to preventing and caring for these mental health issues meets these needs.

At Aetna a CVS Health company we understand that every individual sits along a continuum of mental and emotional health needs—from facing moments of anxiety or stress to longer-term clinical diagnoses and everything in between. To truly make mental health care a reality for all we must meet people where they are along this continuum through a three-pronged approach to prevention.

Primary prevention: Addressing root causes

The COVID-19 pandemic has put a new lens on how we think about mental well-being as people have faced increased levels of loneliness routine disruption and anxiety. In fact Aetna and Morning Consult data found that a staggering 65% of Americans ages 18-34 have had concerns about their own mental health or that of household members family or friends since the pandemic outbreak began. Yet the study also found that nearly one in four of the same respondents are not confident in finding help to address these concerns.

Addressing loneliness is one way we can lower feelings of depression and anxiety before they even start. Bringing together communities that have faced similar experiences such as through forums like Aetna-hosted Here4U sessions allows people to feel that they are not alone in the struggles they face. The Here4U sessions held recently for women African American women moms and moms of children with special needs have demonstrated a positive impact on attendees’ mental health with participants reporting a 31% improvement in feeling connected to their peers.

Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) are also valuable modes of preventing escalated mental health concerns as they provide 24/7 life assistance across a wide range of issues that can lower risks of feeling overwhelmed anxious or depressed. In fact one study found that companies with EAPs see a 24% improvement in life satisfaction and a 10% reduction in workplace distress among their workers. But we need to better inform people that EAPs are more than a workplace productivity tool. Aetna’s Resources for Living which provides EAP servicesis one example of a resource that supports those facing stress and anxiety family conflict legal and financial issues grief and loss and even loneliness among our Medicare members.

Secondary prevention: Early signs and treatment options

One in eight emergency department visits are related to mental health or substance abuse demonstrating missed opportunities to identify early signs of mental health concerns before they rise to an emergency. By proactively surrounding individuals with mental health resources in their everyday lives and when interacting with the health care system we can effectively spot early signs of mental health needs and direct people on the right path to well-being.

For the health care industry one of the most effective ways we can identify mental health needs early is through patient data analysis. As part of Next Best Actions our data scientists use consumer data on past behaviors and preferences to guide Aetna members toward decisions or services that will achieve their best total well-being. For example we use data from medical claims to identify members with chronic conditions who are likely at higher risk for having a mental health issue and proactively reach out to them with resources for support.

Providers also play a critical role in early detection of these needs especially with 76% reporting a high or moderate proportion of their patients face mental health issues. Arming providers with instructions tools and resources to identify and direct those facing mental health challenges to the right care such as through Aetna’s work with PsychHub can lead to meaningful change toward preventing further mental health concerns.

To support spotting mental health needs in other health care settings CVS Health provides mental health screenings during MinuteClinic appointments and licensed clinical social workers in select HealthHUB locationsprovide virtual or in-person mental health assessments and treatment planning. An effective approach to early detection combines all of these measures—proactive consumer outreach provider training and embedding resources in local communities and other care settings—to improve mental health.

Tertiary prevention: Intervening with treatment

While intervention is more focused on the action taken when a clinical issue has already presented itself it is an equally important aspect of preventing mental health needs from worsening. Mental health care is accessible in more ways than we’ve ever seen before—from seeing a therapist in person to connecting virtually or over the phone to text we are continuously evolving modes of mental health intervention.

Among Aetna’s Commercial members 60% of outpatient mental health visits were done via telemedicine in 2020 up from just one percent in 2019. That higher figure is holding steady through this year which is a positive development! Telemedicine has proven to be particularly effective for mental health care as it allows for greater convenience in connecting with a provider and it can be a good option for those who are apprehensive about receiving this kind of care in person. Studies have also shown that integrating telebehavioral health into primary care and increasing access to telepsychiatry has led to improvements in patients’ mental health.

We also know that individuals increasingly want to receive care conveniently in their communities and in a way that is connected to their overall health care plan and lifestyle—connecting their physical and mental health care to where they are shopping for other well-being products and picking up their prescriptions. The expansion of home delivery of mental health medications to ensure people adhere to medication guidance to recover and prevent future risks is another positive step in this regard.

Preventive care is powerful and we must not forget the influence it has on all aspects of our health including our mental well-being. As the focus on the mental health of ourselves loved ones and communities continues to rise Aetna and CVS Health remain committed to ensuring that no one is alone on this journey and supporting our partner providers and companies across the country to do the same. Through this work we can make progress toward improving mental health for our communities workplaces and families.

In the study doctors recruited 679 people from April to June across Britain. At the time all of the volunteers had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine either from AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech the two vaccines first authorized there.

When the volunteers returned for a second vaccine dose the researchers also gave half of them a flu shot and the other half a placebo. The researchers then monitored the volunteers for side effects such as aches and fevers.

Home Town Season 6 is officially underway.

Erin Napier shared a snapshot from the first day of filming and fans can hardly contain their excitement.

HGTV viewers have come to know and love Erin and Ben Napier over the years so when Erin took to Instagram to announce the first day of filming for Home Town season six fans were nothing short of thrilled.

“#hgtvhometown day one of season SIX” Erin captioned a photo of herself and Ben smiling behind the clapperboard. “Thank you so much for watching so we get to keep making this very special show together. thank you times a million!!”

It’s especially fitting that she said “times a million” in her caption as well because recently she surpassed a million followers on Instagram something that has only been done by a small number of HGTV hosts.

Follower count aside her fans were quick to comment on her photo. “May it never end” one fan wrote. “Thank YOU for giving us a quality show to watch” someone else commented. “Thank you for entertaining us and teaching us about life and home remodeling/decorating” another fan exclaimed. “You are a very special couple and it's easy to see the light of Christ shining brightly in you two!”

And the praise just kept trickling in.

As a refresher Home Town follows Erin and Ben as they remodel and redesign homes for couples and families of varying ages. Where Erin uses her design background to create modern stylish updates Ben puts his woodworking skills to work to breathe new life into old homes.

While the season 6 premiere date isn’t here quite yet fans can expect to tune in to the home improvement show in 2022. In the meantime catch up on old episodes on discovery+.

Stores such as CVS Walgreens and Duane Reade are all running very low on goods.

Supplies are being held up on cargo ships that are taking up to four weeks to dock at US ports.

A lack of manpower to unload them and to drive goods around the US is causing a giant backlog.

Experts have warned the government to intervene or face spiraling inflation and unemployment as rocketing demand for goods in short supply pushes their prices up.

US consumers have already seen prices of everyday items rise in recent months with economists warning of an extended period of inflation that will push up the cost of living.

'It looks like the Third World' one Manhattan resident complained to the New York Post.

The backlog of billions of dollars of toys clothing electronics vehicles and furniture came amid surges caused in 2020 by the onset of COVID.

The United States has since largely returned to normal life - but demand for goods has surged as people get the hang of returning to normal.

Americans who were able to save money during COVID lockdowns are now splashing the cash with that raised demand further credited with pushing up prices.

The trillions of dollars of COVID relief printed to help people put out of work by the pandemic has also been blamed for inflation.

Supply chains have lagged far behind consumer demand due to a lack of manpower at American ports and the restrictions that came with the COVID-19 outbreak early last year. These constraints which include social distancing and mandatory quarantines have severely limited the number and ability of port workers to do their jobs.

'Global infrastructure was not designed to handle goods at such a rate' a logistics expert who asked not to be named told DailyMail.com.

'Supply chains are the artery who feeds our entire ecosystem. The government needs to intervene to stop this crisis immediately or face increased inflation and unemployment and economic breakdown - or face an end to global trade.'"

So was the Bloomin’ Onion.

A state known for its famous cartoon mouse pristine beaches and wild animal stories also served as the birthplace of some of the more popular restaurant and fast-food chains in the U.S. and beyond.

Here are stories behind the more popular restaurants that originated in Florida.

Burger King Jacksonville (1953)

Two cities claim Burger King but at least both are in Florida.

The fast-food burger franchise began in 1953 as Insta-Burger King on Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville. Later that decade two Miami-based franchisees bought the financially struggling company and renamed it Burger King.

The hamburger chain was on its way in 1957 when the Whopper was added to the menu. Burger King hit the national scene especially during the 1970s when the chain advertised heavily on television with its “Have It Your Way” commercials that touted “hold the pickle hold the lettuce special orders don’t upset us.”

The predecessor of the burger mega-chain Burger King was originally founded in 1953 in Jacksonville Florida by relatives Keith J. Kramer and Matthew Burns. They decided to call their first location Insta-Burger King due to the broilers they purchased to cook the burgers called Insta-Broilers. The following year James McLamore and David Edgerton began opening Insta-Burger franchises in Miami — they replaced the Insta-Broilers with the flame broiler system that Burger King is famous for. Due to financial hardships Kramer and Burns eventually sold the company to McLamore and Edgerton who subsequently renamed the chain Burger King.

Children also enjoyed a visit to BK receiving a paper crown that adjusted to their head size. And don’t forget the funky maroon and orange uniforms (with a goofy-looking hat to match) employees wore in the 1970s certainly helping to build its brand.

But it was perhaps its offering of flame-grilled burgers that kept customers returning along with its variety of food offerings including thick french fries and the Hershey’s Sundae Pie dessert.

In recent years Burger King added the Impossible Whopper featuring a plant-based protein-filled patty and four versions of the Ch’King Sandwich.

Burger King has more than 18000 outlets in 100 countries.

Sonny’s BBQ Gainesville (1968)

Sonny’s BBQ is a Southeastern restaurant chain known for its slow smoke traditions Southern hospitality and “Random Acts of BBQ” initiative where it throws surprise feasts for community members or organizations nominated for their good deeds.

The tradition of giving dates back to 1968 when it was founded at 2700 NE Waldo Road Gainesville by Floyd “Sonny” Tillman and his wife Lucille.

Over the years the local joint became a Florida favorite and expanded across the state and Southeastern U.S. Its first franchisee John Kirkpatrick opened an Ocala location in 1977 according to the restaurant’s online history.

Less than five years later Sonny’s had 25 restaurants. And by the end of 1998 the barbecue staple had welcomed its 100th location and spread to seven other states: Georgia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana South Carolina North Carolina and Kentucky.

The BBQ bosses at Sonny’s boast Southern must-haves like fried okra and corn nuggets and signature pork beef brisket and sauce available through dine-in takeout delivery and catering. If you’re still hankering after the meat of your meal don’t worry. Sonny’s isn’t done yet. It offers banana pudding chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon sugar doughnut holes with sweet tea glaze to fill that extra room for dessert.

Red Lobster Lakeland (1968)

Anyone who has made then savored Reb Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits at home can thank this Florida original.

Red Lobster opened in Lakeland in 1968 and General Mills two years later acquired the company. The chain expanded rapidly especially in the 1980s and today has more than 700 restaurants worldwide including nearly every U.S. state and in countries including Japan Mexico China and others.

The famous biscuits — served in restaurants first in 1992 — became so popular that the biscuit mix hit grocery store shelves so consumers can bake them in their

Red Lobster for more than half a century has specialized in of course lobster but also crab shrimp and other seafood while also serving up chicken pasta steak salads dessert and more.

Olive Garden Orlando (1982)

The popular Italian restaurant chain opened as a unit of General Mills in Orlando.

So Olive Garden was not a typical restaurant that began from an owner or two as General Mills — a multinational manufacturer that markets branded consumer foods not based in the Sunshine State — solely intended to create a chain from the get-go.

Even so Florida can claim the first one at 8984 International Drive along Interstate 4 in Central Florida which made sense with Disney World nearby.

Olive Garden has become known for its “endless” soup salada and breadsticks along with popular pasta dishes including shrimp alfredo “Tour of Italy” (featuring three of Olive Garden’s most popular dishes: chicken parmigiana lasagna and fettuccine alfredo) and lasagna fritta.

General Mills in 1995 spun off its restaurant chains to create Darden Restaurants Inc. which is headquartered in Orlando. The multi-brand restaurant operator in addition to Olive Garden owns Eddie V’s Prime Seafood The Capital Grille LongHorn Steakhouse Bahama Breeze Seasons 52 Yard House and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Hooters Clearwater (1983)

Sure there are hundreds of Hooters restaurants across the country but there’s only one Original Hooters and it can be found on Gulf to Bay Boulevard connecting Tampa to Clearwater Beach.

Opened by six businessmen “with absolutely no previous restaurant experience” according to the restaurant’s website it was incorporated on April Fool’s Day 1983 and opened on Oct. 4 of that year.

This undated photo provided by Hooters restaurant shows the original building that housed Hooters in Clearwater Fla. Courtesy photo ' Hooters

The website notes that the “Hooters Six” were L.D. Stewart a painting contractor; Gil DiGiannantonio a liquor salesman; “Uncle Billy” Ranieri a retired service station owner; Ed Droste a real estate executive; Dennis Johnson a brick mason by trade; and Ken Wimmer a partner in the painting business with L.D. Strange group.

The Original Hooters operated out of a ramshackle wood structure before being almost entirely demolished and rebuilt in 2012. Now it features a new inside/outside bar area a merchandise and to-go area and a museum dedicated to Hooters history.

Of course the main attractions in addition to the friendly staff in the famed orange and white outfits remain the World Famous Wings. On Super Bowl Sundays for instance this Tampa Bay Hooters goes through about 20000 of ’em.

Outback Steakhouse South Tampa (1988)

A global restaurant chain giant best known for its signature steaks and Bloomin’ Onion appetizer Outback debuted in March 1988 on Henderson Boulevard in South Tampa.

The original Outback Steakhouse which opened in 1988 and has since been remodeled is at 3403 Henderson Blvd. in South Tampa.

Outback was the first restaurant by the proprietors’ Bloomin’ Brands which is also still based in Tampa and now owns and operates Outback Steakhouse Carrabba’s Italian Grill Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar.

Rib City Grill Fort Myers (1989)

What began as local barbecue restaurant 32 years ago in Southwest Florida has spread across the U.S.

The first Rib City Grill opened on U.S. 41 in Fort Myers after original founder Gerry Pastore created the concept of a small family-style barbecue joint. In early 1990 Pastore founded a second location on Leonard Street in nearby Cape Coral.

The restaurants caught the attention of Paul Peden a Fort Myers restaurateur who met with Pastore who no longer was involved with the restaurants. Peden eventually became a partner in Rib City Grill and later bought the company.

The chain grew across Southwest Florida and eventually to other states including Colorado Missouri Tennessee Illinois and Virginia.

Rib City Grill offers backyard barbecue classics such as pulled pork chicken and baby back ribs.

“We stick to what we know and we produce what we say we will — real barbecue great ribs and excellent service” Peden told the Fort Myers News-Press in 2019. “This philosophy became the foundation of our growth.”

Metro Diner Jacksonville (1992)

Credit Guy Fieri with giving Jacksonville-based Metro Diner a boost just when it was needed most. The first Metro Diner opened in Jacksonville’s San Marco neighborhood in 1992 in a location that had housed diners under other names since the 1930s and was taken over by its current management team in 2000.

But it was a 2010 appearance on “Diners Drive-ins and Dives” with Fieri raving about the “crunchification” of Metro Diner’s signature meatloaf that brought national attention to the chain.

Metro Diners known for its “comfort food with flair” can now be found at more than 50 locations in 12 states including 25 in Florida.

Firehouse Subs Jacksonville (1994)

Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen were Jacksonville firefighters just like their dad when they opened their first Firehouse Subs location at Crown Plaza in suburban Jacksonville in 1994.

The chain known for its tasty subs and firehouse-decorated restaurants now has nearly 1200 locations in 46 states including about 170 in Florida. In a 2016 interview with CNBC Robin Sorensen said he and his brother had less than $100 in their checking accounts when they opened their first restaurant.

They started the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation in 2005 to provide funding equipment and education for first responders.

Bonefish Grill St. Petersburg (2000)

Bonefish Grill founders Tim Curci and Chris Parker — “fueled by their shared love for catching cooking and serving fresh fish” according to the restaurant’s website — opened its first location in St. Petersburg in January 2000.

The following year it was acquired by the Tampa-based Bloomin’ Brands and over two decades has become one of the biggest seafood chains in the country.

As its name suggests Bonefish Grill is known for its wood-grilled fish along with other seafood selections such as its Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer tossed in a creamy spicy sauce. It’s also known for its cocktail offerings stating that its hand-crafted martinis are “shaken no less than 20 times.”

Today the chain has nearly 200 locations in 31 states according to its website’s directory though its home of Florida still has by far more locations than any other state.

PDQ Tampa (2011)

Co-founded by former Tampa Bay Buccaneers chief financial officer Nick Reader and Outback’s Bob Basham this chicken-centric chain opened its first location in Tampa in 2011.

According to PDQ’s website Reader wanted a fast-food place that was fresh and he felt good about feeding to his children while Basham was in search of fresh flavor and inspiration. They found what they were looking in a North Carolina neighborhood joint called Tenders making a deal on the spot with the restaurant.

When they opened their first Tampa restaurant on Halloween weekend “car lines wrapped around the building and folks kept coming back for more.”

Since then PDQ has opened dozens more locations throughout Florida — including at Tampa International Airport Raymond James Stadium and Amalie Arena — as well as states such as North Carolina New Jersey and New York.

Along with chicken tenders nuggets sandwiches and salads PDQ serves handspun shakes.

Ford’s Garage Fort Myers (2012)

What began as a downtown Fort Myers restaurant moved quickly in a couple years faster than a 1969 Boss 429 Mustang.

Ford’s Garage quietly opened in 2012 and a couple years later something happened: A few retired executives from Naples stopped by and noticed the detail and care put into the restaurant from the black Model T suspended above the bar (which honks OOGA with steam spewing from its tailpipe) to the branded Ford’s Garage logo on burger buns.

Ford Motor Co. reached out about partnering with the restaurant and the two forged a unique relationship. Ford’s Garage became the first and only restaurant to be allowed rights to Ford’s iconic blue-oval logo as well as other of the automotive giant’s brand imagery including archived historical photos images of vehicles and actual Model Ts.

There’s now 16 Ford’s Garage restaurants in three states including one in St. Augustine next to a Ford dealership along Interstate 95. Other ones in Florida are in Brandon Cape Coral Countryside Estero Kissimmee Lakeland Orlando Sarasota St. Petersburg Wellington Wesley Chapel and Westchase.

But what about the food? Ford’s Garage offers a vareity of burgers along with onion rings served on a piston rod “Edsel’s Hot Pretzels” with dip sauce loaded mac & cheese varieties desserts like the caramel apple cookie skillet and more.

UAW Vice President Chuck Browning who has led negotiations with the company said in a statement Sunday night that 90% of members voted against a contract that the two sides proposed. He said UAW International staff along with presidents and chairs of nine locals will return to the bargaining table Monday.

Some locals in Iowa posted on Facebook that workers will go on strike if Deere doesn't meet the UAW""s demands by the end of Wednesday.

Many workers who spoke to the Des Moines Register on Sunday said they wanted the union to go on strike. The last strike among Deere workers was in 1986 after the company laid off thousands of employees during the Farm Crisis.

Deere executives said Sunday night that they will hear the UAW out.

""John Deere remains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees’ viewpoints"" company officials said in a statement. ""In the meantime our operations will continue as normal.""

All of the locals in Iowa roundly rejected the agreement with each voting no by more than 85%.

More: Everybody wants a John Deere tractor. But not everybody wants a John Deere job. Why?

'You deserve better' the signs read

Throughout Sunday members loudly protested the proposed contract which called for modest wage gains and enhanced retirement benefits — at the cost of future workers.

On the drive into Des Moines' Saydel High School where Deere's Ankeny employees voted someone planted signs reading ""REJECT THIS PIECE OF TRASH"" and ""YOU DESERVE BETTER.""

Inside the University of Northern Iowa's McLeod Center Waterloo workers booed a UAW International representative. Members yelled at him about a 2018 vote when union delegates approved a 31% pay hike for UAW leaders according to videos of the event provided to the Des Moines Register.

In East Moline another video showed an employee asked union leaders why the UAW hadn't told the members to walk after workers voted to authorize a strike in September.

""You didn't hear us"" she said. ""Do you hear us now? Do you hear us now? How can you stand up there on your high horse and not hear us? This is not who we are. We deserve better.""

The vote comes as Deere takes in record profits fueled by high corn and soybean prices. The company projects it will earn $5.7 to 5.9 billion this fiscal year which ends in November. That would be at least 61% higher than the company's previous record year in 2013.

At the same Deere managers said in May that they were struggling to hire enough workers. Durable goods manufacturing companies around the country have reported a record number of job openings this year. Workers in those factories in turn are quitting in record numbers.

What's in the contract?

The proposed contract between Deere and the UAW calls for an immediate 5% or 6% pay raise for factory hands depending on the job. For lower-end positions like fork truck drivers first-year employees would make $20.10 an hour up 96 cents from what the company paid earlier this year. For higher-end skilled labor jobs like electricians and plumbers new workers would get $30.30 an hour a $1.71 increase.

Deere also agreed to offer 3% pay bumps in 2023 and 2025 as well as throw in three extra holidays and two weeks of paid parental leave.

The company would change its formula to determine how much money retired workers get under Deere's pension plan. A worker with 25 years of experience would receive about $100 extra every month. The company would also give retired workers five lump sum payments from $20000 to $50000 depending on how many years they worked for the company before stepping away.

But the contract would also end the pension program for new hires after Nov. 1. Those employees would receive matching contributions from the company in a 401(K) plan.

Deere no longer a 'premium employer'?

Outside of Saydel High School Marty Carter said he voted against the contract because the changes hurt future employees. The proposal reminded him of what happened between Deere and the UAW in 1997 when the company enhanced pension benefits for its current workers but cut starting wages for new hires almost in half.

""John Deere was once a premium employer"" said Carter a welder for the company for the last 11 years. ""It used to be the best place to work. It isn’t anymore. I think about our kids and our grandkids We need great places for them to work one day when they grow older. This isn’t going to do it.”

Shawn Fields an assembler for the last 11 years said his decision to vote against the contract was pretty simple especially after the company declared that employees like him were essential to the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We busted our [expletive]"" he said. ""We got crumbs. That's all it comes down to.""

Diana Swartz who has worked as an assembler for the last four years said the contract would bump her wage by 74 cents to $21.43 an hour. She said the pay doesn't compete with what she made at her old job working in production for Cargill for $24.46 an hour.

She added that her proposed small pay bump isn't satisfying when the pay of Deere's CEO John May increased by 160% during the pandemic. May received $15.6 million in 2020 up from $6 million the year before.

May received an extra $5 million in stock awards in 2020 as well as an extra $2.3 million in incentives because the company hit certain targets like sales figures.

""They've long forgot who really does the work"" Swartz said. ""John Deere's been a bully since '97 on the playground with the UAW. They bullied the UAW around and got away with it. It's time we stood up. We deserve more.""

Tom Morris dies at 101 best known for case on patent infringement,"AGN Media

Amarillo attorney S. Tom Morris a trial lawyer who won a precedent-setting Supreme Court case on patent infringement in 1966 died Monday Oct. 5.

According to a news release issued Thursday at age 101 Morris was still engaged in an active practice at the Underwood Law Firm.

Morris was elected to the elite Fellowship in the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1973. In 2001 he received the Chief Justice Charles L. Reynolds Lifetime Achievement Award from the Amarillo Area Bar Association. In 2005 he was honored by the Texas Bar Foundation as one of five outstanding Texas lawyers with more than 50 years in practice.

“Underwood has been honored to be associated with a Texas Legal Legend – an official designation by the Litigation Section of the State Bar of Texas” said Underwood President Gavin Gadberry. “Mr. Morris made us all better lawyers by his example and instruction. He will be missed.”

Underwood colleague Slater Elza said “I have had the opportunity to handle lawsuits all over the state. It seems everywhere I go someone asks me about Mr. Morris. Then they tell me with both honor and affection how hard he prepared what a gentleman he was and how bad they lost to him at some point in their career. He is our reminder that we can do our job efficiently and with grace and common courtesy while still protecting our clients’ interests. We are lucky to have been able to watch him and learn from him.”

Morris represented the John Deere Company in the patent infringement case of Graham v. Deere which he argued before the Supreme Court on Oct. 14 1965. The case was decided for John Deere on Feb. 21 1966 and since then has been cited more than 30000 times and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court three times.

The case established what is known as the obviousness doctrine whereby a patent claim is obvious when the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art ""are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.”

Ken Fields another Underwood colleague said “Mr. Morris was a consummate professional. I always felt after his experiences as a Navy pilot in World War II where he flew off of the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga every type of fighter plane and dive bomber the Navy had that law practice at the highest level was to him child’s play by comparison.”

During Morris’ final year of law school at the University of Texas he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 he served four years in the Navy flying airplanes off an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean. Morris returned to law school after the war graduated in 1946 and stayed to serve two years on the faculty.

In an interview for the Texas Bar Foundation Morris recounted the time when the University of Texas established a separate law school for African American students and he was assigned from the faculty to teach the Torts class for the first class of three students. Morris said “I remember the Daily Texan interviewed me and asked for my comments about it. One of my comments was that well I was glad we were doing it but I didn’t see why we just didn’t go ahead and admit them to the law school. That was kind of a revolutionary statement to make in those days of segregation battles. Kenneth Culp Davis who was a very liberal-thinking faculty member came to my office first thing the next morning when my remarks appeared in the Daily Texan. We were good friends. He said ‘Tom I wish I’d been able to say that. I didn’t have the guts to say that.’”

Also during that interview Morris was asked what he liked best about being a trial lawyer. He said “I like to compete and I genuinely love the law. I think the law is the most challenging profession in the world. It’s just fun. I enjoy it as much today as I did 50 years ago. It’s a privilege to practice law and I think I run scared all the time. I’m afraid that I’m not going to have everything that I should have done have my witnesses ready or have every bit of my law ready for the trial. It’s a challenge right up from the beginning of a trial until you get through in the Supreme Court.”

At the end of the interview Morris said “My family is first and I could not have done what I have done without the constant and loyal support of my wife Estella. But the law is second always has been. Whatever success I’ve had I think the reason is that I’ve dedicated myself to the law and the practice of law.”

Underwood colleague Kelly Utsinger said “Tom Morris was the trial lawyer’s trial lawyer. His extraordinary courage and heroism in WW II transferred well into a fearless formidable courtroom advocate. For 75 years the law was his professional life and he lived it to the fullest rising to unparalleled levels of achievement and commanding universal respect for his ethics collegiality analysis briefing and trial skills. Practicing with him or against him made you think he didn’t just know the law – he created it. And considering his years of practice he may have. With equal fervor he was committed to his family. His wife and daughters were his greatest treasures. He is irreplaceable as a great husband father and lawyer and as our partner in the Underwood Law Firm.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudG1haWwuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvMDgvcGhvdG9zLXRyYWN0b3ItYXVjdGlvbi1vY3RvYmVyLWJlbmVmaXQtcG93ZGVyc3ZpbGxlLXltY2EvNTgyMjA0MDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos Tractor auction in October to benefit Powdersville YMCA,"Photos Tractor auction in October to benefit Powdersville YMCA

Keith Edward Coleman

Holly Springs NC - Keith Edward Coleman age 35 passed away Tuesday July 20 2021 from a tragic car accident near his home in Holly Springs N.C. He was born in Erie July 22 1985 the son of Lynnette (Albert) Coleman of Erie and the late Ronald Coleman.

Keith grew up in Erie where he attended St. George School and then went on to graduate from Cathedral Prep class of 2004. He attended the University of Dayton to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. There he met his future wife Courtney. He went on to graduate from Penn State Behrend with a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology.

Keith's Engineering work brought the couple to several destinations across the country including Louisville Ky. to John Deere in Houma La. and eventually to Winston-Salem and Raleigh N.C. Courtney and Keith were married in Asheville N.C. on November 26 2016 and settled their family in Holly Springs where Keith worked as an engineer for Pentair. There the Colemans expanded their family from two to five.

Perfectly described as quietly hilarious Keith was a lover of craft beer bacon and the Cleveland Browns. His favorite time was that spent with his children reading books and visiting parks. At home Keith always had his miniature schnauzer Winnie by his side. He was beloved by his family and friends and they will forever keep him in their hearts.

Besides his father he was preceded in death by maternal grandparents Edward and Esther Albert (Papa and Nana) and his paternal grandparents George and Evelyn Coleman along with numerous aunts uncles and cousins.

Survivors include his wife Courtney (Mullin) Coleman and three children; Piper Monroe (3) Quinlan Edward (2) and Brady George (4 months) his mother Lynnette Coleman and William Phipps half-brother Jeffrey (Erin) Coleman Chicago Ill. and half-sisters; Jodi (Chris) Gray of Edinboro and Jennifer (John) Pitcairn of Willoughby Ohio and their families along with very special ""Aunts"" and numerous friends.

The Atlanta-bound plane was not completely full Mr. Plummer said and the couple changed seats several times.

The man and woman never did settle in and as Flight 462 began to taxi out to a runway the man stood up ignoring a flight attendant’s order to sit saying that he had post-traumatic stress disorder Mr. Plummer said.

A short time later Mr. Plummer said he felt the plane shudder to a stop. It was not immediately clear to him why but the flight crew eventually told the passengers what had happened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9zaG91bGQtYWlybGluZXMtb2ZmZXItcGFpZC13aW5lLWNob2ljZXMtaW4tZmlyc3QtY2xhc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should Airlines Offer Paid Wine Choices In First Class?,"I don’t want to drink the swill that many airlines serve on board and would love an option to pay for something nicer. I’m not sure it would work though as a business proposition because of the cost to source a niche product taking up scarce galley space when the market for this might be limited.

Airlines might also worry that a paid upcharge in a premium cabin might cheapen the experience. On the other hand they don’t seem to worry that serving cheap wines cheapens the experience! So perhaps they should give it a go as a test to improve the product while generating incremental revenue as well?

Delta Air Lines probably has the best paid wine program in its Sky Clubs though it recently devalued paying for those wines in SkyMiles. United has a paid premium wine program in its clubs and so does American.

All three airlines offer paid upgrade options for club members and those with access through the class of service yet none offer paid upgrade options in the air for premium class customers. And all largely offer swill in their domestic first class cabins and while they’re somewhat better in international business class the options aren’t great.

They don’t offer a truly premium feel



And don’t serve the kinds of wines you’ll find on international competitors.

Delta has even been caught serving $4 champagne in international business class.

To be sure not every airline offers bad wine on board! Flying Qatar Airways first class I had a glass of Taittinger Comptes de Champange in first class before heading back to the business class bar for a glass of Krug.

But how nice would it be to enjoy a class of Penfolds RWT Shiraz on a flight out of Australia like I’ve had on Singapore Airlines but in business class or even economy? Or perhaps a 2005 Pichon-Lalande which I’ve also enjoyed from Singapore’s first class cellars or a Chateau Cos d’Estournel Saint-Estephe? I should disclose that I have a preference for big and complex French Bordeaux blends and Burgundies for California and Australia wines generally and am somewhat averse to acidic and to overly tannic wines. That influences my take on what works well in a lounge and in-flight.

God Save The Points argues that airlines should offer a paid upgrade option for passengers in premium cabins to drink better wines than airlines will serve at the price bundled with a ticket.

Galley space is highly constrained on narrowbodies it would be difficult to offer more than a bottle or two for upsell and airlines may not find the juice here to be worth the squeeze. On the other hand galley space is more available on widebodies and this could be an option for international long haul. So why don’t U.S. carriers do it?

The idea likely overrates consumer’s willingness to pay for better wine especially at altitude where your ability to taste changes (Singapore Airlines has a pressurized room for wine tasting on the ground to simulate the cabin experience).

Put another way the idea may underrate consumer’s willingness to drink the swill that airlines serve today. When faced with a choice of bad wines I skip the wine and might enjoy a cocktail (or just a glass of water).

And this could create the hotel minibar problem where the option is expensive to service and a money loser despite high prices.

Given the constraints of space cost to source and serve a limited market item the price could be higher than customers might expect and would be willing to pay.

About four years ago I sat next to a passenger on a Dallas Fort-Worth – Austin flight who had brought her complimentary wine from the Admirals Club on board in a ‘to go’ cup. She wound up in an altercation with the flight attendant who insisted she give it up prior to takeoff and she could have a new glass of wine once we were in the air. It ended up with a passenger inflight disturbance report.

I have to remind myself at times that much of the wine that’s being served is being served to this passenger or Cort McCown’s character Quint in 1987’s Can’t Buy Me Love trying to impress a girl with his wine knowledge.

Quint: I’ve learned to appreciate the finer things in life. I even travel with my own wine. You never know the quality you may encounter at a soiree. Fran: [smells the wine and coughs] Very classy. Quint: [takes a swig out of the wine bottle] Mm-hmm. I’m into class. It’s my new thing.

Given this customer and that it’s expensive enough to source wines for an airport location and bring them through security and storage is at a premium inside of an airport these problems are only magnified in an aircraft cabin the idea may be both challenging and low value to an airline. But I’d still personally love to see it!

One idea that God Save The Points offers for airlines with an international first class product is to offer bottles already being sourced and loaded for first class to passengers in other cabins for a fee. This solves some logistical problems while creating others such as quantities to board whether to store it all in first class and having crew running between cabins or truly just to serve the wines you’re buying anyway in other cabins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGF3YWl0cy5jb20vMjcwMjI3Mi91bml0ZWQtYW1lcmljYW4tZGVsdGEtbm8tY2hhcmdlLWZvci1mbHlpbmctd2l0aC1iaWtlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Airlines Won't Charge Passengers Who Travel With Their Bicycle,"If you love to ride your bike or know someone who does then you understand how attached cyclists are to their bikes. Chances are you also understand that taking a bike on a trip can be frustrating — and expensive — because some air carriers still charge outrageous fees for transporting bikes.

Last month for example United Airlines was charging cyclists an additional $200 — each way — to transport a bike an article on CyclingTips.com reports.

But that was last month. Now in a move that has U.S. cyclists rejoicing United has changed its policy. Instead United now treats properly packed bicycles as standard luggage that doesn’t incur oversized bag charges.

In other words United now joins American Airlines and Delta in making it easier and cheaper for cyclists to take their bikes on trips.

Here’s how American Delta and United now deal with bikes.

American Airlines

American was the first airline to change its policy about bikes when it eliminated oversize bag fees for sports and music equipment in May 2019.

“As the busy summer travel period quickly approaches American Airlines has announced changes to its policies regarding oversize sports and music equipment” the company said in a statement at the time. It went on to note that the updated policy “will also ensure that customers can more easily pursue active and healthy lifestyles wherever their travels may take them without having to pay additional oversize bag fees.”

American now explains that passengers can travel with a non-motorized touring mountain tandem or racing bicycle if the bike meets certain conditions. The bike must be in a hard-sided case bicycle bag or box built for bicycle transport. Plus the bike’s handlebars must be fixed sideways. Finally the pedals must be removed or the pedals and handlebars must be wrapped “in plastic foam or a similar material.”

One important note American does point out that “if your bicycle is not in a hard-sided case it will be treated as a fragile item.”

OK so what’s it cost for a bike on an American flight? The airline explains that standard checked bag fees apply for bikes up to 50 pounds if they are 126 inches in total (length + width + height). A $150 fee will apply to bikes that weigh 51 to 70 pounds.

Delta Airlines

Delta quickly followed American’s lead.

“Delta customers traveling with surfboards bicycles golf clubs scuba gear and other large-sized sporting equipment will now be allowed to check them as part of their standard baggage allowance” the airline wrote in a July 18 2019 statement. “The airline is eliminating the $150 specialty sports bag fee previously charged for these items effective for travel worldwide on tickets purchased beginning July 17 2019. Customers will instead pay a first second or third checked bag fee according to the fare rules associated with their booking.”

Delta now explains that while bikes count as checked bags overweight baggage fees apply to bags that weigh more than 50 pounds and bags cannot exceed 115 linear inches (length + width + height).

Delta further explains that “bicycles non-motorized touring or single seat racing” are allowed as long as they meet certain conditions. First of all non-motorized touring or single-seat racing bicycles must be packed in a “durable protective container designed specifically for bicycles.” If the bike is packed that way the passenger does not need to complete “a limited release form.”

On the other hand if the bike is packed in a soft-sided travel bag or anything that’s not a hard-shell case the passenger must sign a limited release form.

United Airlines

Now United has taken a similar approach although it did so quietly with no fanfare.

In a recent update to its Traveling with Sports Equipment webpage United now explains “We’ll accept them [bikes] as checked bags as long as you pack them in suitable containers that are within the size and weight limits of your checked bag allowance.”

Of course United also notes that “oversized and overweight items will be subject to standard fees for oversized and overweight bags.”

United does stipulate certain conditions for packaging bikes. To begin with bikes must be packed in a sealed hard-sided box using plastic foam or other protective material inside. However United does allow that the box may also be made of “durable cardboard.”

As you would expect the bike’s handlebars must be turned sideways and the pedals must be removed.

Finally United cautions that it isn’t liable for damage to any checked bicycles that weren’t packed properly.

Bates plays store owner Ruth Whitefeather Feldman who runs Ruth’s Alternative Caring along with her son Travis (Aaron Moten) and an eclectic array of store employees. Disjointed uses the backdrop of a California dispensary complete with its unique set of workers and customers to showcase the benefits of controlled legal marijuana use that are often left out of the modern representation of cannabis in our culture.

This is achieved primarily through the use of one character the store’s security guard Carter (Tone Bell). An Iraq War veteran Carter suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The showrunners Chuck Lorre and David Javerbaum use this to build a storyline that follows Carter’s experiences medicating with marijuana for the first time.

Disjointed balances the semi-serious aspect of Carter’s character with a never-ending slew of weed-related humor complete with “Strain O’ The Day” YouTube videos (including one hilariously funny play on the Schrodinger’s cat paradox) and marijuana-themed advertisements in each episode.

While the show’s humor feels forced at times and it is definitely not for everyone — Rotten Tomatoes published a “Summer TV Scorecard” that ranked Disjointed as the worst show of the summer giving it a 17 percent based on 24 reviews — it will undoubtedly be a hit within the community at which the jokes are aimed.

Rather than try to accommodate the needs of outside viewers the showrunners focus all their energy on making the show as enjoyable for cannabis consumers as possible. Despite this Disjointed includes enough classic sitcom tropes to appease most average viewers as well.

All comedy aside the new Netflix show does shine light on the growing medical marijuana industry something even more timely for those watching in Maryland. After about four years of delays the state approved its first medical marijuana dispensary (the Wellness Institute of Maryland in Frederick) over the summer and cultivators began growing their first plants last week.

At its core Disjointed is a stoner comedy about stoners but it strives to be so much more by tackling the big-picture issues that surround marijuana in a fresh way. Rather than continuing to perpetuate negative stereotypes about marijuana the show details the positives that can come with cannabis culture.

Disjointed challenges the typical sitcom combining the best parts of workplace comedy and bar-room banter by focusing on cannabis instead of alcohol. Our protagonists no longer have to congregate in their local bar after a long day at work to share their stories — they can do it in the middle of their lunch break all while sharing a smoke no less.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's Wait and See,"In late September a UAE startup called Nomad Homes announced having raised $20 million in Series A funding. What makes this news interesting is the point of pain this new startup is supposed to solve. You see not every country has an MSL system to help individuals buy or sell homes. Nomad Homes wants to fill this void for markets with hundreds of millions of potential buyers and sellers. Yeah my thoughts exactly. Now let’s see if they can do it.

The Nomad Homes team with co-founders Daniel Piehler Helen Chen and Damien Drap (seated)

Nomad Homes founders Daniel Piehler Helen Chen and Damien Drap say they are creating a personalized real estate buying experience for Europe the Middle East and Africa a region worth $20 trillion in potential real estate transactions. And no I do not know why someone has not already thought of this. Here in Greece for instance my friends who are agents constantly quiz me as to how a multiple listings service can help them. Now Nomad which is headquartered in Dubai and Paris is not “just” plugging people into an MLS they claim they are really innovating. Pause take a breath.

Nomad Homes quizzes to match their criteria with properties that suit their needs and desires. Then the platform acts like a buy-side agent for negotiating prices doing the documentation and performing all the necessary functions for buyers. But read on.

The current funding is by 01 Advisors a fund co-founded by past Twitter execs Dick Costolo and Adam Bain along with The Spruce House Partnership Goodwater Capital HighSage Ventures Abstract Ventures Partech Class 5 Global Precursor Ventures and Alta Park Capital. TechCrunch quotes Dick Costolo managing partner of 01 Advisors:

“Nomad Homes has built an incredible platform that is shaping the future of real estate across EMEA. What the team is building is increasing market liquidity and simplifying the consumer experience. We have invested in similarly transformative companies in the U.S. and are excited to partner with these founders and the entire team as they expand.”

Shaping the future hmm. According to the news Nomad Homes is currently expanding operations to southern Europe and building out its teams in the United States and across Europe. I know my Greek real estate friends will be thrilled to hear this since the current home search process is something like archaeology or digging endlessly to find the right property. Here finding a legitimate price or listing is needle in the haystack work. I know because we are searching for a house sifting through agent sites that are not maintained properly. But wait until the end.

The Nomad Homes user interface on the Paris website - Note my language is En but the listing is in French

I signed up to the platform just so I could show you a few screens from the system. I chose Paris as my desired area of search and after my phone was verified the system started offering me choices based on the area and my budget. “No rocket science yet” I thought. So right away I found some major problems with the platform as it exists. First the system is suggesting properties based only on price area and size which makes the user experience only slightly better than using Google. Secondly even though my language selection on the platform is English the listings are in French. And since I avoided foreign languages in high school…. Well.

The current platform is amateurish in my opinion especially given the $24 million bucks already put into the startup. Users get a few images some basic data and almost no in depth description on the properties listed in the system. No maps pertinent locality information tax or other expense related material nothing but a connection to the pertinent real estate company associated with the properties. To be fair I switched to the Dubai website (which is another strange hiccup).

One of my Paris choices based on area price and square meters only - This is just old school listing mediocrity

The platform there is better with properties listed in traditional form on a map and in a matrix of browsing. Still the Nomad Homes platform development seems to be in its infancy. And they take another hit since the system appears to be WordPress but I could be wrong? Crappy images aside I did manage to find a huge apartment overlooking an empty Dubai marina for about $27000 a year (image above).

Nomad Homes could be successful even with this but it would require a massive database of listings and further filtering options. Even so this is not what is being advertised via TechCrunch and other media. In my professional opinion as a former PR and media executive whoever is doing the pitching for this new startup he or she has one heck of a lot of clout to get TC and other media to report sight unseen on such limited tech. Sorry it has to be said. I’ve pitched the reinvention of the wheel to TC authors and an “idea” in the making gets coverage? Come on guys $24 million smackers!

Before expanding to leverage trillions in real estate deals in the region I suggest the developers fix the glitches navigation interactivity data analysis and other key facets of the platform first. Any halfway decent tech guru can start scraping Europe listings and a small team can verify validity. What will make this a stunning new development will be the three founders doing what they say they are doing and leaving off the PR until the right time.

My takeaway: Can they do it? Of course but they need to get busy very busy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vcGVvcGxlLzIwMDU5LXRoZS1jaGFuZ2luZy13b3JsZC1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW1hcmtldGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The changing world of digital real estate marketing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.constructionweekonline.in/people/20059-the-changing-world-of-digital-real-estate-marketing on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbndlZWtvbmxpbmUuaW4vcGVvcGxlLzIwMDU5LXRoZS1jaGFuZ2luZy13b3JsZC1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW1hcmtldGluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Context: Hong Kong freezes domestic helper wages for second straight year

The minimum pay for Hong Kong’s 370000 domestic workers will remain unchanged for a second straight year. The government decision is partly blamed on the economic slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Late last month the government announced that the monthly rate would stay at HK$4630. But an allowance for workers who do not receive food from employers would rise by HK$52 to HK$1173. The higher allowance applies to contracts signed from October 1.

Hong Kong needs to do more to protect domestic helpers

In 1973 the government started the minimum wage scheme for foreign domestic workers and set the amount to HK$450 per month. It reviews the pay of helpers every year. Domestic helpers received a 2.4 per cent pay rise in 2019 and a 2.5 per cent increase the year before.

The last time authorities froze domestic worker salaries for two consecutive years was in 2009 and 2010 – this was during the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008. The biggest cut happened in 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak. At that time officials lowered the minimum monthly wage by HK$400 to HK$3270.

Now the city is experiencing a shortage of domestic helpers. Authorities suspended flights coming to Hong Kong from the Philippines in April and Indonesia in June because Covid-19 infections were surging in the two countries. The bans have been lifted but a number of entry restrictions remain.

The city’s pool of domestic workers fell from 400000 in 2019 to 370000 last year. The shortage has led to a bidding war among employers. Many households have struggled to find workers even after offering higher wages. HelperChoice is an online platform that connects helpers to employers. It found in a recent survey that the average salary of domestic workers had reached HK$5144 per month mainly because of the labour shortage.

News: Pay freeze draws criticism from both employers and domestic workers

Domestic workers have expressed disappointment that their minimum wage has not risen while employers say the government should have cut salaries instead.

Eman Villanueva a spokesman for the Asian Migrants’ Coordinating Body said the pay freeze was “unfair” and “insulting” and argued that helpers’ workloads had increased during the coronavirus pandemic.

“During the epidemic children stay more at home; parents also work from home – that means more work for their helpers ... They also have to go to the market to buy food more and do more cleaning.”

Don’t ignore Hong Kong’s racism

Meanwhile Betty Yung Ma Shan-yee chairwoman of the Hong Kong Employers of Domestic Helpers Association said some employers were expecting a minimum wage reduction for domestic helpers as many households faced financial hardships amid the pandemic.

“Families with slightly lower incomes or who rely on a single income source are feeling the pinch and won’t be able to afford hiring a helper to take care of their elderly family members or children” Yung added.

A government spokesman said the financial ability of households to afford a helper was the main reason for not changing the minimum salary.

“We have carefully considered Hong Kong’s general economic and labour market conditions over the past year as well as Hong Kong’s near-term economic outlook including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in this year’s review” the spokesman said.

Mahee Leclerc general manager of HelperChoice – an online platform which connects domestic workers to employers – said helpers faced their own increased financial pressure because of the pandemic.

“They face greater expenses and pressure to send more remittances back to their families because the economic situation is far worse back home” Leclerc said.

Children of asylum seekers struggle during Covid

When Villanueva came to Hong Kong as a domestic worker in 1991 the minimum wage was HK$3200 a month. Now 30 years later the level has only risen by HK$1430.

“We are not asking for special treatment ... just a living wage” he said. “It is the government’s fault that we are one of the lowest paid [workers] in Hong Kong.”

Issue: Shortage of domestic helpers sparks bidding war among employers

The severe shortage of foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong has sparked a bidding war with desperate employers offering to pay well above the minimum wage to secure a helper recruitment agents have said.

There are six potential employers for every domestic worker in Hong Kong and some are offering as much as HK$5500 to HK$6500 a month without success according to Anliza Hung an agent at Well Harmony Employment Services.

“There simply aren’t enough domestic helpers in Hong Kong” Hung said.

Domestic helpers are Hong Kong’s superheroes

“They’re almost all employed already leaving those households who want to hire a helper with no options but to offer higher wages or go through the complicated process of hiring from the Philippines and Indonesia.”

She said about 30 to 40 employers came to her company each month hoping to find helpers ready to start work but there were very few or none available now.

Only about a dozen employers each month are willing to have the agency recruit from the Philippines or Indonesia because that would mean paying more for flights and quarantine.

Hot topics: Hong Kong’s waste charging scheme

When hiring domestic workers from the Philippines or Indonesia employers need to pay at least HK$2000 in airline tickets plus HK$10080 for a 21-day compulsory quarantine at the government-run facility.

According to Hung an elderly couple in urgent need of a helper has been unable to hire one for months. The agency placed them on its priority list because the man in his 90s has dementia and his wife 87 has lower back pain. Both have chronic illnesses.

Recruitment agents said even when their clients were willing to pay more to bring in helpers the process was stalled by a severe shortage of accommodation at the two designated quarantine facilities – Penny’s Bay quarantine facility and Silka Tsuen Wan hotel.

Are domestic helpers treated fairly?

At Silka Tsuen Wan hotel a room costs HK$800 per night and all 409 rooms that opened for booking on August 28 were gone by the end of the day.

At the government-run Penny’s Bay quarantine facility 800 rooms were snapped up within minutes on September 14. When 200 extra quarantine rooms were made available last week they were taken up within minutes of bookings reopening leaving thousands of helpers still waiting to enter the city.

Discount chains such as Lidl or Dollar General have more flexibility to manage supply chain issues.

These stores stock fewer items and carry more own-brand goods.

This means fewer products to keep in stock and more flexibility to switch manufacturers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The global supply chain network is on its knees and retailers across the world are scrambling to keep shelves stocked as the busy holiday shopping season approaches.

Experts say that empty shelves and long delays are expected to be a guaranteed part of our winter shopping this year. However some stores namely the discount chains could be less vulnerable to pressures because of their unique business models.

The Aldis Lidls Dollar Generals Dollar Trees and to some extent the Costcos of the world stock a large amount of own-brand goods and have a limited number of product stock keeping units or SKUs in their stores. This approach reduces costs and streamlines supply chains.

At the core of the dollar store or discount grocery chain business model is keeping business costs as low as possible in order to keep prices down for the shopper. This means these stores have far fewer types of products on offer than you would find in your typical Walmart supercenter for example.

In normal times buying fewer products in bulk gives these stores greater bargaining power with suppliers but this setup also has its benefits during the ongoing supply chain crunch: these stores have a smaller assortment of items to worry about being in stock and most likely fewer suppliers to deal with something Lidl's UK and Ireland CEO flagged in a recent interview.

By not being a store of everything the discount chains have more flexibility to swap items in and out. Dollar General has been vocal about this advantage in recent earnings calls. As prices have risen over the past two quarters the retailer said it has had the flexibility to drop items that have been most impacted by inflation.

And just as shoppers don't mind if the assortment changes they also wouldn't be shocked to see bare shelves Dave Marcotte longtime retail and supply chain expert from Kantar Consulting said in a recent conversation with Insider.

""Shoppers don't go to dollar stores for an experience … They are not expecting to see full shelves and when they come in and see two to three meters of holes in the shelves it doesn't affect them"" he said adding: ""If they are out of what they're looking for that's ok too.""

Marcotte said that shoppers generally make dollar or discount stores their first port of call if the item they want is there and they can get it at a cheap price great. Shoppers depend on these stores for discounts rather than a large assortment.

Then there's the own-brand aspect. Discount chains stock large amounts of private-label goods as does Costco through its Kirkland range which gives them greater flexibility to switch manufacturers without the consumer noticing.

""Shoppers are not aware of who the real manufacturer is"" Marcotte said. ""The actual manufacturing behind it can be anything as long as the quality is there … they don't have the perception that they are being traded down.""

While private-label manufacturers are still subject to the same supply chain challenges the discount retailers have more flexibility to shop around by selling fewer national brands.

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

Have you heard about the recent poll that shows substantial percentages of both Donald Trump (52%) and Joe Biden (41%) voters think we’d be better off splitting into two countries?

Don’t worry about it.

Short of war a split presumably couldn’t happen without an act of Congress and as we know Congress doesn’t act. Members regularly tiptoe up to the edge of action but that’s just so they can send out fundraising letters predicting dire consequences if the other side isn’t stopped.

Splitting the nation into red and blue countries would be like a bitter divorce requiring compromise at every turn. Congress could never navigate those waters. But I have some suggestions on how it might approach some issues:

• National symbols: Who gets the bald eagle? This question alone could trigger years of bickering. The only logical solution would be to agree that both sides get an eagle. But in Red nation it would be clutching twin AR-15s while the Blue eagle’s talons would grasp vaccine syringes and some marijuana leaves.

• Music: Only one nation can have the “Star-Spangled Banner.” I’m thinking Blue gets the song because the opera singers concentrated in New York City are better at hitting the high notes on “land of the free.” Red which produces more amber waves of grain can have “America the Beautiful” provided it still calls itself America and remains beautiful after repealing all environmental legislation of the past 100 years.

More:Joe Blundo: The logic of the Ohio Redistricting Commission map is hard to swallow

• Money: We couldn’t keep the existing currency because it’s full of references to the old United States. But for practical reasons I think the two nations would have to agree to keep the current denominations — nickel dime dollar etc. — to protect such beloved institutions as Dollar General penny loafers and Dime-A-Dog Night.

• Border security: What happens when Blue northeastern snowbirds make their way to the border of Red Florida every fall? Should they be waved through the checkpoints out of compassion or denied entry because seeking asylum from snow flurries doesn’t qualify as a humanitarian concern?

We’d need comprehensive immigration reform. Good luck with that.

• Holidays: Would July 4 be supplanted by the birth date of the two new nations? What if the birth happens in say February. Could the rival states agree to still celebrate their independence in the summer to avoid devastating the swimsuit fireworks and charcoal briquet industries?

More:Joe Blundo: After 43 years it was high time to visit some of Ohio's travel destinations

• Sports: Fights already break out over sports rivalries. Imagine the conflicts sparked by international tension.

Would a Texan who roots for the San Francisco 49ers run the risk of being charged with treason? If Tom Brady of Red Tampa Bay deflates a football in Blue Seattle does he have diplomatic immunity?

The complications seem far too great for a divided government to handle. In that case let’s celebrate gridlock. It might be the very thing that keeps us united.

Smith Travels to Chernobyl,"Augmenting radiation training skills intended to help Mon Co.

Newsroom@DominionPost.com

Dr. Lee B. Smith spent five days in late June dosimeter in hand measuring radiation levels inside the former Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine and the surrounding area known as the Exclusion Zone.

Dressed in assigned white personal protective gear when inside the domed-off plant which experienced a catastrophic explosion meltdown and fire in 1986 that rained radiation at least as far away as Sweden and in blue PPE outside in and around the ghost city of Pripyat Smith continued his ongoing training in radiation detection and preparation that he uses for his job as Monongalia County Health Department’s executive director and county health officer.

“It’s still highly radioactive” said Smith of Chernobyl. “Radioactivity will go on for thousands of years.”

Working in conjunction with MCHD’s Threat Preparedness program Smith uses these skills locally such as by helping to monitor mass gatherings for individuals or groups that might attempt to set off a “dirty” bomb that contains radiological material.

“We were part of a 10-person team to train in taking measurements and performing drills while seeing effects of the explosion 35 years later” he said.

Smith was accompanied by his wife Dr. Vicki Everly an emergency physician at Mon Health Medical Center who prepared for the trip by undergoing training by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“My husband asked ‘Do you want to go to Chernobyl ?’ ” Everly said. “It’s not one of the top places I want to go but I said ‘Yeah I can do that.’”

Smith and Everly visited locations including a control room identical to one where an ill-advised test was conducted April 26 1986 and the sarcophagus that now covers the remaining structures to keep radiation from escaping.

The test triggered a chain reaction nuclear explosion and fire in Chernobyl’s No. 4 reactor.

When the accident took place responding firefighters had no idea how to effectively extinguish radioactive flames from the more than 200 tons of uranium that melted down the reactor. They also were not properly outfitted to do so. Many died within three months and others died later from radiation.

“Many of those guys had lethal doses of gamma radiation” Smith said. “It was reported to us that many of the helicopter pilots who dropped sand and boron on the site also received lethal doses of gamma radiation just from flying helicopters over the open reactor.”

Residents were not immediately alerted to the dangers of the nuclear accident and were not evacuated for three days.

The area will not be inhabitable for 30000 years and reaching the site required a daily train ride from Slavutych about

60 miles away and built for those involved in the clean-up Smith noted.

He was invited to participate on this trip by Technical Resources Group based in Idaho Falls Idaho which has been conducting this exercise for about 10 years.

“Because of the work Monongalia County Health Department does with radiation training and preparation we’ve been involved in a lot of education and drills” he said.

Also in 2015 the state Department of Health and Human Resources designated MCHD as the Northern West Virginia Radiation Response Team which includes maintaining a cache of equipment and trained personnel who can respond to radiation events.

“Since then we’ve put a lot of time and effort into getting our Threat Preparedness staff up to speed” he said.

That has meant sending staff members to Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education in Oak Ridge Tenn. Also Smith just completed Radiation Emergency Preparedness a yearlong training at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey Calif.

“That’s been an involved course” Smith said. “We got to meet in person for the class and there were subject matter experts from the federal government and from state governments and someone from Oak Ridge was there. There were people from all over the country that were accepted into this program and they were equally interested in what I had learned at Chernobyl.”

That included insight into what prompted the accident. “Reactor No. 4 had about 200 tons of uranium in it and it was a twin to reactor No. 3” Smith said. There were also twin reactors Nos. 1 and 2. “So there were huge amounts of radioactive materials there.”

At the time Ukraine was part of the United Soviet Socialist Republic and the Cold War that was about to end was still ongoing.

“The Soviets thought that the Americans were going to come and bomb them and they wanted to know if they could switch the electrical generator from nuclear power generating steam to turn the turbines to a diesel-fired generator” he said. “That’s why this whole thing happened.”

A series of errors occurred including postponement of the test until the middle of the night when a less experienced shift would be working and then by going ahead with the test even as indicators continued to emerge that should have stopped them from proceeding.

“Long story short they ended up trying to shut down a lot of energy created from radiation and start it back up again” Smith said. “But the reactor power went so low. In order to make it heat up they drained water from the cooling system which was another error that sealed their fate.”

Then control rods filled with boron to absorb neutrons were withdrawn to allow more radiation and heat. When radiation reached critical levels the safety control rods started to lower back down into the reactor. However the rods’ tips were made of graphite which absorbs radiation. The rods were burned and ruined jamming the safety rods from being further lowered. “It was a fait accompli. It went critical within seconds.”

Although it’s been more than 35 years since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster occurred it reentered public awareness and was introduced to a new generation in 2019 through both an acclaimed HBO miniseries “Chernobyl” and a bestselling book “Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster” by Adam Higginbotham.

As depicted in the series in the minutes following the explosion area residents gathered on a nearby bridge to watch the flames having no idea of the radioactive fallout that was swirling around the sky.

“Some of them ended up with thyroid cancer which can be treatable” Smith said. “Not everybody died quickly of acute radiation sickness.”

Unauthorized individuals are not supposed to visit Pripyat and the surrounding areas but natives known as stalkers steal into town.

“Some of the people who were evacuated came back thinking ‘It’s my homestead and I can live off the land’ ” he said. “But can you take the radiation? If you take a meter and hold it up to a tree it’s giving off large amounts of radiation in counts per second. Heavy metals follow gravity and wash into the soil where it is absorbed by plants.”

There are also adventure tourists who want to see the area for the coolness factor of visiting a forbidden place.

Smith recalled seeing a busload of sightseers disembark a bus. “And they have on T-shirts and flip-flops like they are on a picnic and the leader of the group lets them turn on their meters which make a big noise” he said. “But they didn’t have a clue what they were doing.”

On the other hand Smith felt very safe as his team was led by experienced professionals who have been conducting the tour twice a year for about a decade.

“It gives you a sense of reality that your meter is singing” he said. “To you it’s a real-world situation. But you are conscious of limiting your amount of exposure.”

They were in “harm’s way” for five days and were measured for radioactivity before and after. “At the end we had like 45 microsieverts which isn’t exceptional. It’s a really small cumulative dose like getting dental X-rays.”

Pripyat offered its own fascination as a city stopped in time. The group saw abandoned amusement rides such as a merry-go-round and Ferris wheel; circa-1986 televisions furniture and pianos on display at deserted shops; and a café with beautiful stained glass that served as a reminder of the city’s former status as a cultural center.

Also remaining in the area are dogs who survived in spite of a mass effort to eliminate all pets that might have been contaminated with radiation. One of the group’s guides runs a site called “Dogs of Chernobyl” that raises funds for communities affected by industrial accidents.

“He also sets up funds for people with various cancers to get them treatments that for them are not financially attainable” Smith said.

As seasoned world travelers Smith and Everly compared their experience to previous trips.

“It was one of the most rigorous things we’ve ever done maybe other than Machu Picchu” Smith said. “It was 95 degrees a day and when we were outside in Pripyat we wore wool polyester-blend pants big work boots and jackets while we walked about 10 miles each day.

“It wasn’t like you could sit down and put your backpack down because everything is contaminated.”

But it’s an experience that Everly will never forget. “It touches you to see this area that it is now kind of beautiful and all grown over and green and lush but it’s going to be radioactive for the next 30000 years. Nothing is going to be able to inhabit it safely.”

The collaboration comes after Domino's asked fans earlier this year if they would give a cheesy Vegemite pizza a try - to which the response was a resounding 'YES' through almost 30000 likes and 12000 comments.

Last week Italian-American chef Giovanni Fabiano - who has been spinning pizzas for more than 40 years - put Vegemite pizza on his menu at Rosa's Pizza in Brooklyn.

Domino's ANZ chief marketing officer Adam Ballesty said it's only fitting that we return Australia's favourite flavour to the heartland and ensure everyone can share in the 'joy of this perfect pairing'.

'It's great to see Americans enjoying what we here in Oz know to be true - that Vegemite can go on just about anything' he said.

'To this day we still receive messages from customers asking us to make this combination a reality and at Domino's… we always deliver.'

Vegemite marketing manager Jacqui Roth said the spread is not just limited to the breakfast table.

'Vegemite is being added to everything from stir fries to roast potatoes but you can't beat the classic cheese and Vegemite combo' she said.

And Aussies are going mad for it — with the post notching up more than 9500 comments and more than a thousand shares.

“You know your Aussie when you get excited for Vegemite pizza (non Australian’s wouldn’t understand)” wrote one fan on Facebook.

“Breakfast pizza!” wrote another.

While others compared it to similar Australian classics.

“This might beat the good ole Vegemite scroll.”

Amid the thousands of comments lauding the decision there were a few who didn’t agree.

One poster wrote “yuck” — but was quickly jumped on by the fans of the new flavour.

And there’s good news for those who are meat and dairy free there’s a vegan option on offer.

It’s not the first time the breakfast spread has been used in unlikely food combinations. Cadbury’s released Vegemite chocolate in 2015 while Smiths released Vegemite chips in 2017. It has also been added to Arnotts Shapes biscuits which are still available to buy now.

Our strategies to improve our employees’ wellbeing are comprehensive and include psychological safety 2 training recognition ongoing employee communications access to occupational health services employee resource groups (ERGs) mentoring and flexible work arrangements. Dow’s approach to Total Worker Health is part of Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goals one of the four components of the World-Leading Operations Goal.



Let’s look at some mental health services that Dow is offering in order to address mental health in the workplace.



Psychological safety program launched

In 2020 Dow’s Occupational Health team launched psychological safety training for leaders and employees. Among the goals of these sessions is to begin an honest discussion of the meaning and value of psychological safety and how leaders and co-workers can foster an environment in which we can all thrive. Sessions are interactive and include action steps which teams and individuals can take. A psychologically safe workplace begins with a feeling of belonging. It is a workplace where it feels safe to learn to share to challenge the status quo – an environment where our people will thrive and will make their best contributions.

Employee Resource Groups create community

In March 2020 nearly two-thirds of Dow’s workforce went virtual because of the pandemic. For many employees this was incredibly isolating. Dow’s 10 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) held virtual forums that dealt with topics such as hidden disabilities social injustice mental wellness resilience coping with stress home office ergonomics and more. The purpose of these sessions was to create a sense of community among a far-flung workforce suddenly separated and to welcome our new Dow employees hired during the pandemic. Some ERGs hosted leader-led townhalls for employees and community members where medical staff spoke about COVID-19. Other topics covered mental health awareness and flexible work arrangements.

Mental health resources

When it comes to mental health there are many things people can do themselves but there are a lot of initiatives an organization can – and should – take to best protect the mental well-being of employees. Some of our additional activities and resources to support our employees’ mental health include:

Dow’s Employee Assistance Program – available to every employee and his or her dependents in each country Dow is present.

A global healthy culture index with an annual assessment and site-based action planning.

Mental health parity in U.S. health care benefits.

Various leave options for stages of life or personal needs in addition to traditional holiday and vacation programs.

Global substance use policy.

Stress/resiliency and depression leader training.

Energy management and purpose programs.

A comprehensive summary of resources for employees and leaders to navigate mental health from staying strong to “it’s OK to not be OK” and managing mental health illness is available for many of the countries in which we operate.

We understand there is no one-size-fits-all approach to mental health. That’s why we are committed to providing an array of support for our people and evolve our mental health services as needed. We recognize that reducing mental stress and anxiety at work and cultivating a psychologically safe environment are critical to ultimately create a more positive work culture for all – helping us thrive and move forward both as individuals and as a company. It is a journey we embark on.

Eric Dow but instead she had to plan his funeral.

After three and a half years together Burns and Dow who was 50 years old were set to be married Oct. 19 but on Oct. 1 everything changed when Dow died of a suspected blood clot while recovering from COVID-19.

""When we were off work we were always together"" Burns said Friday. ""Everything — we did everything together.""

Dow a 26-year veteran of the Fayetteville Police Department was planning to retire in just 14 months Burns said.

She said much of their time in recent months was spent working on a home they bought in Myrtle Beach where they planned to move after his retirement.

""He'd just bought the house at the beach so we were constantly making it ours"" Burns said. ""He didn't like to paint too much I always painted the walls but he was always there working on whatever was beside me. If one of us was in the yard the other was in the yard. We were just together.""

Dow's younger brother Chuck and Burns both remember Dow as a kind person who strived to be a positive influence on everyone he met.

Chuck Dow said that one of the things that makes the death so difficult is that his brother had so many plans for his future after retirement.

""He was just at such a place in life where he had his entire next chapter in his life laid out"" Chuck Dow said by phone from Springfield Missouri. ""It's like a bad movie. It's awful.""

He recalled how he looked up to his brother and how Dow left a good impression on all who knew him.

According to Chuck the Dow family moved a lot as a military family and his older brother stayed in Fayetteville after graduating high school where he worked at the Fayetteville Police Department until his death.

""He was giving compassionate funny. I mean just so selfless"" Chuck Dow said. ""He served Fayetteville and was a staple in the community there for a long time and anybody who met him instantly just loved him. He was a ton of fun.""

According to Burns she knew her fiance was well-loved by his friends family and the community he served and that after his death the outpouring of love for him on social mediajust confirmed that belief.

""He would always say that he wanted to leave anyone he was with better than he found them"" she said. ""He just wanted to be a positive point in their day ... He was just so honorable and honest.""

Dow's goal to be a positive influence on all those around him extended to Burns' 19-year old son Colin who she said Dow loved as one of his own.

""He was very supportive of Colin and he just encouraged him and told him he could do anything"" Burns said. ""God (Colin) loved Eric."" .

Dow had two sons of his own Noah 16 and Ian11.

According to Chuck his brother loved Myrtle Beach and some of Dow's fondest memories were of spending time with family there.

Burns said Dow was in the Hospital with COVID-19 for several days but had been out of the hospital and recovering for about a week before his death.

""He seemed to have overcome those issues"" she said.

While he wasn't vaccinated Dow was otherwise ""extremely"" healthy and exercised at least four times a week Burns said.

She said that while she is still not sure exactly what caused her fiance's death she thinks it was possibly a blood clot and she is almost positive that it was related to COVID-19.

On the day of his death Dow was set to get fitted for his suit for the wedding. .

He was excited to be able to get out of the house after being sick and had made plans to go to the tailors with Burn's mother while Burns worked she said.

""He hated being in dark rooms he always wanted to be able to see the sun. He said it drove him crazy not to be able to see the sun he loved being outside"" Burns said.

About 10 a.m. on Oct. 1 Burns' mother arrived at Dow's house to pick him up and found him dead.

Burns said the last conversation she had with her fiance was that morning before she left for work.

""He said 'I don't know what I would do without you'"" Burns recalled ""and I told him he'll never have to know.'""

As stocks soar to historical highs some experts say conditions ripe for correction

The stock market has been a roller coaster ride in recent weeks with wild swings from day to day at times.

The major indices have also hit record after record this year as the as the economy roared back from pandemic lows and the government flooded the economy with stimulus cash.

The S &P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices for instance closed at record-highs last month besting highs that were only just set earlier in the year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large company stocks closed at a record-high a month prior. Despite a pandemic-battered economy the S &P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are both up approximately 30% compared to the same period a year ago and the Dow is up more than 20%.

The trends have left some experts wondering whether the ground underlying the rapid growth of the market fueled in part by a new crop of retail investors is solid or if there is a bubble building.

Risks abound from the debt ceiling crisis to inflation fears and even China's Evergrande saga which have led to daily swings.

But even as markets have fallen on news the newfangled hashtags like #BuyTheDip (which encourages market participants to buy rather than sell during these down periods) and #DiamondHands (encouraging investors to hold onto assets rather than sell) often trend on Twitter in tandem with the fear-ridden headlines. Even the Fed has warned of vulnerabilities associated with the ""increased risk appetite"" demonstrated by retail investor exuberance seen in the ""'meme stock' episode.""

While the pandemic's abrupt disruption to American life is another reminder that it's impossible to predict the future historical patterns and the precariousness of present market conditions have some economists warning that current growth rates may be unsustainable especially amid inflation worries and potential tightening by the Fed of monetary policy.

Here's what we know and don't about the market landscape:

Key overvaluation indicator at highest level since the Dotcom bubble

One measure often used by economists to predict a potential asset price bubble is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio developed by economist and Yale University professor Robert Shiller. The measure looks at firms' inflation-adjusted real earnings per share over a 10-year period to indicate possible over- or under-valuations.

Itay Goldstein a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business told ABC News that the measure is essentially used as ""an indication for whether the stock price is too high or not.""

When Shiller first published his research in 2000 he pointed to how high stock prices were at that point relative to the fundamentals that should underly their prices. His book ""Irrational Exuberance"" appeared in March 2000 highlighting how psychological factors can produce speculative bubbles and as it appeared the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite index began a 78% drop and the broader U.S. stock market took a 64% fall.

Presently the CAPE Ratio hovers at around 37 its highest level since the 2000-2002 Dotcom crash -- higher now than the 30 it reached before the Black Tuesday crash in October 1929 that triggered the Great Depression. The historical mean is 16.8.

There have been criticisms of CAPE. Jeremy Siegel a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business has argued in research that changes in accounting standards cause the earnings data to be biased downwards and thus the CAPE to be biased upwards. Others noted that the CAPE uses past earnings but what investors are interested in is future earnings.

""You basically see that it's now still in historically high levels"" Goldstein said of the CAPE Ratio. ""If you go back in history it was higher than that only around 2000 before the big crash of the Dotcom bubble it wasn't even at that high a level in 2008 before the big financial crisis."" In May 2008 before stocks started falling the CAPE was 23.70.

""It's been high for a long time and there was this crash last year when COVID started and then it climbed back up very quickly and continued to climb since then"" he added. ""It's hard to predict what will happen but certainly it could be that the level is too high and there could be some correction.""

Fears of overvaluation are not new especially in the tech sector where the value of certain traditional fundamentals or research and development may be harder to quantify. Many tech companies are not earning profits now but people are investing based on the hope that they will earn in the future. A measure such as CAPE that uses past earnings will not be useful for evaluating these companies.

Tech sector and risk appetite

Many market watchers for example have been ringing alarm bells surrounding the sky-high growth of Tesla stock in recent years -- arguing that its value does not align with its production output and fundamentals. On paper the argument seems valid: Tesla's market cap some $775 billion is larger than the next five largest automakers combined.

Yet some with so-called #DiamondHands who have been able to ignore this have seen themselves become ""Teslanairres"" in recent years as the electric vehicle maker's stock value continues to climb.

Tesla aside overvaluation estimates for the stock market as a whole is ""speculative"" Goldstein said.

""People can tell sort of an economic story that will justify -- my overall feeling is that it's too high and it's hard to justify that based on fundamentals"" Goldstein said referring to the market as a whole.

While he stresses it is ultimately difficult to know for sure whether stock prices are creeping towards a bubble Goldstein said that ""The indicators that we see I think give us some reason to be worried that stock prices might be too high.""

The Federal Reserve also warned off rising asset prices being vulnerable to ""significant declines should risk appetite fall"" in its semi-annual Financial Stability Report released in May noting that ""prices are high compared with expected cash flows.""

Fed Governor Lael Brainard pinned increased appetite for risk and rising valuations in part on retail investors referencing ""the 'meme stock' episode"" in a statement accompanying the report.

""Valuations across a range of asset classes have continued to rise from levels that were already elevated late last year. Equity indices are setting new highs equity prices relative to forecasts of earnings are near the top of their historical distribution and the appetite for risk has increased broadly as the ‘meme stock’ episode demonstrated"" Brainard said.

The increased appetite for risk has also been seen in the bond market Brainard added. ""The combination of stretched valuations with very high levels of corporate indebtedness bear watching because of the potential to amplify the effects of a re-pricing event"" he said.

Unique market conditions and inflation woes

When COVID-19 upended the economy in the spring of 2020 unemployment levels in the U.S. reached highs not seen since the Great Depression as lockdown orders forced businesses to shutter. In the midst of the crisis the stock market fell sharply in March (when it had been at record highs) -- but then rallied back to reach new highs within months.

Much of the pandemic stock markets gains can be pinned in part to aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic some economists say. The Fed pulled out all of the stops slashing the target for overnight interest rates to almost zero buying massive amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities encouraging bank lending and taking other steps to sustain the flow of credit.

""What the Fed has done is it reacted to a public health crisis"" Philip Schnaebl a professor in finance and asset management at New York University’s Stern School of Business told ABC News.

""Now the economy looks much stronger obviously there's still risks with [the] delta [variant] and what's happening in emerging markets and so on"" Schnaebl who is also a research associate in corporate finance at the National Bureau of Economic Research added ""But employment growth has been pretty strong it looks like the public health crisis is not as severe as it used to be.""

If the Fed starts tapering its purchases of securities -- which it signaled after its Sept. 22 meeting that it would likely start doing soon -- and when it looks to start raising interest rates many economists are bracing for what this could mean for the stock market. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month starting in March 2020. Tapering means the Fed would slow its purchase of these assets.

Ending these pandemic-era policies would ""lead to slow deflation of stock prices"" Schnaebl said.

The Fed said it found concerns that a change in monetary policy especially if the economic outlook hasn't improved could lead to a ""correction for risky assets"" according to the investors  academics and more it surveyed as part of its market intelligence gathering for its Financial Stability report.

""Contacts observed that valuations of many assets have derived significant support from low discount rates and therefore may be susceptible to a spike in yields especially if unaccompanied by an improvement in the economic outlook"" the report said.

Overall Schnaebl said he thinks the Fed has its ""eye on the ball"" and will be able to respond to stock market dangers that could spill over into the economy as a whole.

One possible wrench in the Fed's machine however would be if inflation takes hold and the central bank could no longer implement expansionary policy. Data from the consumer price index has stoked inflation fears though the Fed has largely said that it should be temporary due to labor and supply chains issues as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 shock.

Historically the stock market has served Main Street in the long run

Retail investors have pumped billions into the stock market in 2021 with some economists linking this to the rise of investing apps and pandemic stimulus funds that were distributed at the height of stay-at-home orders.

Ultimately Stern's Schnaebl says it is hard to tell until after the fact if stocks are overvalued and a crash looms.

""There can be a lot of volatility in the short run that's why the stock market is risky"" he said.

""I'm less concerned about the stock market just on its own sort of falling"" he added. ""I'm concerned about the health crisis and if that worsens I think it would show up in the stock market.""

A sudden drop in stock prices ""would be bad not necessarily because the stock market crashed but probably because something else happened which made the stock market crash and that's not good news for the economy.""

While price corrections can be scary for investors they can also be viewed as a part of how equity markets work when prices adjust to reflect longer-term values.

Goldstein notes that asset ""prices are just high they are high across the board across multiple assets."" He sees a ""significant likelihood"" that stock prices will fall. The trigger for this could be monetary policy tightening news coming out of China like Evergrande's threat to destabilize the international financial system or some other factor.

""People are looking for where to put to put their money and make a decent return"" Goldstein said of the new excitement in the stock market. ""With all this in place I think you have a combination of factors that contribute to high prices and there could be a trigger that could come from different places that will eventually start the drop.""

Even if economic outlooks in the labor market and beyond are positive outside of stock prices Goldstein notes a sudden drop would impact the real economy as firms ""become more cautious"" by spending and investing less.

Many major Wall Street players are feeling the uncertainty. Over three-quarters of respondents to a CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey say now is the time to be very conservative in the stock market when asked what kind of market risk they are willing to accept for themselves and their clients. Respondents include some 400 chief investment officers equity strategists portfolio managers and contributors to the financial news outlet.

Schnaebl noted that if a drop were to happen ""The question is why does it happen and usually these things don't come out of the blue.""

""I tend to think of the stock market in many ways is a reflection of what's going on in the economy rather than this is independent entity which is driving other things"" he added noting that if the a drop were sparked by the worsening of the virus it would be a blow to the economy as a whole that's reflected in the stock market versus not the other way around.

Still the stock market has historically been a useful vehicle for those with #DiamondHands looking to save over the long term.

""For investors -- especially people saving for retirement and thinking about where to put their money so they can have a safer time in 10 to 30 years from now -- historically the stock market has been a good place"" Schnaebl said.

""My advice to everyday investors would be two things: first of all diversify"" Schnaebl said ""And second of all invest for the long run.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wOS9jYXJzL3Rlc2xhLWZzZC1sZWdhbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gE3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMC8wOS9jYXJzL3Rlc2xhLWZzZC1sZWdhbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Tesla can sell 'full self-driving' software that doesn't really drive itself,"Washington DC CNN —

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company will roll out the latest beta version of its “full self-driving” software to 1000 owners this weekend.

Yet there aren’t actually any self-driving cars for sale today according to autonomous vehicle experts and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which regulates cars. Tesla’s “full self-driving” is more like an enhanced cruise control they say.

Videos posted on the internet by people who already have the feature unlocked show that it might stop for traffic lights and turn smoothly at intersections but it also might veer toward pedestrians or confuse the moon for a traffic signal.

Tesla says that a human driver needs to be watching and ready to take over at any moment and the company is only allowing initial access to the system to the people it considers the safest drivers.

Despite those limits Tesla is free to call its technology “full self-driving.” Tesla owners who download the “full self-driving” beta must check a box confirming that they understand they are responsible for remaining alert with their hands on the wheel and must be prepared to take action at any time. “Full self-driving” does not make their car autonomous it says.

A person buying a Tesla vehicle on its website sees the technology described in big bold letters as “full self-driving” but the fine print below that says the technology is a driver-assist technology. Driver-assist technologies are intended to help a human drive more safely with features such as forward collision warning blind spot warning and lane departure warning systems.

“The problem is that Tesla has one foot on both sides” said Bryan Reimer a scientist at the MIT AGELab whose research has looked at driver attention with Tesla’s features.

The US government has no performance standards for automated driver-assist technologies Reimer said. Tesla or any automaker can essentially do whatever they want when it comes to these technologies.

“We’re at mercy of the auto manufacturers to put in safe systems. We are reliant on drivers wanting to be risk adverse” Cathy Chase president of the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety told CNN Business. “The combination of those two is a perfect storm for future disasters.”

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.

There are signs that the NHTSA is moving toward regulating driver-assist technologies but how fast that might happen remains to be seen. It can take years to complete a rulemaking process and sometimes an administration may halt a process a previous administration started. NHTSA’s agenda earlier this year called for proposing a rule that would set performance standards for automatic emergency braking as well as specifying a test to determine if automakers comply.

NHTSA launched an investigation this summer into Teslas rear-ending emergency vehicles while using Autopilot. Chase said she’s concerned that the Tesla technology may play a role in other types of crashes we aren’t yet aware of.

Autonomous driving experts have long cautioned that Tesla’s description of “full self-driving” and its more rudimentary predecessor Autopilot may lead to drivers putting too much trust in the technology. Tesla drivers have already died in high-profile crashes using Autopilot drawing rebukes from the National Transportation Safety Board.

US Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla and take enforcement action because Tesla’s marketing overstates its vehicles’ abilities they say.

“When drivers’ expectations exceed their vehicle’s capabilities serious and fatal accidents can and do result” they wrote.

The Federal Trade Commission which is tasked with protecting consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices declined to tell CNN Business why it has not taken any action against Tesla. The FTC also said it does not comment on whether it has any open investigations a spokesperson said.

Picking the wrong technology

NHTSA and Congress which can push the agency to regulate specific things missed an opportunity to focus on driver-assist technologies in recent years according to autonomous driving and law experts.

Rather than regulate driver-assist they focused on self-driving vehicles the types of cars that wouldn’t need steering wheels or pedals. The US House of Representatives passed a law related to self-driving cars in 2017. NHTSA has released several versions of guidance for fully autonomous vehicles.

“It’s jumping ahead many many steps while we’re not addressing what could be saving lives right now” Chase said.

The decision to focus on the revolutionary technology followed years of hype from self-driving companies. Some of the biggest names in the industry said the technology was only years way. But self-driving software has proven incredibly difficult and companies have failed to hit predictions. Only Waymo offers a self-driving robotaxi service and it’s in a limited portion of the greater Phoenix area. On rainy days Waymo’s vehicles require a human behind the wheel.

Bryant Walker Smith a professor at the University of South Carolina law school said that European regulators are far ahead of the United States on regulating driver-assist technologies. Smith said that technologies like pedestrian detection and automatic braking are sensible to mandate on new cars and there should be performance standards for them.

“There’s low-hanging fruit” Smith said. “We could save lives far earlier than we have self-driving cars.”"

While it is likely consumers in Northern Michigan will pay more to heat their homes this winter officials with two large natural gas utilities in the state said several factors will keep that increase minimal.

Since propane is produced from liquid components recovered during natural gas processing a spillover from the jump in natural gas prices will help push propane higher this winter as well said two distributors in Northern Michigan.

Natural gas

Due to the interconnectedness of the world rising costs overseas do have an impact on U.S. natural gas price projections said Dan Brudzynski vice president for gas sales and supply with DTE Energy.

""Gas price projections for this winter have risen from previous forecasts and natural gas prices have doubled in a year"" he said.

""However our customers will not be impacted by this dramatic increase because DTE purchased approximately 90% of the needed volumes prior to the recent increases in natural gas prices. Supply issues will likely affect natural gas costs in the 2022/2023 winter season and possibly beyond"" Brudzynski added.

Prices have been at unprecedented highs in Europe and Asia competing for liquified natural gas (LNG) exports from countries like the U.S. noted Brudzynski.

""Prices are being driven higher in the U.S. because we are exporting natural gas out of the country to provide for the shortage and production has not yet increased by the same amount"" he added.

Michigan’s geological formations offer some of the best natural gas underground storage in the country allowing DTE to store the natural gas until it’s needed said Brudzynski.

""For the upcoming winter our storage levels are very near 100% so we expect the commodity cost of gas to our customers to be stable."" he added.

Meanwhile Brian Wheeler a spokesman for Consumers Energy which has 1.8 million customers in the state said customers will likely experience some price increase for natural gas but will be largely shielded from the current uncertainty and volatility of the market.

""That’s because our vast storage system allows us to buy large amounts of natural gas when it’s cheapest and pass those savings along to customers during the winter when demand is highest. That means we’ve already secured gas for heating this winter at lower rates to help keep heating bills affordable"" said Wheeler.

Consumers' stored gas is within the state and readily available.

""On average gas storage assets have supplied approximately 50% of the natural gas we provide to customers during winter and can provide up to approximately 80% on peak days if needed. We purchase the remainder on an as-needed basis meaning our customers may experience some impact from current market pricing. We only charge our customers for the actual cost of the gas used"" said Wheeler.

Wheeler said the average Consumers household will pay about $2.16 a day for natural gas in 2021.

""Our customers pay less for natural gas than the national average. Households’ average overall bills in 2021 were 21% less than in 2011. Over the last 12 months the price that Consumers Energy residential customers paid for natural gas was 21% less than the national average"" Wheeler said.

Propane

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration high demand and low supply globally are contributing to the increase in U.S. propane spot prices. At one point last year propane spot prices averaged just above 20 cents per gallon. At the end of September it was averaging about $1.33 per gallon.

Natural gas prices have been on fire lately because inventory overseas is in short supply.

""Since about 80% of the propane produced comes from natural gas chances are low that propane prices for the near future will fall"" said Tom Van Stedum of the Ellsworth Farmers Exchange which provides propane to customers in several Northern Michigan counties.

Van Stedum said propane has become a world commodity and every country uses it for heating and petrochemicals so that helps to keep the price high.

""There is a fair amount of inventory for Michigan but there was a fire at a fractionator in western Canada that supplies Line 5 with propane that could have a large impact for the Upper and Lower Peninsula. (It is ) unknown to what extent that fire had on that fractionator"" said Van Stedum.

As to how much propane customers in Northern Michigan will pay this winter much depends on the duration and coldness of the winter and how much propane will be needed by farmers for grain drying Van Stedum said.

TJ Lancaster who operates Alpine Propane in Gaylord said when one energy commodity moves up in price they all tend to follow in the same direction.

One of the biggest reasons why propane prices are heading higher is because of exports noted Lancaster.

""When they ship a tanker of propane (overseas) they are taking 17 million gallons of propane per ship"" he said.

Exports are helping to deplete U.S. inventories according to Lancaster.

""Summer is when we typically build supplies for the upcoming winter"" said Lancaster. ""This year we didn't build as much because of the exports. Now we are coming into this winter and we are 28% behind what we had in U.S. propane inventories last year.""

Like Van Stedum Lancaster said the length and severity of the winter — along with farmer demand for crop drying — will determine if supplies will be adequate.

Lancaster is encouraging homeowners to make sure their tanks are filled now and to avoid emergency fill-ups which could be expensive this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlcnNldGlja2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YWxsZWQtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXByb2plY3RzLXNlZS1uZXctc2lnbnMtb2YtbGlmZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stalled Construction Projects See New Signs Of Life,"Will long-stalled hotel developments in East Bay Charter Township ever move forward? Why did Milliken Street shut down for road work this week after construction already closed the street several days this summer? What’s the plan for the parking lot at West End Beach which has become a seemingly permanent home to multiple barriers and orange barrels? These are just a few of the construction-related question marks in and around Traverse City at the moment. The Ticker tracks down the answers.

East Bay Hotels

In March 2018 The Ticker broke the news that a pair of developers were planning to build a trio of new hotels along US-31 in East Bay Township. Two of the hotels as well as a brand-new restaurant/retail space were planned for the old site of Pebble Brook Adventure Park the other for a parcel farther west between the Hampton Inn and the Keith J. Charters Traverse City State Park Campground.

More than three-and-a-half years later both lots are vacant but some action at one of the sites could come next spring. According to Claire Karner East Bay Township’s director of planning and zoning the Ann Arbor-based developer of the project next to Hopscotch contacted the township this week to restart conversations about the development.

“Their site plan expired” Karner says of the developer – formerly known as Stellar Hospitality now called Premier Hospitality. “So we emailed them and told them ‘You need to come back to the township if you want to move forward with this development.’ We actually didn't hear from them until [Wednesday] but they got in touch with us and said that they wanted to reapply for site plan review.”

That exchange ends a lengthy radio silence between East Bay Township and Premier Hospitality. In past conversations with The Ticker Karner had indicated that no one at the township was sure where things stood with the project.

Less than 24 hours after touching base with Karner The Ticker received a message from Premier Hospitality Vice President Jonathan Azer offering an update. Azer says the plans for the development are still largely the same as in March 2018. One hotel will be a Residence Inn by Marriott with six stories and 123 rooms; the other will be a Staybridge Suites by IHG with six stories and 122 rooms. The property will also include an 8692-square-foot restaurant/retail space with five units including one with a drive-thru.

“We were ready to break ground and financing was available” Azer says of the development. “Then COVID hit. Obviously the hospitality industry suffered greatly. We kept our hotels open but it was very very hard to stay alive. And we did survive but the financing landscape was just not available [to start new projects] and it still is a little tough. But things are opening up business is picking up – slowly but surely – and there's some markets that have just done phenomenal business. I really think Traverse City is one of them.”

Premier Hospitality is now “planning for shovels to hit the ground early spring of 2022.” Azer expects the full project will take about 24 months to complete but says the work will be phased so that one hotel can be finished and opened before construction proceeds on the other.

Premier Hospitality currently has hotels or upcoming developments in Ann Arbor Grand Rapids Lansing and Okemos. This project will mark the company’s first foray into Traverse City.

As for the property between Hampton Inn and the State Park plans for a hotel there fizzled after the developer behind the project passed away. The property has been listed for sale with a price tag of $3.5 million since October 2020. Karner says the township has “spoken with some developers some potential applicants” that have eyed the property for potential projects “but we haven’t gotten anything formal submitted to the township.”

Karner does confirm that things are moving forward for a fourth hotel project in the township: The 92-unit Avid hotel planned for the former Wendy’s property on US-31. “That project was approved by a site plan review by the planning commission” she says.

Milliken Avenue Closure

In August Milliken Street was closed for four days while contractors for DTE Energy worked to replace outdated gas lines in the area. While the road reopened after the initial closure of August 9-12 the work was visibly incomplete. Work recommenced on the project this week with the road once again closed to both lanes of traffic near the Eastern Avenue intersection.

According to John McWethy public services assistant for the City of Traverse City the work is once again “being completed by a contractor working for DTE” and is the completion of the same project that shut the road down in August.

“The work started earlier this summer and came to a halt because they could not get the appropriate materials for completion” McWethy says. “I was notified by the contractor that they intend to have the road open back up by October 22.”

West End Beach

Erosion at West End Beach a product of high water levels in Grand Traverse Bay over the past several years has caused parts of the beach’s parking lot to crumble. While the city has placed multiple barriers and orange barrels in the lot though – eliminating some parking spots and cautioning visitors about the unstable pavement – some locals have wondered what the long-term plan for the city park might be.

According to Mitchell Treadwell a member of the City of Traverse City Parks and Recreation Commission the commission’s discussions about the crumbling West End Beach parking lot date back to August 2019.

“At that time it was decided that the installation of limestone boulders would be an appropriate temporary solution to slow or halt the rate of further erosion” Treadwell says. “Since then no additional parking spaces have been lost. However West End Beach is one of the parks slated for renovations and improvements through voter-approved allocations from the Brown Bridge Trust Fund. While those improvements primarily focus on replacing – and potentially relocating – the bathroom building other aspects of the park including the parking lot and access drive could be reconfigured as well. As such there are no plans to rebuild the parking lot in its current layout in the near future especially since there is ample parking at a city park right across Grandview Parkway.”

Treadwell says “proposed redesigns” of the parking lot would likely reduce the parking area anyway. The redesigned parking would be mostly “handicapped-designated or temporary pull-through spots” with the city encouraging most users of the beach to park across the street instead. The thought Treadwell notes is that turning the parking lot into more of a drop-off zone could help make the park “more resilient against future high water levels.”

“Even at 'full capacity’ West End Beach only had 25 parking spaces which is inadequate for as many people as use that park through much of the summer” Treadwell tells The Ticker.

Green Mitt

One local construction project that will be crossing the finish line soon? The new Green Mitt car wash on US-31 in East Bay Township. The business has announced that it will host its public grand opening on October 25 and that it will be giving away free car washes the week of October 25-29. Hours of operation will be 7am to 9pm seven days a week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXVkaW9pbmtyYWRpby5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9ndW5zLW4tcm9zZXMtbmV3LXJlbGVhc2UtYXhsLXJvc2Utc2xhc2gtZHVmZi1tY2thZ2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guns N' Roses Prepping First Release Featuring Axl Rose Slash and Duff McKagan in 28 Years,"2021-10-09



Guns N’ Roses will release their “Hard Skool” EP in February 2022 marking their first release featuring Axl Rose Slash and Duff McKagan in 28 years

Against all odds Axl Rose Slash and Duff McKagan famously reunited back in 2016 for Guns N’ Roses’ Not In This Lifetime World Tour bringing together the band’s classic “Appetite for Destruction” lineup. Now band members are slated to release their first official recording back together.

Guns N’ Roses have announced their new four-song “Hard Skool” EP out Feb. 25. The album is the group’s first new release bringing together Axl Rose Slash and Duff McKagan together in a whopping 28 years.

In a first-of-its-kind victory for the right-to-repair movement Microsoft has agreed to take concrete steps to facilitate the independent repair of its devices following pressure from its shareholders.

On Monday Microsoft and the investor advocacy nonprofit As You Sow reached an agreement concerning a shareholder resolution As You Sow filed in June urging the tech company to analyze the “environmental and social benefits” of making device repair easier. After months of negotiations Microsoft has agreed to comply—and then some. Not only will the company study how increasing access to the parts and information needed for repair can reduce its contributions to climate change and electronic waste it has also agreed to act on the findings of that study by the end of next year.

This is the first time a US. manufacturer has agreed to change its repair policies following investor pressure. But it might not be the last: In September Green Century a mutual fund company focused on environmentally responsible investing filed two similar right-to-repair resolutions one with Apple and another with Deere & Co. the agricultural equipment manufacturer best known for the John Deere tractor.

Collectively these resolutions represent a new front in the right-to-repair fight one that explicitly links corporate environmental responsibility to repair policies. The battle is being led by shareholder organizations that have had success pressing companies for greater transparency on climate change. For instance As You Sow has previously convinced the major utility Duke Energy to disclose the methane emissions associated with its natural gas infrastructure and pressed Twitter to report its carbon footprint.

When consumers are unable to fix their devices quickly and cheaply they’re more likely to buy new ones and that has consequences for the planet.

“We’ve seen shareholder resolutions become a significant tool for climate activists” Kerry Sheehan the U.S. policy director at the repair guide site iFixit told Grist. “We’re seeing it get adopted in the repair context as well in part because these are very connected.”

When consumers are unable to fix their devices quickly and cheaply they’re more likely to buy new ones and that has consequences for the planet. A significant fraction of the carbon emissions associated with the devices we own—81 percent in the case of Apple’s new iPhone 13—occur during manufacturing. Replacing our stuff before we need to causes those emissions as well as the pollution natural resource use and land degradation associated with extracting and refining raw materials to multiply. In the case of consumer electronics it also leads to more toxic e-waste.

Despite the environmental benefits of using our stuff as long as possible companies like Microsoft Apple and Deere make extended use difficult by restricting access to parts manuals and software tools needed for repair and by designing products that aren’t easy to fix. These corporations also have a history of lobbying against bills that would make independent repair more accessible.

Kelly McBee the waste program coordinator at As You Sow started intensively exploring the issue of electronic waste several years ago. After learning that Microsoft was actively contributing to the crisis through its restrictive repair policies she reached out to the company to have a “good faith conversation” in May. It didn’t go well.

“The company presented a very antagonistic view of repair” McBee said adding that Microsoft’s legal counsel told her they didn’t see “any connection between improved sustainability and repairability.”

But after As You Sow filed its shareholder resolution in June which garnered media attention and raised awareness among Microsoft’s investors McBee says the company’s attitude shifted dramatically.

“Microsoft came back with different legal counsel and representatives on the line and said ‘We are really changing our tune on this issue we think this study is a great idea let’s work together to make this change’” McBee said. “Which is night and day.”

As You Sow has now agreed to withdraw its resolution with the company.* In exchange McBee says Microsoft has agreed to hire an independent consultant to study the benefits of increasing consumer access to parts and repair documentation including impacts on carbon emissions and waste. While the study will not be made public due to concerns over proprietary information Microsoft is required to publicly post a summary of its findings by the beginning of May 2022.

iFixit will be “closely watching” to see how Microsoft follows through and whether it changes its tune on right-to-repair legislation.

Based on those findings Microsoft has also agreed to make new parts and documentation available beyond its authorized repair network by the end of 2022. It has also agreed to launch new as-yet-unknown initiatives to facilitate local repair according to McBee.

Sheehan called the agreement between As You Sow and Microsoft a “step in the right direction” adding that iFixit will be “closely watching” to see how Microsoft follows through and whether it changes its tune on right-to-repair legislation. Nathan Proctor who heads the right-to-repair campaign at the nonprofit U.S. Public Research Interest Group noted that Microsoft is still a member of lobbying groups that oppose right-to-repair bills like the Entertainment Software Association.

“We really appreciate what they’re doing for this report but if they show up to kill right-to-repair bills there’s still more work to be done” Proctor said.

In response to questions about the agreement a Microsoft spokesperson told Grist that Microsoft is committed to meeting consumers’ needs and desires including device repairability. “We believe customers are entitled to repair options that are safe and reliable” the spokesperson said in an email. “We currently provide customers with repair services that ensure the high quality of repairs safeguard customers’ privacy and security and protect customers from injury.”

“As You Sow asked us to investigate the connections between our sustainability commitments and device repairability” the Microsoft spokesperson added. “It was a productive discussion and we have agreed to undertake that important study the results of which will be used to guide our product design and plans for expanding device repair options for our customers.”

McBee says she’s “very happy” with the agreement adding that she “hopes it has sway” on the Green Century resolutions currently before Apple and Deere. Like As You Sow’s resolution those proposals ask the two companies to evaluate the benefits of making tools and information needed for repair more accessible to consumers.

Green Century shareholder advocate Annalisa Tarizzo told Grist that over the past year the investment company has “grown concerned” that Apple and Deere’s antagonistic stances toward independent repair were harming the companies’ reputations and exposing them to regulatory risk. Many state legislatures are actively considering bills that codify the right to repair and in July the Federal Trade Commision or FTC vowed to “ramp up law enforcement” against illegal repair restrictions.

Apple has “very ambitious climate goals but that anti-repair stance really does not align with what they are presenting to the public.”

Apple has “very ambitious climate goals but that anti-repair stance really does not align with what they are presenting to the public” Tarizzo said. “And given Deere’s positioning in the market we were concerned that they could face some lawsuits.” Deere which has captured more than half of the agricultural equipment market in the U.S. doesn’t allow farmers to access diagnostic software needed to fix their tractors a policy that costs farmers money by forcing them to wait for a dealer to repair their equipment.

Apple and Deere didn’t respond to requests for comment on the shareholder resolutions filed by Green Century and Tarizzo couldn‘t offer details on the investment firm’s conversations with the companies. But she hopes that both “agree to make some substantial changes in their policies” in the coming months in which case Green Century will withdraw its resolutions before their respective shareholder meetings.

Otherwise the resolutions may be put to a vote at the companies’ annual shareholder meetings in early 2022. While shareholder resolutions are legally nonbinding Tarizzo says that typically when more than a third of corporate shareholders vote in favor of one “it sends a pretty strong signal to the company that they should probably address whatever issue the company voted on.” As the Microsoft resolution demonstrates even the prospect of such a vote can compel a company to take action.

These shareholder resolutions come as the grassroots right-to-repair movement continues to garner support from high places. In May the FTC came out strongly in favor of independent repair when it released a report that found “scant evidence” to justify manufacturer-imposed restrictions. In July President Biden issued an executive order asking the FTC to craft new rules that would address “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair.” Support for independent repair is also growing among lawmakers: A record 27 states have considered right-to-repair bills this year and in June a US representative from New York introduced the first-ever national right-to-repair bill targeting everything from computers to tractors.

Sheehan of iFixit sees shareholder activism as “part and parcel” of the right-to-repair movement’s expanding reach. Even if some of these resolutions fail to garner investor support or the companies being targeted don’t take aggressive enough action Sheehan believes that all manufacturers are “going to have to reckon with right to repair eventually.”

Since 1964 the iconic sign was right off the John Belk Freeway and as much of a landmark for the Queen City as the Duke Energy Building is now.

It came down in 2009 and much of Charlotte mourned.

“And you hear that about a lot of these different signs” said Adria Focht president and CEO of Charlotte Museum of History. “It's like ‘Oh that was how I knew this was home. This was school.’

“It’s placemaking right? And that's a big part of historic preservation and why we do it why we advocate for historic preservation. Obviously businesses come and go but some of the businesses that we're highlighting were really cultural cornerstones or you know community cornerstones for Charlotte.”

Starting Oct. 16 the JFG Coffee sign will be one of the signs featured in the Charlotte Museum of History’s new exhibit “Charlotte: Signs of Home.” Other signs among the exhibit include one for Eastland Mall and the recently removed sign for The Penguin.

“We have all these icons of places in Charlotte that were near and dear to people’s hearts” Focht said.

In fact the exhibit might be a bit sad for those who yearn for Charlotte’s past.

“But the icons still exist” Focht said. “And people still think of them fondly and think of the time spent (there).”

The exhibition kicks off Thursday Oct. 14 with Charlotte Gem a party on the museum’s grounds that will include performances by Nouveau Sud Circus Project ax throwing drinks and appetizers and access to new museum exhibits including “Siloam School.” Tickets are $200 or $150 for museum members",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvZGVhbi1iZWF2ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mjg5MDg4MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dean Beaver Obituary (1954 - 2021) - Rockwell NC - Salisbury Post,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/salisburypost/name/dean-beaver-obituary?id=28908814 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvZGVhbi1iZWF2ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mjg5MDg4MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvam9obnN0b24tY291bnR5LW5ld3MvbGFyZ2UtdHJlZS1mYWxscy1vbi1zdXYtbmVhci1jbGF5dG9uLW5vLW9uZS1pbmp1cmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large tree falls on SUV near Clayton no one injured,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/johnston-county-news/large-tree-falls-on-suv-near-clayton-no-one-injured/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczE3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvam9obnN0b24tY291bnR5LW5ld3MvbGFyZ2UtdHJlZS1mYWxscy1vbi1zdXYtbmVhci1jbGF5dG9uLW5vLW9uZS1pbmp1cmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I’m not a doctor. I’m not a scientist. But if I can do something small that helps find a cure for me I figure that’s huge.”

No single fighter not even the great(est) Muhammad Ali himself packed the kind of wallop it would take to knock out cancer. But that’s the point why LaBelle and everyone else on the card at the House of Blues is about to stick their chin out and put up their mitts.

Gus LaBelle 39 a former corrections officer in Dedham is a carpenter by trade these days but he’s about to swap his hammer and saw for pair of boxing gloves in a bid to help knock cancer all the way to Palookaville.

LaBelle is one of 26 first-time fighters amateurs all on the card Wednesday night on Lansdowne Street in the latest iteration of Haymakers for Hope the Boston-born charity that has raised some $14.5 million for cancer research the last 10 years.

Haymakers has staged these amateur fight fests in four cities rallying a total of nearly 800 fighters including the likes of the 5-foot-6-inch LaBelle. As the weekend approached LaBelle had raised over $13000 some of it through sweatshirt sales for his bout vs. Anthony Lallis a 43-year-old insurance agent. The total pot all earmarked for research was nearly $700000.

H4H fighters come from myriad backgrounds professions and financial means. They have been doctors and lawyers scientists and tradesman Olympic swimmers (Dara Torres) who’ve known the pursuit of gold and culinary artists forever in search of crafting the perfect dish (chef’s kiss here).

The intimate setting of the House of Blues brings them all together each fight slated for three three-minute rounds for what is always a fun rewarding night win or lose (for ticket information go to: haymakersforhope.org).

A bout during the 2018 Haymakers for Hope at the House of Blues. mikediskin.com

Virtually all fighters trained for three months by Haymakers-approved coaches enter the ring in someone’s memory. LaBelle is no exception. Raised in Leominster he was 10 when his dad Richard LaBelle a public school teacher and administrator in Leominster succumbed to pancreatic cancer.

“Docs told him he had six months — he lasted a year but it was a pretty rough ride at the end” recalled Gus who was born in El Salvador and adopted as an infant by Richard and Bonita LaBelle. “He was a fighter . . . we’re the same that way I guess.”

LaBelle grew up as a hockey player and one of his side jobs along with carpentry has been installing outdoor rinks including one in recent years at City Hall Plaza. A winger he played at Leominster High Lawrence Academy Bentley and Curry.

He still plays men’s league hockey once a week and says with a stifled smile and slight shrug that he’s never fought much on the ice. If you’re looking to go to a boxing match with the hope that a hockey fight breaks out on Wednesday he pledges he’s not your man.

“High school and college I mean you can’t fight there right?” he said. “Otherwise yeah maybe a fight or two . . . no matter where you play there’s always a guy or two out there who’s looking to go but . . . ”

Cobbs a 6-2 pro fighter as well as a trainer said he spotted the hockey player in LaBelle his first day in the gym.

“Just by the way he attacked — I’m sure he’s had his share of scuffles” said Cobbs 37 who has trained eight fighters a half-dozen of them women for Haymakers bouts. “He was more like a street fighter when he came to me. He had the fight and that’s all that matters.”

A good piece of that persistence wasn’t learned in the rink but literally by accident when in 2010 LaBelle cracked up his high-powered motorcycle a Honda CBR 900 just south of the city.

The bike he said was torn into three pieces. He spent a month recovering at Boston Medical Center fractures to his lower left leg so extensive that doctors braced him for the possibility that they might have to amputate it at the left knee. The leg was saved and it took LaBelle nearly two years of rehab and therapy to get back near 100 percent.

Nerve damage in the leg and foot however restrict his range of motion and make it difficult for him to determine if the foot — the lead foot for a righthanded boxer — is planted before his punch. During drills one night recently in Foxborough Cobbs repeatedly had to remind LaBelle to “to find your foot! . . . find your foot!” and assured him when it was down.

“That’s been a battle for sure” LaBelle said. “When I first started this it’s what made me think I’d try to be a lefty keep that foot back and lead with my right. But Kevin convinced me no that’s just going to get me messed up.”

Come fight night Cobbs will be in LaBelle’s corner and wife Talia will be rooting him on from the crowd. Their two daughters Serenity (10) and Isabella (4) are too young to be admitted.

If he’s sure he can keep it secure all night LaBelle will carry his dad’s Bible to the ring the one with passages his dad circled in the final months when cancer closed in telling Gus to keep the good book’s words in mind.

“He told me I didn’t have to read them every day but I felt I needed them” he said. “It can be once a week twice a week whenever. Prayers help.”

The fight against cancer continues. Money helps. Prayers help. All fighters big and small aid the cause.

Police are investigating a photo that shows a shadowy figure in a barn a month after Leah Croucher vanished.

A member of the public discovered the photo while looking at a barn believed to be connected to Leah who went missing on February 15 2019 while walking to work.

The Google Maps image which seems to show a figure looking around a door was taken a month after the 19-year-old was last seen it has been reported.

The amateur sleuth passed the image on to police who have confirmed they're investigating it.

The photo was taken in the grounds of a large house in Eaton Bray which is 18 miles from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire where Leah lived.

Almost two years ago the house and grounds were searched by police the MKCitizen reported.

""We saw police digging up the grounds and people were told it was part of the search for Leah Croucher"" a member of the public told the paper.

They said the property was taken off the market while the police search was carried out.

Mentions of Eaton Bray started circulating on amateur detective forums a month ago in connection with the case.

One member of the Leah Croucher Disappearance - Community Investigation Facebook page went onto Google Earth after hearing about the police action in 2019 and started looking around according to MKCitizen.

What she found in images of the property shocked her.

""I zoomed in then zoomed again - and then I couldn't believe my eyes"" she said.

""I could see someone in one of the barns looking out of a big open window.""

The date on the Google Earth image was March 2019 - a month after Leah disappeared.

The woman said the figure looks like Leah and appeared to be hiding in the barn.

She took a copy of the image to a Thames Valley Police station the following morning prompting cops to look into the picture.

A spokesperson for the police said: ""Thames Valley Police can confirm it received some images last week which are being reviewed by the investigation team into the disappearance of Leah Croucher.

""We would always continue to urge the public to contact Thames Valley Police with any information that may assist the investigation either by calling 101 or making a report online or by visiting Milton Keynes police station quoting reference number 43190049929.""

The disappearance of Leah has confounded amateur and professional sleuths for the past two years.

Last month a woman claimed to have a lead in the hunt for the missing teenager as she believes she may have witnessed the 19-year-old being snatched.

The 68-year-old claims to have seen a young woman being ""aggressively"" pushed down in the seat of a car in Milton Keynes around the time of Leah's disappearance two years ago.

The woman says she reported the sighting to police at the time and twice more after learning of Leah's disappearance - but claims the call handler she spoke to seemed uninterested.

Since then she has grown increasingly concerned about the incident.

The woman who was stationary in a queue of traffic at the time said that she saw a pair of feet on the dashboard of a shiny black coupe car with the man behind the wheel aggressively pushing whoever was next to him down into the passenger seat.

The incident so concerned the motorist she contemplated getting out of her car and running to the suspect vehicle but then the line of traffic started moving.

The pensioner claims that no detectives contacted her after she reported the information so she reported it for a second time but was again met with silence.

Thames Valley Police say they took ""appropriate"" action over the woman's reports and declined to disclose further detail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9sZWFoLWNyb3VjaGVyLXBvbGljZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1uZXctbGVhZC1hZnRlci1naXJsLXNlZW4tb24tZ29vZ2xlLWVhcnRoLTE1Mzk3NDM5L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9sZWFoLWNyb3VjaGVyLXBvbGljZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1uZXctbGVhZC1hZnRlci1naXJsLXNlZW4tb24tZ29vZ2xlLWVhcnRoLTE1Mzk3NDM5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leah Croucher: Police investigate new lead after 'girl' seen on Google Earth,"The photo is thought to have been taken a month after Leah Croucher disappeared (Pictures: Hyde News and Pictures/PA)

Police investigating the disappearance of Leah Croucher are investigating a photo showing a shadowy figure captured on Google Earth.

The satellite image was spotted by a member of the public while studying a barn believed to be connected to the teenager who vanished while walking to work on February 15 2019.

Web sleuths say the picture was taken by a disused barn in Eaton Bray 18 miles from Leah’s home in Milton Keynes a month later.

It was passed on to police who have confirmed they are looking into it.

The barn along with a large house are on grounds which were searched as part of the investigation nearly two years ago.

Neighbours said they saw police ‘digging up the grounds’ as part of the hunt but ‘nothing seemed to come of the search’.

However talk of Eaton Bray resurfaced on an online forum named Web Sleuths along with a Facebook page called Leah Croucher Disappearance – Community Investigation this month.

One curious member decided to try and find the property on Google Maps to see what it looked like and how big the grounds were before spotting the mysterious figure.

She said: ‘I zoomed in on the house then moved the cursor along to one of the barns next to it. I zoomed in then zoomed again – and then I couldn’t believe my eyes.

‘I could see someone in one of the barns looking out of a big open window. It was clearly a female and looked as though she had a red blanket of jacket round her. She was just sitting there.’

The member noticed the date on the Google Earth image was March 2019 – a month after Leah then 19 disappeared.

She went on: ‘The more I looked at the photo the more it seemed to resemble Leah. The girl looks the same age she has the same hairline same eyes and same lovely slightly chubby cheeks.

‘It made shivers run down my spine. Could this be Leah – alive – in March 2019? And if so how did she get to be in a barn?

‘It looks as though she was in hiding or someone had hidden her – but why? The questions were running through my head.’

Detectives investigating the teenager’s disappearance confirmed they are looking into the photo (Picture: PA)

The following morning the woman went to Milton Keynes police station and handed the information to police. Details of the former owner of the property who fled in fear of the gang were also passed to detectives.

She handed a copy of the photo into officers in Milton Keynes the following morning.

A police spokesman said: ‘Thames Valley Police can confirm it received some images which are being reviewed by the investigation team into the disappearance of Leah Croucher.

‘We would always continue to urge the public to contact Thames Valley Police with any information that may assist the investigation either by calling 101 or making a report online or by visiting Milton Keynes police station.

‘It wouldn’t be appropriate to comment further on these images as they are currently with the investigation team. However we have no issues with this being reporting in the media.’

Though it is blurred the face shape and hairline seem similar to that of Leah who inexplicably vanished while walking to work on February 15 2019.

The photo is blurred because it is so magnified. But there seems to be a resemblance to Leah Croucher.

The searches for the then 19-year-old and police appeals for witnesses have primarily revolved around Milton Keynes but this barn is in the grounds of a large house in Eaton Bray 18 miles away in Bedfordshire.

However The MK Citizen can now reveal that the same house and grounds were searched by police almost two years ago as part of the Leah investigation.

One Eaton Bray resident said: ""The house was empty and on the market at the time. We saw police digging up the grounds and people were told it was part of the search for Leah Croucher. The property was even taken off the market for a while until the police had finished.""

The resident added: ""Rumours spread around the village and everyone was gossiping about it. But nothing seemed to come of the search so we thought it was just a red herring. We could never understand why Eaton Bray was involved.""

The Google Earth image from March 2109

The person who owned the house at the time a female who lived on her own has spoken willingly to the Citizen.

She says she left the house in February 2019 because there was a vendetta against her allegedly from a gang involved in drugs and sex trafficking.

""I feared for my life"" she said.

The woman says she left a key with an acquaintance to care for her three pets which she was unable to take with her. Heartbreakingly the three dogs were found starved to death in the kitchen of the house in June 2019. An RSPCA prosecution into the case has since been dropped.

Could the girl in the bar be Leah Croucher?

The property was sold last year and there is no suggestion that the new owners are in any way connected with the case.

But this month mentions of the Eaton Bray police search re-surfaced on social media - on the online forum Web Sleuths and also the Facebook page 'Leah Croucher Disappearance - Community Investigation'.

The aim of the Facebook group which has 1200 members is to share information and thoughts that may lead to insight into what has happened to Leah.

One member was curious about what the property looked liked and how big the grounds were so she decided to find it on Google Earth.

Save for a couple of large wartime huts Markeaton Park bears little evidence of the military camp that once thrived there – or of the temporary housing estate that provided emergency accommodation for 200 Derby families at the end of the Second World War.

Although it had escaped the worst of Nazi Germany’s bombing raids like many towns and cities across Britain by 1945 Derby had a significant housing shortage. The damage and destruction of a number of properties had made worse a pre-existing shortage of affordable housing.

Recently demobbed ex-servicemen returned home to find their wives and children living in two rooms of a shared house. One solution which had been adopted in several towns was the conversion of disused military camps into temporary residential use.

In Derby the most obvious location for such a settlement was Markeaton Park where a hutted camp had been established over more than half the parkland.

It was decided that ex-servicemen and their families would be given priority and once the Army moved out and the conversion was sanctioned by the Ministry of Health work began.

The Derby Telegraph called it “Derby’s new garden city settlement” and it certainly boasted good facilities. There was a canteen and a concert hall a dance hall a gymnasium and two messes indoor space for children to play in rainy weather and ready-made allotments that had been established by the troops.

It was estimated that the former camp would be required for no more than two years after which it could revert to being a public park.

While the camp had housed 1200 troops it was expected to cater for only 200 families. According to the Derby Telegraph: “Some of the troops’ huts could be converted into two homes and there are Nissen huts which would be suitable for one family.”

The borough council believed that residents aware that their stay was only temporary would be prepared to share many amenities. “The housewives will have to use tact and forebearance and like their menfolk in the services will have to learn to live together … in a spirit of understanding. They may find that the time they spend there will be a very happy period of their lives” noted Derby MP Group Captain Clifford Wilcock.

To ensure that only those given priority used the huts there was a caveat: anyone who decided to move in without permission and effectively squat would not be considered for the tenancy of any council house; their names would be struck off the waiting list.

The first “Markeaton Hut Homes” were ready for occupation in September 1946 and the first 50 families moved in during mid-October with approximately ten more homes being occupied each week.

Among the neat signposts was one bearing the name “Fifth Avenue” which the Derby Telegraph reminded envious readers was “a strictly ‘utility’ one compared with America’s most elegant residential thoroughfare”.

The new residents were told they could have the first week rent-free and those with children were promised that they would be provided with a permanent Corporation council house “within twelve months”.

The Derby Telegraph spoke to some of the delighted new residents. Among them was Mrs N Groves wife of ex-Staff Sergeant Henry Groves of the Royal Artillery and the REME who had never had her own home.

She said: “I think the Corporation has made a fine job of the conversion and I know we are going to be very happy here.”

However by February 1947 the Derby Telegraph was reporting tenants’ dissatisfaction. Many of the residents were threatening to withhold their rent unless the Derby Corporation Housing Committee agreed to meet with them to discuss the many grievances they had.

Chief among their complaints was the belief that the Corporation had bypassed camp tenants in the first allocation of new council houses.

There were also concerns about poor sanitation and inadequate street lighting while during the worst winter in living memory snow and ice had not been cleared from the main roads deterring tradesmen and causing housewives to have to fetch barrows of coal from the entrance of the park.

There were also arguments about the enforced installation of electricity meters and a complaint from one father that general dampness had caused mildew to form on his child’s pillow.

This type of complaint continued for another two years with one housewife claiming that condensation had caused mildew to form under the oilcloth in her bedroom and to warp the wood of her bedroom suite.

In September 1947 the Derby Telegraph reported on the “rust decay and dilapidation that now meet the eye in the once spotless kitchens of Markeaton Camp”.

By December Councillor Alec Ling had taken up the tenants’ cause. He told a meeting of the Town Council: “I have medical evidence that some [properties] are not in a state to house adult people let alone children.”

It transpired that by agreeing to sign a lease of 18 months minimum each tenant might well have to wait longer for their permanent house. Borough Housing Manager Mr E H Gregory noted that before signing each tenant “is advised that if he is comparatively comfortable where he is – in rooms perhaps – it would be advisable to remain and get an earlier chance of a house”.

Figures in the eBay x Den of Geek NYCC Scavenger Hunt,"Attendees at New York Comic Con love their giveaways but eBay has something truly special for those walking the convention floor. Rather than simply browsing vendor wares and appreciating cosplayers passing by visitors can look for special Funko Pop display boxes hidden around the Javits Center for an extraordinary scavenger hunt that appears to be drawing in quite a few of the most competitive fans and geeks in attendance.

For those on the lookout for more exclusive swag than just the posters and stickers that other booths are handing out the special superhero-themed Funko Pop that lies at the end of this particular adventure. All visitors have to do is snap a photo with their phone when they find one of the ten display boxes secreted around the exhibition hall. The boxes can be anywhere — a tee shirt vendor might have one or there could be one tucked away in the corner of an activation from one of the many exhibitors attending New York Comic Con.

When attendees have gathered all ten of the photos they’ll need to post them to Instagram tagging @ebay and @denofgeek (or @eBay and @DenofGeekUS on Twitter) and then proceed to the eBay booth (#1209) to show the display box images that they’ve captured. The fine folks there will bestow upon them the super-secret superhero Funko Pop that will make them the envy of their fellow convention-goers.

This scavenger hunt adventure continues the cavalcade of fun events eBay has hosted at their NYCC booth. On day one of the convention the team brought in artists DJ Skee and King Saladeen who were giving away exclusive Dark Knight inspired trading cards. DJ Skee also premiered his psychedelic Doctor Strange variant cover for Marvel as well. Booth visitors were able to pick up these one-of-a-kind items along with an eBay gift card to use on the site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5pZS9uZXdzLzc3MTcyNzQvdWstZWJheS10cmFkZXJzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWlyZWxhbmQtcG9zdC_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uaWUvbmV3cy83NzE3Mjc0L3VrLWViYXktdHJhZGVycy1idXNpbmVzcy1pcmVsYW5kLXBvc3QvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some UK eBay traders forced to stop doing business in Ireland as packages keep getting sent back by An Post...,"PACKET IN Some UK eBay traders forced to stop doing business in Ireland as packages keep getting sent back by An Post

A UK-based eBay trader has given up doing business with Ireland after 80 per cent of his packages were sent back by An Post - and says ""loads more"" are doing the same.

Brexit has been blamed for tough new EU customs rules that have seen millions of euro worth of goods left in storage depots here or returned to sender since July.

But while Rob Howe has seen 14 of 18 packages fail to get through he has had just one issue – in Denmark – with 120 parcels sent to the rest of the EU.

He told the Irish Sun: “I would be better off throwing £3 down the drain than sending a package to Ireland. I can’t do business there until all of this is sorted out.”

Rob sells around 4000 TV remote controls a year over the internet buying them in bulk and selling them individually.

He said: “I sell remote controls on eBay I buy job lots and sell them individually. A few weeks ago I bought seven lots of 100 from one seller in one week. I’m still working through them now!!

“I’ve got around 4000 listings on eBay of individual ones and actual stock I’ve got over 10000.

“I’ve got one room full of them under the beds in tubs here there and everywhere! Generally I’ve the brand ones Sony and Panasonic for particular models.”

AN POST UNDER FIRE

An Post has come under fire from customers who since July 1st have failed to receive packages sent from outside the EU – mainly Great Britain – following a change in customs rules.

Sinn Fein communications spokesperson Ruairi O’Murchu warned that Irish shoppers are facing Christmas carnage unless the problem can be fixed.

The company insists the fault lies on the British side but Rob from Margate in England disagrees.

He said: “In ten years I’ve done coming up on 40000 orders so I’ve filled in a few customs forms in those years! Since July I’ve had 18 items sent to Ireland and 14 of them have been returned.

“One was delivered definitely the other three I don’t know whether they arrived or not.

“At the same time I’ve sent 120 to the EU and had one return from Denmark. It’s a heck of a difference.

“All these forms are filled in exactly the same way so I wonder if one gets through why don’t the others?”

SIMPLE PROCESS

The process for sending since July 1st is simple enough according to Rob who insists he does everything required to deliver a parcel from Britain to the EU.

He explained: “I send by Air mail so I go on to Royal Mail site to purchase the label. I say I’m sending an item sold on the marketplace select eBay from the list and fill out their company number before including a description of the item.

“Then you print and pay for the label stick on your item and post it. It’s exactly the same for all the orders I send. One return from Denmark in 3 months out of 120 but most of them returned from Ireland so there is something wrong there.”

WHAT ARE THE NEW RULES? TOUGH new EU Customs rules governing non-EU goods came into effect on July 1 2021. Many customers in Ireland buying from smaller or specialist non-EU retailers are experiencing significant delays or not receiving their goods at all as a result. As most of the trade is between Ireland and Britain most of the issues relate to there where even gift parcels being sent by family and friends are being impacted. The EU now demands added electronic documentation and has also banned more goods from coming in from non-EU markets. An Post says many smaller more specialist British retailers are simply not aware of these requirements and have not put in place the necessary online shopping systems for selling to Ireland. They say this is causing Customs delays when these parcels arrive in Ireland while items then have to be returned to sender because the necessary electronic data is missing or incomplete or the contents are restricted. An Post says: “There are no such issues when shopping online in Ireland or other EU countries as no Customs tariffs apply when buying from these locations. “Similarly no issues arise when shopping with major British or international retailers (e.g. Amazon M&S) where smooth online processes have already been developed with An Post. “An Post is working with Irish Customs Royal Mail and other non-EU carriers to help them solve these issues. “In the meantime we advise customers receiving parcels (either online shopping or personal goods) from outside the EU to check with the sender that they are completing the appropriate documentation with any parcels they send.” However Rob Howe says the issues affecting business here have not arisen in the rest of the EU.

An Post say they worked with the likes of Amazon Marks and Spencer and River Island to ensure a smooth transition post Brexit and that the problems are lying with smaller retailers and ordinary people sending parcels to Ireland.

Rob says the knock-on effects are becoming obvious.

SELLERS BLOCKING IRELAND

He said: “On eBay you’ve got loads of people saying they’re blocking Ireland from buying which unfortunately I’ve had to do as I’m out of pocket by £100 in postage.

“I can’t do business until this is sorted out. Most parcels cost £5.65 if someone orders from Ireland I might as well throw £3 down the drain not post it and I’ll still be better off!

“The one that annoyed me really is the last one was a fully tracked and signed parcel that went to a school which ordered three remotes to use with their projectors and they got rejected.

“I might have thought someone would go ‘ooh it’s going to a school we’ll let that go through’. Kids have had it tough enough!

“My regular postman said ‘another return from Ireland Rob even he’s joking about it!

“Sort it out guys please. All I get is automated emails from An Post every time telling me they’re experiencing delays. I’ll continue to work with the rest of the EU I just hope it won’t eventually affect them.

'I WANT TO TRADE WITH IRELAND'

“I want to trade with Ireland. The people there have been so understanding saying ‘sorry we’ve heard about these issues thanks for the refund’.

“I’d love to start selling there again An Post like Royal Mail have been troopers through the pandemic but they just need now to get a grip on this and work out what exactly the problem is.”

An Post did not respond to requests for comment.

It’s understood eBay are working with An Post and Royal Mail to ensure the ""small portion"" of affected UK sellers can ship to Ireland effectively.

They said in a statement: “eBay is focused on providing the necessary guidance and support so that businesses can keep selling.

""If sellers are experiencing issues in this transition we recommend they utilise the Global Shipping Programme which is there to make shipping to ROI and elsewhere much simpler.

""Duty payment customs clearance tracking and all the rest of the delivery are taken care of for the seller which fully protects them and gives easy access to buyers in over 100 countries.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvcmtzaGlyZXBvc3QuY28udWsvbmV3cy9jcmltZS9mcmF1ZHN0ZXItbWFkZS1wczI5MDAwLWJ5LXNlbGxpbmctZmFrZS1maXJzdC1jbGFzcy1sbmVyLXRpY2tldHMtb24tZWJheS0zNDEyNjk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraudster made £29000 by selling fake first class LNER tickets on eBay and Shpock,"Muhammed Sufi 34 made fraudulent tickets over a five month period before selling them online.

Inner London Crown Court heard the company’s fraud department was tipped off when they found four dubious scratch card tickets being sold on website Shpock.

LNER - which runs routes between London Yorkshire and Scotland - say they may have lost £263000.

Sufi was snared when an unsuspecting elderly couple who had bought the tickets on eBay were stopped at London Kings Cross station when the serial number was flagged as fraudulent.

The conman had opened an eBay account under the name of an employee of the train company based in London and Yorkshire.

The swindler from Mitcham in South West London was handed a nine month jail term suspended for two years after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation.

He was also told to do 100 hours of unpaid work.

Detective Sergeant Karen Grave of the British Transport Police said: ‘’Sufi was hoodwinking honest members of the public into thinking they had paid fairly and squarely for legitimate tickets.

‘’Ticket fraud is not a victimless crime- the loss is passed down to honest fare-paying members of the travelling public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZS1uZXdzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstd29ybGQtbmV3cy9lYmF5LW9sZC1jYXItcGFwZXItdGF4LTIxODE2MjYz0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FtYnJpZGdlLW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay13b3JsZC1uZXdzL2ViYXktb2xkLWNhci1wYXBlci10YXgtMjE4MTYyNjMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay: Old car paper tax discs could be worth more than £1000,"We have more newsletters

Many drivers may not realise an item they likely discarded years ago could be worth over £1000 today.

Paper tax discs have been scrapped for a long time now but they could make drivers a big amount of money if they chose to hang onto them.

If you kept hold of your paper disc it could now be able to sell it for hundreds of pounds if not thousands reports The Mirror .

For more UK and world news click here.

The discs that were brought in 100 years ago in 1921 were placed on windscreens to show vehicle tax had been paid.

However this was replaced in October 2014 by an electronic register.

Around 1.7 billion tax discs were issued during this 100-year period with most being destroyed.

But some of the ones still surviving can sell for hundreds of pounds online according to LeaseCar.co.uk.

On eBay the discs are being sold for up to £1250.

The tax disc in question dates back to 1970 and is unused and pre-decimalisation.

These rare quirks made it more valuable to expired tax disc collectors known as 'velologists'.

For example in August 2014 the DVLA ran out of perforated paper - the special material used to print tax discs on.

It meant for the next two months until they ceased production entirely people would receive non-perforated tax discs which they'd have to cut out themselves.

Today these 'limited edition' discs are considered rare and experts reckon they'll accrue the most in value in the long term.

Likewise those with typos and printing errors are also seen as more valuable.

Those in good condition are worth more than visibily used tax discs.

And if your tax disc dates back to World War II it could also sell for more.

Vehicles used for the war effort had tax discs with 'War Service' marked on them and are rare.

Regardless of the year tax discs which have their sleevage intact (the paper that surrounds the disc) are also more collectable.

But if you don't have such a rare tax disc don't lose heart.

Even fairly average tax discs from as recently as 2009 are trading for up to £300 on eBay.

A LeaseCar.co.uk spokesperson said: ""Many people find it fascinating to explore buying and selling websites to look at the variety of used car tax discs that are available today.

“These small round pieces of paper are an important part of our motoring heritage and it is particularly poignant that on the 100th anniversary of their introduction on our roads that car tax discs from as early as the 1920s are actively available to buy.”

Vehicle tax was brought in with the 1888 Budget. A tax system for cars came in in the Roads Act 1920.

A man has posted a hilarious advert for his campervan that's a 'reminder of terrible life choices' - describing it as a 'slab of misery on wheels'.

The Bedford CF Motorhome is currently up to £620 on eBay with three days left to go which is surprising as it isn't described in a very favourable way.

In the advert the man describes how he didn't want a van but his girlfriend did 'so we comprised and purchased a camper' and he set about doing it up.

But then the woman left him 'probably for a man with a much more impressive motorhome than mine' so he decided to sell it - saying it's perfect for 'another coerced partner or sadist'.

What do you think about the campervan? Let us know in the comments...

In the advert the man writes: ""Well well well. Where do I start with this?

""Up for sale is my 1984 Bedford CF campervan. A perfect restoration candidate for another coerced partner or sadist.

""I never wanted a campervan my now ex girlfriend did. So we comprised and purchased a camper without ever laying eyes on it first might I add.

Image: ebay/milnthorpe31584) ebay/milnthorpe31584) Image: ebay/milnthorpe31584) ebay/milnthorpe31584)

""It was intended to be a 'joint' project which in reality turned into her standing around for half a day complaining about the shed we'd bought and the remainder of the time on my back about how long it was taking to transform it into her 'perfect tranquil cabin on wheels'. Yikes.

""Fast forward a few months and she decided to up and leave (probably for a man with a much more impressive motorhome than mine) leaving only behind this sad slab of misery on wheels.

Image: ebay/milnthorpe31584) ebay/milnthorpe31584)

""Apart from being an eyesore and driving down local property prices it serves as a personal reminder that the last few years of my life have truly and utterly been a waste.

""As you can probably tell by this point I'm eager to get this thing off of my drive and draw a line under this turbulent chapter. So without further ado here's a little more about the van.""

He then goes on to describe the good points of the van saying that it's largely rust free underneath good progress has been made on the conversion and it doesn't leak anymore.

Image: ebay/milnthorpe31584) ebay/milnthorpe31584)

It also comes with everything needed to convert it into a campervan including a full wiring kit water tanks cladding and a heater.

However the advert then goes on to describe more of the motorhome's bad points - including the fact that it doesn't run any more.

It's also got corrosion to the bodywork will need repainting and worst of all - ""it taunts me daily of my past failures and lost love""

The advert continues: ""If you've made it this far you are probably mentally unwell or still being forced into making a perfect love den for those romantic weekend getaways either way I applaud the dedication.

""If you do decide to bid on it and God forbid you actually win you will have to get it transported or collect it yourself as I have neither the time the means or the will to deliver it for you.

""I will do my best to answer any serious queries but if you ask me about the flow rate of the shower for example; I probably won't.

""It's not perfect (far from it) nor road ready so don't expect it to be and you won't be disappointed it's a cheap project and a good way to break into the world of motorhome owning.

""I'm just trying to get a little money back so I can go on a heavy night of drinking perhaps visit a lady of the night depending on how well the auction goes and then close this awful chapter of my life.

""Happy bidding and good luck (God knows you're gonna need it).""

A gigantic battlefield centered around a large rocket taking off into orbit is easily one of the coolest themes for a map that EA and DICE have created but due to several flaws with the map's design I'm not as impressed as I was hoping to be.

The map's main problem is that it's way too open and flat which makes it difficult to move between points of interest without being spotted. It's also tougher to pull off stealthy strategies like using a recon vehicle to deploy other players to an enemy's flank which is something that I've enjoyed doing in Battlefield games. Additionally the lack of significant verticality also makes it way too easy for anti-aircraft vehicles and players armed with anti-air rocket launchers to harass and take down helicopters since there are very few tall structures or pieces of terrain to use as cover.

Orbital is way too flat and lacks sufficient cover making snipers and tanks feel overpowered.

Another big problem with Orbital is that it's way too sparse. Whereas most other Battlefield maps have traditionally had lots of structures to break up sightlines and give players cover Orbital only has a few buildings at each capture point with next to nothing located between them. The extreme lack of cover makes it way too easy for snipers and tanks posted up on elevated positions to control the match and I wish that the developers placed several more buildings and props around the map so that I wouldn't feel so exposed all the time.

Orbital's flatness and lack of cover also make the map feel way too messy. One of the reasons why fan-favorite Battlefield maps like Caspian Border were so good is because their structures and terrain shape would corral players into engagement zones resulting in frontlines that players could identify and organize around. In Orbital the complete lack of these elements means that the entire map is incredibly disorganized and chaotic. I can appreciate chaos to an extent but Battlefield plays best when there's at least some structure to the flow of a match.

Orbital's destructible elements are incredibly lacking and that's a huge bummer.

Orbital's destructible elements are also incredibly disappointing. From what I've been able to gather you can only blow up sections of the walls on the map's smaller structures the round rocket coolant tanks and the explosive barrels found next to some doorways. You can't fully destroy any of the structures on the map and things that look destructible such as radio towers can't be blown up. You can't even do any damage to the large tower adjacent to the map's central rocket at all and while you can destroy the rocket while it's taking off doing so has little to no impact on the map's gameplay. It's more or less just a visual spectacle.

Compared to something like Battlefield 4's ""Leveloution"" that allowed players to collapse entire skyscrapers and cover the entire map in clouds of dust or turn a control point structure into a giant mound of rubble the lack of meaningful destruction on Orbital is concerning. It has me worried that most of the Battlefield 2042 maps will be like this although there's a chance that the game's other maps will have more destructible elements.

Overall Orbital is simply disappointing in most respects and it has me worried about what to expect from the maps in Battlefield 2042 in general. The game could be one of the best Xbox shooters but not with maps like this. I expect well-designed maps with a good flow a healthy amount of cover and plenty of destructible elements from Battlefield but Orbital has none of these things. As a result it's not scratching the itch I've had to play on a quality Battlefield map lately. I'm tempted to avoid the beta entirely and simply play Zavod 311 with my friends in Battlefield 4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVhY2hpZXZlbWVudHMuY29tL240NzMxMS9maWZhLTIyLWZ1dC11bHRpbWF0ZS10ZWFtLWluLWZvcm1zLXNiYy1vYmplY3RpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 Locker Room: What's new this week? (October 8th),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Phil Foden (Manchester City — LW — 86)

SBCs

Objectives

Welcome to the Locker Room: the place where we get to talk all things FIFA 22 once a week. Here we round up all the Ultimate Team news. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick the newest SBCs as well as the objectives for the week.The 90-rated Son leads the pack of cards with the highest rating followed by the 89-rated Suárez and the 86-rated LW version of Phil Foden. The Star Player for the week is Jonathan David from Lille coming in at 84-rated with some seriously promising stats. One more inform and the Canadian striker could find himself settling into quite a few mid-range price teams. César Azpilicueta out in RWB might peeve a few players who rely on pacy overlapping wingbacks but I think this could be a great cheap defensive option as the prices settle. He has good all-around defensive stats; it's only his strength and heading that let him down a bit.I was tempted to pick out my favourite player Sandro Tonali but he needs another card to help boost his shooting and passing to justify a selection. Likewise Breel Embolo could be a phenomenal pick up with that lovely combo of physicality and pace. However I think people will be turning their noses up at this LW version of Phil Foden for his perceived lack of pace (it's still more than enough but you know FIFA players and their 90 Pace requirements). Even now he is trading at a reasonable 100k but I suspect it will drop because that is his bin rate. People are unimaginative. Have this guy upfront as an LF in a 4-3-2-1 and he will start shredding defenders with his high dribbling and strong attack positioning. Drop him into a meta 4-1-2-1-2 formation he can be a playmaker drifting into the offensive zone to pick up spare balls. Enjoy this card before the next upgrade comes!The SBC situation is already chaotic. There is plenty to do so we've picked out the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. There is currently the 92-rated ST version of Ronaldo for his Premier League Player of the Month card worth around 2.51 million coins right now. There is also the Eredivise POTM 82-rated Guus Til  the Feyenoord CAM with an SBC worth around 10.8K. Pretty good if you ask us. Moving to the Serie A POTM SBC and we have a beastly 88-rated Kalidou Koulibalu card for around 167.7K. It will last you for a good few months so if you have the coins we would highly recommend it.There are two One To Watch cards on offer through objectives until Wednesday October 13th. The above is Justin Kluivert who I only just realised made the move to Nice over the summer. The card doesn't really scream ""must get"" to us even though Nice have got off to a totally fine start in Ligue 1. The requirements are fairly straightforward goals with Ligue 1 players a few wins with a Seria A/Ligue 1 hybrid team through ball assists and two goals with Dutch players in three separate games. For some this will come naturally. The exciting one is really that OTW Camavinga from Real Madrid. The objectives are to score in 12 separate matches with LaLiga players ten premier league goals five assists with crosses using Ligue 1 players in the FUT Friendly: New Allegiance and to win nine matches in that same friendly.

And according to an interview with Eurogamer EA Chief Experience Officer Chris Bruzzo says that it’s a mechanic that’s here to stay.

It’s a pretty long interview with a major focus on lootboxes within the FIFA series. And as you’d expect there’s plenty of dodging and deflecting when the hard questions are put forward. At one point Bruzzo also equates loot box spending to real world football.

Bruzzo also claims that it is not the intention of EA to have people spend too much time or money on FIFA. To that end he says the publisher has things like the FIFA Playtime dashboards to help players keep track of their spending. He also goes on to say that the publisher will work on “real solutions” to the problem. Just as long as the problem gets to stay.

You can read the full interview or a still considerably lengthy summary by hitting the link below. Though ultimately the takeaway is that EA is not removing lootboxes from FIFA but is apparently aware that there are problem spenders spending too much on it and is working to control it.

From 1997 to the early 2010s almost-yearly video games helped fill the (much shorter) gaps between movies featuring capitalism’s favourite secret agent.

And yes we know 1997’s GoldenEye on N64 is the best James Bond game of all time. With its varied objectives enemy guards filled with character and legendary multiplayer there is no topping GoldenEye. But what about the rest? Reload your Wolfram P2K set your remote mines and join us on a journey through the Golden era of Bond games.

GoldenEye 007 (Daniel Craig Remake)

Developer: Eurocom

Eurocom Playable on: Wii PS3 Xbox 360

The takeover of the Bond game licence by Activision from Electronic Arts was the beginning of the end. The games devolved from varied gameplay in exotic locales to Call of Duty rip-offs about shooting and blowing things up in generic locations.

And yet given these limitations (and the pressure of living up to the original game) the GoldenEye remake is not entirely bad. The story is nicely updated (though the characters are shorn of much that makes them memorable in their original incarnations) the gunplay is solid and a late-game stealth mission through the villain’s base recalls Eurocom’s best work on Nightfire.

But perhaps its greatest lesson is that 007 needs his gadgets his martinis his “Bond James Bond” lines and his vehicle missions to be memorable. Bond cannot live on shooting alone.

James Bond 007: Blood Stone

Developer: Bizarre Creations

Bizarre Creations Playable on: PC PS3 Xbox 360

Similar to the GoldenEye remake Blood Stone lacks most of the things that make 007 unique. A third-person shooter with a plot based around diamonds Blood Stone is more Splinter Cell than Goldfinger but gains a place in this list by including multiple vehicle sections though they are linear and the vehicles lack any gadgets.

Like all the Craig-fronted games Blood Stone suffers from the more serious tone and ends up unmemorable almost as if ashamed of the past antics of 007. Less hollow volcano bases more shoot-men-in-the-faces.

The World is Not Enough (PS1 Version)

Developer: Black Ops Entertainment

Black Ops Entertainment Playable on: PS1

Compared to the N64 version the PS1’s The World is Not Enough is shorter and its stiff gameplay small levels and lack of multiplayer mean it is not even by the standards of 2000 a good game. (Medal of Honor: Underground is a great example of what this game could have been.)

TWINE nonetheless contains some interesting ideas. The “cell phone stunner” from Tomorrow Never Dies can be used to stun enemies a camcorder rocket launcher is a unique gadget and a casino level is inexplicably one of the few Bond game levels where 007 can actually gamble.

From Russia with Love

Developer: EA Redwood Shores

EA Redwood Shores Playable on: PS2 Gamecube Xbox PSP

From Russia with Love is a unique James Bond game. Not only does it feature the likenesses of many classic actors (Bernard Lee’s M; Lois Maxwell’s Moneypenny; Desmond Llewelyn’s Q) it sees Bond himself voiced by Sean Connery the original 007. With Goldfinger’s gadget-laden Aston Martin and Thunderball’s jetpack both controllable in-game FRWL should have been a classic.

Unfortunately its levels are not very memorable and many of the translations from the 1963 movie to a video game are laughable. Remember in the movie when a chain-gun wielding seven-foot-tall henchmen interrupts Bond’s fight with Red Grant on the Orient Express? No? Indeed.

The World is Not Enough (Nintendo 64 Version)

Developer: Eurocom

Eurocom Playable on: N64

Far more of a successor to GoldenEye than the PS1-only (and third-person) Tomorrow Never Dies the Nintendo version of The World is Not Enough feels in many ways like a prototype of Eurocom’s later game Nightfire. Expanding on the movie TWINE features 14 levels and a suite of multiplayer options.

With some great levels (the standouts being an attack on MI6 and a tense timed mission in the London Underground) full voice acting varied objectives and beautifully animated enemies TWINE is let down by difficulty spikes long reload times and unmemorable gadgets (they all seem to be in his watch).

GoldenEye: Source (fan game)

Developer: Team GoldenEye: Source

Team GoldenEye: Source Playable on: PC

This multiplayer only game created by fans using Half-Life 2’s Source engine shows GoldenEye’s multiplayer is truly timeless. Though its last update was over four years ago GE:S updates the graphics and mechanics of the N64 classic while keeping the quick pace and general “bounciness” of the original.

GoldenEye: Source features both updated versions and recreations of classic levels like Bunker and Facility as well as new levels based on other movies like Casino Royale. Though the servers tend to be empty playing against bots is endless fun. Turn on rocket launchers only and watch mayhem unfold!

Agent Under Fire

Developer: EA Redwood Shores

EA Redwood Shores Playable on: PS2 Gamecube Xbox

The very definition of a “great 7/10” game Agent Under Fire came about from the melding of cancelled PS2 remakes of The World is Not Enough and 007 Racing. With a smarmy Bond played by Andrew Bicknell and a plot about replacing world leaders with clones this is far from the gritty Bond of modern times. Though the shooting is lightweight and the campaign short the gameplay variety and two wonderful vehicle levels featuring classic gadget-laden Bond cars make this a template for future games.

The vehicle levels feature details even modern games lack. Shop alarms blare if your gunfire hits them and skyscraper windows pour smoke if hit by an errant missile. Agent Under Fire also sees the introduction of “Bond moves”. Shoot some explosive barrels or find a hidden route and a “007” icon flashes on-screen with a burst of the famous theme and a bonus to your score. Corny? Definitely. But if you don’t like corny you don’t like Bond.

Everything or Nothing

Developer: EA Redwood Shores

EA Redwood Shores Playable on: PS2 Gamecube Xbox

With 007 voiced by Pierce Brosnan a villain played by Willem Dafoe Bond girls played by Heidi Klum Shannon Elizabeth and Mýa (who sings the theme song) a lengthy campaign (and co-op missions) and numerous well-developed vehicle missions Everything or Nothing is the closest the games ever came to a real Bond movie.

The plot sees the supervillain using nanotechnology and platinum-coated tanks to try take over the world. With crazy gadgets (a reconnaissance spider bot explosive coins a suit that makes Bond invisible) and even the return of Jaws this is pipped at the post only because Golden-era-Bond never feels quite right in third person.

Nightfire (Console Version)

Developer: Eurocom

Eurocom Playable on: PS2 Gamecube Xbox

Second only to Rare Eurocom are the developer who most “got” Bond. It’s unfortunate that 2012’s terrible 007 Legends was their final game (and marked the definitive end of Golden era Bond) but the console version of Nightfire is the game they should be remembered for. The opening level The Exchange is the pinnacle of Golden era Bond game design featuring multiple ways into the villain’s castle opportunities to use your varied gadgets the infiltration of a classy party and ending with a helicopter boss battle. Pure concentrated Bond.

The game is memorable even on the level of a pure shooter with a stealth level with a tranquilliser gun (a level mandatory for every Golden-era game) shootouts in a skyscraper and a Japanese mansion a climax with laser guns in space a memorable sniper mission and the infiltration of the villain’s lair along with numerous vehicle levels making Nightfire full of the variety that defines a classic Bond game.

The multiplayer lets you play as classic characters – Xenia Onatopp Oddjob (with a throwable hat) May Day – on recreations of classic locations (Goldfinger’s Fort Knox The Spy Who Loved Me’s Atlantis) alongside well-designed original maps like Skyrail a snowy map with cable cars. It’s strange to think what games would be like if Ian Fleming hadn’t sat down one day in the 1950s to write his first Bond novel.

Honourable Mentions

Tomorrow Never Dies

Developer: Black Ops Entertainment

Black Ops Entertainment Playable on: PS1

Any follow-up to GoldenEye was going to pale in comparison but even so Tomorrow Never Dies is a bad game. A PS1 exclusive third-person shooter Tomorrow Never Dies nonetheless has two segments: a skiing section where you can attack your enemies with ski poles and a vehicle section with Bond’s missile-laden BMW that were prototypes for the variety that future games would embrace.

007 Racing

Developer: Eutechnyx

Eutechnyx Playable on: PS1

A poor game by any standards with difficult levels stiff controls and very basic game design flaws (your own explosives consistently harm you for example) 007 Racing is nonetheless the most developed representation of Q’s gadget-laden cars. It would take future games to get vehicles right but 007 Racing was an important first step even if it immediately tripped and landed on its face.

The first pill to treat Covid-19 is on its way and vaccine producers are rolling out booster shots in wealthy countries. For investors the next stage of the pandemic means a tougher landscape for stockpicking The success of Merck & Co.’s oral antiviral treatment in a clinical trial has shifted the momentum in the stock market  weighing on shares of the companies that developed the most effective vaccines Moderna Inc. and the duo of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.Nineteen months into the pandemic a successful rollout of a Covid-19 pill could quicken and broaden the world’s recovery opening up a plethora of investment opportunities in stock markets.Here are some stocks seen by traders as possible winners and losers:Dozens of companies around the globe have said they’re trying to do what Merck appears to have succeeded at: Develop an easily administered treatment that reduces the risk of serious illness or death for people infected with coronavirus. For most of them the effort has come to nothing and after brief share spikes their stocks have fallen back.Among the bigger companies still working on antivirals are Pfizer Shionogi & Co. and Roche Holding AG with partner Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc. All plan to publish results from late-stage clinical trials by the end of the year. Shionogi’s pill could be a $2 billion drug the Japanese company said Friday.A tiny Israeli biotech RedHill Biopharma Ltd. said Oct. 4 its experimental oral therapy showed promise in helping hospitalized patients. The study consisted of only 251 people; weeks earlier RedHill had said the drug failed to show an effect in a broader group of patients. The company is discussing next steps with regulators.“The Covid pills are really a complement to the vaccines” said Shane Oliver head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. They could reduce demand for costlier treatments such as intravenous medicines he added.Another tiny company Synairgen Plc of the U.K. was one of the last year’s investor favorites soaring 2520% on optimism for its inhaled treatment for Covid-19. The stock has fallen 2% this year. It too expects late-stage trial data by year’s end.The possible arrival of Merck’s molnupiravir pill coupled with the prospect that the pandemic will wane further already is weighing on the valuations of jab makers.Moderna’s share price has almost tripled in 2021 after surging 434% last year. The stock’s inclusion in the S&P 500 in July further propelled it to a record and sent it soaring past analysts’ price targets.Still it’s now priced at 11 times estimated earnings down from 147 times in July 2020. The recent selloff finally brought the stock back in line with analysts’ 12-month projections for the first time in more than four months.The share price of Pfizer’s German partner BioNTech is even cheaper at 5.9 times earnings despite tripling this year.“Vaccines remain the primary prevention measure and largest market opportunity” Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison wrote in a note dated Oct. 5.Still it’s unclear how big that market will be: Harrison’s forecast for annual coronavirus vaccine sales over the long term ranges from $3 billion to $30 billion. He has equal-weight ratings on Pfizer and Moderna.The vaccine leaders may also lose market share if new inoculations from Sanofi Novavax Inc. or Valneva SE succeed and if mix-and-match boosting appears to be effective. The U.S. FDA is reviewing results of a study of adults who received booster doses of different vaccines than their original shots.Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking U.S. approval for use of their shots on children ages 5-11 while Moderna is testing its shot in kids as well.In Asia watch firms such as Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. which has a deal to distribute BioNTech and Pfizer’s vaccine in greater China and South Korea’s SK Bioscience Co. a local production partner for AstraZeneca Plc.The convenience of a pill for Covid could take market share from expensive infusions that need to be done in a clinic namely the monoclonal antibody treatments from Eli Lilly & Co. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Gilead Sciences Inc. GlaxoSmithKline Plc and partner Vir Biotechnology Inc.New oral antivirals “could open up a broader population to Covid-19 treatments in a true outpatient setting” wrote Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Chris Shibutani in an Oct. 1 research note.The continuing vaccination and a possible therapeutic may also curb the need for Covid testing kits.“Less hospitalizations as a result of Covid (which will surely be aided by molnupiravir and similar treatments) will result in a dialed-back pandemic response which should then result in less demand for asymptomatic testing -- especially for rapid testing” said Tycho Peterson an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Goldman analysts are more pessimistic saying the market for rapid Covid tests will “collapse” in 2022 to less than $200 million outside of symptomatic and PCR testing. Companies making those quick diagnostics known as antigen tests namely Qiagen NV DiaSorin SpA and Abbott Laboratories have all slumped from their recent peaks in September.Quidel Corp. Orasure Technologies Inc. and Abbott will be in focus in the U.S. Sugentech Inc. Biolidics Ltd. Metropolis Heathcare Ltd. Thyrocare Technologies Ltd. and Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd. are on traders’ radar in Asia.Other stocks to watch include lab operator Eurofins Scientific SE and suppliers of lab equipment such as Fluidigm Corp. Sartorius AG Sartorius Stedim Biotech and Tecan Group AG.",,,,,,,,,

A rooftop solar power plant touted as “the largest” for a residential apartment complex in the country was inaugurated in the city on Saturday. Enphase Energy announced the installation of the 354.4KW plant over 13 residential high-rise buildings at the Brigade Gateway Apartment Complex here.

“This is the largest rooftop solar power plant for a residential apartment complex in India that enables residents to save up to 69% of their present estimated consumption while also helping save carbon emission of up to 530 tons annually” a release said.

C.N. Ashwath Narayan Minister of Higher Education IT and BT Science and Technology inaugurated the solar installation.

While the aforementioned EQT pair featured a black upper that was decorated with “EQT Green” city map embroidery marking out routes for the marathon this pair is made from a gauze-like Celarmesh material that’s semi-transparent making for a very light breathable and close-fitting shoe. Multiple eyelet options decorate the upper for a tighter and customized fit while the strategically-designed heel clip and tongue come together to better secure your foot in place.

A particular standout feature for this running shoe is its sole unit which combines a Carbitex carbon fiber plate sandwiched between a firm yet squishy BOOST heel segment and a firm and propulsive Lightstrike system that runs the length of the mid-foot to the forefoot. A Continental outsole adds to the overall wearing experience and is well balanced for a sturdy grippy run but at the heel you’ll find an AdiWear section that better suits the BOOST above it.

This particular offering features a colorway that starts off black at the toe and by the means of green flames turns white towards the rear. The same pattern decorates the multi-piece sole unit while the tongue and heel appear in black.

adidas Consortium’s ADIZERO Pro RNRS High in “White/Green” is due to launch later today on Nice Kicks’ online shop costing $180 USD. Take a closer look at the pair above.

Kāinga Ora is offering to chip in up to $200000 or 25% of the purchase price of a home - whichever is lower.

The idea is that the homeowner then buys out Kāinga Ora over several years. The homeowner will be charged an annual fee if they take longer than 15 years to do so. The fee is currently $2250 (plus GST) and can be hiked.

The applicant will need to get approval from a participating bank (BNZ and Westpac) to get a mortgage. They’ll need a deposit of at least 5%.

The Government has allocated $187 million to the ‘First Home Partner’ scheme over three years indicating it expects modest uptake.

Buyers need to meet a set criterion to be eligible for the scheme. There are also a number of strings attached.

The buyer needs to have a total household income (pre-tax) of less than $130000.

They either need to be a first-home buyer or be someone who doesn’t currently own a home and doesn’t have realisable assets worth more than 20% of the house price caps for homes in the area they are buying in.

The home they buy has to be a new build. Although Kāinga Ora said the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development would consider allowing buyers to purchase existing homes on a “case-by-case basis” where requiring a new build effectively prevents the household from buying a home in that region for more than a year.

The homeowner can’t rent out the house but can get flatmates or boarders.

For as long as Kāinga Ora owns a share of the home the homeowner needs to get Kāinga Ora’s approval before selling.

Proceeds from a sale will be distributed in proportion to each party’s share.

The homeowner also needs to commit to living in the home for at least three years. If their circumstances change and they need to move before then they’d have to talk to Kāinga Ora. It will assess situations on a “case-by-case basis”.

Homeowners must also get Kāinga Ora’s approval before doing renovations or any building work on the home.

And they must allow Kāinga Ora to enter and inspect the home for the purpose of any property maintenance and repair.

Housing Minister Megan Woods in mid-2020 said Kāinga Ora would roll out its own shared equity scheme in “early-2021”. Funding was first allocated to support “progressive homeownership” at the KiwiBuild reset in September 2019.

Some of this funding has already been used to provide community organisations with loans to upscale their shared equity products.

Woods said this support has helped 53 families into their own homes.

A further 113 homes have been contracted and the Government has agreed to lend Habitat for Humanity and the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust more money to provide another 50 homes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This year’s conference delivers critical discussions about the state’s economic recovery with a particular focus on how Connecticut cities and towns are supporting small businesses.

Eversource CEO Joe Nolan keynotes CBIA’s Sept. 30 The Connecticut Economy conference.

Nolan who took over the reins at the utility company in May will address the future of energy including the latest on the company’s joint offshore wind venture with Danish company Ørsted.

That project promises to deliver hundreds jobs—particularly in the eastern part of the state with New London acting as a staging area—economic growth and enough electricity to power 350000 homes.

CBIA will also release the results of its annual survey of Connecticut businesses produced in collaboration with Marcum LLP featuring critical insights into the state’s economy.

Marcum Hartford office managing partner Michael Brooder will moderate a discussion on the survey’s findings with iCleanse CEO Chris Allen Beacon Health Options chief administrative officer Carrie Bourdon and Freeman Companies president and CEO Rohan Freeman.

The Larson men were among thousands of runners from Connecticut and across the nation taking part in 5K half marathon half marathon relay and marathon races. Runners started outside the state Capitol building and finished under the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Arch at Bushnell Park.

Music pumped on Capitol Avenue as bibbed runners filled the street in “corrals” corresponding to staggered start times. The weather was nice with feathery clouds and no threat of rain.

After a state trooper sang the national anthem Mayor Luke Bronin shouted into a mic “Good morning Hartford!” welcoming runners back to the city after a year’s hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coventry’s Alex Norstrom won the men’s marathon in 2 hours 20 minutes 40 seconds. Christine Myers of Altamont New York was the women’s winner in 2:48:34.

Among the spectators were Sarah Reinold of Middlebury with her two children Theo 5 and Louisa 6 all three wearing hand-written T-shirts cheering on runner dad Andrew Reinold 38. On the other side of the street a spectator held a sign “May the course be with you.”

Announcer Ken Shluger whose wife Beth is the marathon director gave a 30-second warning as the first wave of runners hopped and raised their hands. Then with the blare of an air horn the section was off in a mass of multi-colored T-shirts tank tops and costumes. The second section started soon after one runner in a T-Rex outfit capering along in the rear.

Members of the Hartford chapter of Latinas in Motion ran in several races.

Tents filled Bushnell Park offering food freebies and even flu shots. The finishing stretch near the Arch was lined with red pink lavender and yellow mums. The announcer there exhorted cheers and “More cowbell!” from the many spectators lining the last stretch. Volunteers greeted huffing sweating finishers with water bottles and space blankets. A few staggering limping runners needed assistance from volunteers and EMTs.

Terryville’s Tyler Raymond won the men’s half marathon in 1:07:22. Barkhamsted’s Annmarie Tuxbury an Olympic marathon trial qualifier won the women’s half in 1:13:45. Mystic’s Chris Helminski won the men’s 5K in 15:22 and New Haven’s Josephine Jacob-Dolan won the women’s 5K in 18:27.

Haley Hanenbaum 25 who finished the half-marathon at 1:46.44 shouted to her mom Helaine that it was her best time ever.

“I’m waiting for my husband now — make sure he’s still alive ” Helaine Hanenbaum of West Hartford joked.

Haley and her dad Barry Hanenbaum have been running together since Haley was a little kid trying to keep up. She came around barriers to stand with her mother waiting for her father to finish and tracking his progress on a cellphone app. Mother and daughter cheered loudly as dad passed through the Arch and across the finish line at about 2:22.

Finishing the marathon was a personal victory for Danielle Mailloux-Scott of West Hartford who was diagnosed with cancer in 2018 and underwent a double mastectomy in January 2019. The UConn emergency medicine physician then had to endure a harrowing regimen of chemo and radiation treatments.

A swimmer in high school and at Yale University Mailloux-Scott said she discovered an enthusiasm for running in the past two years. The Bristol native and married mother of two said “This marathon was my ‘take my body back f-cancer experience.’ “

She completed the 26-mile course in 5:09:24.

“My body tried to sabotage me and I said ‘No no no — we’re going to do this instead.'”

His mother ran it his father ran it both the full marathon and the half.

It would be his first marathon he decided last year.

He upped his mileage training hard through the pandemic and Saturday he finally stepped onto the start line of the marathon a year after the race was canceled due to COVID-19.

And the local guy won. Norstrom 25 a Central Connecticut graduate and a Hartbeat Track Club runner finished the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 20 minutes 40 seconds.

“This has been the goal for about a year now” Norstrom said. “It’s awesome. I’ve always felt like the marathon was going to be my event. This is a good way to start.”

About 7000 ran the marathon and accompanying half marathon 5K and half marathon relay. The race’s field was scaled down as was the elite field which likely lost runners to the Boston Marathon which was rescheduled to Monday due to the pandemic.

As a result the races were dominated by local talent. Terryville’s Tyler Raymond a 2017 Central grad won the half marathon in 1:07:22. Chris Helminski of Mystic a University of Hartford graduate won the 5K in 15:22. Annmarie Tuxbury of Barkhamsted an Olympic marathon trial qualifier won the women’s half (1:13:45).

“This is always on my schedule because it’s so much fun” said Tuxbury 27. “It went a lot better than I thought it would.”

It was the same way for the women’s marathon winner Christine Myers of Altamont N.Y. Her last marathon was in May in Providence. In the third mile she tripped over a muffler lying in the road and fell breaking her right arm. Myers got up and kept going and ended up finishing second in 2:50.

Saturday Myers 23 stayed upright and won the race in 2:48:34.

“There is no better feeling” Myers said. “I’m so blessed to be here. I couldn’t have asked for a better day.”

When she fell she said she broke her arm in such a way that she could still move her arms to run.

“My [watch] is still shattered” she said. “[My arm] is still not fully healed. I got back up and said some colorful words and then just kept going.”

Myers felt strong Saturday. So did Norstrom. He realized he was in the lead when the half marathoners turned back at Mile 11. Jason Ayr of Philadelphia the runner-up and another runner caught up to him at the halfway mark and he had company for a while.

“I pulled away at Mile 20” Norstrom said. “I didn’t really even pick up the pace. It was me and another guy and he kind of fell off. I started cranking it a little bit and from there I just kept going. I didn’t look back.”

Ayr 34 finished second (2:23:08).

“We made a surge to reel him back in and then the three of us ran together until 17ish” Ayr said. “Alex made a hard move. [The other runner] responded I didn’t. That was the last time I saw Alex. I was fading pretty hard from 18 to the finish and from 22 to the finish it was pretty much a death march. I knew everyone was suffering similarly to me and Alex looked great so I wasn’t going to catch him. It was pretty much damage control. It worked out for second.”

Ayr’s UMass college teammate Andrew McCann of Westerly R.I. finished third (2:24:07).

“This is my first real competitive full” McCann said. “I won [the] Bay State [Marathon] two years ago but I ran about 10 minutes slower than I did today. It was a PR but not exactly the way you like to run PRs. The wheels came off at 13 [miles].”

In the half Raymond was in second most of the race until the last half mile or so. Then he kicked.

“It went exactly how I wanted it to go” said Raymond 27 who ran the half in 2017-19. “A kick at the end gave it all I had. Tried to get through the race smart.”

He ran a personal best by 40 seconds.

“It’s the best type of half because there’s always someone cheering for you” he said. “People in the last two miles are like ‘Come on you can get him you can get him.’ I’m like ‘I don’t know I’m kind of tired.’ Then I was like ‘Why should I get second? I’m going for first. All right let’s do it.’

A little over a month after launching its first transatlantic route — between New York-JFK and London's Heathrow Airport — the carrier launched its second with service from JFK to London Gatwick.

The dual-London-airport strategy came as a surprise when JetBlue announced it earlier this year.

Both airports serve different but significantly overlapping needs — akin to New York's JFK LaGuardia and Newark. In broad terms it's Heathrow that boasts major flagship carriers and links all around the world making it a crucial link for any airline looking to secure business travel demand to London. Gatwick is more leisure-oriented and serves as the home airport of ultra-low-cost-carrier EasyJet. Both airports have decent connection options to central London and which airport is preferred generally depends on where you're going in the region or where you're connecting to.

""They complement one another very well"" Geraghty told me on Wednesday ahead of the inaugural flight to Gatwick. ""We're also the only airline flying from Gatwick to the U.S. right now.""

From the area of London where I was staying this weekend — Wimbledon visiting friends — both airports would have been equally easy by taxi ahead of my flight home but Gatwick was a nice quick — and affordable — ride.

My former colleague Zach Honig flew on the Heathrow inaugural and covered his experience flying Mint out of Heathrow on the return.

I flew over to Gatwick in Core — JetBlue's economy — so TPG offered me a Mint flight back. I booked the flight right when it went on sale and luckily was able to snag one of two Mint Studios the first row of Mint seats which feature extra space for an extra $199.

Arriving at Gatwick

Gatwick is one of the major airports in London and despite the broad strokes painting it as the leisure airport it also sees plenty of business travel. Don't mistake it for a dinky side operation.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

JetBlue flies from the North Terminal which it currently shares with every other airline at Gatwick part of a COVID-era consolidation.

https://twitter.com/staralliance/status/1446155171780861961?s=21

The New York-based carrier is still missing from the physical signage around the terminal but all of the electronic displays have the JetBlue logo prominently.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

Even without the signage just looking around the terminal I was able to spot the JetBlue check-in counter.

Setting up a new base can be tricky for an airline particularly when it's an international base — and particularly in the days of COVID restrictions. So it wasn't surprising to see a bit of a queue at the JetBlue check-in counter both at the Mint desk and the Core one.

Within moments though an agent came up to me asking if I had an American passport and just carry-on luggage and offered to give me a hand at the self-check-in kiosks.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

The agent who was a new hire along with a JetBlue employee who was training her helped me scan my passport then looked at my negative COVID test and had me fill out an attestation form. I returned the form to the agent got my boarding pass and went through security.

JetBlue does not offer lounge access to Mint passengers at Gatwick — just like at Heathrow and JFK.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

But there are plenty of shops cafes and restaurants in the terminal — so it's easy enough to kill time. If you would rather go to a lounge however there are a few options for Priority Pass members.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

Of course given the decrease in travel due to COVID it's worth noting that some of those lounges have temporarily closed. For now the No. 1 Lounge is available.

I checked in at the front desk with my Priority Pass card and boarding pass and ordered breakfast — food is all table service while coffee is self-serve.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

I moved towards the gate a little before boarding. It was a short walk past a secondary security question area then down an escalator.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

At the gate the agents called passengers who hadn't had their documents verified at check-in — generally because they didn't check bags and used a mobile boarding pass — to verify that they had taken the required COVID test.

Boarding began right on time with pre-boarding quickly followed by Mint and Mosaic passengers.

A sweet suite and a sweeter studio

The Airbus A321LR that JetBlue uses to operate its London service has 12 rows of its Mint business class seats arranged in a 1-1 layout facing forward on a slant — that's a total of 24 Mint seats. It's similar to the A321neo just with more rows of Mint.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

The two seats in the first row have some extra room and are considered a slightly different product the Mint Studio. The remaining 22 seats are Mint Suites.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

Both the Studio and the Suites have sliding doors but they don't close completely. There's a small gap and the doors rise only to about chest level if you're standing. So there's definitely privacy but less than you'd find with a properly closing door like on Qatar Airways.

I sat in seat 1F — the starboard Studio. You can read a review of the Suite on a flight from London Heathrow here.

The Studio typically has a price premium above the Suite typically $199. The service is exactly the same but you get a nice bit of extra space. It's basically like the airline didn't have quite enough room for another row of seats and decided to just elongate the first row instead.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

It's not a make-or-break amount of space but it is definitely fun to have and extremely comfortable even compared to the impressive Suites.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

In theory some of the extra space can function as a ""buddy seat"" where a travel companion can join you and sit to watch a movie have a drink or even eat dinner. There's even a second tray table and a seatbelt for that seat although someone can't sit in it during take-off or landing.

London calling: Where to sit when flying JetBlue's A321LR to and from the United Kingdom

In reality it would be a bit of a squeeze unless the other occupant is a child or a significant other or someone you're okay getting quite up close and personal with — they'll practically be in your lap.

Although I actually ran into a friend on this flight we decided to skip the buddy seat.

Instead I enjoyed the extra storage space in the pod and the extra shoulder room. I could sit almost sideways slouch slant lean or even curl my legs under me without feeling at all tight. And when I lowered the seat into bed-mode to take a nap I couldn't believe how spacious and open it felt around my head and shoulders.

It also meant more space to put my backpack and other stuff during the flight.

Not that there was a lack of storage space — the Studio was loaded with drawers and compartments for just about everything.

There were also two full-sized power outlets as well as USB ports.

There's a gigantic 22-inch in-flight-entertainment screen — the regular Suites get a smaller but still impressive 17-inch one — which angles out towards you aside from during take-off and landing

The seat was quite comfortable and there was only one minor flaw — I kept knocking the seat control panel with my elbow making the seat move unexpectedly. By the end of the flight I had gotten used to positioning my arm carefully

Waiting at each seat were a few different amenity kits.

One from Wanderfuel had a handful of supplements including an ""immune support"" chew as well as a lip balm socks and a deodorant wipe — a really handy addition for red-eyes.

Another pouch contained hand sanitizer moisturizer lip balm a stain remover pen and a Mint-branded ""flight-deck"" of cards.

A final pouch held a toothbrush and toothpaste as well as ear plugs and an eyemask.

There was a small pillow sitting on the buddy seat and a bag with a bigger pillow and a blanket from Tuft and Needle sitting on the main seat — I put these aside on the floor by the buddy seat until later when I took a nap.

There was also a pair of slippers in one of the compartments.

Finally there was a menu with the names of our flight attendants — a nice touch I thought — and a pair of headphones.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

The headphones made by New York-based Master & Dynamic are high quality with excellent sound but with a catch. There's no active noise cancellation — for some that's a dealbreaker on flights.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

On the other hand they blocked the engine and plane noise more than well enough (though it might be different sitting closer to the engine) so I had no trouble hearing anything.

Onboard service from Gatwick

A few minutes after I boarded and settled into my seat Nicole one of the flight attendants came by to introduce herself and offer a drink while boarding wrapped up — choices include a blood orange juice champagne water or a mimosa. I went with the orange juice which was sparkling and delicious.

Boarding wrapped up and we pushed back right on time. After a lengthy taxi around to the runway we were airborne just before 12:25 p.m.

As soon as we were above 10000 feet Nicole came by and took my order for lunch and my pre-landing meal so that she wouldn't have to wake me to get my order later. She also asked what I'd like to drink — I decided to try one of the cocktails on the menu.

A few minutes later once the two flight attendants had taken everyone's order Nicole brought my drink followed shortly by our other cabin crew member Alex with a snack platter.

Lunch was brought out about 30 minutes later — about an hour after take-off. There were five dishes to choose from — reminiscent of the Dig Inn meals served on the eastbound flight in coach but not quite the same. I opted for the baby greens salad the roasted carrots and the chicken Milanese.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

I hadn't even realized how hungry I was but all three were delicious. The carrots in particular were my favorite. Served cold the roasted carrots came on top of a Greek yogurt dressing and were quite flavorful. The chicken too was excellent — impressively crispy.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

Throughout lunch I was thrilled to see that the live TV options included a channel with Premier League football (soccer) meaning I could watch Tottenham Hotspur my club. Thankfully we won and I managed to not jump out of my seat and spill my food everywhere after Pierre-Emile Kordt Højbjerg's incredible first goal.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

Lunch was cleared and I settled back to watch the rest of the match.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

A dessert cart was brought out around 3:10 p.m. London time. I opted for the vanilla gelato though I was tempted by the cheese plate. Still the gelato was fantastic so I stand by the choice. I also had a cup of coffee which came on a drink cart following the desserts.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

After the match I decided to start Black Widow which I hadn't had a chance to see yet. I was pleasantly surprised to see the recent release available on the IFE.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

As I was watching the movie the flight attendants came by a couple of times with a snack basket which included Tyrrell's potato chips (or crisps) and shortbread.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

I was fairly jetlagged and sleep-deprived so I took a nap after the movie. I was so tired at that point — despite the coffee — that I forgot to take a photo of my seat in bed-mode! But to give a sense of what it's like take a look at the above photo that we previously took during a tour of the new Mint cabin when JetBlue first announced it.

I woke up after about an hour and surfed on my phone — thank you free Wi-Fi — until the pre-landing snack came out which was about an hour and change before landing.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

This time I opted for the Panzanella salad and the tomato and cheese panini. Both were excellent though the Panzanella stood out.

Photo by David Slotnick/The Points Guy

As we prepared for landing flight attendants came around with disposable hot towels and a nice hand-written note with a Mint souvenir pin.

Finally we flew over Long Island descending until arriving at JFK.

Bottom line

JetBlue's business class from London is a light pleasant unfussy experience. It's a comfortable seat good food and stylish cabin and amenities — none of the pomp and circumstance other carriers offer just a solid enjoyable well-considered product.

As someone who likes to get to the airport early the lack of lounge is a bit of a downer but that's exactly what Priority Pass is for.

Overall the Gatwick experience was a good one. I typically fly to or through the U.K. a few times a year and wouldn't hesitate to fly on JetBlue again in either cabin. As I live in Boston I'm excited to see the carrier bring its trans-Atlantic service to New England in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC9jb2x1bW5pc3Qva29tYW5kby8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL2hvdy1jbGVhbi1vdXQtanVuay1maWxlcy1hbmQtZm9sZGVycy10YWtlLXVwLXNwYWNlLXlvdXItcGMvNjAyNzkyMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to remove files and folders taking up valuable storage on your PC,"Kim Komando

Special to USA TODAY

It happens. The longer we keep our devices the more cluttered they become.

Open your phone's app tray for a great example. How many are sitting there that you haven't opened in months or years? This clutter isn't just annoying – it can be dangerous too. Tap or click for the smart way to delete apps you’re not using.

On your PC your Start menu is probably a mess too. That's easy to clean up and you'll thank yourself every time you click it. Tap or click for quick steps to banish the junk.

Then there are all those files you genuinely don't need. Keep reading for your easy action plan to free up some space like a pro:

Step 1: Empty the Recycle Bin

When you delete a file it's not gone. It first goes to the Recycle Bin waiting for you to take more permanent action. To get them out of purgatory right-click on your Recycle Bin and click Empty Recycle Bin.

Here’s another option that shows you even more files: Go to Settings > System > Storage > Temporary files. You’ll see a list of temporary files including the contents of the Recycle Bin. Check the Recycle Bin box (and anything else you want to get rid of) then select Remove files.

Deleting old photos documents and spreadsheets is just the beginning. This 5-minute tech fix will help you speed up your PC.

Step 2: Clear temporary files

Temporary files are created to help apps or processes go off without a hitch – or to help with transferring data and other processes. Over time they can take up a lot of space. To clear them open your C: drive and select the Windows folder then Temp (C:\Windows\Temp). Press Ctrl + A to select everything then hit Delete.

You can also navigate to Settings > System > Storage > Temporary files. Select what you want to delete and hit Remove files.

Sick of paying for expensive software? Tap or click for 9 free copycats that are just as good as the originals.

Step 3: Wipe out the Hibernation File

When you put your PC to sleep it stores your open windows documents and files in the memory.

Hibernate does the same thing but it saves these things to your hard drive instead of using your system's memory. You can disable hibernate if you don't use it. Here's how:

Right-click on the Start button or press Win + X then select Command Prompt (Admin) or Windows PowerShell (Admin). Type the following command to disable hibernation: powercfg.exe /hibernate off.

SECURITY 101: Tell Google to butt out. Tap or click for 3 quick settings to change to keep the tech giant from watching what you are typing hearing what you say and seeing what you watch.

Step 4: Delete the old version of Windows

Windows automatically deletes the old version of the OS off your machine after an upgrade. You can also manually delete it before that happens to regain some space. Warning: You won’t be able to return to your previous Windows version if you change your mind.

Go to Settings > System > Storage > Temporary files. Under Remove temporary files select Previous version of Windows and then Remove files.

It has two series of houses in its collection: Legend and Cube. For each of them there are several versions available: Legend/Cube One Legend/Cube Two and most recently Legend/Cube Two X. We are going to focus on the Cube Two X in this piece which is an extension of the Cube Two series maintaining the same futuristic design and high-tech features but adding more space and charm to the tiny home.The C2X comes with an interior design that increases the living space by 30 percent compared to Cube Two. There are two versions available with the C2X: a single bedroom and a double bedroom. Both of them have the same dimensions but the layout is different. With an area of 377 sq ft (35 sq m) the C2X measures 393” (10 meters) in length 137” (3.5 meters) in width and 122” (3.10 meters) in height. Both versions weigh 8000 kg (17636 lb). In comparison the standard C2 tiny home has a 263 sq ft (24.4 sq m) of living space being able to accommodate a family of 3 to 4 members.When it comes to layout the single bedroom C2X has an entryway living room bedroom kitchen dining area and bathroom. The double bedroom version of the tiny home has pretty much the same configuration but you have both a master and a secondary bedroom included.For the C2X Nestron installed a long horizontal window and French windows as well offering plenty of natural light and a more open view to enjoy your surroundings.This home might be tiny but it is smarter than you think both in terms of design and amenities with an AI (artificial intelligence) assistant named Canny controlling appliances via voice command. There is also a projector available as an add-on.Everything about the C2X is smart including the furniture although most of its fancier features are optional available upon request. For instance the projector set that would go in the living room is sold as an extra. In the kitchen and dining area Nestron includes the basics such as sink and faucet dining table storage cabinets but you have to request as extra a double door fridge invisible induction cooktop and there’s even a dining wall mounted smart tablet available.Moving on to the bedrooms you can also opt for automatic sliding doors. A manual sliding door is otherwise included in the basic package along with the bed storage cabinets a bookshelf a wardrobe and a foldable table.The bathroom is equipped with a toilet shower water heater mirror cabinet basin and faucet clear black glass partition. But you can also make the bathroom smarter if you opt for a smart toilet and a smart mirror. A washing machine is also available upon request. Nestron likes to keep the design smart as well separating the wet and dry areas in the bathroom in order to keep it cleaner and prevent it from getting damp and moldy over time.There are also hands-free lights installed in the house  that automatically turn on when they sense motion nearby.In-floor heating for the house is also available but it comes at extra cost.All the electrical and mechanical systems of the C2X are gathered in one single room which is located in the back of the house saving space and keeping everything organized.The Cube Two X tiny house is available to pre-order anywhere in the world with a starting price of $98000. While worldwide delivery is available you have to expect to pay extra depending on the location you want it shipped to. For instance the shipping costs of the Cube Two model were an extra $8000 for the U.S. and that was last year.

Over the last five years the 100 top ranked law firms in the US facilitated $1.36tn of fossil fuel transactions represented fossil fuel clients in 358 legal cases and received $35m in compensation for their work to assist fossil fuel industry lobbying according to a “climate scorecard” published in August.

The scale of law firms’ work for the fossil fuel industry is huge said Tim Herschel-Burns a third year student at Yale Law School and co-founder of Law Students for Climate Accountability which developed the scorecard. “As we started digging we realised how holistic this is. Everything fossil fuel companies want to do they need lawyers to accomplish.”

Fossil fuel companies rely heavily on armies of lawyers to advise on projects lobby negotiate contracts secure permits and navigate an increasing number of climate lawsuits. Law firms’ fossil fuel industry work has increased compared with the previous year’s scorecard even as climate warnings become more dire and the International Energy Agency has warned new fossil fuel development is incompatible with the target of net zero emissions by 2050.

The climate scorecard awarded firms grades based on their involvement in lawsuits “exacerbating climate change” their support for fossil fuel transactions and fees received for lobbying on behalf of the fossil fuel industry.

Paul Weiss a top 10 US firm according to Vault Law’s rankings was one of 37 to receive the lowest F grade. The firm which has its own sustainability practice has acted for fossil fuel companies in 30 cases over the last five years according to the scorecard. Among the most high-profile was the firm’s work representing ExxonMobil in a landmark trial where the company was accused of having misled investors about the risks of climate change to its business. The court ruled in favour of Exxon in 2019. Paul Weiss did not respond to a request for comment.

Only 12 law firms were rated an A or B in the scorecard which meant they did not conduct work for fossil fuel clients. Three firms – Cooley; Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati; and Schulte Roth & Zabel – have actively addressed the climate crisis through renewable energy transactions lobbying or pro-climate litigation according to the scorecard report.

“We definitely agree that the law can be this force for good” said Herschel-Burns. “But one thing that we found really striking is that overwhelmingly the top law firms are [representing] the wrong side of it.”

There’s a tangible human cost said Alyssa Johl legal director for the Center for Climate Integrity. “Elite law firms are representing the oil and gas companies and providing them with a deep bench of high-priced lawyers” she said. “For the communities across the country that are seeking justice the end result is that their cases have been delayed and bogged down by procedural hurdles put forward by some of the biggest law firms in the country.”

Law Students for Climate Accountability is calling on law firms to pledge to stop taking on new fossil fuel industry work phase out their current work by 2025 and ramp up their work for the renewable energy industry and in support of litigation to tackle the climate crisis.

It’s a potentially controversial stance given the principle that everyone should have access to legal representation. But Herschel-Burns said this principle is often used in “really sloppy ways which end up justifying law firms being able to represent whoever pays the most”.

Some firms have acknowledged a choice. Speaking at a conference last year about the link between law and climate change the global senior partner at Clifford Chance Jeroen Ouwehand said firms “can choose what we support and what we don’t support. We do not have to be neutral professional service providers”.

Law firms are starting to ramp up their own climate action even as they continue their fossil fuel work. A number of firms that scored F grades on the climate scorecard including Shearman & Sterling and Hogan Lovells have signed up to the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance which launched in July. Members pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and to work with clients to embed climate goals and to help drive “systemic change”. Neither firm responded to the Guardian’s request for comment.

Another alliance member DLA Piper has set its own science-based target to halve all emissions by 2030 including indirect emissions from the firm’s supply chain. The firm was recently appointed official legal services provider for the forthcoming Cop26 climate talks. But it scored only a D on the climate scorecard and has represented clients including Shell ExxonMobil and BP. The firm declined to comment.

Thom Wetzer law professor and director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme one of the organisations supporting the alliance said the firms may be serious about taking steps in the right direction but they do not necessarily have the best practices yet. “We need to move the whole sector and for many firms involved this is the start of a journey.”

Some law firms that ranked low on the climate scorecard were keen to promote their green energy work. Allen & Overy which according to the scorecard worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $125bn over the last five years said in a statement that it does “more renewables work than any other law firm in the world by most key measures”. Clifford Chance which the scorecard calculated worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $123bn said it is “perennially at or near the top” for advising on renewables financing.

But neither firm both of which scored an F responded to questions about how they reconcile this work with their representation of fossil fuel firms.

Lawyers have a responsibility to reflect on their own role and to ask whether their clients’ values align with their own Wetzer said. “Firms that engage constructively with the net zero transition will be rewarded; clients will value their judgment and expertise top talent will be more easily attracted and retained and these firms will strengthen their social license to operate.”

Law firms’ best resource is their employees said Sam Sankar of the nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice which makes the climate scorecard a powerful tool. “In the future nobody is going to think twice about making career decisions with an eye to whether it aligns with their climate ethics.”

There’s now a conversation about legal ethics and climate which is well overdue Sankar said. “The [fossil fuel] industry is paying law firms tons of money in an effort to dodge responsibility and block regulatory reforms that could help avert this crisis.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vYmF0b25fcm91Z2UvbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9zZWUtaGlyZXMtYW5kLXByb21vdGlvbnMtYXQtYmF0b24tcm91Z2UtZ2VuZXJhbC1zbWFsbHMtc2xpZGVycy1hbmQtd29tYW5zLWhvc3BpdGFsL2FydGljbGVfOThmMjQ3MTItMjZjNS0xMWVjLWJkZDAtNTNkYzU0NTljYzhjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See hires and promotions at Baton Rouge General Smalls Sliders and Woman's Hospital,"You have permission to edit this article.

Some 90m tonnes of the stuff are produced each year providing revenues of over $150bn—approaching those of ExxonMobil an oil and gas company. This is done almost entirely by burning fossil fuels with air and steam—a process which uses up 6% of the world’s natural gas and 2% of its coal and emits more than 800m tonnes of carbon dioxide putting the industry’s emissions on the same level as those of Germany.

The vital nature of this comes from one of the subsequent uses of the gas. As well as being used to process oil in refineries and to produce methanol for use in plastics hydrogen is also crucially used for the production of almost all the world’s industrial ammonia. Ammonia is the main ingredient in the artificial fertilisers which account for a significant part of the world’s crop yields. Without it agricultural productivity would plummet and hundreds of millions would face starvation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9ldXJvcGUvY3plY2gtcHJlc2lkZW50LW1pbG9zLXplbWFuLXRha2VuLXRvLWljdS1pbi1ob3NwaXRhbC8yMzg4MjUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Czech President Milos Zeman taken to ICU in hospital,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.aa.com.tr', port=443): Read timed out.

A couple of Saturdays ago the famed food show presenter and general apogee of erudition was not in a good mood.

I know this because he tweeted: ""I love how @fedex can send you a notice saying they attempted delivery at the exact time you were actually standing at the door waiting for the delivery.""

I felt at one with Brown's plight because at that very moment the same thing was happening to me.

I was waiting with extreme passivity for the delivery of wine. Delivery companies tell you that you have to be home because you're supposed to be over 21 and offer a signature when the box arrives.

I'd been told by text that the little box would arrive on September 23. It didn't. These things happen especially in Covid times. I know there aren't enough drivers. I know a driver's lot isn't always easy.

Still the FedEx website said it would be delivered the next day. It wasn't.

FedText. Information May Be Entirely Inaccurate.



Because I was signed up to receive FedEx updates by text I received another update: ""Hi your package is now out for delivery today 9/25. Adult signature -- identification required.""

This made me oddly cheered. FedEx was working hard to deliver my box on a Saturday. Yes it did mean one of us would have to be home but hey it had been three days now. This was surely good news.

But then at 3.28 p.m another text: ""Delivery attempt: 09/25/2021. Time: 2.36 p.m. A reattempt will happen on the next business day.""

How odd. We were both home at 2.36 p.m. And we feel sure that no one came to the door because we were sitting mere feet from it. Moreover when FedEx usually comes and we're not home the driver always leaves a tag on the door. There was no tag.

I did what many might do. I went to FedEx's website to check for the new delivery date. The following Tuesday it said.

By this time -- though Brown's tweet made me feel I wasn't alone -- I was a little miffed.

Fed(Up)Ex Let's Have A Chat.



My miffedness rose exponentially when FedEx texted me at 12:02 p.m. on the following day -- a Sunday -- to tell me that 11 minutes previously it had tried to deliver my package. This I felt sure was again bilge. Annoying bilge too.

So given that I'd been stuck at home waiting for my delivery I contacted FedEx customer service chat.

It was at least helpful. ""I apologize for the confusion but the package has not been placed on the truck out for delivery.""

The alleged delivery attempt then was fake. All made up.

When will it be delivered I asked. Monday said the chat confidently.

I went to the FedEx website. It said delivery would be Tuesday. It also claimed that the Sunday delivery had indeed been attempted and the problem was: ""Customer not available or business closed.""

The package was delivered on Monday. The driver didn't ask for a signature. I really don't mind this at all. Drivers can leave things on the doorstep. It's fine.

At this point it was time to investigate. It seemed that several people and several technological systems either weren't talking to each other or were each playing their own little game designed to wreck consumer moods.

FedEx's corporate types apologized and had their local managers call me. Only then did I begin to realize what the game truly was.

I had to explain that it didn't bother me that the delivery driver hadn't asked for a signature.

Instead it's the lies that get you isn't it? It's the inference that you the customer are at fault because you supposedly weren't at home when you were supposed to be. Even though you were.

When FedEx Happens To FedEx.



""This has happened to me"" explained the local FedEx delivery manager.

""What?""

""Yeah I've had these texts when I've actually been home.""

""But you work for FedEx.""

""Yeah.""

The manager then explained that because my delivery box had been scanned the text was automatically generated. Could it be then that drivers are pretending to attempt deliveries in order to fulfill some sort of quota and then making it someone else's problem?

That's how it seems. The manager continued that you always know if a real delivery was attempted because there'd be a tag left on the door. (Note to self: Relief. You're not mad.)

""I'm going to be having strong words with those drivers"" said the manager. ""They're not your regular drivers. Those work Monday to Friday.""

I explained it's annoying to be told that something was out for delivery when it wasn't.

""Those texts you got on Thursday and Friday"" she said. ""I don't understand them. We didn't even receive the box till Saturday. But the texts you got on Saturday and Sunday yeah that's not right.""

Citius. Altius. Altonus.



If Franz Kafka was still alive and realized the depths to which technology has dug what would he say? How loudly would he scream?

Ultimately why sign up for ""helpful"" texts when they turn out to be false? And why go to a website that constantly gives you the wrong date of delivery and even suggests that your business is closed?

But I know you're still worried about Alton Brown's delivery.

Well here's his follow-up tweet: ""57 minutes ago I tweeted about my @fedex issue and 1 minute ago an unmarked van sped up to the door and I have my package. I have to wonder what the non-twitter time would have been.""

Alton Brown enjoys 4.4 million Twitter followers.

FedEx's current tagline is ""Where Now Meets Next.""

Now could you make your next text more honest please FedEx?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWQtZXgtb3JiaXMtZG9uYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Donates $3.5 Million To Keep Orbis MD-10 Eye Hospital Flying,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWQtZXgtb3JiaXMtZG9uYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvc2FpbnRzL2RvdWctd2lsbGlhbXMtb25lLXByb3VkLWZhdGhlci10by1zZWUtc29uLWQtai1hcy1zYWludHMtb2ZmZW5zaXZlLWFzc2lzdGFudC1hdC9hcnRpY2xlX2YwZGUyN2NjLTI5ZTgtMTFlYy05YmNlLTg3MTVmZjA1MDljZC5odG1s0gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vbGEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zYWludHMvZG91Zy13aWxsaWFtcy1vbmUtcHJvdWQtZmF0aGVyLXRvLXNlZS1zb24tZC1qLWFzLXNhaW50cy1vZmZlbnNpdmUtYXNzaXN0YW50LWF0L2FydGljbGVfZjBkZTI3Y2MtMjllOC0xMWVjLTliY2UtODcxNWZmMDUwOWNkLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doug Williams one proud father to see son D.J. as Saints' offensive assistant at FedEx Field,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Kenya Airways currently operates a direct route to New York but no American airlines are flying into Kenya

The new agreement will be especially beneficial for Cargo powerhouse FedEx who are looking to set-up a base at Jomo-Kenyatta international airport to kick-start cargo operations

The National Assembly’s Transport committee in a report to the House said commencement of FedEx cargo operations and a base in Kenya would have a multiplier effect on the Kenyan economy

They had entered the game ranked fifth in the nation with 275.8 yards per game.Shepherd now stands second in the FCS in rushing scores with nine on the season. The signal-caller was effective through the air as well as he finished 8-of-11 for 109 yards.The Owls scored on their opening drive running 7:11 off the clock on a 12-play 51-yard drive that resulted in a 35-yard field goal attempt for an early 3-0 lead. After forcing a three-and-0 on Hampton's first possession of the game the Owls started the next drive on their own 23-yard line.That's when a downpour hit the game and would be a factor in three fumbles over the rest of the opening quarter including at the end of an 39-yard rush by Shepherd up the middle from just past midfield. He was hit right at the 15-yard line though and the Pirates came up with the ball. After another three-and-out the Owls again marched back down to the red zone and had a second and goal at the three-yard line before fumbling the ball out of the back of the end zone giving a touchback to Hampton. KSU though came up with its own forced fumble on the very next play thanks tothat was recovered byat the 25-yard line. The Owls took five plays to get in the end zone for the first time scoring on Shepherd's three-yard TD run for a 10-0 edge with 13:47 to play.KSU added to its lead with 3:32 to play in the first half whentook the option pitch from Shepherd and ran almost untouched down the right sideline for a 36-yard score on fourth and one. That put the Owls ahead 17-0.Hampton broke its scoring drought in the final minutes of the half thanks to a 41-yard touchdown pass over the Owls' defensive coverage to the back of the end zone. Hampton's ensuring two-point try was no good while KSU went 61 yards in the final 68 seconds of the half before32-yard field goal made the score 20-6 at the break.Hampton scored off a short field goal on the first possession of the second half to close within 20-9. The Owls put the game away with two more Shepherd touchdowns a five-yard near the end of the third and a three-yard early in the fourth for a 34-9 edge with just under 13 minutes to play.While Shepherd gained most of the notable stats on the offensive side it was a team defensive effort for the Owls. Spottsville finished with a team-high seven tackles in addition to his forced fumble whilewas next with six including five solo tackles. Hampton was held to 276 total yards in the game and was just 3-of-10 on third down conversions. KSU meanwhile converted 8-of-12 on third down and was perfect on its two fourth down tries.The Owls are back in action next week as they return home for a homecoming contest against North Carolina A&T on Saturday Oct. 16.

Roush Fenway Racing will be among the group and the organization has set the stage by revealing Chris Buescher‘s Next Gen No. 17 Ford Mustang.

The team tweeted out multiple photos of the stock car on Wednesday October 6 showing off the No. 17 with the Fifth Third Bank sponsor scheme. The design featured the numbers at the front of the doors the single-lug wheels and the revamped body that more closely resembles Ford Mustangs that are available in showrooms around the country.

The design automatically created numerous conversations on social media. Several fans expressed excitement about the new body style and how the lack of a spoiler was a great design choice. Others however continued to argue about NASCAR moving the numbers forward to provide more space for sponsors in 2022.

According to FOX Sports reporter Bob Pockrass there should be more than 20 drivers in attendance. The list includes Alex Bowman Chase Elliott Cole Custer Chase Briscoe Austin Cindric Ryan Blaney Joey Logano Tyler Reddick Buescher Martin Truex Jr. Denny Hamlin Ricky Stenhouse Jr. Bubba Wallace Daniel Suarez Ross Chastain Justin Haley Erik Jones Cody Ware Ty Dillon and Timmy Hill. Boris Said could also make an appearance while working alongside Hill.

Buescher Is Fresh off a Season-Best Finish at Talladega

The driver of the No. 17 will head to the Charlotte Roval for the test just over a week removed from turning in a season-best finish at Talladega Superspeedway. Buescher locked up a sixth-place finish in the rain-shortened race his sixth top-10 of the season.

The driver of the No. 17 started the day 24th overall while the playoff drivers lined up in the first six rows. However he did not remain near the middle of the pack for very long. Buescher worked his way to 17th overall before the competition caution on Lap 27. He then continued moving through the field taking the lead prior to the stage-ending wreck involving Kyle Larson Justin Allgaier William Byron and Chase Briscoe.

Buescher continued to race near the front of the pack for the remaining laps. Though none of the drivers reached the end of Stage 2 due to a late wreck as well as the approaching rain. NASCAR flew the caution flag on Lap 117 for a four-car incident bringing the race to a halt with Buescher in the sixth position. Once the rain began falling once again NASCAR called the race complete declaring Bubba Wallace the winner and cementing Buescher’s season-best finish.

Buescher’s Remaining Schedule Will Feature a New Crew Chief

When Buescher heads to the Charlotte Roval on Sunday October 10 for the Bank of America Roval 400 he will join forces with a different crew chief. He will work alongside Scott Graves.

Roush Fenway Racing’s change will put Graves and Buescher together for the first time in the Cup Series but they have considerable success together at the Xfinity Series level. The two men combined for three wins in 2014 and 2015 as well as the 2015 championship.

While Graves heads over to the No. 17 team Luke Lambert will reunite with Ryan Newman. He and the driver of the No. 6 previously worked together at Richard Childress Racing from 2014 until 2018 resulting in one win and a spot in the 2014 championship race.

With shipping options already radically reduced by Covid-19 the micro-factory set out across the Baltic Atlantic and Mediterranean seas via the Suez Canal stopping by Saudi Arabia India and Sri Lanka landing at last in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. From there it went by truck through the developing rural landscape over the Ngorongoro crater wall at 2640 metres above sea level across the great Namiri plains and up to the Mara river. It’s a big change of scene from a noisy industrial site in Sweden to a peaceful eco-tourism camp in northern Serengeti.

It had taken Wayout 18 months to go from idea to complete product. The result is a module that converts sunshine and local groundwater into pristine potable water – and which can also produce premium craft beer and soft drinks. A single module puts out 150000 litres of clean remineralised water per month and lets whoever operates it serve up to eight different types of drinks through the integrated tap station. The micro-factory is offered for lease and the fully automated beverage production is done via a desktop app letting the local operator – and Wayout in Stockholm – monitor and control the process remotely. The system in the Serengeti is powered through a 110 kWp solar field with the energy stored in 2000Ah OPzS batteries.

In the Serengeti water is abundant but not fit for drinking. The natural mineral content is extreme making it corrosive to teeth and internal organs and the unique ecosystem – including the famous “great migration” of wildebeest – makes the living soil busy with bacterial processes. That is why the micro-factory takes its source water from a local groundwater bore hole and filters it through an advanced integrated treatment system that removes all impurities before remineralising it for optimal taste and quality.

“It started out as a fun project between friends at a moment when craft beer and micro-brewing was a thing” says Martin Renck one of Wayout’s three founders. The first system was developed to be used in the hospitality industry and by major breweries and beverage brands that seek to produce locally and sustainably. As the trio started pitching the concept to prospective clients they hadn’t realised how urgent the issue of water purification was. “When we listened to the feedback we got – not just in Africa but from all around the warm regions of the planet – it became clear that it was the mineral water that was the really remarkable thing. We realised we not only had a commercial opportunity but also a greater mission to take on” Renck says.

Touching down on the red dirt track at the Kogatende Airstrip in Northern Serengeti the infrastructural challenges of the region become instantly clear. Here the dynamics of the natural world still rule; scorching days followed by chilly nights dry seasons followed by torrential rains wildebeest and zebras followed by big cats and hyenas with termites boomslangs hyraxes aardvarks and pangolins filling the gaps. Roads and rivers meander with the seasons. Man-made structures morph and merge with biomass. Good quality drinking water may be as far away as a few days by four-wheel drive and the distribution logistics leave scars in the sensitive biotope. The effects of the Wayout micro-factory in this location have been profound.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2F6YmlnbWVkaWEuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2NvbW1lcmNpYWwtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvY29uc3RydWN0aW9uL21jY2FydGh5LWNvbXBsZXRlcy1zdW4tc3RyZWFtcy0yLXNvbGFyLXByb2plY3QtaW4td2VzdC12YWxsZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McCarthy completes Sun Streams 2 solar project in West Valley,"McCarthy Building Companies’ Renewable Energy and Storage Group recently completed construction and final commissioning of the 200-megawatt (MW dc ) Sun Streams 2 solar project in Maricopa County Arizona.

The project is situated on more than 1000 acres in Arlington Ariz. located approximately 40 miles west of Phoenix. McCarthy’s Renewable Energy and Storage Group served as Engineer Procure Construct (EPC) contractor for the project which is now owned by Longroad Energy a U.S.-based renewable energy developer owner and operator. Longroad Energy acquired the project from First Solar in early 2021.

Sun Streams 2 has more than 450000 First Solar Series 6 modules it also includes a substation expansion. McCarthy’s self-perform field forces installed all modules 5805 NEXTracker trackers 53 SMA MWPS-4000 inverter skids all DC wiring and combiner boxes and all underground 34.5 kV AC collection wiring. The project employed more than 250 local workers for its construction and recruitment was primarily conducted in Buckeye and Goodyear Arizona. In an effort to help recruit new people into careers in clean energy McCarthy employs extensive hands-on training and mentorship to assist entry-level craft workers and those with limited experience in solar construction to develop the skills needed to launch their careers in the growing clean energy industry.

“Building solar plants in sunny Arizona has always made sense and the fact that we were able to recruit and train more than 250 workers from the local community for careers in this rapidly expanding industry makes this project even more impactful” said Scott Canada senior vice president of the Renewable Energy and Storage group at McCarthy. “Longroad was a great partner to have on the final construction and commissioning of this solar project in part because we share a commitment to bringing solar power and its economic benefits to communities across the nation. We’re looking forward to future partnerships with them as they expand their footprint in Arizona and elsewhere.”

“We are extremely pleased with the completion and commercial operation of Sun Streams 2. McCarthy’s performance on this project was exemplary. We look forward to working on many more projects with them in Arizona and across the U.S.” said Michael Alvarez COO of Longroad Energy.

Sun Streams 2 is one of four Maricopa County-based projects that Longroad acquired from First Solar in February 2021. The PV and storage portfolio totals approximately 900 MWdc with the potential for 1-2 GWh of battery storage.

Sun Streams 3 4 and 5 are development projects with target operational dates between 2023 and 2025. These projects are ideally positioned to accommodate a variety of offtake structures with or without storage. The projects are expected to generate over $40 million for Arizona’s schools via a long-term lease with the Arizona State Land Department and over $5 million in tax revenue.

The Sun Streams projects mark a growing presence in Arizona for Longroad. The company owns other operating solar projects in the state as well as an existing development portfolio. Longroad’s affiliate Longroad Energy Services is the asset manager and operator and is providing remote monitoring services to the project over the long term.

Since 2010 McCarthy’s Renewable Energy & Storage Group has completed more than 50 utility-scale clean energy projects in communities across the country delivering a combined capacity of approximately 5 Gigawatts (GW) of clean energy production and over 340 MW / 770MWh of energy storage. Nationally McCarthy provides EPC services on utility-scale solar projects for private solar developers and utilities helping them deliver cost-effective clean energy to the communities they serve.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvbGFyLXBvd2VyZWQtYXN5bW1ldHJpYy10aHJlZS13aGVlbGVyLWdldHMtcmVhZHktdG8tcmFjZS1hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLW1vcm9jY2FuLXNhaGFyYS0xNzEzNDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar-Powered Asymmetric Three-Wheeler Gets Ready to Race Across the Moroccan Sahara,"The Vattenfall Solar Team is presenting Luna11 an asymmetric three-wheeler with an angled solar panel that can run for thousands of miles without using a single drop of fuel. With Nuna11 the team plans to take part in the Solar Challenge Morocco a brand new solar race across the Moroccan Sahara.

Described as the ""Picasso of solar cars"" the team's new machine features a special design that sets it apart: it sports two wheels on the right and one on the left. This form not only makes it look asymmetric but also optimizes the solar car 's aerodynamics giving it less rolling resistance.""Traditional three-wheelers have the third wheel in the middle either at the front or at the rear. The air then has to pass around a wheel in three places. By opting for two wheels on the right before and after the driver and one wheel on the left we have air resistance in only two places"" explains team leader Christiaan Wiers.But integrating this design also left the team with a major challenge in terms of the steering system. Because the wheels on the solar car were not on the same axis as in regular vehicles they had to work together to handle corners safely. It took a lot of dedication to turn this thing into a reality but the folks from Vattenfall made it possible.With a new motor controller designed in-house that combines power with efficiency Nuna11 is now ready for the solar race.""With Nuna11 we can now accelerate faster climb better and hold our own in city traffic. That's ideal for a race like Morocco"" says team member Jasper Insinger.The Vattenfall Solar Team will take part with their unique three-wheeler in this year's Solar Challenge Morocco . The race is set to start on October 25th and will last five days.

Now a Dutch-based blended finance manager Climate Fund Managers (CFM) and Solar Water Solutions are working together to develop the installation of up to 200 desalination units in Kitui County Kenya. The project eventually aims to provide clean water made of brackish groundwater for 400000 Kenyans by 2023.

The new solar-powered desalination system works without connecting to a grid without any batteries or chemicals ever. This means the system will need zero battery investments zero running costs have zero emissions and zero carbon footprint.

The team working on the project claims that their containerized SolarRO reverse osmosis system is the world’s first desalination system powered by 100% solar energy. This fully automatic standalone system is installed in a 20ft container. The system will convert from 3500 L/h up to 7000 L/h from seawater with total dissolved solids (TDS) 36000 ppm. The production capacity is up to 10000 liters per hour from brackish water powered entirely by solar panels.

“Through this partnership with CFM and locally with Kitui County and Epicenter Africa we can together revolutionize access to safe affordable water in rural Kenya” said Antti Pohjola CEO of Solar Water Solutions. “This project marks a breakthrough in solar-powered water infrastructure. It wouldn’t have happened without the four key elements: A sustainable technology that brings down the cost of clean water access to finance with a leading institutional investor local partners and a market-based business model.”

These asteroids are believed to be the remnants of the early solar system and studying them will help scientists understand its origins and evolution and why it looks the way it does.

The solar-powered mission is estimated to be over 12 years long during the course of which the spacecraft will visit eight asteroids covering a distance of about 6.3 billion km to deepen the understanding of the “young solar system”.

The mission is named after ‘Lucy’ a 3.2 million-year-old ancestor who belonged to a species of hominins (which include humans and their ancestors).

The spacecraft’s first encounter will be with an asteroid that lies in the main belt that can be found between Mars and Jupiter. This asteroid is named ‘Donald Johnson’ after the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossilised remains of ‘Lucy’.

When will ‘Lucy’ be launched?

The spacecraft will launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Florida on an Atlas V 401 rocket during a 21-day launch period that will start on October 16 2021. Subsequently the spacecraft will fly by the Earth twice in order to use the planet’s gravitational field to assist it on its journey to the asteroids.

What is the aim of this mission?

NASA says that as per some planet formation and evolution models the Trojan asteroids are believed to be formed from the same material that led to the formation of planets nearly 4 billion years ago when the solar system was formed.

Therefore the mission is designed to understand the composition of the diverse asteroids that are a part of the Trojan asteroid swarms to determine the mass and densities of the materials and to look for and study the satellites and rings that may orbit the Trojan asteroids.

Where and what are the Trojan asteroids?

Asteroids are divided into three categories.

First those found in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This region is estimated to contain somewhere between 1.1-1.9 million asteroids.

The second group is that of trojans (the name comes from Greek mythology) which are asteroids that share an orbit with a larger planet. NASA reports the presence of Jupiter Neptune and Mars trojans. In 2011 they reported an Earth trojan as well.

The Jupiter asteroids can be found in what are referred to as “swarms” that lead and follow the planet Jupiter along its orbit around the Sun. ‘Lucy’ will reach the first swarm of these asteroids that precede Jupiter by August 2027.

The third classification of asteroids is under Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) which has orbits that pass close to the Earth. Those that cross the Earth’s orbit are called Earth-crossers. More than 10000 such asteroids are known of which over 1400 are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs).

The statue was unveiled in May but lingering pandemic restrictions prevented a larger audience then.

No matter because the weather was perfect as noted by Miriam Ray founder of the campaign that brought the statue to the new roundabout at South Main and East Mill streets. The Rubber Worker Statue & Akron Stories Project also is accumulating stories from workers and their families in an oral history project online.

Many of those in attendance were former rubber workers or their families who examined commemorative bricks at a plaza across the street from the statue where a touchscreen kiosk tells the story of Akron’s rise to the rubber capital of the world.

Shirley Werner of Akron came to the event to see the statue and the bricks for her father and husband. Fred Kirsh her father worked in the industry from 1917 to 1959 riding the bus to work every day she said.

“The end of the line was at the bottom of our street” she said. “He never talked about [work] much.”

Her husband worked at Firestone for 23 years starting in 1962 as a mechanical engineer.

Derreck Collins of Wadsworth came to view the bricks dedicated to his maternal and paternal grandfathers.

Collins recalled a visit to his grandfather John Rufus Houston’s house when his grandfather reached into his top pocket and pulled out a container of pills.

“These are salt tablets” his grandfather told him. “The give them to us at Goodrich.”

His grandfather told him temperatures could get to 100 degrees where he worked and the tablets replenished salt sweated out during the work shift.

At the retirement party of his other grandfather Edgar Collins Sr. Derreck Collins got to view the Goodyear building.

“It looked like Fort Knox” he said.

Marco Sommerville deputy mayor for intergovernmental affairs said the statue is a key part of the renovation of downtown.

""This statue stands as a testament to the working people of Akron"" he said.

Akron Historian David Lieberth told attendees that the rubber industry brought great wealth to the city. At one time Akron contained the headquarters of five of the six largest tire companies. In 1920 Akron was home to 100 millionaires.

“We’ve had statues to the giants of the industry” he said. “… Now there’s a statue to all the people who actually labored to achieve those accomplishments.”

Amelia Moton-Butler of Akron said she her father and three sisters worked for the rubber companies. She worked in the payroll service department and spent 46 years with Firestone.

During a strike in the 1970s Moton-Butler said she would pass her dad on the picket line as she went to work.

Moton-Butler said she remembers the company picnics thrown by the unions.

“Every year they gave away a car” she said. “One year [my dad] won a car.”

Retired rubber worker Barbara Duboise of Akron said her father and husband worked for Goodrich. She also worked in the industry eventually landing a job in the law department.

“It was the greatest job ever” she said.

Helen Surbey of Springfield Township said her grandfather got a job as a rubber worker after emigrating from Romania in 1912. He served stints as a groundskeeper at the Firestone mansion on West Market Street and a custodian at Goodrich headquarters.

Her father also worked in the industry she said.

“In 1942 my dad went off to war” she said. “When he came back they gave him those years of service.”

Her brother added a third generation starting in the print shop — like Surbey’s father — and shifting to sales. Surbey said her father would smell like fresh paper when he came home from work.

Felita Grice of Akron started working in the industry when she was 17. Her father had died and she decided it was time to take care of herself.

She remembers the tire recall in 1977 when 400000 tires were recalled.

“The phones never stopped ringing” she said.

She said when she started her first job she was awed by the Firestone complex which was like another world within the city with a hospital bank chauffeur service and barber shop.

“When they gave parties there was no distinction of level” she said. “… It was just great to be part of that.”

Following the dedication a VIP event was held with sculptor Alan Cottrill ""Wheels of Fortune: The Story of Rubber in Akron "" authors Steve Love and David Giffels and Mac Love co-founder of Art x Love and compiler of Akron Stories.

Love said the statue and plaza with bricks and kiosk will serve as an enduring memorial to the working men and women of the rubber industry.

“There’s not a day when I come down here that there’s not a person viewing the statue” he said.

It was the first time the trio have played in the preseason for the Milwaukee Bucks and they helped the Bucks score an astounding 81 first half points.

Antetokounmpo Holiday and Middleton each played 17 minutes in the first half and combined for 33 points on 14 of 21 shooting (66.7%) 16 rebounds and 12 assists as the Bucks took a 81-54 first half lead.

""A lot of the core group came back so the camaraderie's there"" Holiday said. ""We do have to kind of install some people but I think the way that they play kind of fits our style and that's been good for us. And then having the short offseason it's kind of like you never really stopped.

""It just seemed really really comfortable out there even though it seemed like the guys didn't really have the legs that they wanted or we couldn't play 48 minutes but yeah it felt good out there.""

It was an impressive return to competition for Antetokounmpo who just began practicing in a five-on-five setting on Wednesday. It has been a gradual ramp up for the reigning NBA Finals Most Valuable Player as he is still working his way back from a sprained left knee in the Eastern Conference Finals.

The two-time league MVP looked sharp flashing to the basket with his signature burst and strength slinging a left-handed pass to Middleton for a dunk and shaking the stanchion with his own flush off an offensive rebound. He had eight points on 4 of 9 shooting nine rebounds six assists and a steal.

""It feels good"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I'm not gonna lie it feels good to be part of the team just go out there run up and down and make some plays just be around the team competing here at the Fiserv it feels good.""

Middleton (hamstring) and Holiday (knee) weren’t missing practices but Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said he would err on the side of caution with his key players during the training camp period.

Middleton opened the game making all six of his shots and scoring 14 points in the first half from a dunk to his patented midrange jumpers to a couple of threes. Holiday made four of his six shots in his first half including getting to the “dunker” spot baseline to receive passes.

More:Giannis and Khris: A partnership forged through years of battles to push each other and the Milwaukee Bucks to the pinnacle of the NBA

Joining the “big three” in the starting lineup were center Brook Lopez and guard Grayson Allen who was acquired in an offseason trade with Memphis. With guard Donte DiVincenzo still recovering from ankle surgery it was easy to assume Allen would hold his place but Sunday was the first chance for that group to run together against an opponent.

Allen looked comfortable with the regular starters taking advantage of open spacing to hit five of his nine first half shots for 13 points.

""For me it felt great playing out there with those guys"" Allen said. ""It felt a very easy game for me personally. It's a really fun offense to play in with those guys. They're all swinging the ball early. They're all playing with their head up.

""Jrue Giannis and Khris are such great scorers too but the fact that they have their head up like that looking for other guys makes it really fun to me so I can just roam and find an open lane and just give those guys some space.""

Allen and Lopez were the only starters to see second half action with the second unit and Allen finished with 13 points in 23 minutes and Lopez had 11 points in 20 minutes. Pat Connaughton had 12 points in 18 minutes.

Jordan Nwora got a few minutes with the starters and played 20 minutes. He led the Bucks in scoring with 15 points.

There was a Milwaukee flavor on the opposite bench as former Bucks big men Mamadi Diakite and D.J. Wilson were on the court for Oklahoma City. Diakite was tremendously popular by teammates and fans alike and was part of the championship team. He was waived by the Bucks before training camp and was claimed by the Thunder.

Diakite went head-to-head with Antetokounmpo on a few occasions and the Thunder forward had six points and two rebounds in 16 minutes.

Wilson was a first-round pick for the Bucks in 2017 but he contributed to the Bucks’ title run by being part of the deal that brought P.J. Tucker to the Bucks. Wilson played 13 minutes pulling down seven rebounds and scoring two points.

Josh Giddey the No. 6 overall pick in the draft for the Thunder had nine points six points and six rebounds in 26 minutes.

The Bucks scored 81 points in the first half and at one point led by more (37) than the Thunder had points (33). Milwaukee made 64% of its 50 field goal attempts including 12 of its 21 three-pointers to score that many. All 12 players who saw court time for the Bucks scored led by Middleton (14) Allen (13) and Holiday (11).

Of the Bucks starters Lopez was the one who spent more time with the second unit while Connaughton and Nwora each got their turn as part of the “small” lineup.

Despite the fact the entire team had yet to play together through two preseason games Budenholzer had said after the game in Brooklyn that the team had been having good practices. That looked to be the case as the Bucks jumped out to a 9-0 lead to start the game and led 48-32 after one quarter. They gradually built their first half lead to as many as 37 points on several different occasions.

""They've been practicing well the focus has been good I think for them to come out and play in front of people play against another team was kind of that next step"" Budenholzer said of the starters. ""I like the way the ball's moving the way guys are finding open people and then also in attack mode drive kick spacing.

""They've got to keep building on it. But I think for those guys it was a good kind of the next progression from camp for that group to play together tonigh

Lou Dort led the Thunder with 19 points while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 12 and six assists all in the first half.

Some Bucks still injured

While the game marked the return of Antetokounmpo Middleton and Holiday the team was still without new acquisitions Semi Ojeleye (calf) and Rodney Hoot (midfoot soreness). The pair were injured shortly after the start of camp the last week of September and have not played in an exhibition game yet. Hood practiced for the first time in some time Thursday.

In late September the Ford Motor Company revealed its plans to build a battery plant and a truck assembly plant in the West Tennessee community of Stanton outside of Memphis at the Memphis Regional Megasite development. Ford and SK Innovation will invest $5.6 billion to build a 3600-acre mega campus called Blue Oval City in Haywood County where production of the next generation of all-electric F-Series trucks will begin in 2025.

The move adds to the state's already blossoming manufacturing industry stretching from Columbia to Memphis. The region can look to Maury County to catch a glimpse of how such an industry presence can shape a city and its surrounding area.

“This is a watershed moment for Tennesseans as we lead the future of the automotive industry and advanced manufacturing” Gov Bill Lee said recently about Ford's announcement.

Maury County has already experienced its share of watershed moments this year — as the fastest growing county in Tennessee according to the 2020 U.S Census and ranking No. 1 in incoming investments in the state by think-tank SmartAsset.

County leaders weigh-in on local prosperity

In Maury County Ryder System Inc. which supports GM’s operations at the Spring Hill plant is the county's second largest employer following GM. The presence of GM has also shined light on the need for supply companies close by.

The company is a transportation logistics and supply chain solutions operation that employs more than 1000 union workers contributing to GM’s team of more than 3200 workers.

“As a leading third-party logistics provider for the automotive industry Ryder manages the operations of some of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers” Steve Sensing president of global supply chain solutions for Ryder told The Daily Herald.

""As part of that we regularly recruit and train people on behalf of our customers. With the automotive industry’s roots in Tennessee going back to the 1980s we’re fortunate to have access to a workforce that has four decades of experience and is more than three times the size of the national average.""

Ryder continues to invest in the area by recruiting workers and providing training programs for the next generation.

""And as vehicle manufacturers continue to invest in the area Ryder continues to invest in training and retention programs to ensure we have the best possible workforce in place for our customers” Sensing said.

Already established as an automotive giant Maury County is also making its mark in the manufacturing industry as a whole which is a major factor in shaping its future.

Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles who says he's focused on building business and industry in Maury County praises the most recent $4.3 billion expansions at the GM plant.

“We are a low-tax state and a rights-to-work state” Ogles said.

He explained workers in the state are gaining a good reputation building credibility with some of the world’s largest corporations.

“Tennesseans are known for their work ethic” Ogles said. “We are a friendly people and all of those factors are important if you are a General Motors or a Ford.”

News about previous success is starting to spread.

“The fact that you can operate at lower costs and will have hard workers if you are investing millions of dollars you have to make sure there is a return on that investment"" Ogles said. ""And Tennessee has been proven to be one of the best states in the country to do that.”

Sen. Joey Hensley R-Hohenwald said the state's emphasis on savings also serves as a point of interest for large businesses.

“Tennessee in generally is a fiscally responsible state” Hensley said. “It is a right-to-work state people like to live here and companies like to deal with us here. We have low taxes. When you look at other states like California the cost of business is astronomical. They can do business here a lot cheaper and get good workers.”

Hensley's statement proves true with the May relocation of the JC Ford company headquarters from California to Columbia investing $30 million and bringing 210 new jobs. The tortilla machine-maker which has contributed to the production of products like Doritos chose Columbia as its next home because of lower taxes.

Connie Ruhe 88 matriarch of the JC Ford Company family said she told her son Scott Ruhe company president ""you ought to jump on it"" in purchasing a manufacturing facility in Maury County.

""It's about the low taxes people and schools that brought us here"" Ruhe said.

Hensley said the absence of a state income tax also allures companies.

“That is a bigger deal than most people realize” Hensley said. “They can get help from the state and counties and cities are willing to help them. We want businesses to come here.”

A buzzing manufacturing hub

Maury County has attracted 37 economic projects bringing more than 6400 jobs and $5.5 billion in capital investments since 2014.

Of those projects almost $4.3 billion has been generated in just the past 18 months following the two GM announcements in creating the luxury electric SUV the Lyriq ($2 billion) and the construction of the 2.8-million-square-foot Ultium battery facility ($2.3 billion) on Nashville Highway at the plant's site.

More:'Secret's out': How Maury County became the fastest growing county in Tennessee

In the last five years Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development has supported nearly 20 economic development projects in Maury County accounting for approximately 4000 job commitments and more than $3 billion in capital investment.

Projects have included the 2015 announcement of Landmark Ceramics’ $80 million project constructing a now fully-operational 600000-square-foot facility on 96 acres in Maury County bringing 180 new jobs.

In 2019 Mersen which works with businesses in the energy electronics transportation chemical pharmaceuticals and process industries opened an operation. The company announced it would invest up to $65 million and hire 100 local employees reawakening part of a vacant Union Carbide facility that previously employed generations of workers in Columbia.

The facility is the global manufacturer’s 10th U.S. location.

During the same time the $60.9 million dollar manufacturing facility of the Japanese auto parts maker Fuel Total Systems opened in the Cherry Glen Industrial Park in Mt. Pleasant bringing 150 new jobs to the region.

The plant remains the largest addition to the Maury County-owned industrial complex which broke ground on its first 50000-square foot facility in August of 2016.

An established workforce

Maury County Chamber and Economic Alliance President Wil Evans spends much of his time facilitating deals that bring major businesses to the region and the lucrative jobs that come with them.

“There are a lot of factors at play” Evans said. “Tennessee is a very business-friendly state. Looking over the past 10 years Nashville has really grown and come into its own and so has the greater region. We still are an affordable option in the region while also offering a high quality of life and a low tax burden.”

He said the quality of the region’s workforce has also been a major contributing factor in bringing enterprise to the region keeping them and attracting more industry giants.

“We have been very advantageous in the workforce that we have here while still being able to draw on the Nashville market as well” Evans said.

Bob Rolfe commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic Development said the recent announcement of Ford just adds to the state's booming automotive industry which will be felt across the state.

“The ripple effect resulting from these projects will be transformational for our state especially West Tennessee and we are most grateful for this enormous investment and the addition of two top global brands"" Rolfe said.

It was Oct. 3 2011 and he was reporting for his new job at the company that would become electric-car maker Rivian. His boss R.J. Scaringe emerged limping badly.

Scaringe had a crush on a woman doing a half-marathon. He had run it with her.

“Did you train for it?” Moczydlowski asked.

“Not really.”

Cold-starting a 13-mile race with a romantic interest takes confidence perseverance and a healthy dose of naivete. The same chemistry helps start a car company.

When he ran his race Scaringe was about four years into building the company that would become Rivian. Now the Irvine California-based startup which an IPO around this coming Thanksgiving may value as high as $80 billion has a multibillion-dollar contract with Amazon to build delivery vans and this month has started delivering its first production vehicle a $67500 luxury pod to customers. Dubbed R1T the electric pickup is aimed at rocky trailheads and Whole Foods parking lots and resembles a traditional pickup worked over by a scrum of Apple designers.

Billion-dollar startups tend to share a triumphalist origin story: a neurotically focused founder with an unwavering vision. This isn’t what was happening in Florida the day that Moczydlowski showed up.

'He wasn't an electric guy'

A Rivian started out as an affordable tiny sports car then an expensive supercar then became an austere pickup aimed at Middle Eastern drivers scratching at life near the poverty line. None of those machines made headway and the company sputtered at the brink of insolvency. The only reason Rivian isn’t on the scrapheap of automotive history – the only reason its investment bankers are claiming it’s worth more than Ford Motor Co. – is its adaptability.

“One of the most important human characteristics … for progress for creating improved environments is humility and the ability to listen to others” Scaringe said last month. His reactions to the wants of others resulted in Rivian’s 12-year gestation which began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In the mid-2000s the school’s Sloan Automotive Laboratory housed a silver 1976 Porsche 914 that graduate students were converting into an electric vehicle. Scaringe a doctoral candidate from Rockledge Florida walked by the car nearly every day but scarcely touched it.

Instead Scaringe spent his time trying to perfect exhaust-gas recirculation and valve timing and taking manufacturing courses. “He wasn’t an electric guy” said classmate Emmanuel Kasseris. “He was a car guy.”

On Feb. 4 2009 his final year Scaringe showed up for a seminar by Daniel Roos and James Womack faculty members and authors of a sweeping automotive history “The Machine That Changed the World.” “It was at the end of the first class” Womack said. “He walks up to me and says ‘I’ve got a new idea for a car company. Let me tell you about it.’”

Degree in hand Scaringe went home to Florida to start it. He may have learned manufacturing in a classroom but his entrepreneurial model was close to home. His father Robert is also an engineer with a scrappy shop called Mainstream Engineering. There the elder Scaringe invents stuff largely for the Department of Defense: diesel engines water-processing units and a system to make medical-grade oxygen from ambient air to name a few.

R.J. Scaringe set up shop in the same cluster of buildings naming his own endeavor Mainstream Motors. Scaringe has said he didn’t fully understand the complexities ahead. “A very low probability of success” he admitted in an internal video last year.

“The only way to start was to start” he said on a podcast in February 2020. “Lots of U-turns lots of twists lots of turns lots of gut punches. Overall just brute force built it.”

'The Blue Thing'

Scaringe recruited about 15 designers and engineers who bought into his vision: a sports car that combined high performance and fuel efficiency with a low price.

They were a fiercely committed bunch. Brian Gase the fourth employee said he left his job interview thinking “these people are crazy. They believe they can do something they don’t know how to do and I was hooked.”

Scaringe didn’t think he could sell more than about 40000 cars a year. With cagey manufacturing and lightweight materials he wouldn’t charge more than $25000.

Instead of a steel frame he would use lightweight aluminum. Instead of steel body panels Scaringe envisioned thermoplastic sheets. Mainstream would piece together its coupe in four modules like a kid’s toy. There would be no metal-stamping machines and no paint shop — two of the most expensive parts of any conventional plant.

The team worked incessantly once stringing together four consecutive all-nighters. Scaringe would take everybody to lunch on Fridays and every winter they would decamp to Daytona to watch a 24-hour race bleary-eyed amid the screaming engines.

“It truly was tribal” said Renee Templeton former head of human resources. “I’m not even sure everyone had job titles.”

After about a year the tribe had plans for a prototype; the engine was an afterthought. Scaringe shipped the files to a contract manufacturer in Detroit along with a Mini Cooper. The instructions according to Chris Auerbach a seminal employee were to build the car plop in the Mini’s engine and send back the whole package in a crate.

The prototype dubbed “the Blue Thing” rolled off the truck in Florida in fall 2010. A photo marking the occasion shows the team with wide grins that belie reality: The car was nowhere near ready for production or even driving. It looked like a Honda hatchback in a gawky teenage phase.

Nevertheless a car is a car and the Blue Thing would serve for pitching investors.

'We didn't have money'

Scaringe organized a brain trust including Jim Thomas a former chief finance officer at MapQuest and Rick Wagoner a former chief executive officer of General Motors Co.

Doors were opened the calendar was scattered with meetings but nothing was taking hold. Scaringe and his father mortgaged their homes and rounded up $3.5 million in state funding. Employees agreed to house interns who’d gone to work for the startup. Raises were out of the question and the weekly snack budget was about $35.

“We didn’t have money” Templeton recalls. “We just didn’t have it.”

The machine Scaringe had so confidently conceived began to buckle under the financial pressure. “Week to week month to month the whole plan would change” Moczydlowski said. “It was really just a circular pattern: Let’s design something pitch it to an investor and you know kind of rinse and repeat.”

At one point the team was working on a spartan race car to woo a Brazilian investor. Then they shifted to a higher-performance higher-price version of their original idea.

“Pivots didn’t cost much money” Womack said.

Moczydlowski was laid off in February 2012 shortly before several co-workers. Auerbach decamped to culinary school.

In the tumult two words seldom arose: “electric” and “truck.”

'Our darkest moment'

Scaringe had set out to build a performance vehicle and “if you’re looking at a sports car market people were so afraid to lose the sound and smell of exhaust” Auerbach said.

But Scaringe just wanted to build something — it didn’t much matter what it looked like or even what it was called. Mainstream became Averra became Rivian inspired by the Indian River near Rockledge.

Ultimately that MIT seminar paid off. Roos the professor was good friends with Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel an MIT alumnus and CEO of Abdul Latif Jameel which owns car dealerships from Europe to Japan. Scaringe called in a favor.

A few months later he was sitting on a rug in the Saudi Arabian desert surrounded by smoky hookahs and dusty Toyotas. Over tea and sweets Jameel’s son Hassan gave Scaringe homework: Design an efficient rugged pickup — the lovechild of a Ford F-150 a Toyota Prius and a dune buggy.

Around year-end Scaringe sent ALJ rough plans and the company agreed to invest a nominal amount but nevertheless a lifeline for the frantic Florida skunkworks. By the time Rivian decamped to Detroit a few months later there were fewer than 10 employees.

Spartan and stamped out in high volume the desert machine would be at odds with Scaringe’s original concept: a precious piece of engineering for automotive savants. The truck part however was Scaringe’s long-shot chance.

“Shifting from the coupe to the truck space was our darkest moment” Gase said.

Ever-plusher pickups had long been the U.S. auto industry’s most profitable slice with General Motors Ford and the former Chrysler Group netting more than $10000 in profit per machine. American tastes were spreading across the globe.

The defining difference

ALJ by then a major investor shelved the desert truck idea and agreed to a more opulent pickup. Still Scaringe needed something to make Rivian’s machines drastically different — sexier — than the other rigs coming out of Detroit.

“He announced it at a board meeting one day” Womack said. “No one was expecting it: ‘I’ve made the decision this will be an all-electric vehicle. We don’t need to discuss this further.’”

By November 2018 Rivian had two prototypes to reveal a pickup and an SUV. The singer Rihanna then Hassan’s girlfriend did the honors at an annual Los Angeles auto show.

“My first impressions were that it looks really cool” said IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley. “It looks like a truck but it’s different; it does a really good job of communicating its technology.”

Orders began pouring in. They have since climbed to over 48000 according to the company’s S-1 filing.

Major competition

The woman Scaringe was chasing in that long-ago race is now his wife. His marathon with Rivian in many ways has just begun and it won’t be easy.

The startup may do for pickup trucks and SUVs what Tesla did for the family sedan. But the market for electric trucks and SUVs has steadily shrunk as the incumbent auto giants have fast-tracked plans for their own battery-powered workhorses. General Motors' GMC Hummer EV an $80000 rival is already being spotted in the wild. And Ford recently doubled production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning due out next year saying it has surpassed 150000 reservations.

To succeed Rivian’s vehicles will have to not just be novel but great. The first iterations rolling into the world have won praise but also display technical gremlins including rogue windshield wipers and an adaptive cruise control system on the blink. The company is barreling towards Wall Street with almost $1 billion in net losses in the first half of the year according to the SEC filing. Meanwhile the ranks of expectant customers are getting restless.

But Scaringe is beginning to find his footing and true to form he's running at full speed. He's also limping a little bit too."

After regaining his card on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2018 Homa finally broke through with his first win at the 2019 Wells Fargo Invitational. Now just over two years later Homa has three Tour wins on his resume after adding the 2021 Genesis Invitational in February and the 2021 Fortinet Championship in September.

Homa is now ranked 32nd in the world and is one of the game’s rising stars. During his appearance on this week’s episode of Subpar hosts Colt Knost and Drew Stoltz asked Homa if with three wins under his belt he finally believes that he’s one of the best players in the world.

“I actually am starting to believe. I really did start to believe it too after the Genesis even” Homa said. “It’s just it’s still practice for me. I don’t know what it is I just kind of deal with lower self esteem when it comes to golf. I guess this is kind of deep in a way but like I wasn’t a world-beater in college until my senior year so it caught late so now all the sudden I got catapulted in this category leaving college with like Justin Thomas and to me Justin my whole time in college and even before he was in college he was the dude right. So I didn’t really feel like I belonged there. I should have told myself I did but I didn’t. And then I kind of teetered off. And then it’s just been a slow grind back.

“But after the Genesis I really put it in perspective a little more” Homa continued. “I was like dude you just won a golf tournament. I played Saturday and part of Sunday with DJ who was World No. 1. When I won Wells Fargo I played with Rory who I think was World No. 1. So I started trying to tell myself — and it’s a huge testament to my wife Lacey [my caddie] Joe [Greiner] and [coach] Mark [Blackburn] because that’s their big thing. I let Mark in I was like hey buddy I struggle with this. And he just like wears me out. He’s tries to tell me hey man you’re better than you’re telling yourself you are. It’s hard for me. That’s definitely my biggest difficulty. I have to see the results. And I’m trying start to do it without seeing the results so that’s helping a little bit.”

Homa also reflected on the difference in mindset between college golf and competing on the PGA Tour.

“In college when I was kind of the dude for a little bit like you can look around a range and you’re not even tripping about a single person out there” Homa said. “You know who you are. When you get to the PGA Tour it’s just so hard to do that. You’re looking around at these guys who you’ve either watched or you are competing against who just are kicking your a–. And you’re like how am I supposed to have that feeling again? But I’m getting the feeling where I play with the people and I’m not nearly as overwhelmed with it. And that for me has been a big confidence boost. To be able to just kind of feel like I’m the old me in a way and being like hey you know you’re really good I’m really good. Let’s go play.”

Would I have been able to save American democracy truth vaccines and horses in desperate need of ivermectin if I intervened and warned about the destructive effect of the new conservative news channel started by Rupert Murdoch an Australian immigrant and media tycoon and Roger Ailes a right-wing political strategist and cultural warrior? Would family members have been able to save their relatives from being radicalized and weaponized by this right-wing propaganda network cosplaying as a news channel?

Would media and political gatekeepers have then start listening to the people of color media experts and scholars who had been continuously warning about normalizing the conservative media ecosystem whose viewers would eventually renounce a life-saving vaccine reject legitimate election results and end up supporting violent insurrectionists who overtook the US Capitol a quarter century later?

Probably not. First fear and hate sell. Just listen to the Facebook whistleblower’s Senate testimony this week or former CBS President Les Moonves’ admission in 2016 that Trump “may not be good for America but it's damn good for CBS.”

It’s apparently really good for AT&T as well which according to a recent stunning revelation helped inspire the creation of One America News Network (OAN) Trump’s favorite right-wing channel that continues to promote COVID-19 conspiracies and Trump’s “big lie” about the 2020 election. “They told us they wanted a conservative network” Robert Herring Sr OAN founder and chief executive said during a 2019 deposition. “They only had one which was Fox News and they had seven others on the other side. When they said that I jumped to it and built one.” He built it with funds from AT&T which also owns CNN a news channel that has been attacked by Trump supporters including Cesar Sayoc whose defense counsel said he was radicalized by Fox News when he sent pipe bombs to Trump’s enemies including CNN hosts.

But hey why let a little ultra-violence terrorism and descent into fascism stand in the way of profit and ratings?

The top-rated “news” network has been playing up its silver anniversary which seems like a fitting one for an operation that’s full of ads for precious metals to go along with the Trump commemorative items and the dubious herbal “remedies” and sometimes the MyPillow guy.

Even progressive Congressman Ro Khanna submitted a 30-second video congratulating Fox News for its 25th anniversary. That’s like thanking the people who have only invited you to their home to ridicule you in front of their sadistic guests and then ending the dinner by putting a price on your head. It’s no coincidence that as Fox News has thrived over this quarter century America has suffered.

I’m old enough to remember when Al Franken who at the time was best known for his Stuart Smalley character on SNL emerged as a political force due to his best-selling book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them where he scorched Fox News especially then-star Bill O’Reilly for their hypocrisy misinformation propaganda and harmful impact on America. Jon Stewart did his part with The Daily Show and even MSNBC finally found its footing as vocal critics of the Bush Administration with Keith Olbermann breathing fire during his nightly shows.

I was first attacked by Fox News in 2001 when a quote of mine appeared in a column by Michelle Malkin the right-wing extremist who pals around with white nationalists and wrote a book in defense of internment that was picked up by Fox News hosts. In response to an inflammatory and racist cartoon that appeared just days after 9/11 in my UC Berkeley newspaper a bunch of us participated in a protest attempting to have a conversation with the newspaper editors.

I made a speech in which I said “They have to be held accountable"" and for that I was demonized as “hating Americans” and “greedily feasting off the fruits of freedom” and received a deluge of lovely racist and Islamophobic emails telling me to “go back” to where my kind came from.

In the 20 years since then I can’t imagine how many people have come in for even nastier treatment as the network has thrived by sowing hate division fear and lies. Fox has evolved into a right-wing cultural and political juggernaut so successful at electing Republicans that there’s even a name for it: “The Fox News Effect.”

With over 200 million viewers on air and through its websites and podcasts Fox Media doesn’t just reflect the cultural zeitgeist but helps shape and mold it with the subtlety of a hammer. Because our country is paralyzed by a stultifying and deeply troubling “both sides” false equivalence we keep treating Fox News and its endless stream of manufactured right-wing cultural warriors as good-faith actors who deserve a platform and voice in the interest of “fairness.” Instead in the past 25 years it’s worked tirelessly to shift the Overton Window of acceptable talking points — on gender race immigration white supremacy obstruction of justice abuse of power praising of authoritarians — to the right. Just ask President Donald Trump.

The Fox News of the early 21st century wasn’t this bad. It initially cut its teeth on the Clinton impeachment scandal before serving as propagandistic cheerleaders for the Bush Administration’s War on Terror. But that Fox News would be ridiculed by its current viewers as a safe haven for RINOs and pro-immigrantion corporate establishment hacks. The most notorious host wasn’t white supremacy cheerleader Tucker Carlson but Bill O’Reilly who cut his chops at ABC CBS and the tabloid TV show “Inside Edition” before hosting The O’Reilly Report (later changed to The O’Reilly Factor.) Political correctness was the “cancel culture” of the 20th century and O’Reilly an old-school Irish-Catholic blowhard promised to cut through the noise and the spin zone. On his first day he promised: “Few broadcasts take any chances these days and most are very politically correct. Well we’re going to try to be different—stimulating and a bit daring but at the same time responsible and fair.”

Well that was a lie but at least then Fox tried to appear “fair and balanced” and give the illusion of being an actual news network even hiring Brit Hume who at the time was chief White House correspondent for ABC News. O’Reilly who would finally be let go in 2017 after revelations of the network paying out millions in hush payments to settle several sexual harassment claims against him even promised to apologize if the Bush Administration didn’t find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq one of the egregious lies Fox laundered for neo-cons to fuel their War on Terror.

In 2004 O’Reilly did just that saying “My analysis was wrong and I’m sorry. I was wrong. I’m not pleased about it at all.” He added “I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at the time.""

Can you imagine Tucker Hannity or Laura Ingraham apologizing to their viewers in 2021 about the many bold-faced lies the network has spun on vaccines masks President Obama being a Muslim Hillary Clinton Seth Rich or anything else? Those were simpler times.

Of course Fox News has always been a right-wing propaganda outfit; it’s become more extreme and unapologetic about its intentions. In 2007 a report analyzed O’Reilly’s “Talking Points Memo” segment and concluded he used propaganda and portrayed foreigners as threats. In 2021 you don’t need any analysis to decode Carslon talking openly about white people being “replaced” by people of color parroting a white supremacist talking and conspiracy theory.

Fox News’s reliance on fear-mongering xenophobia and lies reflects the DNA of Roger Ailes the former GOP political strategist who became the channel’s CEO. The network is a “reflection of [Ailes]” said the late Rush Limbaugh whom Ailes helped thrust into mainstream popularity. The channel still reflects Ailes’ true ambition which was to counter and disrupt liberal news channels and implement a “plan for putting the GOP on TV News” which was a plan hatched by the young political strategist in the 1970’s to use television to help promote the Nixon Administration and its right-wing agenda.

“With television you just sit-watch-listen. The thinking is done for you” Ailes wrote correctly predicting the rise of TV and the audience’s insatiable appetite for politics and news as sensationalistic entertainment.

“I don’t think Donald Trump would have been elected without Roger” said Christopher Ruddy who followed Ailes’ own playbook to launch Newsmax a hard-right news channel that is even more subservient to Trump who had an open invite to call Fox and Friends and whine complain and bloviate about anything that popped into his narcissistic vulgarian brain. According to Brian Stelter’s book Hoax top-rated primetime host Sean Hannity served as an unofficial consigliere to Trump fielding daily phone calls from the manic and beleaguered President. Trump took Carlson’s advice on Iran and coronavirus over that of his own advisors.

In fact there was a literal revolving door between Fox news channel and the Trump White House. Bill Shine who was a producer at Fox left to become Trump’s White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications. Hope Hicks left the Trump White House for a job at the Fox Corporation as chief communication officer where she made nearly $2 million in two years. Kayleigh McEnany who was one of Trump’s many White House press secretaries is now an on-air contributor at Fox News. Nearly two dozen people found lucrative employment at Fox News and the Trump White House.

The synergy is complete. The incestuous relationships between conservative media and politics and business will surely be replicated the next time a Republican is in the White House. The only thing that might change is that the revolving door will expand to include Fox News copycats who are even more extreme in their ideological zealotry.

GAS PRICES ARE SURGING – SO IS THE WHITE HOUSE GOING TO STEP IN?

Port delays Covid-19 outbreaks and worker shortages have snarled the flow of products between Asia and North America threatening the supplies of everything from holiday decorations and toys to appliances and furniture. It is taking roughly 80 days to transport goods across the Pacific or twice as long as before the pandemic retail and shipping executives said.

Walmart Inc. Home Depot Inc. Costco Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. —some of the biggest U.S. retailers by revenue—are among the companies that are paying for their own chartered ships as part of wider plans to mitigate the disruptions a costly and unattainable option for most companies. Some of the chains are passing along these added costs by raising prices for shoppers.

The chartered ships are smaller than those that companies like Maersk operate and move just a small slice of total imports the executives said. Ships that can hold around 1000 containers are on average nearly twice as expensive as the cost of moving cargo on a typical 20000-container vessel according to freight forwarders.

But the charters provide the big retailers with a way to work around bottlenecks at ports such as Los Angeles by rerouting cargo to less congested docks such as Portland Ore. Oakland Calif. or the East Coast. It also could help retailers ensure that key products such as electronics and décor arrive for the holiday season.

Shipbrokers said small vessels chartered for point-to-point voyages now earn around $140000 a day multiple times more than levels before the pandemic when such sailings were rare because of the high cost. ""They at least know that the inventory will arrive in time for the Christmas rush"" said Vicky Zervou a sales manager at Athens-based freight forwarder Aritrans SA.

In May Home Depot executives were looking for new ways to bring in goods in a timely fashion when they struck on the idea of chartering their own ship something the company had never before done. ""It was almost started I think as a joke"" said Sarah Galica vice president of transportation at Home Depot. ""Let’s just charter a ship.""

Products coming in on chartered ships make up a small percentage of Home Depot’s overall import volume she said but the shift allows the company to have more control over when products arrive in stores and give priority to the most in-demand products. For Home Depot the charters are moving plumbing supplies power tools holiday décor heaters and other items.

Richard Galanti Costco’s chief financial officer said the retailer has chartered three ships each capable of carrying around 1000 containers to bring goods between Asia and North America. Each vessel will be making up to 10 deliveries for Costco over the next year. Those ships will account for under 20% of the warehouse retailer’s import volume from Asia next year he said.

The channel still reflects Ailes’ true ambition which was to counter and disrupt liberal news channels and implement a “plan for putting the GOP on TV News” which was a plan hatched by the young political strategist in the 1970’s to use television to help promote the Nixon Administration and its right-wing agenda.

“With television you just sit-watch-listen. The thinking is done for you” Ailes wrote correctly predicting the rise of TV and the audience’s insatiable appetite for politics and news as sensationalistic entertainment.

“I don’t think Donald Trump would have been elected without Roger” said Christopher Ruddy who followed Ailes’ own playbook to launch Newsmax a hard-right news channel that is even more subservient to Trump who had an open invite to call Fox and Friends and whine complain and bloviate about anything that popped into his narcissistic vulgarian brain. According to Brian Stelter’s book Hoax top-rated primetime host Sean Hannity served as an unofficial consigliere to Trump fielding daily phone calls from the manic and beleaguered President. Trump took Carlson’s advice on Iran and coronavirus over that of his own advisors.

In fact there was a literal revolving door between Fox news channel and the Trump White House. Bill Shine who was a producer at Fox left to become Trump’s White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications. Hope Hicks left the Trump White House for a job at the Fox Corporation as chief communication officer where she made nearly $2 million in two years. Kayleigh McEnany who was one of Trump’s many White House press secretaries is now an on-air contributor at Fox News. Nearly two dozen people found lucrative employment at Fox News and the Trump White House.

The synergy is complete. The incestuous relationships between conservative media and politics and business will surely be replicated the next time a Republican is in the White House. The only thing that might change is that the revolving door will expand to include Fox News copycats who are even more extreme in their ideological zealotry.

GAS PRICES ARE SURGING – SO IS THE WHITE HOUSE GOING TO STEP IN?

Port delays Covid-19 outbreaks and worker shortages have snarled the flow of products between Asia and North America threatening the supplies of everything from holiday decorations and toys to appliances and furniture. It is taking roughly 80 days to transport goods across the Pacific or twice as long as before the pandemic retail and shipping executives said.

Walmart Inc. Home Depot Inc. Costco Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. —some of the biggest U.S. retailers by revenue—are among the companies that are paying for their own chartered ships as part of wider plans to mitigate the disruptions a costly and unattainable option for most companies. Some of the chains are passing along these added costs by raising prices for shoppers.

The chartered ships are smaller than those that companies like Maersk operate and move just a small slice of total imports the executives said. Ships that can hold around 1000 containers are on average nearly twice as expensive as the cost of moving cargo on a typical 20000-container vessel according to freight forwarders.

But the charters provide the big retailers with a way to work around bottlenecks at ports such as Los Angeles by rerouting cargo to less congested docks such as Portland Ore. Oakland Calif. or the East Coast. It also could help retailers ensure that key products such as electronics and décor arrive for the holiday season.

Shipbrokers said small vessels chartered for point-to-point voyages now earn around $140000 a day multiple times more than levels before the pandemic when such sailings were rare because of the high cost. ""They at least know that the inventory will arrive in time for the Christmas rush"" said Vicky Zervou a sales manager at Athens-based freight forwarder Aritrans SA.

In May Home Depot executives were looking for new ways to bring in goods in a timely fashion when they struck on the idea of chartering their own ship something the company had never before done. ""It was almost started I think as a joke"" said Sarah Galica vice president of transportation at Home Depot. ""Let’s just charter a ship.""

Products coming in on chartered ships make up a small percentage of Home Depot’s overall import volume she said but the shift allows the company to have more control over when products arrive in stores and give priority to the most in-demand products. For Home Depot the charters are moving plumbing supplies power tools holiday décor heaters and other items.

Richard Galanti Costco’s chief financial officer said the retailer has chartered three ships each capable of carrying around 1000 containers to bring goods between Asia and North America. Each vessel will be making up to 10 deliveries for Costco over the next year. Those ships will account for under 20% of the warehouse retailer’s import volume from Asia next year he said.

Franklin Templeton a leading global investment manager with operations in the Dubai International Financial Centre sees bright prospects for its business and plans to strengthen its position in its core markets in the GCC region its top official says.

Jenny Johnson president and CEO of Franklin Templeton said its business has shown resilient performance this year despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The GCC is an important market for our business. We are strengthening our retail and institutional capabilities locally and see ourselves as a core player servicing sophisticated institutional clients like central banks sovereign wealth funds and pension funds as well as local and international banks” Johnson told Khaleej Times in Dubai in an exclusive interview during her first official trip outside the US after the pandemic.

She was joined by Julian Ide head of Franklin Templeton’s EMEA distribution and Sandeep Singh regional head for CEEMEA and Head – Islamic Business at Franklin Templeton.

Franklin Resources a global investment management organisation with subsidiaries operating as Franklin Templeton has been serving clients in over 165 countries for more than 70 years. With offices in over 30 countries and approximately 1300 investment professionals the California-based company had over $1.5 trillion in assets under management as of August 31 2021.

UAE among region’s core markets

Singh based in Dubai said the UAE Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are among the leading markets in the region for Franklin Templeton.

“We are proud of our longstanding presence in the region. We have just recently celebrated our 20-year anniversary in the UAE and as the asset management industry continues to evolve we are looking forward to capitalise on business opportunities in the region” he said.

“Franklin Templeton has a strategic vision to strengthen its position in the UAE GCC and other parts of the Middle East. We want to replicate the UAE business success model in other markets of the region” he said.

Dubai a financial hub

Ide commented that Dubai continues to grow as an international financial hub and demonstrated a successful strategy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The Middle East is a material percentage of Franklin Templeton’s EMEA business and Dubai is becoming increasingly strategically important particularly for wealth management. Expo 2020 is just one part of this” he added.

Johnson further elaborated saying the Expo 2020 Dubai will drive business momentum in the region by attracting more tourists businessmen and investors to the region.

“Expo will further charge positive sentiments among the corporate world and help resume economic activity in the region and globally” she said.

Helping the clients

Johnson said Franklin Templeton’s mission is to help clients achieve better outcomes through investment management expertise wealth management and technology solutions. “The company brings extensive capabilities in equity fixed income multi-asset solutions and alternatives through its specialist investment managers in key markets across the world” she said.

“We offer Shariah-compliant products to our clients in the region as Franklin Templeton is one of the few global asset managers which manages Shariah-compliant strategies for investors worldwide” she added.

She added that with some key acquisitions completed over the last 12 months the company now has a 50 per cent split between institutional and retail clients. The GCC has over 70 per cent of its business sourced from institutional clients while the remaining are under retail and high networth individuals.

Franklin Templeton’s recently acquired Legg Mason Aviva Investors Athena Capital Pennsylvania Trust and AdvisorEngine.

“Our specialist investment manager’s Brandywine Global also acquired Diamond Hill Capital Management. We have most recently announced plans to acquire O’Shaughnessy Asset Management” she added.

Demand for fixed income products

Ide and Singh noted the local business continues to see strong demand for global fixed income products with growing interest for ESG strategies.

“We have just concluded our financial year on September 30 with six acquisitions including a $4.5 billion Legg Mason deal that will deepen Franklin Templeton’s presence in key geographies and create a platform well balanced between institutional and retail clients. We have over $6.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet and if the right opportunities come up - we’re still buyers” Johnson elaborated.

“In the GCC we are very excited about the opportunities we have here as a combined business. From a cultural standpoint the integration of Franklin Templeton and Legg Mason has been incredibly harmonious and we are seeing a lot of momentum from clients” added Ide who came from Legg Mason’s Martin Currie.

While referring to its latest acquisition of a leading quantitative asset management firm O’Shaughnessy Asset Management Johnson said this will help build up Franklin Templeton’s offerings in the high growth separately managed account (SMA) industry.

“The latest transaction will serve as an important expansion and enhancement of Franklin Templeton’s existing strengths in SMA and custom solutions capabilities. It will bring compelling benefits to clients” she added.

Gender equality diversity

Johnson who won Financial Woman of the Year title this year from Financial Women of San Fransico said Franklin Templeton is advancing its efforts toward achieving gender equality in the financial services industry.

“I firmly believe that the inclusion of colleagues from diverse backgrounds perspectives and identities leads to better decision-making and problem-solving across our business. Indeed there is a direct link between innovation and diversity which drives greater economic and social returns” she added.

“The asset management industry offers good opportunities for women and I strongly believe that women can grow and thrive in this industry” she said.

Johnson further elaborated that gender equality and diversity can play an important role in business growth in today’s competitive environment. Last year Franklin Templeton created a position of chief diversity and inclusion officer to promote more diversity within the organization.

Work from home

Johnson said that having the flexibility to work from home will likely be a feature that corporate entities continue to consider in the coming years.

“About 97 per cent of Franklin Templeton staff started work from home within two weeks when the pandemic hit the global markets. We quickly moved to a new working model and had a resilient performance despite the challenging environment” she said.

“With all Covid-19-related decisions the firm continues to prioritise the safety and well-being of our employees. Taking local conditions into account many of our offices are open to varying degrees however the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home. While we are planning for a gradual return to office in greater numbers we are not envisioning a “one size fits all” approach for work arrangements. Franklin Templeton’s flexible work culture included remote work arrangements prior to the pandemic and that will continue even after we return to the office.”

And many regular attendees from Asia the most important driver of metals demand and from South America the key mining region are opting to stay at home.

The resumption of LME Week when in past years many thousands have descended on London to cram into hotels bars and nightclubs is something of a test case for the return of large corporate events as the pandemic moves to a new phase.

“It’s certainly the case that there are fewer events” LME Chief Executive Officer Matthew Chamberlain said in an interview. The week’s centerpiece event a black-tie dinner hosted by the exchange that is normally attended by 2000 people is going ahead with a slimmed down 850 guests and larger gaps between the tables.

“We totally understand that some people may not feel comfortable attending and it will be a smaller event for that reason and because of travel. But we don’t think that we’re off key” Chamberlain said. “The impression that I’ve got is that people are really looking forward to a good evening.”

While daily Covid infections remain relatively high in the U.K. the government has lifted almost all restrictions and workers have been returning in growing numbers to the City of London in recent weeks.

However many banks brokers and miners — which typically throw their own parties for clients and contacts during LME week — have scaled back the festivities and are instead focusing on business meetings.

Triland Metals a broker owned by Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp. usually puts on a spread of sushi and champagne for 1000 people in the Dorchester hotel. But this year it called the party off believing that it wouldn’t be possible to throw a good party that didn’t risk spreading Covid according to a person familiar with the matter.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. the largest publicly traded copper company is sending a delegation of executives to negotiate supply contracts but has canceled its annual party. Many banks and consultancies which typically present their views on the market to clients during LME week have moved their events online.

A few are pressing ahead with events. “Why shouldn’t we?” asked Jean-Pierre Adamian chief executive of Transamine a medium-sized metals trader which prizes its reputation as a host. “It’s a limited party since it will be mostly European as the rest of the world cannot come.”

In addition to its black-tie dinner the LME itself is also hosting a smaller drinks reception and organizing a seminar in a hybrid format with in-person attendees and online participation.

StoneX Group one of the eight brokers that last month returned to the LME’s open outcry trading floor has booked 15 tables at the LME dinner. While some people are understandably reluctant to travel StoneX is hoping that things will be back to normal by next year said Kevin Tuohy co-head of metals.

Marex another large dealer is hosting its usual cocktail party on Sunday evening.

“On the one hand we’re expecting it to be fairly subdued because of travel restrictions” said President Simon Van Den Born. “But certainly from our point of view we see a good amount of people who are making the trip and who do almost from a personal perspective crave some face time.”

These included his sense that the medication prescribed last December for his mental health difficulties had impacted on his running.

""While I don't think the medication directly changes your fitness I think it just makes you a little bit more content and complacent in life and leads to less training and less intensity in training and less eagerness to be a better athlete.

""The long story short is that you kind of go through the motions and once you stand on the startline that's not a place for athletes.""

""I have these moments. These breakdowns or whatever you want to call it"" he reflected earlier this week.

""It was really a tough time for me emotionally. And it's not like it went away at the Olympics it's kind of happened the last three or four weeks too where I guess one should start working with therapists and work through certain things.

""Part of getting to the other side is perhaps digging up things that you perhaps had brushed under a rug and then buried the rug about 500 feet under the ground.

""It's not easy to do so mentally it has a cost. But I don't often think about it like that. Maybe it's my own arrogance about myself or my own ego that I think 'no I'll be fine'.

Garmin Connect and Apple Health are designed to play nice. If you have a Garmin watch you can sync a lot of your data over to the Apple app. Here’s how to set up the connection and troubleshoot any issues that might arise.

How can I share my Garmin Connect data with Apple Health?

All Garmin watches work with the Garmin connect smartphone app. The software is fairly good even if it takes a bit of getting used to. Garmin has been improving the app over the years although it still leaves a bit to be desired.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

The obvious question is why you would want to sync Garmin data over to the Apple Health app. Well there are certain advantages to doing this.

If you have an iPhone you have the Apple Health app already installed on your device. Syncing the data will not affect in any way what is sitting in Garmin Connect. But you will also have some of this data in Apple Health.

The Cupertino company’s software has the advantage in that it offers support for many other devices. In a sense it is designed to act as a repository for all your health and fitness data. It is not there yet but this is the direction it is going in.

Time needed: 10 minutes Setting Garmin Connect and Apple Health to communicate is not very difficult. The steps are as follows.

Open up the Apple Health app and navigate to settings The easiest way to do this is to tap on your picture in the top right hand corner. Scroll down until you see Apps.



Choose Apps This will display a list of apps that you can link (or have linked) with Apple Health



Select Garmin Connect You’ll recognise it by the Garmin logo next to it. Follow the instructions to establish a link You’ll be asked to approve the connection. The Apple Health app allows you to choose which data to sync Choose Turn On All or toggle the individual categories on or off – as per your preference.



You can check that you are connected in the Garmin app Do this by opening settings in Garmin Connect navigating to Connected Apps. You should see Apple Health in the list. Tap on this and you’ll see a confirmation that you are indeed connected.





A few important things should be mentioned at this stage.

The data sync is only in one direction. So Apple Health data cannot find its way into the Garmin app. Also the type of data that can be synced from Garmin Connect depends on the device that you own. Not all options from the screenshot above may be available.

Finally the sync is done whenever you connect your watch to the Garmin Connect app. The info will not be ported over if Garmin Connect is closed or in the background. The Garmin software needs to be open – and in the foreground – in order for the data sync to complete fully with Apple Health.

What type of Garmin data can I sync with Apple Health?

You can sync quite a bit of info from Garmin Connect to Apple Health. But no you can’t sync everything. And as mentioned – it depends on the Garmin fitness tracker or watch that you own.

Data that can potentially find its way to Apple’s software includes:

steps

walking and running distance

active energy

floors climbed

weight/body fat percentage/body mass index (if you have a connected scale or manually enter data)

resting energy

sleep data and

water.

Workouts are also synced. But any GPS data will not be written to Apple Health.

As far as heart rate you can sync all-day heart rate (including resting heart rate) along with high and low heart rate values from workouts. So not all heart rate data will be ported. This may result in a “Chart Unavailable” message for a workout in the Apple Activity app. Without GPS data and complete heart rate beat-to-beat info the data from your Garmin workouts that shows in Apple software is quite limited.

What to do if the data is not syncing

You may have done all of the steps above and found that the data sync between the two apps is unsuccessful. Or it may have worked for a while but it is not working now. There are several things you can do to troubleshoot.

First know that Apple Health can receive data from multiple sources. If more than one source of the same type of data is available Apple will pick data from the one which is of higher priority in its app.

The order can be customized by going into the settings for that particular metric in the Apple Health app – for example steps. Simply re-order the data sources as per your preference. Presumably you will want Garmin to be on top.

Even if you don’t have another smartwatch the iPhone itself can count steps. And this might have priority over the Garmin step count.

You can uncheck the iPhone step count by going to Settings/Privacy. Scroll until you see Movement & fitness. Tap on this and turn the toggle for Fitness Tracking to off. But it is better to simply reorder in the priority list in the Apple Health app so that Garmin is above.

There are several other troubleshooting steps.

Keep in mind that not all Garmin data can be synced to Apple Health. Review the list above for data that can be shared. There is currently no native way to get GPS and complete heart rate data for workouts from Garmin to Apple.

Make sure you have given enough time for the Garmin Connect app to sync to Apple Health. Sometimes the data might be a bit late. So for example your step count might be lower in Apple Health. It might be because the full day’s data has not synced over just yet. Try hitting the refresh/sync button in Garmin Connect to force a sync – and give it time to complete fully.

Check that the time zone settings are correct on your phone. Otherwise there’s a possibility that not everything will have the correct time-stamp.

It is good to have the latest version of Garmin Connect and Apple Health on your phone. Sometimes bugs appear and subsequent versions of the software can help to squash them. Although it can be the other way around… For example about a year ago an update to the Garmin Connect app rendered the sync with Apple Health inoperable for many users. This was resolved soon after. But there’s a very long thread on Garmin forums discussing the issue.

If all else fails users have reported on forums that deleting the Garmin app from your iPhone and reinstalling it often resolves sync issues. Don’t worry – your Garmin data will not be lost – it lives in the cloud. But you will need to re-enter your Garmin username and password when you reinstall the app. You could even try forgetting the connection in Apple Health and re-establishing it.

STAMFORD Conn. — A recent report shows that one-third of technology organizations are planning to invest $1 million or more on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies over the next two years.

The report by Gartner “Emerging Technologies: AI Technology Spending in 2021 — Survey Trends” also shows the vast majority of survey respondents (87%) who view AI as a major investment area believe industry-wide funding for AI will increase at a “moderate to fast pace” through 2022 according to the firm last month.

“Rapidly evolving diverse AI technologies will impact every industry” said Errol Rasit managing VP Gartner. “Technology organizations are increasing investments in AI as they recognize its potential to not only assess critical data and improve business efficiency but also to create new products and services expand their customer base and generate new revenue.

“These are serious investments that will help to dispel AI hype.”

The report shows that AI technologies have the second-highest mean funding allocation among other “emerging technologies” such as cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Technology organizations planning to invest in AI expect to spend the most on four areas on average: computer vision $679000; AI-generated composite applications $624000; AI-augmented software development $584000; and AI data and analytics $565000.

“Very few respondents reported funding amounts of less than $250000 for AI technologies indicating that AI development is cost-intensive compared to other technology innovations” Rasit said.

“This is not an easy segment to enter due to the complexity of building and training AI models.”

“Immaturity” of AI a barrier to development and adoption

The findings in “AI Technology Spending” highlight the “relative immaturity of AI technologies compared to the other innovation areas” Gartner said.

For instance 41% of respondents said AI is still “in development or the early adoption stages” while about half reported “significant target customer adoption” of their AI-enabled products and services.

The responses suggest there’s “a wave of potential adoption” as new or augmented AI products and services are available according to Gartner.

Companies investing in AI said the top reason for failure when integrating an emerging tech is technology immaturity.

Product leaders said the main hindrances to their progress in AI implementations are product complexity and a lack of skills.

“These survey responses reflect the difficult cycle of developing AI technology given its complexity as well as industry-wide challenges in hiring AI talent due to the finite number of skilled individuals” Rasit said.

Frances (Foteini) Karamouzis – fondly known as ‘Fran’ – is an leader in Corporate America a philanthropist and a proud New Yorker and Greek –with roots in the historic village of Kalavryta Greece.

The National Herald: Tell us about your background.

Frances Karamouzis: I come from a quintessential second-generation Greek-American background and I am always striving to be an international ethnic ‘mixologist’ which involves the blending of the two cultures in optimal combination. Both of my parents were born in the same small mountainous village in the Peloponnese region of Greece namely Kalavryta. Kalavryta is recognized as the place of origin of the 1821 uprising of Greeks against the Ottoman empire. It was also the site of a brutal Nazi massacre. A significant feature film is scheduled for release about it titled ΚΑΛΑΒΡΥΤΑ 1943. The trailer can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcBl7yYbJ2c.

My parents were young kids (under the age of 10) when their village was ravaged by World War II fighting and during the subsequent civil war in Greece. Significant portions of the village were burned down and famine had dominated the area. My dad and his sister were lucky enough to be selected by the Red Cross (as part of a relief effort for some of the most impoverished families) to be given transport to America.

My dad arrived with $19 in his pocket and lots of hopes and dreams. Over time he became a small business owner in a specialty food shop in the Hell's Kitchen area of New York City.

This photo was taken in 2018 in Kalavryta Greece. The woman on the far right is Karamouzis’ mother Eleni Karamouzis. And the two women on the left are Thea Angeliki and Thea Alexandra. Thea Alexandra is 97 years old and was a survivor of the German ravages during WW 2 of Kalvaryta. Her father and brother were killed in the mass execution of 1943. Her personal and oral account of these atrocity is captured in the local museum of Kalavryta.

My mom was a seamstress a homemaker but above all she was a role model of bravery kindness perseverance resiliency and lifelong learning. The incredible strength and depth of women are often not recognized and celebrated in both the United States or Greece. Thus it’s so important to me to bring unsung heroes like my mom to the forefront.

Like many Greek immigrants of their era my parents emphasized hard work education spirituality and community as the cornerstones for growth.

As a child of the Greek diaspora in the United States curious and determined my experimentation included education (including language) sports arts music cinema travel and social and work experiences.

I spent many summers in Greece as a child and young adult enabling me to spend time with my maternal grandparents along with a tribe of over 40 first cousins.

After graduating from high school I earned a bachelor's degree in International Business and Accounting from New York University. I went on to complete an MBA in Finance at New York University.

I am now working continuously in corporate America since 1987.

This photo was taken in 2009 in the Galapagos Ecuador on one of Karamouzis’ many trips in a remote area of the world.

TNH: Tell us about your role at Gartner Inc. and your leadership style.

FK: Initially I was a consultant at prestigious firm for 14 years. In my current company I started as a research analyst publishing research and delivering lectures and conference presentations on specific technology areas (primarily software development offshore outsourcing hyperautomation data & analytics and Artificial Intelligence).

Over the 20 years at Gartner I received several promotions to Vice President and Distinguished Analyst.

In 2019 I was appointed Chief of Research of the entire Technology group representing over 650 research professionals. This role involves looking across the vast breadth of Gartner’s excellent technology coverage to set the strategic direction for the research agenda and publications.

I am responsible for managing the professionals that define execute and ensure quality control of the technology research portfolio. It's hard work as technology is ever more dynamic complex and changing at an unprecedented velocity.

I have the privilege of thinking more broadly and strategically about technology solutions and services with some of the finest minds in the industry.

My leadership style is inspired by my mom – strong persistent passionate – and always acting in service of the group success. Like the Greek women’s role in the household – they are the understated and often unrecognized foundation consistent engine and the glue (or Greek honey) that nourishes the whole unit.

This photo was taken in 2020 in New York. It depicts my Eleni Karamouzis (mom) Konstantina Tsavaris (sister) and Karamouzis’ nieces Ireena Katerina and Delia.

Fortunately as corporate America evolves and grows to acknowledge the incredible contributions of women in the workforce I have been awarded several accolades. I humbly and graciously accepted the 2019 Research Analyst of the Year award by the Institute of Industry Analyst Relations (https://lnkd.in/dfzsgBn ). I also appeared and contributed to reports showcased on CBS 60 Minutes CNN CNBC PBS Business Week Forbes and the Council for Foreign Relations.

TNH: What have you learned from your work experiences and study of Hyperautomation and Artificial Intelligence?

FK: Many of the learnings from my study of technology (specifically Hyperautomation and Artificial Intelligence) align with some of the writings of the author Yuval Noah Harari in his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. One approach is to strive to see the world as it truly is and the natural beauty it reveals to all of us.

To do so we should remain humble seek reliable data sources understand our limitations and biases and be ready for change. The liberalism of the United States (and other cultures) which emphasizes the importance of liberty and freedom in political and economic life became the predominant ideology of the 20th century but is inadequate to manage the global challenges of the 21st century posed by nuclear weapons emerging technologies and impending ecological changes.

Tribalism in the form of nationalism religion and culture threatens to divide humanity against itself leading to such problems as intolerance war and terrorism.

The technological challenge at the heights of artificial intelligence and mechanization will radically change the nature of human work as well as enable human behavior to be thoroughly understood and eventually controlled. These changes have the potential to worsen the immense chasm of inequality.

The political challenge involves the analysis of the emergence of a global community and the limits of that community identifying different ways in which tribal interests have divided humanity along nationalist religious and cultural lines. Layered on top of all of this is that it has become unclear what “truth is” and whether “facts matter.”

Harari writes about a ‘post-truth’ world explaining that the proliferation of unfiltered information undermines our ability to detect factual and moral truths. Hence resilience is the way forward. We must first understand ourselves learn to think critically and strive to minimize suffering rather than adhere rigidly to any particular narrative or doctrine.

This photo was taken in 2018 in Washington DC outside of a museum alongside a famous statue of Eisenstein.

TNH: What have you learned from life?

FK: My personal and professional life is almost like a modern-day Homeric Odyssey. It has allowed me to travel to over 100 countries worldwide and learn so much from many trials and tribulations. I have come to experience firsthand that we are more alike than we are different. Across so many cultures – the faces colors foods and scenery may vary but the hopes dreams loves losses connections and human experiences are incredibly similar.

Home is where the heart is and where people find community and support; it is where they long to stay. I love all that Greece offers and will always have a soft spot there but I will always come back to the New York area where I have an amazing circle of friends and love that forms my foundation.

I contribute to local causes and partake in community events including coaching basketball and raising money for local charities. And of course taking full advantage of living in New York by visiting the Cloisters the MET the Museum of Natural History the Rubin Museum and the High Line.

I also love to frequent live music in local venues and I share with pride that I am one of the first 100 members of the MOTH (a spoken word organization that is now international).

Working in technology and living in the era of the knowledge economy I would like to share the following quote: ""We are more connected and yet more isolated than at any other time in history.”

Many have traded: Trust for ‘Tweets’; Smiles for ‘Statuses’; Love for ‘Likes’; and Conversations for ‘Comments’.

As such it's essential to get back to the simple abundance of our humanity our neighbors and our community. I always remind myself of how lucky I am to be able to afford to live in Manhattan (the heart of New York City) and travel to Greece often –and I should not take things for granted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL3doYXQtaGFwcGVucy10by1hbWVyaWNhcy1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLXVuZGVyLWEtc2Vjb25kLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLW5vdGhpbmctZ29vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happens to America's mental health under a second Trump administration? Very bad things,"Donald Trump's presidency and the destructive forces it unleashed are a mental health emergency — as well as a public health emergency in general. Trump may no longer be president but his fascist political movement and the political party he controls continues to cause harm.

Trumpism is both a political cult and a manifestation of collective narcissism. Tens of millions of his followers now live in an alternate reality sustained by the Big Lie an upside-down world in which Donald Trump is still the ""real"" president of the United States. Many of Trump's followers believe that he should be returned to power by any means available including terrorism and other political violence.

The Trump regime and Republican policies more generally have literally caused trauma — physical emotional psychological and spiritual — for millions of Americans including of course the deaths of at least 700000 people from the coronavirus pandemic.

In a recent essay author and pastor John Pavlovitz addresses this:

[F]or the first time in America's history the latent ugliness in people was revealed and validated and celebrated by a sitting president — it was officially normalized. And what we're experiencing now; this staggering insensitive posturing in the face of so many people's suffering is the late-ripening fruit of something that has been set into the bedrock of half our nation. It is the malicious entitlement that MAGA was designed to nurture from the beginning.... This quickly metastasizing moral cancer is something we've never experienced on this level in our lifetimes and it's something we're going to have to reckon with regardless of the political outcomes of the next four years. If the former president somehow takes that office again these stories will surely grow exponentially more violent and more commonplace but either way the ugliness is here now. The Trump Effect on America is that once reasonable rational human beings whose prejudices fears and phobias were all bound by some baseline decorum and common courtesy that kept them from intentionally harming others — have been empowered to revel in the worst of themselves. They believe cruelty is their birthright.

As early as 2015 many mental health experts began to warn that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for America and the world. They were correct in nearly all of their predictions.

It is likely that Donald Trump will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2024. (In fact the only unknown variable is whether he will actually decide to run.) Contrary to the naïve thinking of those Americans who believed Trump might magically go away as president or otherwise he will be a fixture in American life for the foreseeable future.

What will happen to the American people's collective mental and emotional health if Donald Trump runs for president again — or if he is elected? What kind of damage would Trump inflict on America and the world in a second term? And how do we explain why so many Americans — both ordinary citizens and members of the political and media classes — continue to be ""surprised"" by the torrent of revelations about Trump's mental pathologies and his antisocial anti-democratic behavior?

I recently asked several leading mental health experts — all of whom I have previously interviewed for Salon — to offer their warnings and predictions.

Dr. Lance Dodes is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training and supervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.

The latest revelations about Trump confirm what we have known for years. Stephanie Grisham his former press secretary says ""The truth was that pretty much everyone eventually wore out their welcome with the president."" This points to Trump's inability to comprehend or value other people; he can only use them while they serve his endless need to aggrandize himself then discard them when they do not.

Grisham says ""When I began to see how his temper wasn't just for shock value or the cameras I began to regret my decision to go to the West Wing."" Here she finally sees that Trump is not ""crazy like a fox"" but is truly a severely disordered person in poor control and a danger to others. In Bob Woodward's book as reported in the Guardian [and elsewhere] on Trump's way out of office he drops F-bombs ""spewing expletives"" and screaming at cabinet colleagues: ""I don't care a fuck. You're all fucked up. You're all fucked.""

This is an example of his paranoia in which he denies responsibility for his multiple failures and losses projecting these to others whom he condemns as worthless. Each of these revelations points to one or another aspect of Trump's delusional sociopathy: his absence of a conscience incapacity to care about or empathize with others projection of blame to others (paranoia) and his psychotic distortion of reality in order to maintain his belief that he has a godlike superiority.

Trump's primitive emotional state make him an enormous danger to democracy which he cannot abide. As a consequence if he were to again become president the end of democracy in this country would become a realistic possibility.

Dr. Justin Frank is a former clinical professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University Medical Center. He is the author of ""Bush on the Couch"" and ""Obama on the Couch."" His most recent book is ""Trump on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President.""

Trump once had an internal conflict between being a builder and a destroyer. No longer is it a conflict; he is a destroyer plain and simple. Unconsciously his destructive force was originally directed against his tyrannical and punitive father displaced onto investors the media banks etc. But his ultimate displacement has been on the founding fathers of America's democratic experiment.

He attacks basic institutions from the CIA to the FBI to Congress itself. And since November 2020 he has put our entire electoral process in his crosshairs. If he were nominated and elected in 2024 — accounting for skewed results in the event that right-wing voter suppression tactics are successful — it would mean that more Americans than ever embrace authoritarianism and that would deliver the deepest blow to our democratic process in our history.

Psychologically people yearn for strong leadership. However they fail to understand that sorrow is the vitamin of growth of strength. President Biden has been strengthened over his lifetime by facing sorrow and loss. Trump denies loss by triumphing over it with powerful defensive grandiosity. A leader who breaks things is also admired interestingly by adoring followers. They admire his ability to say and do things they themselves could never say or do in public. Trump fills that need perfectly.

The other major effect of a Trump victory in 2024 would be the likely apathy and despair felt by those who fought against him.

Elizabeth Mika is a psychotherapist and contributor to the 2017 bestseller ""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.""

The ""revelations"" really just confirm what we have known about Trump for years long before he was elected. People with his character defect malignant narcissism are sadly predictable: They are driven by insatiable drives for adulation and power and an unceasing desire for revenge on those who may interfere (or be perceived as interfering) with the realization of those drives.

It is really too bad that our media broadly speaking has remained in the dark about Trump's well-defined character pathology. Therefore many journalists mostly among the mainstream news media continue to be shocked by these ""revelations"" as if unable and/or unwilling to finally arrive at an understanding of Trump's disordered character.

If Trump runs and wins in 2024 we will see an accelerated continuation of our demise. Every negative trend we are experiencing now will be augmented especially our polarization inequality and violence.

As of now 21 million Americans believe that Trump whose presidency was stolen from him should be restored by violent force — and they are ready to make it happen.

Dr. David Reiss is a psychiatrist expert in mental fitness evaluations and contributor to ""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.""

I am totally unsurprised. But vindication does not soothe the national tragedy or my personal frustration and even bitterness (which are of much less significance) at having been ignored by those who had power to intervene.

No one could have predicted Trump's specific actions while in office or now: His specific behaviors are inherently unpredictable. But the nature of his behaviors the irrationality of his behaviors the immaturity of his behaviors and the dangers brought about those behaviors were all quite predictable and in fact were predicted.

You asked: What do I think will happen to America if Trump runs for office and wins in 2024?

In my opinion the even more frightening question is this: ""What would it mean had happened to the American people and American society if Trump were returned to office in 2024?""

It would mean there had been: 1) a complete breakdown of rationality within the social order; 2) the destruction of our democratic system of elections and government; or 3) that something so horrible had transpired that all hope was lost and due to fear and desperation totalitarianism or fascism had been embraced.

As to what would happen afterward it would depend upon who was actually ""pulling the strings"" of the totalitarian/fascist regime for which Trump was the figurehead. Trump himself at age 78 certainly would not actually be in command. I cannot begin to predict the exact manner or type of dystopia that would be enacted. I can predict that it would be beyond our current worst nightmares.

Dr. John Gartner is a psychologist psychoanalyst and former professor at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School and the founder of Duty to Warn. He was also a contributor to ""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.""

Democracy would be dead and the coup complete. All future ""elections"" would be Putin-style shams where the electorate never actually has the power to remove the Republicans from power.

We could expect criminal prosecutions against Democratic leaders the press and anyone who opposed the regime. Experts of all types would be persecuted. ""Patriots"" would be encouraged to expose punish and marginalize citizens at all levels of society who are not MAGA. Fox would become de facto state-TV propaganda. Only loyal ""party members"" would be allowed to work in government.

Hate crimes would skyrocket. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants would be incarcerated in concentration camps.

Thousands of ordinary citizens would join cells of an ""underground resistance"" which would become progressively more violent. This ""terrorism"" would be used to justify martial law and heavy surveillance. Millions would flee to Canada and Europe.

Internationally the U.S. would become a Russian puppet state. NATO and our international alliances would crumble. The economy would contract. Global warming would spiral out of control. And we might well stumble into war.

Dr. Seth D. Norrholm is a translational neuroscientist and one of the world's leading experts on PTSD and fear. He is currently scientific director at the Neuroscience Center for Anxiety Stress and Trauma (NeuroCAST) in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Wayne State University School of Medicine.

The revelations that are merging from various sources who had access to the Trump White House are not at all surprising. As I and others have commented on for years now no matter how you label or classify the former president's behavior (malignantly narcissistic sociopathic psychopathic abusive) there is an underlying thread of immaturity. This immaturity plays itself out as an inability to regulate emotion a behavioral profile typically seen in children and adolescents. It is therefore not surprising to hear about the former president's uncontrollable rage and the allegation that he had a handler specifically tasked with soothing him like a toddler. I expect similar stories to continue to come out.

What happens if the former president runs for office again in 2024 – and possibly wins? This would be a complete failure of several social political governmental ethical and professional ""guardrails.""

From the perspective of the former president as an abuser a future Trump candidacy and potential presidency would be a psychological slap in the face to all of his victims from the past six years. I've often used the analogy of an abusive relationship when it comes to the former president and his approach to governing. If the watering-down of the Mueller investigation and the acquittal following evidence-heavy impeachment proceedings was akin to the arrest and subsequent release of a criminally abusive spouse a return to office would indicate zero accountability for and an acceptance of physical and emotional abuse from our leadership; a trend that has been gathering steam for some time now.

Considering the former president incited an attack on his own country and has continued to push the Big Lie undermining our electoral process our democracy (already on life support) would suffer likely irreversible damage if this is further ignored and already eroded norms are obliterated beyond repair.

Moreover considering that more than 700000 Americans have died from a pandemic that could have been better controlled which the former president downplayed to protect his political future allowing a return to the campaign trail and potentially the White House would frankly forgive an accessory to negligent homicide on an unprecedented scale.

Taken together the nation and the world would be presented with the psychologically untenable position of having to accept the worst that humanity has to offer according to almost all of the ""standards"" established by modern society as its leader once again.",,,,,,

And when it comes to Israel space exploration doesn’t end with the Moon. For the first time the Israeli Space Agency in collaboration with the Austrian Space Forum (OeWF) will conduct an integrated Mars analog field mission in a protected dome - at Israeli research facility D-MARS - located in the Negev desert in Israel. The six-person crew entered the dome at 6 a.m. on Monday morning for the 21-day mission which will be carried out in the Martian terrestrial analog. Using the Austrian Space Forum’s specifically developed Mars suit prototypes the analog astronauts will perform more than 20 experiments in the fields of biology medicine psychology geology and engineering. The study involves 200 researchers from 25 different countries.

The OeWF’s Mission Support Center in Innsbruck Austria will monitor the mission and act as liaison to the science institutions and researchers participating in AMADEE-20. This marks the agency’s 13th Mars analog mission which it hopes will contribute to future human and robotic exploration of Mars.

The test site is located in the Negev desert in southern Israel near the Ramon Crater. Although not an impact crater rather a rare form of an erosion structure it has a highly similar resemblance to various Mars surface features and a variety of terrain types similar to Mars exploration. The test site offers a wide range of sand and rocky surfaces and the site bears striking similarity to the Vallis Marineris structure on Mars. The selected analog astronauts are highly qualified experts who were trained by the Austrian Space Forum and will be led by Commander and aerospace engineer João Lousada from Portugal an experienced analog astronaut who already participated in two previous Mars analog missions in Austria (2015) and Oman (2018).

The Austrian Space Forum chose five other experts from an international pool of 13 certified analog candidates including Iñigo Muñoz-Elorza (Spain) Anika Mehlis (Germany) Alon Tenzer (Israel) Thomas Wijnen (The Netherlands) and Robert Wild (Austria).

Of the many experiments that will be tested during the remote isolation mission in the dome Israeli startup’s Stemrad’s anti-radiation vest will also be tested. The Stemrad vest is designed to shield the bone marrow and other sensitive organs against cosmic radiation. The experiment aims to protect astronauts on extraterrestrial surfaces whose gravity is less than the Earth - whether the Moon or Mars. Stemrad hopes to gain key answers on issues such as the weight comfortability and ergonomics issues faced by the astronauts wearing the vest while performing daily activities and any recommendation for future improvements.

Avi Blasberger outgoing-Director-General of the ISA noted that “our cooperation with the Austrian Space Forum and hosting AMADEE-20 in Israel is in line with our policy to support science to be part of the international efforts for human exploration and to further our outreach and educational program. We are proud to be part of it and will invest all the required efforts to ensure its success.”

“The Israel Space Agency is a strong and reliable partner for our next Mars analog mission. With this mission we will increase the fidelity of our Mars mission simulations even further. During the four-week duration of the mission our six analog astronauts will live and work at a habitat that is being provided by D-Mars and was specifically built for AMADEE-20. The Austrian Space Forum’s analog astronauts will perform more than 20 experiments in isolation to further facilitate the understanding of advantages and limitations of future human planetary missions. This will be the largest most complex Mars mission simulation in 2021” noted Gernot Grömer Director of the Austrian Space Forum. “The purpose of simulating a Mars Mission on Earth is to prepare for future crewed missions on the Red Planet. The OeWF is one of only five research groups worldwide that has developed a prototype space suit which will be donned by the analog astronauts during their mission.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Actor Nicholas Alexander Chavez of “General Hospital” chatted with Digital Journal’s Markos Papadatos about his latest adventures as Spencer on the ABC daytime drama and he spoke about the upcoming Zoom fan event.

Getting settled as Spencer Cassadine

On getting settled as Spencer Cassadine on “General Hospital” he said “It feels good. I feel like I am finally starting to settle into the show. When I showed up on my first day I was pretty nervous but now I definitely feel more comfortable and settled in. It has really helped me make strong choices.”

He was proud of the scenes that he filmed at Wyndermere on the show. “It was really hard for Spencer to tell his family that he did bad things to them even though they may have been completely justified” he said.

“Spencer is really trying to make them see what they did to him like holding a mirror up to them. He was throwing it right back at them which was cool” he added.

He praised his luminous acting partners Maura West Genie Francis and Marcus Coloma for “killing it” as they always do.

Working with Avery Kristen Pohl

The same holds true for his new girlfriend on the show Esme Prince played by Avery Kristen Pohl. “Avery is an amazing actress. She is very talented and we have the same acting coach Holly Gagnier” he exclaimed. “We have a competitive relationship on the show even though we are dating. She is definitely sneaky in the way that she goes around manipulating people. Spencer really has to be on his toes around her.”

Metro Court Pool

Chavez shared that he enjoyed filming scenes in the Metro Court Pool this summer. “I miss the Metro Court Pool” he admitted. “It’s a great set. The set design team just absolutely killed it and we had a lot of fun there. It’s great for the summer and it was really cool.”

Zoom GH Fantasy event

On October 24 Chavez is looking forward to being a part of a virtual GH fan event with Sydney Mikayla (who plays Trina) which is produced by Coastal Entertainment. For more information on this Zoom event click here. “That event is going to be so much fun” he foreshadowed.

“It will be the first Zoom fan event that I’ve ever done. I think the people are really excited for #Sprina and Sydney and I are excited about it too. We love having that chemistry on set when we do our scenes together. We are so excited to be able to talk about it” he said.

Chavez is also loving his new Corvette car. “I love this car. I wash it once or twice a week like a crazy person” he said with a sweet laugh.

Actors Chace Crawford (The Deep) Antony Starr (Homelander) Jack Quaid (Hughie Campbell) Karen Fukuhara (Kimiko) and Erin Moriarty (Starlight) led a The Boys panel at New York Comic-Con this week and they were all rather creeped-out by a fake chest that Crawford has to wear as his character reports Insider.

Fans may recall the disturbing scene in season one in which The Deep is assaulted by a woman he brings home as she forcefully touches the gills that he has on his chest with the gills making another appearance in season two as Deep hallucinates that they are speaking to him.

The prosthetic chest that actor Crawford had to wear in his shirtless scenes is a replica of his real torso with air pumps fitted in the fake chest to make the gills move.

Explaining his relationship with this odd prop Quaid said: ""They built a prosthetic chest for that scene and every day for like three weeks it was just sitting in the hair and makeup trailer. So the first thing I saw for three weeks every single day was a severed Chace Crawford-with-gills chest. It drove me insane.""

Moriarty agreed that the chest was ""traumatising"" while Fukuhara couldn't help but comment on how ""hairy it was"".

The panel also saw the cast address that gravity-defying floating sex scene between Homelander and Stormfront (Aya Cash) in season two with actor Starr saying that it was difficult to look ""sexy"" during the scene.

""You could see people on the ground just going 'What the fuck is he doing? What is going on up there?' And then we kept giggling as well. Me and Aya get on really well so we kept giggling"" he said.

This week we look at how the pandemic has worsened people’s reliance and addiction to digital devices. This is a shortened version of the full feature​ which can be found here.

As Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the digitalisation of all aspects of people’s lives it has also worsened their reliance and addiction to digital devices

Be it for work study socialising or leisure people are turning to their digital devices amid social distancing and other measures to curb the spread of the virus

Adults and children alike are feeling the strain from staring at screens for most of their waking hours

Experts say that negative effects such as impeded social skills troubled sleep and dry eyes may result

While there are practical steps to help reduce time spent on our screens eliminating it totally is not an option said the experts

SINGAPORE — When social media sites Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp were temporarily down on Monday night (Oct 4) it was the first time in a long while that Xiu Ting 23 managed to go to bed before midnight — without spending at least half an hour on her bed mindlessly scrolling through the sites a common pre-bedtime ritual for countless people around the world.

“It helped me sleep earlier... I was quite happy to be honest” she said adding that she typically looks through her Facebook feed before she sleeps in order to “keep up to date with the news”.

While Monday night offered a temporary reprieve Xiu Ting who works at a tech firm said that she engages in some form of screen time for most of her waking hours — a situation made worse by the pandemic as it accelerates the digitalisation of all aspects of people’s lives.

Working from home means that she would sometimes wake up at 7am “in a panic” several hours before work begins afraid that she may have missed messages from her colleagues.

Even during her lunch breaks she anticipates messages from her colleagues who may have already finished their meals.

“I definitely did not do that when I was working in the office because everyone will be eating lunch with you so how can they text you?”

After work she would speak to her boyfriend whom she is in a long-distance relationship with over a video calling app. Later in the evening she would often watch shows on streaming app Netflix to wind down.

“It feels like I am on my phone (or screen) at every waking hour” said Xiu Ting who declined to give her full name.

The time which people — both young and old — spend looking at their screens along with its ill-effects has been on the rise here even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck early last year.

But the phenomenon has been exacerbated by the move towards working from home and coupled with social distancing measures more people are being pushed to interact online instead according to those whom TODAY spoke to.

“In the wake of the circuit breaker last year there was a sudden switch to online everything — online work online home learning online leisure (and) online socialising” said Professor Lim Sun Sun the head of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

While the use of technology is helpful in helping people to connect during a time of isolation there soon comes the problem of overdependence on technology when people feel that “everything is being done online” said the researcher who is also a professor of communication and technology.

The problem is not unique to Singapore with various studies from abroad showing that there has been an increase in screen use among adults and children during the pandemic.

Anecdotally in Singapore excessive screen use has led to a rise in the number of patients with symptoms related to their digital habits said psychologists psychiatrists and ophthalmologists whom TODAY spoke to.

For instance Dr Lim Boon Leng a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness said that compared to pre-pandemic days he has seen in recent months a 10 per cent increase in patients coming in for conditions such as sleeping troubles increased stress levels and the inability to focus at work all partly due to excessive screen usage."

It was a big moment for the company. For most of its 30 year history Boston Dynamics has been focused on research and development. Initially Boston Dynamics received a lot of its funding from the U.S. military and DARPA. Later it was financed by big-name owners including Google  SoftBank and most recently Hyundai. All of these companies have tried to steer the robot maker on a path to commercialization and Boston Dynamics is finally getting there.

""I expect that we will become a serial producer of novel robots with advanced capabilities. I think we'll build every say three to five years we're going to roll out a new robot targeting a new industry"" says Robert Playter CEO of Boston Dynamics.

But for now Boston Dynamics is focusing on the inspection and warehouse industries with its robots Spot and Stretch.

""The next big industry for Spot is really in this this market that we're calling industrial sensing or dynamics sensing which is where we have robots walking around places like manufacturing plants chemical plants utilities installations and using the robots to collect data on what's happening in these facilities in an automated way"" says Zack Jackowski chief engineer of the Spot product. ""And this is really interesting because once you start getting this highly repeatable high quality data you could start understanding these facilities and the efficiencies of them in new ways.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtcHJvdG90eXBlLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtaGFyZHdhcmUv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWZlbmNlLWJsb2cuY29tL2xvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1wcm90b3R5cGUtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1oYXJkd2FyZS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin delivers first prototype hypersonic hardware,"Pentagon’s No.1 weapons supplier Lockheed Martin Corp. delivered critical ground equipment for the U.S. Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system to Soldiers of the 5th Battalion 3rd Field Artillery Regiment 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord Wash.

“With this delivery we’ve taken another leap in advancing this capability to support the U.S. Army’s long-range precision fires vision in support of joint all domain operations” said Eric Scherff vice president for Hypersonic Strike Programs at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re achieving great efficiencies by supporting this program and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic program through the use of a common missile. We’ve invested heavily in creating digital factories across the corporation that employ advanced materials and precision capabilities needed for hypersonic strike and bringing this digital factory approach to hypersonics means shorter delivery spans and greater affordability.”

In a ceremony held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord today the U.S. Army and industry team celebrated this delivery of ground equipment including the battery operations center and four transporter erector launchers. The overall system is being developed in partnership with the U.S. Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office and its Hypersonic Project Office.

While the low will gradually diminish from now on the general dynamics across the Atlantic and European continent are hinting at what’s coming up for the mid-October period. Another strong cold period is forecast for Europe.

What we will see in the discussion below is the start of the interesting pattern change for much of the European continent thanks to a strong upper High developing across western Europe and North Atlantic. Normally this means the flow turns more northerly bringing colder air mass far towards the south.

Attached below is the video animation of the progress of these more progressive dynamics for continental Europe. A huge pool of much colder than normal air mass is forecast to spread far south across central Europe into the Mediterranean even reaching North Africa late this week.

The next 5-7 days possibly even up to 10 days will see pretty cold October weather which should additionally lower the monthly average temperatures in this part of the continent.

Let’s see how the cold blast will take its steps over Europe this week.

HUGE EXTRATROPICAL LOW OVER THE ATLANTIC UPPER LOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

It is quite an impressive look over the satellite imagery across Europe and the North Atlantic this Sunday. Over the North Atlantic a very large extratropical low has build-up with a well-defined baroclinic zone and warm air mass advection to its east. Farther east over western-southwestern Europe an upper-level ridge (High) is developing gradually expanding towards the north.

Areas to the east remain under the gun of the large and persistent upper-level low that has been ongoing across the northern Mediterranean and the Balkan peninsula for several days. The result was a lot of rain and even tornadoes in Italy while the highest parts of western Balkans have seen their first snowfall as well.

The weather has been pretty cold combined with hurricane-force downslope Bora winds along the eastern Adriatic coast. Winds were exceeding 150 km/h in some places. While the low is finally in a gradual weakening phase its southern parts remain active with strong convective activity over the Ionian Sea.

The visible satellite image above reveals this low pretty well while we can see only some low stratus cloud over western and southwestern Europe as normally happens under the stable upper Highs. But take a look over the Atlantic that’s our game changer coming up. It will help to establish a pretty powerful upper ridge into western Europe that will extend the cold across continental Europe through mid-October.

The low is actually pretty large if we compare its size with the size of Europe. This hints the advection of much warmer air mass to its east is quite large and so will be the cold blast to its east.

STRONG UPPER HIGH DEVELOPS ACROSS WESTERN EUROPE

As the new week starts the upper-level ridge over western-southwestern Europe will begin strengthening in response to the further advection of warm air mass coming up with the extratropical low to the west. To the east of this feature a large upper wave and the Balkan’s upper low remain in place.

At the surface the high-pressure system expands towards the far North Atlantic connecting with the High over Greenland. One large surface low remains over Scandinavia while the low over the Balkan peninsula and the central Mediterranean gradually losing its strength.

The expanded Highs mean there is no typical established zonal westerly flow towards Europe anymore. So the general flow turns more meridional coming from the north. With the cold Arctics over there it can only mean cold advection will overspread the European continent with time.

The temperature anomaly chart of Monday below hints at how this pattern is evolving. We can see warmth ongoing towards the north across the Atlantic while cold remains over the continent. With still pretty obvious cold pool sitting over southern Europe.

So the virtual channel is being established in between the two large-scale features the upper High to the west and trough/lows to the east. Having the connection with the Arctics it will deliver the air mass from this region farther south with time as the general dynamics strengthen more throughout this new week.

A MASSIVE COLD BLAST SPREADS ACROSS LARGE PART OF EUROPE

The real deal begins into the mid-week as the general weather pattern gets into a higher gear. The North Atlantic upper ridge and surface High significantly strengthen towards Wednesday introducing stronger meridional northerly flow into continental Europe. In its response a large and deep upper trough establishes and covers much of Europe.

A classic but strong dipole pattern will develop and is forecast to bring much colder weather through mid-October for many. Once we see such a strong contrast between these large-scale features the real deal begins. A huge cold pool of much colder than normal air mass will begin its progress towards the south.

Temperatures are forecast to be even more than 10 °C colder than normal for mid-October across central Europe first then also expanding across the Mediterranean and the Balkan peninsula late this week.

As we can see a large part of the European continent should see much below normal temperatures this week again. Actually many regions will see an extended period of colder weather also throughout this mid-October week. Only western Europe and part of the western Iberian peninsula should see warmer weather in the coming days.

While the upper High begins weakening after Wednesday the strong warm advection over the North Atlantic continues towards the North. And the cold pool expands far deep south into the Mediterranean delivering extremely cold air mass for mid-October for the region. This should also develop another surface low that will help the cold advection to strengthen into southern Europe.

The surface high-pressure system will remain over western Europe but will begin its weakening process due to the collapsing upper High aloft. Its position in the immediate wake of the trough to the east often allows cold air mass to spread across and around the Alps and continue far towards the south.

So it will be a very cold period for the western Balkan peninsula as well again combined with strong downslope Bora winds along the Adriatic coast (Croatia). Temperature is forecast to be 8-12 °C below normal for this period and also reach Tunisia and Libya after Thursday.

Expect some chances for more snow in the highest elevations over southern Europe especially in the southwestern Balkan peninsula.

A LOT OF SNOW IS FORECAST FOR PARTS OF SCANDINAVIA FLOODING POTENTIAL FOR GREECE

The general flow that turns to more meridional so north-northwesterly will bring a period of quite significant snowfall for the northern and northwestern Scandinavia. With the high mountain range extending from Lapland towards the southwest of the peninsula strong orographic precipitation is the result.

This far north temperatures will be cold enough that it will be heavy snowfall. And quite a lot of snow is forecast for western Norway the northern half of Sweden and Finland. Lapland will get a high snow blanket as well.

About 30-60 cm is quite likely to accumulate over the next 10 days even more than 100 cm of fresh snow in the higher mountains where persistent orographic snowfall will be the strongest. Northerly flow should also bring quite some fresh snow for the northern half of Iceland up to 30 cm is likely in some parts.

Despite a pretty significant cold advection towards southern Europe keep in mind it will be more than 10 °C below normal the mid-October period is still not cold enough to support a lot of snow that far south in the Balkan peninsula. A new surface low establishing in the Mediterranean late this week should bring more storms and rain to the south.

The general pattern will bring a lot of rain and further increase the flooding potential across the southern Balkans. Especially around Greece where a combination of warm advection and the frontal system should bring heavy rain as well as thunderstorms possibly severe weather as well. Some areas are likely to see another 150-200 mm of rain over the next 10 days.

Very cold mid-levels coming up with this new large pool of colder air mass overspreading the still warm Mediterranean should rise the potential for waterspouts and tornadoes as well.

COULD COLD EXTEND EVEN FURTHER?

The general model consensus is however not yet in good agreement regarding the weather pattern evolution for the next weekend. It depends on the North Atlantic dynamics if the upper High will re-establish or remain at least strong enough to limit the warm advection (more zonal flow) penetrating farther east.

Below is the GFS model forecast hint at its solution supporting warmth to the west but an extension of the very cold period over central Europe and the Balkan peninsula.

As we can see the general connection between the north and south might still remain which means that until the westerly flow cuts this channel the weather pattern should not have many chances to change significantly.

Here is the overlook for the temperature and rainfall forecast over the next 14 days across the Balkan peninsula Italy and North Africa. Attached below are GFS model Meteograms for Ljubljana (NW Balkans – Slovenia) Rome (Italy) Tunis (Tunisia) and Dubrovnik (SW Balkans – Croatia).

As we can see a quite long period of much-below normal temperature is forecast to extend well through mid-October across central and southern Europe. While it will be mostly relatively dry cold the southwestern Balkan peninsula and also Greece are in the threat of more rain/flooding as we discussed earlier.

The Dubrovnik chart (bottom right) surely does show a concerning amount of rain that will be ongoing through Monday and Tuesday. Flooding is likely.

The two business jets were presented at gala event in Savannah Georgia.

The G800 which will eventually replace the G650ERm offers customers the longest range in the Gulfstream fleet with its 8000 nautical-mile (14816 km) range at Mach 0.85 (1049 km/h) and 7000 nm (12964 km) range at Mach 0.90 (1111 km/h). The G800 will be powered by a pair of high-thrust Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines and will benefit from the wing tail and winglet designed for the Gulfstream G700. The G800 also features enhanced fuel efficiency and more city-pair capabilities.

In the cockpit the dual head-up displays in the G800 feature Gulfstream’s new Combined Vision System (CVS) that unites the Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS) and Synthetic Vision System (SVS) into a single image increasing pilot situational awareness and access to more airports worldwide.

In the case of G400 it offers a combination of long-range high-speed performance; cabin comfort; and environmental efficiency unrivaled in its class. Powered by advanced Pratt & Whitney PW812GA engines the aircraft will fly 4200 nm (7778 km) at its long-range cruise speed of Mach 0.85 (1049 km/h). Three floorplans are offered with options for seating up to nine 11 or 12 passengers. The G400 provides the signature Gulfstream Cabin Experience and 10 Gulfstream panoramic oval windows.

Aimed at filling niches in the business jet market the Gulfstream G800 is the longest-range aircraft to be built by the General Dynamics subsidiary and the Gulfstream G400 is Gulfstream's first large-cabin jet in a decade.

In 2020 the business jet market was valued at US$24.21 billion and by 2028 it's projected to reach US$36.94 billion which is not surprising when COVID-19 precautions are making commercial air travel less attractive to those with the money to avoid it.

As a result Gulfstream is not only looking to make its jets more technically advanced but also introducing ones that allow the company to spread its net wide in regard to potential customers.

In the case of the G400 Gulfstream plugging the gap between the super-midsize G280 and G500. Using the same fuselage as the G650ER the G400 is designed for long-range high-speed performance. Its twin Pratt & Whitney PW812GA engines punch out 13496 lb each giving the aircraft a long-range cruise speed of Mach 0.85 (562 knots 647 mph 1041 km/h) and a range of 4833 miles (7778 km).

Inside the G400 has a stand-up cabin that can seat up to 12 passengers in three floor plans with up to two and a half living spaces.

So was the Bloomin’ Onion.

A state known for its famous cartoon mouse pristine beaches and wild animal stories also served as the birthplace of some of the more popular restaurant and fast-food chains in the U.S. and beyond.

Here are stories behind the more popular restaurants that originated in Florida.

Burger King Jacksonville (1953)

Two cities claim Burger King but at least both are in Florida.

The fast-food burger franchise began in 1953 as Insta-Burger King on Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville. Later that decade two Miami-based franchisees bought the financially struggling company and renamed it Burger King.

The hamburger chain was on its way in 1957 when the Whopper was added to the menu. Burger King hit the national scene especially during the 1970s when the chain advertised heavily on television with its “Have It Your Way” commercials that touted “hold the pickle hold the lettuce special orders don’t upset us.”

The predecessor of the burger mega-chain Burger King was originally founded in 1953 in Jacksonville Florida by relatives Keith J. Kramer and Matthew Burns. They decided to call their first location Insta-Burger King due to the broilers they purchased to cook the burgers called Insta-Broilers. The following year James McLamore and David Edgerton began opening Insta-Burger franchises in Miami — they replaced the Insta-Broilers with the flame broiler system that Burger King is famous for. Due to financial hardships Kramer and Burns eventually sold the company to McLamore and Edgerton who subsequently renamed the chain Burger King.

Children also enjoyed a visit to BK receiving a paper crown that adjusted to their head size. And don’t forget the funky maroon and orange uniforms (with a goofy-looking hat to match) employees wore in the 1970s certainly helping to build its brand.

But it was perhaps its offering of flame-grilled burgers that kept customers returning along with its variety of food offerings including thick french fries and the Hershey’s Sundae Pie dessert.

In recent years Burger King added the Impossible Whopper featuring a plant-based protein-filled patty and four versions of the Ch’King Sandwich.

Burger King has more than 18000 outlets in 100 countries.

Sonny’s BBQ Gainesville (1968)

Sonny’s BBQ is a Southeastern restaurant chain known for its slow smoke traditions Southern hospitality and “Random Acts of BBQ” initiative where it throws surprise feasts for community members or organizations nominated for their good deeds.

The tradition of giving dates back to 1968 when it was founded at 2700 NE Waldo Road Gainesville by Floyd “Sonny” Tillman and his wife Lucille.

Over the years the local joint became a Florida favorite and expanded across the state and Southeastern U.S. Its first franchisee John Kirkpatrick opened an Ocala location in 1977 according to the restaurant’s online history.

Less than five years later Sonny’s had 25 restaurants. And by the end of 1998 the barbecue staple had welcomed its 100th location and spread to seven other states: Georgia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana South Carolina North Carolina and Kentucky.

The BBQ bosses at Sonny’s boast Southern must-haves like fried okra and corn nuggets and signature pork beef brisket and sauce available through dine-in takeout delivery and catering. If you’re still hankering after the meat of your meal don’t worry. Sonny’s isn’t done yet. It offers banana pudding chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon sugar doughnut holes with sweet tea glaze to fill that extra room for dessert.

Red Lobster Lakeland (1968)

Anyone who has made then savored Reb Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits at home can thank this Florida original.

Red Lobster opened in Lakeland in 1968 and General Mills two years later acquired the company. The chain expanded rapidly especially in the 1980s and today has more than 700 restaurants worldwide including nearly every U.S. state and in countries including Japan Mexico China and others.

The famous biscuits — served in restaurants first in 1992 — became so popular that the biscuit mix hit grocery store shelves so consumers can bake them in their

Red Lobster for more than half a century has specialized in of course lobster but also crab shrimp and other seafood while also serving up chicken pasta steak salads dessert and more.

Olive Garden Orlando (1982)

The popular Italian restaurant chain opened as a unit of General Mills in Orlando.

So Olive Garden was not a typical restaurant that began from an owner or two as General Mills — a multinational manufacturer that markets branded consumer foods not based in the Sunshine State — solely intended to create a chain from the get-go.

Even so Florida can claim the first one at 8984 International Drive along Interstate 4 in Central Florida which made sense with Disney World nearby.

Olive Garden has become known for its “endless” soup salada and breadsticks along with popular pasta dishes including shrimp alfredo “Tour of Italy” (featuring three of Olive Garden’s most popular dishes: chicken parmigiana lasagna and fettuccine alfredo) and lasagna fritta.

General Mills in 1995 spun off its restaurant chains to create Darden Restaurants Inc. which is headquartered in Orlando. The multi-brand restaurant operator in addition to Olive Garden owns Eddie V’s Prime Seafood The Capital Grille LongHorn Steakhouse Bahama Breeze Seasons 52 Yard House and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Hooters Clearwater (1983)

Sure there are hundreds of Hooters restaurants across the country but there’s only one Original Hooters and it can be found on Gulf to Bay Boulevard connecting Tampa to Clearwater Beach.

Opened by six businessmen “with absolutely no previous restaurant experience” according to the restaurant’s website it was incorporated on April Fool’s Day 1983 and opened on Oct. 4 of that year.

This undated photo provided by Hooters restaurant shows the original building that housed Hooters in Clearwater Fla. Courtesy photo ' Hooters

The website notes that the “Hooters Six” were L.D. Stewart a painting contractor; Gil DiGiannantonio a liquor salesman; “Uncle Billy” Ranieri a retired service station owner; Ed Droste a real estate executive; Dennis Johnson a brick mason by trade; and Ken Wimmer a partner in the painting business with L.D. Strange group.

The Original Hooters operated out of a ramshackle wood structure before being almost entirely demolished and rebuilt in 2012. Now it features a new inside/outside bar area a merchandise and to-go area and a museum dedicated to Hooters history.

Of course the main attractions in addition to the friendly staff in the famed orange and white outfits remain the World Famous Wings. On Super Bowl Sundays for instance this Tampa Bay Hooters goes through about 20000 of ’em.

Outback Steakhouse South Tampa (1988)

A global restaurant chain giant best known for its signature steaks and Bloomin’ Onion appetizer Outback debuted in March 1988 on Henderson Boulevard in South Tampa.

The story goes that friends Chris Sullivan Robert Basham Tim Gannon and Trudy Cooper came together with “the dream of opening their own restaurant — a place casual in atmosphere with quality food and service at the top of the list” according to the restaurants’ website.

“To ensure their haven would stand out from the pack they chose an Australian theme to fit the relaxed but lively mood of their ideal restaurant.” Their motto? “No rules just right.”

The original Outback Steakhouse which opened in 1988 and has since been remodeled is at 3403 Henderson Blvd. in South Tampa.

Outback was the first restaurant by the proprietors’ Bloomin’ Brands which is also still based in Tampa and now owns and operates Outback Steakhouse Carrabba’s Italian Grill Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar.

Bloomin’ Brands website notes that it’s one of the world’s largest casual dining companies with approximately 77000 employees and more than 1450 restaurants across the globe.

Rib City Grill Fort Myers (1989)

What began as local barbecue restaurant 32 years ago in Southwest Florida has spread across the U.S.

The first Rib City Grill opened on U.S. 41 in Fort Myers after original founder Gerry Pastore created the concept of a small family-style barbecue joint. In early 1990 Pastore founded a second location on Leonard Street in nearby Cape Coral.

The restaurants caught the attention of Paul Peden a Fort Myers restaurateur who met with Pastore who no longer was involved with the restaurants. Peden eventually became a partner in Rib City Grill and later bought the company.

The chain grew across Southwest Florida and eventually to other states including Colorado Missouri Tennessee Illinois and Virginia.

Rib City Grill offers backyard barbecue classics such as pulled pork chicken and baby back ribs.

“We stick to what we know and we produce what we say we will — real barbecue great ribs and excellent service” Peden told the Fort Myers News-Press in 2019. “This philosophy became the foundation of our growth.”

Metro Diner Jacksonville (1992)

Credit Guy Fieri with giving Jacksonville-based Metro Diner a boost just when it was needed most. The first Metro Diner opened in Jacksonville’s San Marco neighborhood in 1992 in a location that had housed diners under other names since the 1930s and was taken over by its current management team in 2000.

But it was a 2010 appearance on “Diners Drive-ins and Dives” with Fieri raving about the “crunchification” of Metro Diner’s signature meatloaf that brought national attention to the chain.

Metro Diners known for its “comfort food with flair” can now be found at more than 50 locations in 12 states including 25 in Florida.

Firehouse Subs Jacksonville (1994)

Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen were Jacksonville firefighters just like their dad when they opened their first Firehouse Subs location at Crown Plaza in suburban Jacksonville in 1994.

The chain known for its tasty subs and firehouse-decorated restaurants now has nearly 1200 locations in 46 states including about 170 in Florida. In a 2016 interview with CNBC Robin Sorensen said he and his brother had less than $100 in their checking accounts when they opened their first restaurant.

They started the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation in 2005 to provide funding equipment and education for first responders.

Hurricane Grill & Wings Fort Pierce (1995)

The first Hurricane Grill & Wings opened along Seaway Drive on Hutchinson Island in Fort Pierce in 1995 as Chris’ Hurricane Bar and Grill after founder Chris Russo who was only 22 years old at the time.

The most popular menu items were chicken wings and cold beer. By 2008 the restaurant chain had expanded to 30 locations in Florida Georgia and Nevada. Now it has grown to 71 locations in 15 states including Alabama Arizona Colorado Iowa Maryland Michigan Minnesota New York North Carolina and Texas.

Its current headquarters is West Palm Beach. It’s famous for its variety of 35 flavors for chicken wings; some signature sauces are Roasted Garlic Inferno Coco Loco Gold Rush Cyclone and Kogi Secret Weapon.

Bonefish Grill St. Petersburg (2000)

Bonefish Grill founders Tim Curci and Chris Parker — “fueled by their shared love for catching cooking and serving fresh fish” according to the restaurant’s website — opened its first location in St. Petersburg in January 2000.

The following year it was acquired by the Tampa-based Bloomin’ Brands and over two decades has become one of the biggest seafood chains in the country.

As its name suggests Bonefish Grill is known for its wood-grilled fish along with other seafood selections such as its Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer tossed in a creamy spicy sauce. It’s also known for its cocktail offerings stating that its hand-crafted martinis are “shaken no less than 20 times.”

Today the chain has nearly 200 locations in 31 states according to its website’s directory though its home of Florida still has by far more locations than any other state.

PDQ Tampa (2011)

Co-founded by former Tampa Bay Buccaneers chief financial officer Nick Reader and Outback’s Bob Basham this chicken-centric chain opened its first location in Tampa in 2011.

According to PDQ’s website Reader wanted a fast-food place that was fresh and he felt good about feeding to his children while Basham was in search of fresh flavor and inspiration. They found what they were looking in a North Carolina neighborhood joint called Tenders making a deal on the spot with the restaurant.

When they opened their first Tampa restaurant on Halloween weekend “car lines wrapped around the building and folks kept coming back for more.”

Since then PDQ has opened dozens more locations throughout Florida — including at Tampa International Airport Raymond James Stadium and Amalie Arena — as well as states such as North Carolina New Jersey and New York.

Along with chicken tenders nuggets sandwiches and salads PDQ serves handspun shakes.

Ford’s Garage Fort Myers (2012)

What began as a downtown Fort Myers restaurant moved quickly in a couple years faster than a 1969 Boss 429 Mustang.

Ford’s Garage quietly opened in 2012 and a couple years later something happened: A few retired executives from Naples stopped by and noticed the detail and care put into the restaurant from the black Model T suspended above the bar (which honks OOGA with steam spewing from its tailpipe) to the branded Ford’s Garage logo on burger buns.

Ford Motor Co. reached out about partnering with the restaurant and the two forged a unique relationship. Ford’s Garage became the first and only restaurant to be allowed rights to Ford’s iconic blue-oval logo as well as other of the automotive giant’s brand imagery including archived historical photos images of vehicles and actual Model Ts.

There’s now 16 Ford’s Garage restaurants in three states including one in St. Augustine next to a Ford dealership along Interstate 95. Other ones in Florida are in Brandon Cape Coral Countryside Estero Kissimmee Lakeland Orlando Sarasota St. Petersburg Wellington Wesley Chapel and Westchase.

But what about the food? Ford’s Garage offers a vareity of burgers along with onion rings served on a piston rod “Edsel’s Hot Pretzels” with dip sauce loaded mac & cheese varieties desserts like the caramel apple cookie skillet and more.

Trixie LohMirmand Executive Vice President Events Management Dubai World Trade Centre stressed that the involvement of General Motors would further support participants in light of its track record of fostering regional talent

Middle East – General Motors Middle East (GM MEO) has announced an exciting partnership with GITEX High Flyer. The move follows ongoing efforts to prioritize building future talent across science technology engineering and math (STEM) in the Middle East.

The importance GM MEO places on nurturing STEM talent has led to its endorsement of the unique program offering immersive learning opportunities to young people in the field. The partnership follows GM MEO’s collaborations with the Arab Youth Center’s Technology Fellowship Program in June to host a discussion on diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) connectivity and safety. This initiative also led to the Hybrid Internship Program inviting university students to work with GM AMEO throughout the year. Additionally GM AMEO worked closely with Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) in collaboration with Youth 4 Sustainability (Y4S) and other programs featuring virtual workshops and panel discussions on the future of mobility.

Speaking on the announcement Luay Al Shurafa President and Managing Director GM Africa and Middle East said: “At General Motors we see immense value in shaping the workforce of the future as they will be instrumental in the automotive industry’s efforts to bring about the future of mobility. By offering immersive hands-on learning programs we are able to help young people develop a STEM identity and nurture the next generation of Arab leaders to support innovation in the region. As such our partnership with the GITEX High Flyer is invaluable to align with likeminded partners and extend our mentorship exposure and insightful training. We are excited to see the new perspectives that will no doubt come out of GITEX High Flyer and look forward to creating a more diverse equitable and inclusive STEM pipeline through the internship program.”

Run by Ai Everything and GITEX GLOBAL 2021 the initiative offers a springboard from which aspiring talent across undergraduate masters and PhD programs of leading universities in the UAE and across the region can launch their careers. GITEX High Flyer will welcome innovative solutions from candidates in return for internship opportunities with key global and governmental institutions including GM MEO.

Trixie LohMirmand Executive Vice President Events Management Dubai World Trade Centre said: “We are pleased to welcome GM as our strategic partner in the first ever GITEX High Flyer programme; their backing will be invaluable to participants as the programme progresses. GM’s track record of fostering talent is particularly noteworthy and we look forward to jointly building a talent pool that aims to meet the UAE’s growing demand for technological expertise as it embarks on Projects of the 50.”

GM MEO will weigh in on the judging panel and will be selecting four interns to welcome to its teams to potentially be retained as skilled employees. This has been the case in the past at GM MEO where interns have flourished into irreplaceable team members cross the Government Relations Product Marketing Service Programs and Retail Marketing divisions.

As a leader in the technology space GM MEO aims to build the work force of the future and foster ingenuity in support of its vision for the future of mobility. GM’s is striving toward a vision of Zero Crashes Zero Emissions and Zero Congestion. GM sees a future where it can help save lives enable children to inherit a healthier planet and give customers time back spent in traffic. This is the future GM is driving to move humanity forward.

Through engaging with young STEM minds it aims to gain new perspectives around ways of working and fulfil future job roles around Electric Vehicles and the growing digitalization of the consumer experience. GM MEO will continue to cultivate new talent through such initiatives combined with hands on learning experiences that will contribute to the region’s sustainable and positive future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLW1hcnktYmFycmEtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXTSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy1tYXJ5LWJhcnJhLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How GM CEO Mary Barra wowed Wall Street,"It was a good week for General Motors CEO Mary Barra and her shareholders as she paved the road for the legacy automaker to become a tech-focused ""platform innovator.""

The stock gained 6.68% for the week after laying out plans to double revenue by 2030 while expanding profit margins on its quest to become the world’s top electric vehicle maker at the company's Investor Day.

GM'S BARRA TO BECOME FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE

""The vehicle is really becoming a software platform"" Barra told FOX Business’ Grady Trimble in a one-on-one interview. ""We think we have some of the most beautiful vehicles that we've had on the road in my career but then also being able to have a complete software and services business on top of that opens up tremendous growth with a very different margin structure.""

The company plans to rapidly scale EV manufacturing with more than 50% of North America and China plants capable of EV production by 2030. Among the new fully electric offerings will be trucks from Chevrolet GMC and HUMMER Buick crossovers as well as the Cadillac LYRIQ and CELESTIQ. Electric versions of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox are also in the works. The Equinox will be priced around $30000 much more affordable than previously announced EVs from General Motors.

GM has announced a goal of going all-electric by 2035. Right now however EVs make up only about 3% of GM’s new vehicle sales. It is also taking on Tesla and Ford.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the stock to $65 from $59 and Credit Suisse maintained its $75 target while issuing positive commentary on the plan.

The stock has gained over 40% this year.

When asked whether the company is moving too quickly to manufacture vehicles consumers aren’t sold on Barra said ""We have done tremendous research with the customer and they tell us if the vehicle's beautiful if it meets the functionality… that there is the right range over 300 miles and that there’s a robust charging infrastructure they’re in on electric vehicles.""

These vehicles will be equipped with new software and services including its new hands-free driving technology Ultra Cruise which will be offered starting in 2023 and be able to handle 95% of driving scenarios.

GM is also focused on growing its electric delivery vehicle company BrightDrop and its autonomous vehicle company Cruise.

Two shorter-term issues impacting General Motors are infrastructure talks in Washington DC and the computer chip shortage which has been plaguing automakers for months.

General Motors new vehicle sales dropped 33% year-over-year in the third quarter largely because of the chip supply chain problems. Barra said she expects chip supply to begin stabilizing in the fourth quarter and continue to do so in 2022.

In 2020 the United States Army awarded GM a $214.3 million contract to build and support 649 examples of the ISV. At the time GM said the army had approval to order an additional 1416 units if the initial batch proved successful.

The ISV is based on the platform of the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 mid-size pickup truck. It also uses the civilian model's Multimatic spool-valve dampers. GM claims the ISV uses 90% commercial off-the-shelf parts in fact.

General Motors Infantry Squad Vehicle on Jay Leno's Garage

Power is provided by the same 2.8-liter turbodiesel engine offered in the Colorado ZR2 but per army requirements it's been modified to run on jet fuel and produce 375 hp. GM is also testing a fuel-cell version independent of the army GM Defense president Steve duMont told Jay Leno. An automatic transmission was chosen to lessen the driver's workload.

This military vehicle had some different design requirements than the average truck however. For the army's requirements the ISV had to be light enough (curb weight is about 5000 pounds) to be sling-loaded under a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter and compact enough to fit inside a CH-47 Chinook. It can also be air dropped out the back of a C-130 transport plane duMont said.

The ISV gets its name from its ability to carry a full nine-person infantry squad into battle. It has two conventional seating rows plus rear and side-facing seats all the way in the back. In place of a pickup cab the ISV has a roll cage designed with lessons learned from motorsports duMont said. Soldiers can store their gear in netting on the roof.

In addition to getting the complete lowdown on the personnel carrier duMont lets Jay take the vehicle for a spin on a semi-secret off-road location. Jay enjoys driving the vehicle and has plenty of ideas for civilian applications. Meanwhile duMont says the military version can also be sold to America's allies.

The first pill to treat Covid-19 is on its way and vaccine producers are rolling out booster shots in wealthy countries. For investors the next stage of the pandemic means a tougher landscape for stockpicking The success of Merck & Co.’s oral antiviral treatment in a clinical trial has shifted the momentum in the stock market  weighing on shares of the companies that developed the most effective vaccines Moderna Inc. and the duo of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.Nineteen months into the pandemic a successful rollout of a Covid-19 pill could quicken and broaden the world’s recovery opening up a plethora of investment opportunities in stock markets.Here are some stocks seen by traders as possible winners and losers:Dozens of companies around the globe have said they’re trying to do what Merck appears to have succeeded at: Develop an easily administered treatment that reduces the risk of serious illness or death for people infected with coronavirus. For most of them the effort has come to nothing and after brief share spikes their stocks have fallen back.Among the bigger companies still working on antivirals are Pfizer Shionogi & Co. and Roche Holding AG with partner Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc. All plan to publish results from late-stage clinical trials by the end of the year. Shionogi’s pill could be a $2 billion drug the Japanese company said Friday.A tiny Israeli biotech RedHill Biopharma Ltd. said Oct. 4 its experimental oral therapy showed promise in helping hospitalized patients. The study consisted of only 251 people; weeks earlier RedHill had said the drug failed to show an effect in a broader group of patients. The company is discussing next steps with regulators.“The Covid pills are really a complement to the vaccines” said Shane Oliver head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. They could reduce demand for costlier treatments such as intravenous medicines he added.Another tiny company Synairgen Plc of the U.K. was one of the last year’s investor favorites soaring 2520% on optimism for its inhaled treatment for Covid-19. The stock has fallen 2% this year. It too expects late-stage trial data by year’s end.The possible arrival of Merck’s molnupiravir pill coupled with the prospect that the pandemic will wane further already is weighing on the valuations of jab makers.Moderna’s share price has almost tripled in 2021 after surging 434% last year. The stock’s inclusion in the S&P 500 in July further propelled it to a record and sent it soaring past analysts’ price targets.Still it’s now priced at 11 times estimated earnings down from 147 times in July 2020. The recent selloff finally brought the stock back in line with analysts’ 12-month projections for the first time in more than four months.The share price of Pfizer’s German partner BioNTech is even cheaper at 5.9 times earnings despite tripling this year.“Vaccines remain the primary prevention measure and largest market opportunity” Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison wrote in a note dated Oct. 5.Still it’s unclear how big that market will be: Harrison’s forecast for annual coronavirus vaccine sales over the long term ranges from $3 billion to $30 billion. He has equal-weight ratings on Pfizer and Moderna.The vaccine leaders may also lose market share if new inoculations from Sanofi Novavax Inc. or Valneva SE succeed and if mix-and-match boosting appears to be effective. The U.S. FDA is reviewing results of a study of adults who received booster doses of different vaccines than their original shots.Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking U.S. approval for use of their shots on children ages 5-11 while Moderna is testing its shot in kids as well.In Asia watch firms such as Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. which has a deal to distribute BioNTech and Pfizer’s vaccine in greater China and South Korea’s SK Bioscience Co. a local production partner for AstraZeneca Plc.The convenience of a pill for Covid could take market share from expensive infusions that need to be done in a clinic namely the monoclonal antibody treatments from Eli Lilly & Co. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Gilead Sciences Inc. GlaxoSmithKline Plc and partner Vir Biotechnology Inc.New oral antivirals “could open up a broader population to Covid-19 treatments in a true outpatient setting” wrote Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Chris Shibutani in an Oct. 1 research note.The continuing vaccination and a possible therapeutic may also curb the need for Covid testing kits.“Less hospitalizations as a result of Covid (which will surely be aided by molnupiravir and similar treatments) will result in a dialed-back pandemic response which should then result in less demand for asymptomatic testing -- especially for rapid testing” said Tycho Peterson an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Goldman analysts are more pessimistic saying the market for rapid Covid tests will “collapse” in 2022 to less than $200 million outside of symptomatic and PCR testing. Companies making those quick diagnostics known as antigen tests namely Qiagen NV DiaSorin SpA and Abbott Laboratories have all slumped from their recent peaks in September.Quidel Corp. Orasure Technologies Inc. and Abbott will be in focus in the U.S. Sugentech Inc. Biolidics Ltd. Metropolis Heathcare Ltd. Thyrocare Technologies Ltd. and Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd. are on traders’ radar in Asia.Other stocks to watch include lab operator Eurofins Scientific SE and suppliers of lab equipment such as Fluidigm Corp. Sartorius AG Sartorius Stedim Biotech and Tecan Group AG.",,,,,,,,,,,,

South Korea’s chipmaking giants Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix are set to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate taxes to foreign countries where they make a profit under a new landmark global taxation scheme.Members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed to allow countries to collect taxes from multinational companies if they sell their products there even if they don't have business units in those countries.The OECD had initially discussed that such taxes were only to be imposed on global major IT companies such as Google Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. but have expanded the new taxation scheme to other multinational companies.The South Korean government decided to exclude taxes paid by the country’s companies to foreign countries from domestic corporate taxes.The OECD on Oct. 8 announced an agreement on the digital tax and a minimum 15% tax rate to be implemented from 2023. The landmark deal was agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP out of the 140 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) according to the OECD.Four countries -- Kenya Nigeria Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- have yet to join the agreement.Multinational companies around the world will re-allocate some taxing rights for 25% of ""excess"" profit from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profit. In the digital taxation system profit within a margin of 10% of a company’s total global sales is classified as ""ordinary"" profit while the rest is classified as “excess” profit.In other words multinational companies pay tax on total ordinary profit and 75% of excess profit to countries where they have headquarters or workplaces while paying taxes equivalent to 25% of their excess profit to nations where they have markets.The share of taxation rights was decided at 25% after discussing rates between 20% and 30%.“Most countries insisted on 30% but Korea and many other developed nations suggested 20%. So it was decided in the middle at 25%” said a South Korean finance ministry source.Multinational enterprises with global sales above 20 billion euro ($23.1 billion) and profitability above 10% will be subject to the new rules according to the OECD. In South Korea Samsung and SK Hynix are expected to be liable to the rules and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to governments in other countries.Samsung reported 236.8 trillion won ($198 billion) in sales last year with an operating profit of 36 trillion won and a net profit of 26.4 trillion won. Under the digital taxation system Samsung’s ordinary profit was estimated at 23.7 trillion won and its excess profit was calculated at 12.3 trillion won.Samsung is supposed to pay taxes on the total ordinary profit of 23.7 trillion won and 9.2 trillion won -- 75% of the excess profit -- under the current pre-changed rules. For the remaining excess profit taxation rights will be re-allocated to countries around the globe depending on the proportion of its sales. Considering that South Korea accounts for 16% of Samsung’s total sales taxes on the excess profit of 492.5 billion won will be paid at home.In total Samsung’s taxes to South Korea are expected to decline to about 7.5 trillion won from the current 8.1 trillion won under the new rules while other countries will receive the remaining taxes of 600 billion won.“Digital taxes paid overseas are deducted from local taxes” said an official from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. “Companies will not face an additional burden since the rules just change the distribution of existing taxes.”The new rules are unlikely to have a significant impact on South Korea’s tax revenue since major global IT companies including Google and Facebook are set to pay more taxes in countries around the world balancing out the lower tax payments from large domestic companies.Jin-gyu Kang at josep@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxL29jdC8xMC9yaXNoaS1zdW5hay10by1zYXZlLWJpbGxpb25zLWJ5LWNvdW50aW5nLWltZi1jYXNoLWFzLWFpZC1mb3ItcG9vctIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIxL29jdC8xMC9yaXNoaS1zdW5hay10by1zYXZlLWJpbGxpb25zLWJ5LWNvdW50aW5nLWltZi1jYXNoLWFzLWFpZC1mb3ItcG9vcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rishi Sunak to save billions by counting IMF cash as aid for poor,"Rishi Sunak is to save billions of pounds by counting as aid financial assistance to poor countries being provided as a result of a windfall Britain has received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In a move that has been condemned by former Conservative international development secretaries the chancellor has chosen not to use the UK’s share of a new $650bn IMF global fighting fund to increase the share of national output spent on aid.

Britain received $27.4bn (£20bn) as its share of an allocation of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) – financial assets designed to help poor countries struggling during the pandemic – months after the government decided to cut aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income.

Other rich countries are making help provided as a result of the SDRs additional to existing budgets but the UK will stick to internationally agreed rules that allow 30% of any concessional lending through the IMF to count as aid.

Romilly Greenhill the UK director of the global anti-poverty campaign group ONE said she expected the Treasury to recycle about 75% of its SDR allocation and that it was likely to save between £4bn and £5bn over a number of years as a result.

SDRs are an international reserve asset issued by the IMF that can be exchanged for one of five currencies: the US dollar the euro the Chinese yuan the Japanese yen and sterling.

They are given to member states in line with their shareholding at the IMF but the chancellor said that because poor countries had greater need the government would recycle its SDRs. In a February tweet he said it would give “additional financing to low-income countries to help their response and recovery”.

The G7 group of finance ministers which Sunak currently chairs will discuss how to recycle SDRs at the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington later this week.

Profile What is the IMF? Show What is the IMF? The International Monetary Fund created in 1945 is an organisation of 189 countries based in Washington DC. It is governed by and accountable to member countries.

Its goals are to ensure the stability of the international monetary system (exchange rates and international payments) to secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.

The IMF has bailed out scores of countries over the years including the UK in 1976 when the minority Labour government borrowed £2.3bn from the fund to stabilise the value of the pound; Iceland in 2008; and Greece in 2010 2012 and 2015.​ The number of bailouts of African countries has also increased in recent years as states became more vulnerable to commodity price crashes.

The IMF was conceived at a UN conference in Bretton Woods in the US in July 1944 to build a framework for economic cooperation to avoid the devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Thank you for your feedback.

Two former Conservative international development secretaries condemned the decision. Justine Greening said: “Britain has already reduced its aid spend from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income. If we are to be a truly global Britain then we should now be focused on having the maximum impact with what remains.

“It would be counter-productive to effectively even further reduce the aid investment that saves lives and keeps fragile states stable.”

Andrew Mitchell the former international development secretary who led the Commons rebellion against the government’s decision to cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national output said Sunak should think again.

“The Treasury is quite correct to say the classification of these SDRs falls under the aid budget but the question is whether in the midst of a pandemic Britain should agree in these exceptional circumstances they should be made additional.”

Mitchell said the money being recycled by the UK to poor countries represented a contingent liability to the UK rather than actual spending. “This underlines the benefit of making it additional to the aid budget” he added.

Greenhill said Sunak should reverse the decision in the spending review at the end of the month.

“It’s shocking that the Treasury is planning on classifying part of our SDR allocation as overseas development assistance” she said. “It’s yet more evidence that they’re planning further cuts to the aid budget and are not being transparent about how they’re going about it all of which will mean the loss of yet more life-saving programmes for the world’s poorest.

“It’s even more outrageous that we are the only rich donor to be considering counting this money as aid. Because of the way SDRs work this money comes at barely any cost to the UK taxpayer. It’s literally taking charity away from those most in need.”

A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK is one of the leading international aid donors and this year we provided over £10bn towards poverty reduction climate change and global health security. We will return to the 0.7% target when the fiscal situation allows.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc2Nyb2xsLmluL3B1bHNlLzEwMDczNDgvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1pbmRpYS1kZWxheWVkLWNydWNpYWwtc3lyaW5nZS1vcmRlcnMtbm93LXRoZS13b3JsZC13aWxsLXBheS1hLXByaWNl0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2Nyb2xsLmluL3B1bHNlLzEwMDczNDgvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1pbmRpYS1kZWxheWVkLWNydWNpYWwtc3lyaW5nZS1vcmRlcnMtbm93LXRoZS13b3JsZC13aWxsLXBheS1hLXByaWNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigation: India delayed crucial syringe orders – now the world will pay a price,"In January when India began its Covid-19 vaccination drive several companies that manufacture syringes wrote letters to the health ministry highlighting the need for the government to allow the use of conventional disposable syringes in the campaign.

Since 2005 India’s mass immunisation programme has used only auto-disable syringes whose safety locks break off after a single use ensuring they are not reused. Conventional disposable syringes on the other hand can be reused posing a risk of infection.

In their letters the manufacturers noted that India lacked the capacity to produce the volume of auto-disable syringes required for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. Later in January the health ministry invited them for a meeting.

“But nothing happened beyond that” said Deepak Arora the managing director of Bio-Med Healthcare Products Ltd a company that makes conventional disposable syringes. “Officially no orders came. We could not block any quantity for the government or scale up capacity.”

On July 1 as India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive was intensified the government invited bids for 125 crore auto-disable syringes. It did not get enough bidders and was able to place just one order for 10 crore syringes.

The same month the government finally did what the manufacturers had asked for in January – it relaxed the criteria to allow bids from even companies making conventional disposable syringes and invited bids for 90 crore syringes.

But by then many companies had already made export commitments to other countries.

Export restrictions

Of the 90 crore syringes the Indian government sought it was able to place orders for only 68 crore-70 crore said several manufacturers who participated in the process. Senior government officials involved in the procurement process declined to comment on the number of syringes procured.

The shortfall eventually led to the government restricting the export of syringes last week – a move that has sparked concern around the world since Indian manufacturers export syringes to 149 countries many of which are dependent on these instruments for Covid-19 vaccinations and other medical needs.

In India the shortfall led to Covid-19 vaccinations being temporarily halted in cities like Pune and Kochi for a day each.

The government has justified the export curbs arguing it needs to prioritise the needs of India’s people. “The export restriction is temporary to help create a stock of syringes” a senior official from the health ministry said on condition of anonymity.

But Scroll.in has examined correspondence sent to the government by syringe-makers as well as a series of tender documents issued this year. They suggest that Indian manufacturers could have met India’s needs and supplied to other countries as well if the government had assessed domestic demand and availability of auto-disable syringes and placed advance orders for conventional ones.

“We have been raising red flags since last April” said Rajiv Nath managing director of Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd the world’s largest auto-disable syringe manufacturer.

Scroll.in sent an email to the health ministry on Friday asking for comment on the situation. There was no response till the time of publication.

Manohar Agnani additional secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare who oversaw the procurement process and Suresh Puri who heads the Central Medical Services Society an agency under the ministry that issued the tenders declined to comment on the syringe purchases that were made. But the senior official in the ministry who did not want to be identified insisted that they had been “in regular touch with manufacturers” and that the country had no shortage of syringes.

India has more than 20 syringe manufacturers that have capacity to produce 50 crore syringes per month. These syringes vary in size from 0.5 ml to 60 ml. But only three of these companies are capable of producing auto-disable syringes – Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd Iscon Surgicals Ltd and Becton Dickinson India Pvt Ltd. Together they can produce fewer than 15 crore auto-disable syringes per month.

In April 2020 Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd wrote to health secretary Preeti Sudan asking the government to plan for the timely availability of syringes ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine launch “to avoid having a status of availability of vaccines but shortage of syringes for vaccination”.

Nath from Hindustan Syringes said he did not receive any response. “We kept following up and finally had a meeting last October” he said. “The government placed orders by December.”

In December 2020 the government issued a tender for 35.12 crore auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml size. The three manufacturers that produce auto-disable syringes participated. Hindustan Syringes won a bid for 26.5 crore syringes BD India Pvt Ltd for 4.38 crore syringes and Iscon for 4.24 crore. They were given four months to deliver.

In January 2021 soon after India’s vaccination drive began the managing director of Bio-Med Healthcare Products Ltd Deepak Arora wrote to the health ministry highlighting the limited availability of auto-disable syringes. “In these constrained circumstances it can lead to heavy shortage of the product and hence delays in executing [the] vaccination program” his letter said.

Other companies that manufacture conventional syringes wrote similar letters urging the government to buy their syringes along with auto-disable ones. Among them was PH Healthcare Pvt Ltd director Ritesh Brahmecha. “Conventional disposable syringes of all sizes have received worldwide acceptance for use in vaccination drive against Covid-19…” he wrote. “Even WHO [World Health Organisation] has released a press note clarifying that each country should follow whatever is convenient to ensure massive outreach.”

‘Adequate stocks’

But the government did not modify its policy saying that it had an adequate stock of auto-disable syringes. In February the health ministry asked Hindustan Syringes to supply more auto-disable syringes at the same rate Nath said. Iscon’s vice president Sandeep Bhandari said his company was also asked to supply more syringes.

However the government did not share any projections about demand with the companies which the companies said was necessary to plan capacity addition.

In April 2021 Nath wrote a second letter to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan saying Hindustan Syringes could produce 84 crore auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml size per annum and ramp up production to 30 crore syringes per year if the government provided clarity on orders for 2022.

But this did not happen Nath said.

Iscon’s managers also wrote to the government asking for its annual forecast for syringe requirements. “We didn’t know how long the vaccination drive would continue” said vice president Sandeep Bhandari. “We did double our capacity last year but that was planned well before the pandemic began. The government gave no projections.”

By the time the government issued a tender for 125 crore auto-disable syringes (of 0.5 ml and 1 ml size) on July 1 Iscon could not participate – it had already accepted other orders. Hindustan Syringes too had made other commitments and could only supply 10 crore syringes to the government. “Even that 10 crore we diverted from UNICEF to supply to the Indian government” Nath said.

The same month the health ministry contacted UNICEF seeking its assistance to arrange supplies from other countries on behalf of India. Within days UNICEF invited bids for 50 crore syringes but it remains unclear how much stock it was able to procure.

Struggling to procure enough auto-disable syringes on July 9 the government invited bids for 90 crore syringes this time expanding from 0.5 ml and 1 ml auto-disabled syringes to conventional disposable syringes in sizes of 0.5 ml 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml.

The Covid-19 vaccine is administered in India in doses of 0.5 ml so syringes of 0.5 ml or 1 ml size are best suited to the task since they avoid the possibility of wastage. But left with limited options the government had to invite tenders for bigger syringes.

Despite the expanded criteria according to the manufacturers the government was able to place orders for only 68 crore-70 crore out of 90 crore syringes leaving a shortfall of more than 20 crore syringes.

Vaccination interrupted

While the government struggled to source syringes monthly vaccination numbers continued to rise depleting the stockpile of syringes.

Until July 1 India had delivered 33.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses. That month alone it administered 13.45 crore vaccinations which went up to 18.35 crore in August and 23 crore in September.

In Odisha immunisation officer Dr Tapas Patra said that he state faced a shortage of syringes for over three days in September.

In Rajasthan a senior health official said the state’s buffer stock of syringes was depleted by September. “Every night we used to take stock of syringes left in vaccination centres and the diversion would begin from one centre to another” the official said requesting anonymity. “A month or so ago the [Central] government asked us to use 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml syringes if 0.5 ml syringes were not in stock.”

Odisha and Rajasthan did not shut down the vaccinations due to the syringe shortage but Pune in Maharashtra had to halt vaccinations on October 1 and Kochi on August 16.

Kerala Tamil Nadu Rajasthan Maharashtra are among the few states that are making local procurements. “It is true that the [Central] government is unable to fulfil our requirements” said Dr Archana Patil who heads the Directorate of Health Services in Maharashtra. On October 6 Maharashtra received 30 lakh syringes from the Central government a stock that will last three days.

India has administered 94.5 crore Covid-19 doses so far. In addition regular immunisation programmes continue – 12.7 crore children and 3 crore pregnant women are immunised in India annually.

KL Sharma a former joint secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said the normal procurement process for syringes is based on the previous year’s trend. “This is a very uncertain time for the government to plan in such a dynamic situation” he said. “What the government could have done is taken stock every three months for syringes and kept manufacturers informed.”

Setback to exporters

Since the two tenders for syringes in July yielded little response on September 21 the government wrote to the Syringe Manufacturer’s Association of India about a possible “partial control on export”.

Within a week several manufacturers wrote back to the government in alarm.

In its letter Lifelong Meditech Private Ltd India’s biggest syringe exporter pointed out that it had participated in government tenders and even started supplying syringes to the government ahead of the delivery schedule. It has committed to supplying 10.75 crore syringes to the government before December.

In 2020-’21 Lifelong was responsible for 47% of syringe exports from India exporting 67.3 crore syringes.

“We have established our customer base after many years of efforts and against stiff competition from China” said H Srivastava Director and CEO of Lifelong. “This industry takes years to develop if they put restrictions like this for even four months the entire business will move on to Chinese firms.”

Altogether in 2019-’20 India had exported 106 crore syringes which rose to 143 crore in 2020-’21. Between April and July this year the country has exported 55.2 crore syringes – a 15% rise in monthly exports between last year and this year. Average monthly exports have risen from 8.8 crore in 2019-’20 to 11.9 crore in 2020-’21 and 13.8 crore since April this year.

On October 4 the Directorate General of Foreign Trade restricted exports for up to four months for all kinds of syringes including those that are not even used for immunisation. After manufacturers asked for those syringes to be exempted on October 9 the government restricted exports only of syringes with sizes of 0.5 ml 1ml 2 ml and 3 ml. But it allowed the export of syringes with a capacity of 5 ml and more which are used for other medical purposes such as administering insulin shots to diabetic patients. The duration of the restrictions was reduced to three months.

The curbs will still affect Brazil and Argentina which are India’s biggest clients followed by the United Arab Emirates Sudan Russia Nigeria Germany Philippines. Manufacturers say this will setback India’s efforts to compete with China which remains the biggest exporter in the global syringe market.

This year Iscon has so far taken orders for 22 crore auto-disable syringes to be delivered by March 2022. Hindustan Syringes has accepted orders for 67.5 crore syringes and already supplied 48.4 crore. Becton Dickinson Ltd has supplied 4.38 crore syringes.

Arora from Biomed said he has orders for 3 crore syringes for October including from Ethopia and Palestine that rely on Indian manufacturers for supplies. In a letter to the health ministry he wrote: “Non-honouring of our export contracts can bring legal liability on us and will be set back to Government of India’s Atamanirbhar Bharat Program.”

Instead of banning exports Arora said the government should force all manufacturers to compulsorily supply a minimum of 20% of their production for local use.

But scaling up production itself will take time. Nath from Hindustan Syringes said the full capacity of a manufacturing unit can’t be utilised at short notice since inputs like needles cannulas rubber gaskets stainless steel tubing and plastics need to be arranged. Most of these raw materials need to be imported a process that could take weeks. A batch of syringes could take 20 days-24 days from production to pass quality tests.

Manufacturers say this situation could have been averted had the government taken a decision to use conventional disposable syringes for Covid-19 vaccinations in January itself.

“We would have enough syringe capacity in India if this was well thought of six or nine months ago” said Srivastava the CEO of Lifelong.

Gathering around the table for Thanksgiving dinner this year has already become much more common than last. So much so that one popular Winnipeg watering hole has taken it upon themselves to prepare turkey dinners for hundreds of customers.

The Beer Can located beside the Granite Curling Club has put together a team of 75 volunteers and they’re responsible for cooking up to 400 meals.

“The idea is anyone in the community can come in and have some food and pay what they think it was worth” explained the venue’s co-owner Brad Chute.

“People that maybe had a bad year because of COVID will maybe pay less or nothing and the people that had a good year or are doing well can pay a little bit more” Chute said.

The proceeds collected throughout the night are going towards the West Central Women’s Resource Centre an organization that’s partnered with the Beer Can on various initiatives throughout the summer.

“I think magic happens when social service agencies and private business can come together to support our community” said the centre’s executive director Lorie English.

When I first arrived in Finland my discomfort was constant and intense. I didn’t have many friends; I didn’t speak the language. I felt isolated and lonely as hell like an outsider who didn’t belong. It took a few months to get comfortable and get to know people many of whom remain amazing friends to this day.

My team ended up being a saving grace. That first season one of our assistant coaches would pop into my dressing room before games: “Okay Hayley number 11 and number 67 they’re going to try to take you out today.” This allowed me to prepare for it. I was mentally aware of what was coming. I would look at the bench next door and keep my eyes on the players in question. When I was on a shift with one of them I always knew where they were on the ice.

I wore a visor instead of the full cage we wear in the women’s game. I never thought I would miss my cage until I took an Easton Synergy stick across the bridge of my nose in one of my first games with Salamat. The crack was so loud even the fans heard it. Blood gushed from my nose like it was a fountain. When I got to the bench the guys were horrified. I grabbed the door with two hands and slammed it as hard as I could. I had been run at during every game and every practice in front of the media for weeks on end leading up to that moment. It just plain sucked. I was so incredibly uncomfortable with everything I had chosen for that season and this was a breaking point literally.

I grabbed my nose and shifted it back into place. I decided to try out my Finnish. “Pikku! "" I shouted and sat down. I thought I’d said “Fuck.”

One of my teammates Immo – the team’s tough guy who became a close friend – handed me a towel and I put it over my face. “Hayley it’s vittu” he said. We both laughed – turns out the “swear word” I yelled actually means “small child.” Then I buried my tears of frustration in the towel. Dealing with all the other crap I was dealing with hurt more than the broken nose. But I didn’t want the guys or the media to see me cry.

For a week I had a pair of black eyes and I still have a bump on the bridge of my nose – my souvenir from Finland. A couple nights later I got my first goal a backhand in front of a sellout crowd of 1200 at our home rink. I forgot all about my sore nose. I had reached one of my goals – the pursuit of which had put me so far out of my comfort zone in the first place – I was improving my game.

When we played our rival the Savonlinnan Pallokerho or SaPKo their head coach told reporters that he’d brought up a pair of goons to knock the daylights out of me. That I was okay with. What infuriated me was where SaPKo had me change before the game. Instead of opening up a dressing room for me they stuck me with their team’s cheerleaders. Their not-so-subtle dig lit a fire in me. We beat Savonlinnan that night and I was named player of the game in front of 9000 fans. My reward was … a paper bag full of raw fish. Strangely SaPKo’s player of the game was given a trophy. My linemates were pissed. They took the fish and threw it against the rink wall. Then they bought a bunch of beer and we spent the four-hour ride back to Kirkkonummi drinking on the bus my teammates cheering me up.

Always being a seeker can put you in some really uncomfortable positions. But it’s the best way to grow – and there will be bright moments too. Patches of sunlight that break through the overwhelming feelings of What did I just get myself into? – like my first goal for Salamat or when my teammates had my back against SaPKo. Those moments will keep you going through the rough patches. There was another bright spot in that long year: Matilda Nilsson the five-year-old daughter of Camilla and Toni Nilsson the couple who ran the rink in Kirkkonummi. Matilda who always wore a bright blue Salamat tuque atop her long white-blond hair was a little rink rat. Her parents could never get her off the ice.

Matti our coach didn’t seem to mind. He ran practice from the bench never once lacing up to skate with us. When he blew the whistle we’d skate to the boards where he’d explain the next drill. That was also Matilda’s cue. At the sound of Matti’s whistle she’d hop onto the ice and race for the net practising her shot on the suddenly empty net. When Matti whistled to signal the start of the next drill Matilda would hustle off the ice and sit beside him watching us skate.

Matilda came to every home game – she was practically our mascot. When things went badly I would hear a shy little knock on my dressing room door. I’d quickly compose myself and let her in. She’d sit beside me. She didn’t speak much English and I didn’t speak any Finnish. But that didn’t matter. We spoke the language of hockey. She’d smile up at me and I’d feel my pain melt away. She was this brilliant dazzling light in a very dark winter.

I’ve stayed close to the Nilsson family in the years since I left Finland. They’ve visited Noah and me in Calgary and I’ve been back to Finland to visit them. In 2020 shortly after Matilda turned 23 she was named to the Finnish national women’s hockey team. The little girl who sat with me in some of my loneliest moments all those years ago is now living out her own hockey dreams. I couldn’t be happier for her.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXJkYWlseWdsb2JlLmNvbS9zdG9yeS8yMDIxLzEwLzA5L29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbGluZGEtYnJ1bm8tZ3Jvc3NtYW4vMTU5NDUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Linda (Bruno) Grossman - The Globe,"SOUTHBOUROUGH Mass. - Linda (Bruno) Grossman 72 of Southbouroughpassed away on Sept. 30 2021 at her home surrounded by her family.

Linda was born in Wakefield Michigan to Julia (Decur) Bruno and Peter Bruno. Linda was a sister to Darlene Bruno Robert Bruno and Mick Bruno (Janet). Linda graduated from Wakefield High School then graduated from St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing in Marquette Michigan as an RN.

Linda and a group of her RN girlfriends decided to move to Boston to start their new careers. It is there that Linda met the love of her life Howard ""Hersh"" Grossman. They moved to Florida where they were married in 1972. After a short stay in Florida they then moved back to the Boston area where they made their home.

Linda and Hersh raised three amazing sons Jeremy (Jill) Stephen (Heather) and Paul (Kate) who made her very proud in their accomplishments and especially to call herself ""Grammie"" to five incredible grandchildren: Noah Leyla Hannah Dillion and Jackson.

Linda loved her job working as an RN at an allergy clinic for many years. Linda and Hersh enjoyed many vacations around the United States and abroad. An enormous enjoyment and love in life was her children and grandchildren watching their youth activities and spending time with them especially at their summer home at Cape Cod and on the beach.

Linda never left her roots behind. Over the years Linda risked many snowstorms to make sure she came back home to Wakefield to spend time with her family during the Christmas holidays and taking her children and grandchildren to grandma's house to experience the Italian traditions and Wakefield winters. She also came back many times with her children and grandchildren to the 4th of July celebrations.

In 2007 Linda was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma and was told she would live two maybe five years. Linda's response to that was ""we'll see about that."" Linda fought a tough battle over 14 years and amazed all her doctors and proved all their predictions were wrong time and time again. Linda remained positive through it all and was always a rock of strength for her family. Her presence and strength will be missed by many. May Linda's life be a blessing.

Linda was preceded in death by her father Peter A. Bruno; paternal grandparents John Bruno and Mary (Bugni) Bruno; maternal grandparents Dominic Decur and Mary (Bugni) Decur; and her maternal stepgrandfather James Bugni.

Goldman Sachs and a former intern have settled according to court filings from Thursday.

The intern accused the company of fostering a culture that promotes hazing and violence.

He says he suffered bleeding to the brain after an adviser punched him and headlocked him.

Goldman Sachs has reached a settlement with a former intern who accused the investment firm of fostering a ""fraternity culture"" that promoted hazing and violence.

Patrick Blumenthal was a Drexel University student who interned for Goldman Sachs in San Francisco beginning in September 2017.

Court filings say Blumenthal was assigned to work with a group that called itself ""Team 007"" and was led by wealth adviser Julius Erukhimov.

A complaint alleges that the bank ""fostered a fraternity culture"" complete with derogatory name-calling physical altercations and ""rampant"" drinking. It says Blumenthal was pressured to drink within his first week at Goldman despite being underage and was repeatedly warned early on that he would ""take an infinite amount of shit from people."" The filing says Erukhimov called the plaintiff a ""pussy"" for not drinking enough and even told Blumenthal to take Adderall so he could drink more.

The settlement filed Thursday in the San Francisco Superior Court does not reveal the specific terms of the agreement.

Perhaps the most damning incident in the lawsuit says Blumenthal was ""forced to drink by his managers"" during a ""First Friday"" bar event. The filing accuses Erukhimov of telling Blumenthal that he would ""teach him how to drink"" before punching him in his stomach and telling him to punch his manager back.

When Blumenthal said no the complaint filing says Erukhimov wrestled with him and shoved him from the bar to the outdoor patio. The adviser then allegedly choked Blumenthal for so long that he passed out and urinated on himself. Blumenthal came away from the incident with an injured head the filing says.

He went to the emergency room days later according to the complaint where doctors told him he had bleeding to the brain.

Multiple Goldman employees witnessed the event Blumenthal's lawyers say in the complaint filing. And they let Erukhimov drive Blumenthal to Erukhimov's home where he took four pain relievers. At the adviser's apartment Erukhimov allegedly threatened him saying a relative would kill him if Blumenthal disclosed the events of the night to management.

Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for the details of the settlement.

It once boasted on its Web site that the firm “is most proud of the work it has done keeping its clients out of the courts and out of the public eye.” On his Twitter profile John Teitler explains to his 78 followers that he is a “lover of family courts of all kinds (legal squash tennis…)” and of “the original Atticus Finch.”

It turns out that one of Teitler & Teitler’s specialties along with its discretion is representing current and former Goldman Sachs partners in their divorce proceedings. The firm represented John Waldron Goldman’s president and C.O.O. in his divorce which dragged on for six years. It has represented former partners Howard Silverstein Gary Seevers John Gilliam and former managing director Richard Katz in their divorces. It represented Ashok Varadhan a member of Goldman’s Management Committee in his divorce. It is currently representing David Leuschen a former partner in his divorce. And it also represented Goldman C.E.O. David Solomon in a civil matter in 2004.

But it’s not just the men of Goldman Sachs whom Teitler & Teitler represents. Currently two of the most powerful women on Wall Street—both are Goldman partners—are clients: Stephanie Rader the head of the distressed-debt-and-bank-loans sales groups and Jo Natauri global head of health-care investing in the firm’s Merchant Banking Division in her divorce proceeding from her husband Tiku Natauri. Other senior women at Goldman such as Kathryn Sweeney used the Teitler firm in their divorce cases.

While Teitler & Teitler boasts that it likes to stay out of the press there are times when one or more of the aggrieved parties involved decides to go public as much out of despair as anything else. For instance in 2002 the shocking details of the nasty divorce between former Goldman executive Henry Owsley and his wife Danica Cordell-Reeh made their way into New York magazine. The article traced the custody battle involving the couple’s four-year-old twins which included allegations that Cordell-Reeh wasn’t feeding the children properly and worse that she was possibly “delusional paranoid and schizoidal.” Cordell-Reeh claimed that John Teitler had turned her into the “Ice Queen” by claiming that Owsley had “serious concerns about his wife’s mental health” and that Cordell-Reeh “routinely” walked around their Central Park West apartment naked and allowed her children to fingerpaint in the nude and use their naked buttocks as paintbrushes. It was also claimed in court that she encouraged her children to lick people on the arms.

“My whole world just crashed” Cordell-Reeh told the magazine. “It was like being in a snowstorm where you’re walking into that wind it’s coming heavy and you’re just trudging as hard as you can but you’re not getting anywhere and you don’t even know where you’re going.”

Achieving Their Objectives “in a Discreet Fashion”

Teitler & Teitler doesn’t only represent Goldman Sachs executives in their divorces. Annette Roque Matt Lauer’s ex-wife was a client. David Mugrabi the billionaire art collector employed them in his split from his wife Libbie a divorce that the New York Post called “the nastiest” in New York City. The firm has also represented Ken Griffin’s wife Anne Dias; Harry Macklowe’s wife Linda; and Cheryl Strauss Einhorn the wife of David Einhorn the founder of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital. It has also represented Dinakar Singh a former Goldman partner and the C.E.O. of Axon Capital on his recently completed divorce.

But Goldman always seems to come first. And the long-running divorce battle that Jo Natauri a 44-year-old Goldman partner who specializes in investing in private-equity deals in the health-care industry has been waging against her husband Tiku Natauri is but the latest Goldman spouse to come up against Teitler & Teitler.

In the Natauri divorce Teitler & Teitler represents Jo whom Goldman paid more than $10 million in 2017. Tiku no longer has legal representation in the divorce proceeding and represents himself even though he has no legal training. Since the proceedings began in 2018 he’s had six different attorneys. (He hired one to file a recusal motion.) He says other lawyers won’t represent him because the Teitlers are representing his ex-wife. “These cases are groaners” one prospective lawyer told him “because my office groans every time there’s a call or e-mail from them—it’s not worth my peace of mind.”

Currently two of the most powerful women on Wall Street—both are Goldman partners—are clients.

Tiku Natauri has already lost legal custody of his three children who this summer attended Camp Robin Hood in Freedom New Hampshire which is owned by David Solomon the Goldman C.E.O.

“I have gone from a present parent to a parent on the sidelines” he says. And he may yet lose his portion of the marital estate that he estimated at around $30 million. He currently works as the chief investment officer for the family office of a close friend but owes the friend nearly $1 million he borrowed to pay his former attorneys.

“Jo and I Were Poor Entering This Marriage”

Tiku Natauri 45 and Jo Gadiyaram first met in the spring of 1995. Her best friend lived in Tiku’s freshman dorm at Duke. Jo was at the University of Virginia. They both grew up in the South: Tiku in Atlanta Jo in Virginia. They started dating during the summer after sophomore year. At Duke he majored in economics and minored in chemistry. At U.V.A. she was pursuing a double major in biology and economics.

After college the couple headed to Wall Street. He was a financial analyst in Credit Suisse First Boston’s M&A technology group first in New York City and then in Palo Alto. She went to Alex Brown as a financial analyst and then with Tiku’s help got a job as a financial analyst at Credit Suisse in California. In December 2002 Jo moved to Boston to become a vice president at SG Cowen a small health-care-and-technology investment bank. Tiku stayed in San Francisco until 2004 first working at a tech company and then at a small investment firm before moving to Boston too to work at a hedge fund.

Jo Natauri in 2018.

In August 2004 Jo jumped ship to a health-care client Cytyc (now Hologic after a 2007 merger) working in corporate development. By then she had developed a reputation as a hard-charging investment banker. One day into her new job at Cytyc she told Tiku she was bored.

“You’re putting a Ferrari on local roads” Tiku told her. She wanted to tell the company’s C.E.O. they were under-utilizing her. Tiku told her to relax since she had just started. “People go home at five” she told him. “People aren’t responsive. I’m just sitting here in my office doing nothing. This is so slow.”

A few months later a former colleague asked her if she would be interested in returning to investment banking at Deutsche Bank as a vice president. She leapt at the chance even though it meant leaving Boston for New York City. Within a year at Deutsche Bank Jo was recruited away by Goldman to work in its health-care-investment-banking group as a vice president.

With Jo in New York City Tiku moved to San Francisco again to work in another small hedge fund. He stayed for two years and then moved back to New York City to work for Castlerock Management a third hedge fund. After a year he moved to S.A.C. Capital the hedge fund founded by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen. In November 2007 Tiku and Jo married.

“Jo and I were poor entering this marriage” Tiku says. “We are both the same. Our parents are immigrant families from India. We both had nothing in this country.” That would change soon enough.

In 2008 Goldman promoted Jo Natauri to managing director. According to Tiku she thought she should have been promoted to partner in 2010 but that didn’t happen. Two years later though she was named a Goldman partner in investment-banking coverage one of the most coveted senior positions on Wall Street.

Like the Teitler case involving Goldman executive Henry Owsley and his wife Tiku Natauri is so despairing that he chose to share the details of his divorce with me.

While Teitler & Teitler boasts that it likes to stay out of the press there are times when one or more of the aggrieved parties involved decides to go public.

Tiku describes his ex-wife as a “commercial killer” who made so much money for Goldman that she got paid more than her boss. He says she was “very presentable” “very sweet and soft-spoken” and not “brash” “abrasive” or “confrontational.” He says clients loved Jo. “She just has to win deals” he continues “and that’s what she does phenomenally well.”

But she could also be ruthless with a keen desire to win at all costs. When Tiku would attend various Goldman functions bankers at the firm would come up to him. What’s it like being married to Jo? they wondered. He says that question shocked him. “At home she was quiet” he says. “Except for the arguments she was quiet and nice and sweet.... At work they’re like ‘She’s a fucking killer. She’ll rip your throat out if she doesn’t get her way.’ That surprised me.”

In 2015 Goldman got her an executive coach. She may have been a partner making millions of dollars a year but the coach informed her there were things she should improve on if she wanted to be considered for Goldman’s management track to which Tiku says she aspired. According to the coach Jo needed to “avoid misleading communications” “avoid misleading by omission” and “overcome the perception you frequently hide the ball.”

He wrote to her that she needed to “work to change your image of being a lone commercial wolf/lone ranger in the firm.” He added “Become a leader a collaborative partner a team builder and not just a big producer.”

“We Just Decided Our Marriage Should End”

While Jo’s Wall Street career seemed to be soaring Tiku’s was sputtering. His brief stint at S.A.C. Capital ended when the firm let him go after the 2008 financial crisis. He had trouble finding another hedge-fund job because two of the firms he worked at—S.A.C. and Loch Capital in Boston—were charged with insider trading. He started working from home investing the couple’s money and taking care of their three young children now aged 11 9 and 7. “She made enough” he says “and I knew how to do that.” He is one of three co-chairs of the parent-teacher association at the children’s Manhattan private school.

As a step to try to save the marriage the couple moved out of New York City for the summer of 2018 to a rental home in Charlotte North Carolina where Tiku could stay with the children while Jo commuted from Goldman for long weekends. They thought they’d save money and that the kids would have a better quality of life.

By July it was clear the reclamation effort had failed. “We just decided our marriage should end” is the way Tiku puts it. “We’ve had years of strife and conflict even pre-marriage.”

After they agreed to divorce however Tiku started noticing that Jo was acting a bit strangely. He’d drop the kids off at a day camp and then get an e-mail from her saying “Please do not restrict access to the children.” He’s thinking What the fuck are you talking about?

Everything changed on August 20. That’s when on Jo’s behalf John Teitler filed an emergency restraining order intended to immediately return their three children to her in Tribeca and to prevent Tiku from visiting or communicating with her except by e-mail or text and only if it pertained to their children.

As might be expected in what has become an extremely contentious divorce proceeding Jo’s allegations against Tiku were extensive and if true disturbing. (Tiku tells me on the record they are not true. Jo declined to respond to my questions.) Jo alleged that Tiku was going to take their children to Colorado without her; that he was verbally and physically abusive to her; and that raising the children fell largely to her and that he tried to restrict access to them.

Tiku “has stopped at nothing to control me and manipulate me during our marriage” she wrote in her affidavit. “I have until now acquiesced and silently allowed him to continue his abusive conduct to appease him as any opposition usually results in more abusive behavior from him.”

In her affidavit she recounted what Tiku described as a “domestic violence incident” that he says “100 percent never happened.” According to Jo she flew to Charlotte from New York on Thursday August 9 2018 hoping to see their three children before they went to bed. There were four bunk beds in their bedroom and she wrote that she had been sleeping in one of them on her visits in order to be able to “cuddle” with her kids when they woke up in the morning.

She arrived at 7:30 that night and the children were already asleep. She wrote that upon her arrival Tiku started to “badger” her to not see the children for half the weekend. She said that since she doesn’t get to see the kids during the week she didn’t want any restrictions on seeing them on the weekend.

When she went to the stairs to go up to her separate room he followed her and when she went into the bedroom Tiku she said “terrified me” by trying to force his way in to continue the “discussion.” She wrote that eventually she locked herself in the bathroom.

“I was sobbing and terrified to leave” she continued.

“I Love You with All My ‘Forgetful’ Heart”

In his affidavit Tiku presented a very different picture. He included copies of years of Father’s Day and anniversary cards that Jo had given him. In 2016 Tiku’s sixth year as a father Jo wrote “I don’t think the kids could have asked for a more caring loving funny father. You enrich their lives so much and your love for them comes out in everything you do.”

On Valentine’s Day 2018 five months before they agreed to split and after months of weekly therapy Jo wrote Tiku “I am so glad we are persevering … thank you for your faith in us and your support Through a tough (!) year. I love you with all my ‘forgetful’ heart.”

Tiku’s affidavit appeared to refute many of Jo’s accusations.

Jo’s allegations against him? The idea that he was taking the children to Colorado without her knowledge or approval? In his affidavit he included copies of five United Airlines tickets between Newark and Denver that he had purchased in April 2018 and copies of five tickets he had purchased for the family to return from Charlotte to New York City on August 22 two days before the planned family trip to Colorado. “Jo had no reason to suspect let alone believe that I might decline to return to New York City or abscond with the Children” he wrote in his affidavit.

After they agreed to divorce Tiku started noticing that Jo was acting a bit strangely. He’d drop the kids off at a day camp and then get an e-mail from her saying “Please do not restrict access to the children.”

Tiku also appeared to refute the August 9 “domestic violence incident.” Without Jo’s knowledge Tiku explained he had set up in the Charlotte rental a series of recording devices. (There was also one in their car.) He decided it would be “prudent” to set up the recording devices due to his “concern arising out of ominous statements made by Jo and changes in Jo’s behavior starting in July 2018.”

Tiku provided the court with a recording and transcript of the August 9 altercation which he claimed “collectively show the falseness of Jo’s statements.” He wrote that he didn’t prevent her from closing the bedroom door. There was “no feeling of terror only irritation and anger” he continued.

Jo claimed she had been “sobbing” but the tape revealed “no ‘sobbing’” Tiku wrote. “There was no whining” he continued. “There was no whimpering. There was Jo speaking forcefully and with no fear.” He spent much of the rest of the affidavit attempting to show that her claims against him were untrue. “I continue to be puzzled perplexed and disheartened by the aggressive pre-emptive attack which Jo has made against me based upon a mountain of false statements” he claimed.

At this point Tiku still had representation—Blank Rome—and an expectation that he had a fighting chance of being treated fairly in the upcoming trials about custody of the children and the division of the family’s $30 million or so estate. At an emergency hearing on August 22 his attorneys told the judge about the recording and transcript that appeared to refute Jo’s claim of domestic violence.

“She was going for what they call the ‘nuclear option’: sole custody a restraining order against her husband” Tiku says. “That I would be kicked out of the marital home and would require supervised access and visitation with the children.”

The judge did grant Jo’s emergency request to have the three children returned to New York from Charlotte and that they could only leave New York with the judge’s approval effectively scotching the Colorado trip. Tiku was also “enjoined” from “assaulting harassing intimidating or threatening” Jo. But he retained access to the kids half the time and the couple continued to share the family apartment in Tribeca.

In September 2018 Tiku’s new attorney William Beslow initiated a settlement offer regarding joint custody of the children shared and equal residential custody and a dispute-resolution mechanism. But Jo rejected Tiku’s proposal. Once the divorce papers were filed the marital assets were frozen. Tiku had to find a job which he did—working for the private office of his wealthy Duke friend—at a salary of $150000 a year. But there was little debate about who remained the breadwinner in the Natauri family: it was Jo.

Tiku’s fortunes in the battle began to take a turn for the worse when the dispute hit the courtroom of New York State Supreme Court judge Lori Sattler who specializes in matrimonial and tax disputes. Judge Sattler is well known to the Teitlers. The firm was one of the largest donors to Sattler’s 2017 election campaign for a 14-year term donating $3000. One of Sattler’s law clerks—Alexandra White—is the sister of Teitler attorney Elizabeth White Bass. Tiku’s attorney at the time pointed out the “obvious conflict of interest” but the Teitlers denied any such conflict and accused Tiku of a “second attempt … to forum shop in this case.”

Three years on the Natauri’s divorce still has not been resolved. Tiku lost the custody battle and now can see his children only on Wednesdays and every other weekend. He left the “marital home” in Tribeca and now lives in a rental apartment on Central Park South where he is behind on the rent to the tune of $40000. (Jo moved closer to Goldman Sachs on West Street in Lower Manhattan.) During Tiku’s testimony in the custody trial Judge Sattler regularly sustained the Teitler motions objecting to what Tiku was saying. Jo had seven days to put on her case; the judge gave him two and a half.

He’s now in purgatory between the custody trial and the trial about divvying up the marital estate in which he is representing himself. On September 9 Jo called 911 and police officers from the Midtown North Precinct in Manhattan were dispatched to Tiku’s rental apartment to check on the children who were with Tiku because she suspected something was “going on with the children” according to Tiku. He says the police saw that he was “cooking pasta and making pizza” for them and then apologized for disturbing him. After the police left one of the children asked Tiku “Why is Mom trying to have you arrested?”

The divorce trial—and resolution—is still years away. “This is a messy one” Tiku says. “I’ve talked to the best matrimonial lawyers in the city.... No one wants to touch it.” He wonders if it’s because of the Teitlers whom he figures Jo has paid some $3 million for their advice.

“Remember I’ve known Jo since she was a freshman in college” he says. “For as successful as she is her street smarts and her ability to be this conniving it’s not her.”

He’s now $1.4 million in the hole including $300000 in credit-card debt while Tiku says Jo received $3.5 million after taxes in January from Goldman which he believes should have been part of the marital estate. If the judge had allowed him access to half of that money he’d be fine he says but she didn’t.

When he brought up that fact with the judge that Jo has far outspent him on legal fees making for an unfair playing field Sattler was having none of it. “Mr. Natauri I say it every single time get a lawyer” the judge told him during a recent September hearing. “But for some reason you don’t seem to be able to. With $200000 you can’t get a lawyer. A lot of people would be thrilled to have that amount.” Tiku was taken aback. “$200000 is a pittance compared to the three million the Teitlers have had” he replied clearly irritating her.

He tried to have Sattler removed from his case because of the relationship between the two sisters. But since in New York State she could decide that motion on her own she decided not to recuse herself.

Tiku suspects his ex-wife is just following the Teitler playbook.

“You execute on it” he believes they told her “and we’ll get you exactly what you want.” Which is what I ask? “All she cares about is winning” he says. “It doesn’t matter how much she has to pay to win. She just wants to win.” It reminds me of the old Wall Street adage: “It’s not enough for you to succeed; others have to fail.”

Tiku despairs. “The result is Jo and the Teitler firm have become the 800-pound gorilla in controlling intimidating and harassing me into submission” he explains. “This is an unescapable and unbearable vicious cycle. It is constant unforgiving and unrelenting.”

“We do not usually comment on current or past matters and will not do so here other than to say that any assertions of improper conduct or undisclosed conflict made by you and/or Mr. Natauri regarding the Natauri matter (or any other matter) are incorrect” John Teitler responded when asked for comment. “These are private matters and it is unfortunate if Mr. Natauri or others seek to treat them otherwise.”

For its part Goldman Sachs when asked for comment said “We are deeply disappointed that Air Mail sees such material fit for publication for a story so lacking in public interest and regarding a private person.” “Jo Natauri has been a partner of Goldman Sachs for 10 years and is an exceptional professional. We regret she and her family were not afforded the respect or the privacy we each deserve.”

Throughout our conversations Tiku seemed calm in the face of what surely has become a Kafka-esque nightmare for him. He’s lost easy access to his children. He’s increasingly financially destitute. Jo has painted him as someone who has “abused her for twenty years” so he worries that his reputation is in tatters. As his existential legal battle continues to rage he is without legal representation. “How am I calm?” he asks. “I’m numb … In the environment we’re in today you know my name is not Joe Smith. Tiku Natauri you google it and you’re going to find me. I’m not going to just go quietly and not address an allegation that’s now being made publicly no fucking way. Because my kids will start to believe that. She’s already alienating the school and the doctors against me. So I don’t know if I’m calm. I’m defeated but I’m set on my path and I just have to let it play itself out at this point. I don’t know if that makes sense.”

He fears that Judge Sattler will sanction him for speaking out publicly. And in fact as this story was going to press the Teitlers filed an emergency motion with the court seeking to prevent Tiku from continuing to share information with the press about Jo and her career at Goldman Sachs. The Teitlers also sent Tiku a letter telling him not to disclose what they describe as “Goldman Sachs Confidential Information.”

Sounds like he’s on a kamikaze mission I say. Tiku agrees. But he says he has no choice but to proceed. “I’ve already lost two wings and a rudder” he laments. On Friday Tiku caught a bit of a break when the judge declined to sign Teitler’s gag order as proposed siding partially with Tiku—at least for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1hadIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs' AI guy lured by Microsoft's WFH policy,"One of Goldman Sachs' leading AI researchers in Europe has left for Microsoft. He appears to have been swayed by the technology firm's work from home policy.

Luciano Del Corro has left Goldman's Frankfurt office and is joining Microsoft. He's joining the research lab in Redmond Washington but will be working from his home country of Argentina.

Del Corro left Goldman in September according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined the firm as an executive director in January 2019 and was a lead senior AI research scientist at Goldman in Frankfurt where he worked on information extraction and natural language processing (NLP) in the legal and finance domains. He arrived at Microsoft's Redmond office this month.

Del Corro who has an MSc in computing science from Imperial College London and a PhD focused on Information Extraction and Natural Language Understanding from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Munich and the University of Saarlandes was at Goldman for less than three years.

Microsoft's managing director of research Johannes Gehrke a Cornell graduate and the CTO and head of machine learning for the Intelligent Communications and Conversations Cloud at Microsoft. The Redmond research center works on complex challenges in ""computing healthcare economics and the environment.""

Del Corro's move looks like a warning for banks which are generally expecting technologists to return to the office for at least part of the week. Microsoft by comparison has told employees that working from home is the new normal and that some roles can be WFH permanently.

HAL,Halliburton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMTEwMDkvamFyaWEtc3RlcHMtaXRzLXJlZ2dhZS1vcGVuLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZ2FtZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JaRIA steps up its Reggae Open University game,"The Jamaica Reggae Industry Association (JaRIA) through its Reggae Open University (ROU) is staying true to its mandate to educate those in the creative ecosystem. ‘School’ was officially in session on Sunday September 26 and although the turnout could have been better education committee chair Othniel Halliburton is expressing his satisfaction.

‘Earning Online in a Pandemic’ was the topic of discussion and among the panellists were Marcus Goffe deputy executive director and legal counsel Jamaica Intellectual Property Office; Norman Williams chief executive officer One Drop Media; Tara Johnson managing director Harry J Studio; Christabelle Brown operations liaison WiPay Jamaica; and Chris Campbell guitarist and lecturer.

“It was the first quarterly staging since the new board has been in place and it was well received by those who attended. We didn’t have as wide a reach as we would have liked and one reason is that we started advertising it in the same week. But to date it is the most successful staging of ROU and we even had Cat Coore doing a drop for one of the panellists. Among the pluses was the fact that the production team was on time. We did soundcheck at 3:30 p.m. and were able to start by 4 and the testimonials were inspiring” Halliburton shared.

He added “The guests who we chose were very fitting. WiPay for example is the Jamaican equivalent of Pay Pal. We had the guitar player who owing to COVID has not been touring but he now teaches online and is able to supplement his income.”

Halliburton who is himself a teacher of both music and English language is enthused at the myriad of plans which his committee has in store for industry players. Another ROU session is set for December and this time it will be with a decided difference. It is titled ‘The Relay’ and will see young artistes facing off alongside the pioneers in a session that will sync the past with the present.

“We recognise that the new generation is not knowledgeable about the past and we wanted to find a good way to inform the public and give the older artistes some relevance. So we are going to face off the generations but in a positive way. I teach CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) music and when I show my students the link between the past and the music that they are listening to now they are amazed” he said warming up to his pet topic.

“For example one of Koffee’s songs Ragamuffin is on the classic Real Rock rhythm and when I play the current song and then the original my students just sit there in disbelief. We have to let the youngsters be aware that it is a relay and the musical baton is passed down from one generation to the next. With this kind of conceptualisation they can now fully comprehend how the eras and the genres are linked when they are consuming the music.”

Halliburton is intent on driving home the point that “the older music is relevant and all that we are listening to now is certainly not new”. He cited Mr Vegas’ hit song Tek Weh Yuself as the kind of music that is good for the preservation of the culture owing to its strong mento influence. The Education Committee chair admitted that he too would possibly have succumbed to the notion that there is hardly any link between current music and the past “but someone said to me ‘Listen to this’” and his eyes and ears were opened.

“For ‘The Relay’ we will have a live school audience and will be inviting younger artistes such as Kabaka Pyramid who respects the pioneers” Halliburton who is a graduate of the Edna Manley School of the Visual and Performing Arts and The University of the West Indies shared.

“So it will be similar to what we did with the Bone & Joint Institute: spaces designed around our patients and families with the support of a very specific level of expertise all private rooms and each aspect of it designed for health and wellness” said Jeff Flaks the chief executive of Hartford HealthCare the parent of Hartford Hospital and six others in the state.

Flaks said it is too early to say how many stories the new structure might have where it might be located on the campus — “we have ideas” he said — how much it might cost or a timeline for construction.

A portion of an older Hartford Hospital building is visible through the window of a patient care room in the $80 million expansion of the Bliss Building at Hartford Hospital. The majority of the new wing was completed earlier this year.

“But it will be a tower” Flaks said adding later: “This hospital is 166 years old. We have to be constantly reinventing and rebuilding it and that is what is happening at this moment.”

Flaks looked to the future of the Hartford campus during a tour for The Courant on Thursday of the new wing — a 50000-square-foot expansion of the Bliss Building. The wing is the largest construction project on the campus since the $150 million Bone & Joint Institute orthopedic center opened in 2016.

The new Bliss wing was planned entirely for patient care and will focus sharply on those with most critical or acute needs. The four-story structure includes state-of-the-art high-tech intensive care rooms with new and more conveniently located MRI scanning equipment than can dramatically cut down on test times. It also includes large operating rooms — still under construction — to accommodate the trend toward minimally invasive robotic surgery that often requires massive complex machinery.

“This had to happen before [the new tower] could happen because we needed more critical care we needed more high-end operating rooms and we needed more high-end interventional services” Flaks said. “So this being developed now enables [the new tower] to go into strategic planning.”

The need for the new wing also comes amid a sea change in how hospitals are expected to deliver services in the future. Flagship hospital campuses will focus on patients with more significant health concerns. An increasing volume of services will be rendered at local satellite sites also run by the hospital with the two integrated so medical records can be shared.

In addition to its seven hospitals Hartford HealthCare now has 400 locations in Connecticut. One of its newest under construction is at the corner of Park Road and South Main Street in West Hartford.

“The hospital has to become much more acute and the community center have to become more accessible” Flaks said.

Increasing hospital capacity

Construction on the new wing started in late 2019 just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

“We were counting the days during COVID when this building would come online because this is exactly what is necessary to support this community. Whether it’s a mass casualty or a pandemic a building built with these capabilities will allow us to very readily support this community” Flaks said.

Rooms in the after operation area of the new Bliss wing are separated by walls rather than curtains and are equipped with the technology for conversion to intensive care beds in an emergency.

Beds in recovery are equipped with the technology to easily convert them for intensive care patients right down to being separated by walls rather than curtains.

“The technology built here can be as high as the intensive care units” David Fichandler senior director of clinical operations said. “We can provide the same level of care here if we needed to ramp up in a true emergency scenario.”

The new wing was designed to seamlessly connect with the older 1960s Bliss Building and bring services closer to where they are needed most.

Two new high-tech MRI scanners — with a third still pending state approval — are placed close to the emergency department to ease the logjam of patients.

MRI scanners in the new wing feature bigger tubes and the prospect of faster scan times.

The first floor location will eliminate circuitous trips to the basement of the adjacent Jefferson Building where the MRI scanners are now located and eventually will be decommissioned.

The new MRIs each costing $3 million have wider tubes into which patients are slid and scan faster particularly for patients that are uncomfortable with tight spaces. A scan that now takes 30 minutes could be reduced to as little as 7 minutes Fichandler said.

There are 18 intensive care units on the second and third floors that will increase the hospital’s ICU capacity by nearly 20% to 105.

The new rooms are designed to be bigger — in some cases double the size — of a traditional ICU room. Mechanized arms or “booms” suspended from ceiling joists eliminate the need to have equipment rolling on the floor.

Room for a patient’s family members is part of this oversized intensive care unit in the new wing.

“This room gives enough space if it is possible for families to stay with a critical care patient” Adam C. Steinberg vice president of medical affairs at Hartford HealthCare. said. “In the past you usually don’t have space to do that.”

Flaks said space for family members to rest or spend the night — including couches and even chairs that convert to beds — were partly drawn from suggestions from donors who contributed more than $5 million to the wing.

Family waiting rooms have furniture with built-in charging stations for phones and laptops a first for the hospital.

“It’s a nice-to-have but what we’ve heard from families who are here for a prolonged period of time — days weeks — it’s a really important thing to have. If it’s in the wall you’re tied to that spot. Here at least we can do it comfortably.”

Growing for the future

The quiet of the first three floors of new wing is broken by the construction on the top floor where new operating rooms are being built.

A 1000 square foot operating room is under construction on the top floor of the new Bliss Building wing.

The hospital hopes eventually to have five operating rooms in the new wing — two are still pending state approval — bringing the hospital’s total to 48.

The new surgery spaces are about 1000 square feet double the size of a traditional operating room with rooms off them for running technology and tracking imaging.

“It’s counter-intuitive” Flaks said. “You think about these very tiny incisions and minimally invasive cases but you need these huge machines. In the old days you were making these big incisions but you could do them in small rooms.”

Steinberg said the large space also acknowledges that technology is constantly evolving.

“This also allows us to grow into the future knowing how innovation happens” Steinberg said.

By Ronni Newton

Graffiti containing a libelous statement about a West Hartford candidate for the Board of Education was scrawled on the asphalt in front of the walkway to the Little League fields on Trout Brook Drive and discovered by parents arriving for games Sunday morning who immediately contacted police.

The message was painted in white where it was easily visible to anyone arriving at the fields or to use the playground adjacent to the parking area.

Jacobs 45 is a first time candidate for the Board of Education representing A Connecticut Party. He was informed about the graffiti by police Sunday morning.

“It has always been in me to see the good in everyone to try to listen and understand the perspective ideas and concerns of all constituents” Jacobs said in a statement to We-Ha.com. “Clearly there are voices in this community that are still not being heard.”

West Hartford Police Capt. Eric Rocheleau confirmed Sunday that the incident is under investigation. No information about any possible suspect or suspects was provided.

“It saddens me to have learned that our beautiful Little League property was defaced and my name was used in that defamation. Our commitment to children their families and the members of this community are the priority. We are better than this but while we endeavor to work together for a brighter future for West Hartford it is important to make sure everyone knows that their voice can be heard in an appropriate forum. However and I need to make this emphatically clear defamation of character or personal attacks on my family is not the way to make that happen” said Jacobs.

Jacobs has lived in West Hartford since 1998 and he and his wife have a blended family that includes a fourth grade son and a first grade daughter.

Lee Gold former Town Council minority leader and one of several individuals who left the Republican Party several months ago to re-form A Connecticut Party said his faith in democracy was tested when he learned of the graffiti Sunday morning. “I was shocked and disgusted by the attack on one of my fellow candidates from A Connecticut Party of West Hartford” said Gold who is running for Town Council. “Libel and slanderous attacks of this nature have no place in our electoral process.”

Mark Merritt former Republican Town Committee chair and also a Town Council candidate from A Connecticut Party also provided a statement.

“Words matter and I’m beyond appalled that the national discourse and divisiveness has decided to make an appearance in West Hartford. The incident of today is an example of how we’ve lost respect for one another” Merritt said. “An individual(s) decided to make a statement without fact and defames an individual and his family. We must do better as a community.”

Employees of West Hartford’s Department of Public Works responded to the scene quickly to remove the graffiti. To “erase hate” Gold said.

Due to the split from the Toei contract some viewers are worried about adaptations in the future however fans are also excited about the possibility of Hasbro creating original content. Aside from the comics and even a Table-top RPG show there have only been a few Power Rangers original Rangers within teams rather than a completely new Ranger series.

Power Rangers has always adapted Super Sentai content and reused the footage to create their own stories with the arsenal and toys. The first Power Rangers original Ranger was seen in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue which was the Titanium Ranger.

This isn’t the first original Ranger in the shows as Jungle Fury also featured three Spirit Rangers based on Zords of the show. With newly created Ranger teams such as the Solar Rangers and the Omega Rangers it’s clear that new Rangers create a boom of excitement. Power Rangers HyperForce also excited fans as it featured new suits Zords and weapons but it was also the first story sequel to a Power Rangers Team.

Even with the announcement about the contract ending fans still want adaptations of every Ranger team in Sentai including Kirameiger and Zenkaiger. Hopefully this may be possible but even if Hasbro does they have the years of experience with other franchises to create something that will go beyond what Super Sentai is currently doing.

Here are the following reasons why Hasbro should create new original Ranger shows alongside adaptations:

Utilize Nostalgia with Sequels

It’s extremely common to see fans wanting the return of legendary actors that appeared as Rangers in past seasons. Power Rangers seasons have only done this once during Power Rangers Dino Thunder with Jason David Frank’s Tommy returning as the show’s mentor. With the franchise there are so many epic stand-alone ranger stories that could be continued and proof that this concept could work was seen with Power Rangers HyperForce.

HyperForce featured a story that is a direct sequel to Power Rangers Time Force with the adventure even using Time Travel better than the show before it. From new Rangers to new Zords the TTRPG series left its mark on the franchise and to this day fans still want a season 2 to finish the story. If this much hype is created from a Table-top series imagine what effect a live-action show or animated series would do.

Hasbro has the talent to make epic new teams

From Transformers to GI Joe the franchises that Hasbro has been working with for many years could be seen as their portfolio of potential. This potential could be focused on Power Rangers that could make the start of a fresh new wave of toys and content.

If Boom! Studios and Peter Sudarso can make epic new ranger teams then Hasbro could go beyond and even make Zords that break the Megazord mold. It could even completely defy the way things currently are by even leading to Super Sentai adapting a Power Rangers series if it’s irresistibly awesome.

Fans don’t want to miss out on Sentai content

Super Sentai has always appeared to be a Japanese-exclusive brand whereas Power Rangers is more of a global franchise. Although it has seen voice-over adaptations in countries like South Korea Toei has only made Kamen Rider more accessible recently and even stopped fan-subs for current Sentai shows.

This means it’s extremely difficult to be a Sentai fan in the west meaning that sometimes the only way to enjoy the new teams is by waiting for Power Rangers to adapt them. Hopefully this will change but fans have always got excited from seeing what Super Sentai is doing and daydreaming what it will turn into for Power Rangers.

Power Rangers could benefit from Multiple Platforms

The TV series is always going to be desired by fans since the platform is live-action and can tell an epic story using episodes. However from an animated series to comic books and even reusing the Table-top RPG format there are many places where Power Rangers could have a new Ranger team debut. Movies may be better suited for content that already exists due to the length of time but other platforms can be a great place to create something new.

More than one piece of Power Rangers content to enjoy

Although fans’ opinions are divided about the run of Power Rangers Ninja Steel not only did the show have an amazing cast but so much content was released alongside it. This includes the start of the Boom! Studios comics and the first TTRPG show HyperRPG’s Power Rangers HyperForce. Before the franchise has never been on so many platforms at once which meant that Power Rangers were in their prime.

These releases were in relation to the 25th anniversary of Power Rangers. With so much epic content to enjoy fans always had something exciting to talk about. Hasbro could continue this by adding more original content while they create adaptations.

There are many paths that Power Rangers can follow but using both adaptions and creating new teams could lead the franchise into a successful future. Fans are always going to want adaptations but there is always room for something expected for viewers to enjoy at the same time.

But it took a minute.

Harris sold her two-bedroom unit at developer Eastbanc’s Westlight complex in the West End for $1.85 million just below the $2 million April listing according to the Wall Street Journal.

She paid $1.78 million for the property in 2017 — the same year she was sworn in as a U.S. senator for California. The condo totals about 1700 square feet and has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The Westlight complex has a private club gym and a rooftop lounge area complete with a 25-foot heated pool.

The West End is home to some of the Capitol’s priciest condo buildings as well as luxury hotels. The Westlight complex itself is walking distance to Georgetown and the U.S. State Department building.

Harris listed the property around the same time she and her husband second gentleman Doug Emhoff moved into Blair House. The 70000-square-foot home across the street from the White House is also known as the President’s Guest House. The couple lived there until renovations were completed at the vice president’s residence Number One Observatory Circle.

Harris also listed a condo in San Francisco after her inauguration. She sold the property for $860000 or nearly double what she paid for it in 2004. She and her husband still own a property in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood.

As a massive chocolate brand Hershey's is much-loved for its selection of decadent treats. According to Mental Floss there was a time when Hershey's Chocolate Kisses were painstakingly wrapped by employees who used foil to pack the chocolates. It took 14 years for machines to take over and make the task a lot easier. Also the company stepped up and helped out U.S. troops by supplying chocolate bars in the 1940s in the midst of World War II.

Hershey's is still a prominent name in the business and has now established a global presence. It is proud of its legacy. The company's FAQ section states that it has set up one of the largest chocolate factories in the world in Hershey Pennsylvania to ensure that it can manufacture all of its products at their facility. The brand adds ""Our history in the town goes back more than 100 years and we are committed to continue making the world's best chocolate products right here in Hershey Pennsylvania.""

The brand has many popular products including (but not restricted to) Hershey's Kisses Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and more.

Sometimes the most unlikely of unions are the sweetest.

A friendship between a cat and a cow is warming the hearts of many as they love to groom each other and play together.

Both one year old Hershey the cow and Rhys the cat met in their Indiana farm.

Their owner Sandy Powell 35 says the pair are inseparable and have been pals since meeting.

She said: ‘They’ve always been close.

‘When I brought home Hershey she was only a baby and she was really shy.

‘Rhys just reached out to her and it was like an instant connection they had right from the start.

‘It was almost like Rhys helped her come out of her shell.’

The farm is home to other cats horses and donkeys but none have the special bond that’s evident in Hershey and Rhys.

Sandy who works as a teacher said: ‘Rhys would always go up to Hershey and start nuzzling her.

‘But at this point Hershey is more outgoing like if she sees Rhys anywhere she’ll go up to her and she’s always seeking her out.’

The pair are often found together around the farm usually napping or nuzzling.

Sandy said: ‘They just go towards each other.

‘Hershey always licks Rhys or they lay down together and have a nap.

‘If Hershey is eating Rhys will just sit and watch her because she’s interested in what she’s doing.’

Rhys a barn cat keeps watch on all he animals in the farm but pays extra attention to Hershey.

Over on Instagram the friendship between the two of them has been documented by Sandy.

Sandy said: ‘People just love it. I didn’t know it was a thing between cows and cats that they could be so close.

Cute right? (Picture: Mercury Press & Media)

‘They brought me so much joy that I started the Instagram to share that with people.

‘And everyone seems to have the same reaction people say that my feed brings so much joy to their day.

‘And members of my extended family and like long lost friends have followed it and they love it.

‘We even have a whole group chat at work for everyone to talk about Hershey and Rhys every day.’

Is there anything as cute?

And while he was preparing to head back to the Harrisburg area to visit his family he’ll soon be on his way back to Jerusalem so that he can get right back to reporting.

“Honestly I’m living the dream right now” Yingst said in a phone interview from Duha Qatar. “I’m in the middle of what I envisioned I would be doing.”

Yingst grew up in Linglestown and is a graduate of Central Dauphin High School. And by the time he was in college Yingst already had experience covering events in war zones.

While still a journalism student at American University Yingst was a credentialed member of the press reporting on fighting in Gaza between Israeli security forces and Palestinians.

Not long after that he was covering riots marches and police actions in Baltimore Maryland and Ferguson Missouri after the deaths of Freddie Gray and Michael Brown - and at one point was arrested in the process. And as a reporter for One America News Network he was a member of the White House Press Corps questioning Trump administration press secretaries.

“My job as a journalist is not to promote what anyone is doing it’s to hold them accountable” Yingst said - and that applies to everyone whether it be American police and politicians or Afghani militants. “I think that even when you’re interviewing these dangerous people our role as journalists does not change.”

Part of his responsibility as a journalist Yingst said is to tell the stories of those dangerous people so that such complicated and deadly conflicts can be better understood. And that often means he and his team are potentially putting themselves in danger. Their work puts them at risk from everything ranging from roadside bombs and sniper fire to sitting across a table with someone with an AK-47 in their lap.

“The security situation is definitely something you have to consider” Yingst said. ”You’re around members of the Taliban - people who previously would have killed me - and we’ve been in the same room earlier this year. They’re now interview subjects. And it was a very weird feeling to be sitting down with these people. Because you have to remember that they’re human and that they have motivation and they have reasons why they do what they do.”

But Yingst said that his empathy and objectivity for his interview subjects cannot conflict with his obligation to ask them challenging questions - even if his attempts to get that information could potentially lead to violence. It is a careful line to walk he said but the questions don’t change whether he’s speaking to a young Taliban militant or interviewing high-profile Taliban members — members who now hold positions in the government following the Taliban’s takeover.

“While we were in Afghanistan I interviewed Anas Haqqani of the infamous Haqqani network” Yingst said. “His brother [Sirajuddin Haqqani current Afghanistan Minister of the Interior under the Taliban] has a $10 million bounty on his head from the United States. When you’re talking to someone who is the head of basically the major suicide bombers for the Taliban for years it can be quite a delicate conversation. This is someone who has killed en masse and been able to go to sleep that night.”

Trey Yingst a native of Harrisburg and foreign correspondent with Fox News  poses with Afghan children while on assignment.

To put it another way Yingst said “If they kill civilians I will cover that and I will ask them why.”

And that also includes for instance covering the American drone strike in the end of August. The strike was initially thought to have targeted ISIS bombers but was later found to have mistakenly killed 10 Afghani civilians seven of whom were children.

And an equally pressing obligation Yingst said is to tell the stories of those civilians - people caught in the crossfire in these conflicts. And those stories are just as vital for his audience to hear even if they are further removed from the major geopolitical picture.

“There are also other stories that aren’t directly linked to the United States” Yingst said. “Previous corruption in the Afghan government and now the rule of the Taliban that will continue to affect the Afghan people - half whom rely on international aid to survive. And I think I really tried to bring that out in our reporting speaking with families with malnourished children people who are really affected by what happens in months and years to come.”

Yingst said that it was important that people remember that “the majority of people in every conflict that we cover are innocent bystanders and they’re stuck in the middle of this conflict. We always try to shine light on those stories because - it’s cliche but I say over and over again - our role in many cases is giving a voice to the voiceless.”

In Afghanistan Yingst said the people are just like the people found anywhere else he’s lived. There are artists athletes musicians and families just trying to survive. Their cultures may differ but their common humanity is the same.

“There are billions of people a third of the world’s population that lives on less than a dollar a day” he said. “And there are many people that have nothing and still will give you everything. And I think that really always surprises me. They don’t have a penny to their name living literally hour to hour to survive. And yet they’re willing to give you their last cup of tea.”

The stress that comes from being relatively high-profile targets in potentially life-threatening situations is very real Yingst said. It requires steps to make his news team isn’t being followed as they drive through certain areas being careful not to leave themselves as targets for sniper fire and sleeping with shoes on to make sure he can run if needed.

“It can be difficult” he said. “I’m not Superman and sometimes the situation that we’re in requires a lot of focus and it requires you to handle stress in a way that is helpful to your safety.”

The job requires a constant state of alertness which takes a toll on mental health Yingst said.

“When you leave the compound with the hotel in Kabul you are a target” Yingst said. “You are absolutely at risk and you have to make constant calculations to make sure that you’re not killed. I’m constantly thinking ‘Okay if a roadside bomb goes off in front of us and we can’t get out where do I go from here?’”

His upcoming return to his hometown to visit family is a much-needed rest but even then it will take effort to release the tension. Yingst said that “it’s something that I actively work on.”

“There are times even in the field where I’ll tell my crew ‘Hey I need a few minutes’” Yingst said. “I just need to do some breathing exercises and take a few minutes to myself to make sure that I’m clear headed. I also make sure to take time after a very stressful story to decompress and kind of integrate back into society.

“I will take some time in central PA and hang out have a bonfire with my parents and my sister and work my way back into a normal life” he said. “There is a real shock to jumping back into society. Suddenly you can eat at a restaurant outside and not have to think about what happens if a suicide bomber approaches.”

But once his visit is over Yingst is eager to return to the job and tell the important stories that are in places of conflict - an opportunity he was proud to have with Fox News.

“My reminder to people - and it’s something that I try to remind myself and remind my team as we approach these stories around the world - is to be empathetic” Yingst said. “You can learn a lot by listening. And you can also I think be a better reporter and a better human by remembering that sometimes we are there on the worst day of someone’s life. And we have a responsibility as journalists to tell their story to the world.”

UPDATE: On Oct. 8 the Registry real-estate news site reported that Tesla has agreed to lease 325000 square feet of a site that formerly housed HP’s headquarters at 1501 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto. This space will not be used as Tesla’s HQ however.

Tesla Inc. the electric vehicle and energy storage company is moving its Palo Alto-based headquarters to Austin Texas the company’s CEO Elon Musk said Thursday afternoon.

The announcement came during an annual shareholder meeting hosted from inside one of Tesla’s Gigafactories also located in Austin.

Musk gave vague explanations for the move but cited high housing costs and long commute for workers as well as growth limitations imposed by being in the Bay Area.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away. … There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area” he said.

But this is not the end for Tesla’s story in California. Musk added that the company will “increase output” from its Fremont and Nevada factories by 50%.

“This is not a matter of Tesla sort of leaving California” he said.

Propping up the benefits of the new location Musk said the new headquarters will be five minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from downtown. And while the company will continue to grow in California Tesla will expand “even more so” in Texas.

Tesla a company that has grown exponentially since it was founded in 2003 and set the standard for electric vehicles first arrived to Palo Alto in 2009 moving from San Carlos into a 350000-square-foot building in Stanford Research Park.

The company’s former chief technical officer and co-founder J.B. Straubel said one large incentive to come to Palo Alto was the city’s proximity to Stanford University. (Straubel is also a Stanford alumnus.)

Palo Alto City Manager Ed Shikada expressed disappointment in the news noting “Tesla has been a member of the Palo Alto community for over a decade.”

But he said in an email to this news organization “This change reflects the innovative cycle and nature of Silicon Valley where we are seeing highly mobile companies in our region evolve. We look forward to continuing to adapt to the economic forces at play.”

Musk recently became an increasingly vocal critic against the golden state and Silicon Valley. In an interview during The Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO Council summit the Tesla CEO revealed that he moved out of California as it had become “complacent” in its leading economic status. He also suggested that Silicon Valley had become increasingly irrelevant.

“I think we’ll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley” he said in the interview.

Tesla is not the first company to make an exit out of Palo Alto during the pandemic.

In August Palantir Technologies quietly moved out of its Palo Alto headquarters at 100 Hamilton Ave. to Denver Colorado. The company’s CEO Alex Karp previously expressed frustrations with Silicon Valley’s “increasing intolerance and monoculture.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise also announced in December that it will move from Palo Alto to Houston. HP Inc.

Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California the electric-car maker’s home since its founding 18 years ago. It joins companies including Oracle Corp. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Charles Schwab Corp. in relocating their corporate hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state in the past two years.

They all are keeping a large presence in California underscoring the importance of the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the shifts of companies born and bred in the state show how many of its intractable issues from the nation’s most expensive housing costs to high taxes and climate catastrophes pose a threat to continued economic growth if corporate departures multiply.

And losing Tesla -- a long-shot clean-energy startup that upended the auto industry and embodies much of the state’s economy -- delivers a particularly symbolic hit.

“Tesla as a brand represents not just Motor City USA it represents Silicon Valley and Hollywood” said David McCuan chairman of Sonoma State University’s political science department. “Tesla is really a California-centric thing. But Elon Musk represents something larger than life and that’s really Texas.”

Musk Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer pointed to some of California’s issues when he announced the move from Palo Alto to Austin. The company’s Fremont factory is jammed with workers and equipment with little space to build around it.

The billionaire clashed with local public officials over lockdown policies during the pandemic. He defied local orders by restarting production at the plant. Musk said that Tesla isn’t leaving California and will continue to expand there – but he made clear that he saw more opportunity for growth in Texas.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away” said Musk who last year said he was moving to Texas himself. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”

That region in particular has long been seen by companies as a difficult place to do business. Employers have had to offer ever more generous compensation so that workers can keep up with sky-high housing costs. Many workers have simply been priced out of living near their work forcing them into long commutes before the pandemic.

California’s Association of Realtors forecast this week that the state’s median single-family home price will jump to a record $834000 next year more than twice the national level. The median sale price of homes in Santa Clara County -- the heart of Silicon Valley – was $1.66 million in August an almost 11% jump from a year earlier according to the industry group.

Newsom – a Democrat who last month beat back a recall effort that was in part driven by anger about the state’s cost of living crime and homelessness -- on Friday emphasized that the state has created more than 750000 jobs since January. He said California’s policies encouraging innovation and investment in electric vehicles contributed to Tesla and Musk’s success.

“Our regulatory environment helped create that company and grow that company” Newsom said at a press briefing. “I have reverence and deep respect for that individual. But I also have deep reverence and respect for this state and what we’ve done.”

Strong Economy

Tesla’s move is more a symbolic blow than an economic one. While the tech industry is a significant part of the state’s economy California reaps the rewards of other lucrative sectors such as trade and entertainment. The state has notched a $75.7 billion surplus and revenue is again running ahead of projections -- by about 18% -- for the fiscal year that began in July. Its credit ratings are at their highest in about two decades.

Silicon Valley also remains a magnet for tech investment. In the third quarter there was a record $27.1 billion worth of venture deals struck in the region a 17% increase from the previous three months according to a recent report on venture capital from CBInsight.

“The tech sector is so big that Texas can grow and we can grow” said Stephen Levy director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. But “the exoduses do have a real concern if they’re based on the high housing prices and lack of housing.”

The state has few answers for how to fix its most pressing problems. Construction remains way below Newsom’s goals for addressing the housing shortage. Taxes are unlikely to go down. Climate change has contributed not only to record-setting wildfires but drought power outages and smoke-filled air.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise whose Silicon Valley roots go back to the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in a Palo Alto garage eight decades ago said last year that cutting real estate costs were a major factor in its decision to relocate to Houston already its largest US employment hub. The company which has maintained much of its tech and innovation workforce in the Bay Area also said the pandemic and the changing nature of work contributed to the move.

In many ways Covid proved to companies that they could effectively operate elsewhere or at least with a smaller footprint. Silicon Valley’s office vacancy rate has continued to climb reaching 15 per cent in the third quarter as more employers looked to offload space they’d previously leased according to real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

The region still remains key for the tech industry with its depth of talent and access to renowned universities said Robert Sammons senior director of research at Cushman in San Francisco.

“Certainly the business climate has room for improvement” Sammons said citing regulations and the high cost of living. “Those are all difficulties that California has and has had for years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvbmV3LXN0dWR5LWNoZWFwZXN0LW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXN0YXRlcy10by1ydW4tYS1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi0yMDIxLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9uZXctc3R1ZHktY2hlYXBlc3QtbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtc3RhdGVzLXRvLXJ1bi1hLWJ1c2luZXNzLWluLTIwMjEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These are the cheapest and most expensive states for running a business in 2021,"Running your own business is always a challenge.

The study weighed factors like average annual wage top corporate income tax rate and average prices for utilities like electricity and internet. The study included the District of Columbia but omitted Alaska and Hawaii due to ""unavailable data.""

Here are the country's five least expensive states for running a business according to the study:

Texas tops the list thanks to its tax policies and utilities costs. The state does tax businesses with annual revenues above $1180000 at a rate of 0.375% but its corporate tax laws are considered to be among the friendliest to businesses in the country.

Perhaps that's why Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk announced last week that his company is moving its headquarters from Palo Alto California to Austin. Tesla will join Oracle Hewlett Packard Enterprise Charles Schwab and plenty of other companies that have moved their headquarters to Texas recently.

This year marks the 50th UAE National Day anniversary. The government aims to make the UAE among the best countries in the world by the Golden Jubilee of the Union. Against this vision it is exploring ways to use data to improve the life of citizens increase efficiency of operations and create more innovative business models. Gathering accessing and analysing data can assist the government with insight to implement strategies monitor the impact of those policies and ensure a safe living and working environment while data can also assist in delivering proactive services to the public.

Aruba a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company is focused on creating intelligent network solutions that deliver the innovation and flexibility to power this next generation of data-driven real-time applications.

Enhancing the citizen experience

Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning and other emerging technologies automate and streamline processes monitor workflows and connect citizens digitally to government agencies for improved citizen experience where data analytics from cloud-based network software can offer actionable insights for increased operational efficiency.

Analytics from data gathered from a variety of sources including citizens themselves can help to enhance daily life. For example sensors can alert citizens to a change in air quality or traffic congestion. Insight from this data can then be used by government to plan infrastructure improvements or prioritise projects for urban change and in turn create employment and ensure a more sustainable environment for the future.

In terms of public security AI cameras and sensors along with data analytics can improve safety for real-time surveillance and emergency response. Security forces can draw on real-time data and predictive analytics to help police and army officers make more informed decisions while on patrol.

In UAE for example the Ministry of Interior had approved the use of smart helmets for specialist police teams fitted with thermal cameras to detect people infected with Covid-19 and sensors that can help the authorities to recognise faces.

Remote sensing data from satellites and ground-based sensors can also provide a wealth of real-time information to actively monitor public utilities to reduce waste and costs and ensure service delivery. Data-driven analytics based on municipal consumption patterns can encourage citizens to manage their own usage of utilities where notifications warn of overconsumption. This can also help the government to balance the supply of utilities with the actual need reducing wastage.

Secure and efficient networking capabilities

These real-time applications have to have the capability to receive analyse and communicate huge amounts of data and achieving this requires powerful computing and intelligent edge network which offers a flexible highly reliable connection to cloud services such as Aruba Central. If the network connecting the sensors or devices goes down local computer storage and resources can keep the devices working until the cloud connection re-establishes. Safety and efficiency are therefore not compromised.

Many governments around the world require the separation of open networks from classified networks but while sharing the same physical access point. With MultiZone a capability of ArubaOSv8 operating system government IT can create separate zones to allow multiple data classifications to share the same network infrastructure but with appropriate levels of control. This control can be managed by Aruba ClearPass which simplifies role-based access controls across wired and wireless networks for a unified approach.

Enabling safe operations from anywhere

There’s an increasing move by the government to develop smart city projects built on a foundation of sensors data analytics and intelligent edge network to enhance operations and conserve resources and connect with citizens and businesses in new ways. For example automated building management systems can be used in public spaces to control lighting and temperature to maximize comfort save energy and lower operational costs.

As government agencies are exploring the internet of things (IoT) to increase efficiency and safety of these smart cities it’s important that the network on which the IoT is built is secure. An intelligent network can handle encryption for these devices ensuring the integrity of communications detect suspicious activity through analytics and respond timeously to limit the spread of a cyberattack.

This enhanced cybersecurity can be applied to the workplace particularly as the coronavirus has accelerated the need for a smartly re-imagined working environment. Employees in both the public sector and private sector are no longer office-bound but can operate anywhere using a number of devices which makes them more vulnerable to threats.

Aruba Central is an economically viable cloud-managed network which can deliver secure network services in new locations whether to support work-from-home or government operations. Aruba SD-WAN solutions allow IT teams to quickly optimize connectivity across a hybrid WAN of Internet MPLS and cellular in far-reaching locations without waiting for service providers. These systems are integrated with Aruba 360 security exchange technology which delivers cloud-based firewall and threat protection.

New business models

As public-private ecosystems around key areas such as health care transportation and education are increasing to drive dynamic and collaborative networks government data-driven applications can be used by other stakeholders. Many businesses depend on government data to guide business investments create new products and encourage innovation.

Aruba’s cloud solutions can help in the creation of an open platform for collaboration between private and public sectors. These solutions provide storage capacity needed for new initiatives with easy access to data while resolving security and compliance issues. Cloud can also help to cut costs significantly by enabling computing power and additional services to be purchased as needed with scaling of resources up or down to support fast reaction to changing demands.

Today more data than ever is generated at the Edge. Legacy networks are unable to cope with the massive amounts of data and decisions required in near real-time. Network architecture needs to utilize Artificial Intelligence in order to be predictive. That’s where Aruba ESP comes in. It is the industry’s first platform with an AI-powered ‘sixth sense’. The solution is designed to unify automate and secure the Intelligent Edge and help organizations harness its immense potential.

“Data-driven applications can provide the UAE government with the ability to make informed decisions to benefit citizens and economies. Through optimising solutions offered by Aruba government agencies can leverage data securely increase efficiency in operations and services and encourage innovation for a better future” concludes Jacob Chacko Regional Director - Middle East Saudi and South Africa at Aruba a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company.

Mortality rates are on the rise in Eastern Europe too.2

Thanks to screening programs and improvements in technology mortality rates have been falling in high-income countries yet rates within these regions still can affect populations drastically differently. For example Black women in the U.S. are two times more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women.3

Reliable screening and prevention methodologies for cervical cancer have existed and been advancing for decades and where they are implemented preventive screening measures increase and death rates decline. The primary issue is a matter of inequitable access to technology and care.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) medical products could help close the gaps in women's healthcare equity. But to do so several significant barriers must be toppled. Using cervical cancer for case reference this article explains some of the key obstacles standing in the way and offers perspective on how they could be overcome.

Obstacle: Remote and low-resource settings

Solution: Trust in AI for medical products

When the earliest AI medical products went into development and launched around the turn of the 21st century many healthcare professionals envisioned a not-so-distant future in which they would be unemployed having been replaced by technology. Some still do.

Likewise many people feared a healthcare world in which a dispassionate ""robot"" would evaluate diagnose and treat them and overlook their individually unique characteristics and needs. These fears remain even though AI products built with good data representative of patient populations usually perform at least equivalent to humans. Studies show many people continue to mistrust AI technology and prefer to have a human professional involved in and ideally leading their diagnosis.456

However some scientists saw the opportunity to leverage AI technology to evolve the role of healthcare professionals and improve the health of populations -- and that's what happened. In real terms the availability of AI to help screen for cervical cancer has effectively promoted practitioners while improving result accuracy and ultimately saving lives. It also saves time since the healthcare provider can focus on pinpointed areas of potential abnormality rather than trying to examine hundreds of thousands of individual cells. As a result review of each case is more efficient which means more women can be screened.

In fact medical technology companies developing AI products generally are focused on providing tools to help clinicians do their jobs and to provide access to such expertise where it does not currently exist. In regions with too few or too far-removed pathology experts AI can help expand access and save people's lives. As long as qualified technicians quality diagnostic imaging equipment and processes are in place pathologists can review results and collaborate remotely with in-the-field medical counterparts.

In general the higher incidence rates of cervical cancer are linked to regions lacking established screening programs because of cost (i.e. the actual cost of the medical technology or the individual's inability to pay for care) and/or infrastructure meaning the region does not have the equipment or trained experts available to make a diagnosis. While this is often the case in developing nations it also is true for high-income countries like the U.S. where rural and low-income urban communities lack access to quality healthcare.

AI medical technology can help bridge these gaps by enabling sample collection and imaging to take place locally and then sent digitally to another region for expert review or confirmation. In areas with especially limited local and remote pathology resources AI could be leveraged as the first line of preventive defense to sort results so pathologists are only reviewing those deemed as potentially cancerous.

For such programs to be effective however practitioners and patients need to accept AI as a solution. To this end educational programs need to be implemented to help people understand the very real benefits of being screened by a highly accurate and proven AI technology versus the potentially deadly consequences of not being screened at all.

Expanding screening and prevention

The introduction of the Pap test has contributed to a decline in cervical cancer rates of more than 60% since the 1950s.7 Since then HPV has been identified as a cause of cervical cancer and HPV testing and vaccinations have been developed.

For reference all women are at risk for cervical cancer which occurs most often in women over age 30.8 At least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their lives but few women will get cervical cancer. The huge disparity among populations in morbidity and mortality is primarily due to poor access to and poor quality of services for prevention and control.

To screen for HPV and cervical cancer clinicians collect cells from a woman's cervix and examine the cells for abnormalities. If abnormalities are identified the woman will undergo further testing such as a colposcopy or biopsy to determine if precancerous or cancerous cells are present. If they are they usually can be removed through a very minor in-office procedure.

For reference in the past a cytotechnologist looked through a microscope at stained cells to identify potential abnormalities for further assessment. Today for diagnostic and screening medical products AI algorithms are programmed to filter through the collected cell sample and flag areas of potential abnormalities for review. Then they evaluate the screening results together with HPV test results and an individual's clinical history to gauge the potential of disease. Further advances in diagnostic systems enable the test samples to be digitized with 3D scanning and analyzed using an AI deep-learning system.

Obstacle: How AI/DL works

Solution: Testing and setting precedence

As is commonly known regulators review medical products for safety and efficacy. As part of the process they need evidence to show the product works as intended and explanation to know how and why it works what might cause it to fail and what happens if it fails. In the case of AI medical products using machine learning (ML) this can be done relatively straightforwardly. For ML scientists built predictive models for diagnostics by teaching a computer to identify specific features e.g. size shape color object etc. of a condition. For the machine's purposes those features are tangible and can be defined numerically. So for example the machine can be taught to analyze an image and look for say a specific scale of darkness.

Now as with the increasing availability of computational power and comprehensive data scientists also are using deep learning (DL). DL uses a different methodology to learn in which it automatically processes and sorts data to create an algorithm. Explaining how exactly the machine does this can be more difficult often thought of as a ""black box."" This lack of insight into the inner workings of AI/DL concerns regulators. As a result regulators are grappling with how to assuredly assess the safety and efficacy of AI medical products.

So far however regulators have helped medical technology companies step over this obstacle by relying on demonstrative clinical studies and research to evaluate design integrity and clinical performance. Along with preliminary approval regulators increasingly are emphasizing the need for medical technology companies to collect and monitor real-world data as further evidence with recent guidances published in the U.S. European Union and Japan among others.

Obstacle: Potential bias of data inputs

Solution: Multiple data sources real-world evidence and data

Collecting and monitoring real-world evidence should also help quell concerns about whether AI products might perform with inherent gender race or ethnic bias. To comply with the various data and patient privacy laws the data used generally in AI does not contain any information that could potentially be used to identify a patient.

As a result manufacturers can take measures such as collecting data from multiple reliable sources but cannot fully address whether the data itself is representative of diverse demographics or if some populations are underrepresented. (This is also why some regulatory bodies require medical technology companies to hold clinical studies with local populations before granting approval.)

So while the validation can be done in different ways the AI/DL algorithm training cannot be. This fact is leading regulators to question if an AI medical product will provide the same results for people of different backgrounds.

It is a good question -- and one that recently and infamously came to bear with the facial recognition technology used by law enforcement and security professionals worked well enough for white males but failed too often to accurately identify women and people of color.

As more AI medical device technologies launch and accumulate real-world evidence of safety and efficacy it stands to reason that regulatory bodies will become more comfortable with the complex technology. This in turn will pave the way for manufacturers to incorporate AI more readily into innovative medical products.

Obstacle: Inequality of quality products

Solution: Proactive business development strategies

So far science cannot invent empathy or engineer advocacy but it has invented and engineered AI and the enormous computational power required to fuel it for diagnostic and therapeutic medical products. As medical technology companies develop innovative medical products they can and ethically should take a leading role in democratizing access to quality medical products for people around the world.

The medical technology companies already doing this use creative and prudent business strategies that enable them to produce high-quality innovative technologies and scale them to meet a spectrum of healthcare needs. In the case of women's health solutions for example the technologies developed for increasing the efficiency and accuracy of cervical cancer screening in the U.S. and Europe can be leveraged to increase basic access to low-resource settings around the world in countries like China and India. The digitization and utilization of AI can bring the highest quality of care to women around the world.

Beyond ""doing the right thing"" this approach offers many practical business advantages. For a company that may usually avoid emerging markets this approach gives it a new potential revenue stream. For a company already launching products in emerging markets it enables it to streamline its product development resources while continuing to expand its market reach. For both it provides more real-world data and evidence including from diverse populations with regard to safety and efficacy of the AI medical products.

Overall medical products should ideally be held to globally accepted standards. From a corporate responsibility and mission perspective this means committing to providing people with access to the best possible standard-of-care solution wherever they live. To do this medical technology companies need to adopt forward-thinking development strategies and healthcare professionals and regulators will need to get comfortable with what currently makes them uncomfortable so medical technology can continue advancing and reaching the people who need it most.

REUTERS/Mike Blake

The Flying Buttress once glided across the oceans carrying vital commodities like grain to all corners of the world. Now it bears different treasures: Paw Patrol Movie Towers and Batmobile Transformers.

The dry bulk cargo ship has been drafted into the service of retail giant Walmart which is chartering its own vessels in an effort to beat the global supply chain disruptions that threaten to torpedo the retail industry’s make-or-break holiday season.

“Chartering vessels is just one example of investments we’ve made to move products as quickly as possible” said Joe Metzger U.S. executive vice president of supply-chain operations at Walmart which has hired a number of vessels this year.

The aim is to bypass log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space at a time when COVID-19 as well as U.S.-China trade quarrels equipment shortages and extreme weather have exposed the fragility of the globe-spanning supply lines used for everything from food and fashion to drinks and diapers.

More than 60 container ships carrying clothing furniture and electronics worth billions of dollars are stuck outside Los Angeles and Long Beach terminals waiting to unload according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California.

One option – avoid the jam by choosing another nearby port in this case San Diego. Home Depot the home improvement retailer dodged the L.A. gridlock by sending its Great Profit charter ship south to the Port of San Diego.

Pre-pandemic it was unusual for more than one ship to be in the waiting lane at the No. 1 U.S. port complex which handles more than half of all American imports.

Other big retail players such as Target Home Depot Costco and Dollar Tree also have said they are chartering ships to deal with the pandemic-driven slowdown of sea networks that handle 90% of the world’s trade.

Or as Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit describes the escalating concern: “Containergeddon.”

U.S. retailers’ traditional lifeline from Asia is freezing up due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia plus a power-supply crunch in China. The supply snarls coincide with booming demand as consumers spend more on goods than meals out or traveling.

And looming is the festive shopping season.

Burt Flickinger managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group said at least 20-25% of the goods stuck on ships were unlikely to make it onto shelves in time for the Nov. 26 Black Friday kickoff for the holiday shopping season a period when retailers make more than a third of their profits.

That has prompted the biggest chains to take matters into their own hands.

In a typical year Walmart would have moved toys from China to Los Angeles in hundreds of 40-foot cargo boxes stacked like colorful bricks on gigantic container vessels.

But 2021 is far from typical. Incoming cargo at the Port of Los Angeles is up 30% from last year’s record levels. Trucks and trains can’t remove it fast enough leading to logjams said the port’s Executive Director Gene Seroka reflecting the surge in consumer demand.

“It’s like taking 10 lanes of freeway traffic and squeezing them into five” Seroka said.

Chartered ships that offer valuable cargo space and can sidestep the container terminals will play a critical role in this second pandemic holiday season particularly for time-sensitive goods like Christmas sweaters that won’t sell if they arrive too late.

The Flying Buttress for example entered Los Angeles waters on Aug. 21. It got stuck in a queue outside the port before it bypassed clogged terminals and unloaded its goods at a separately operated bulk cargo dock on Aug. 31 according to Refinitiv data and shipping records.

During that voyage Walmart circumvented the shortage of 40-foot containers typically used for global shipping by switching to bigger 53-foot containers that are almost exclusively used to move goods by truck and train within the U.S.

Home Depot said it was “creatively working to obtain additional capacity.”

On Sept. 15 onboard cranes hoisted 7-foot Halloween “Spellcasting witches” Christmas lights and other holiday decor onto docks in San Diego said Ocean Audit CEO Ferreira who helps shipping customers claw back overpayments.

“This is the home stretch. They’re doing whatever it takes” to win in an overheated market he said of retailers.

Yet there is a limit to such workarounds.

Great Profit moored at a terminal that handles everything from sugar to windmill blades but can only accommodate a maximum of 500 containers from one to two ships per month between now and the end of the year said Greg Borossay the port’s maritime business development principal.

That’s because San Diego like many other U.S. seaports for one doesn’t have the towering gantry cranes needed to pluck boxes from massive ships.

In addition rail service is equipped for autos and other specialty cargo. And roads in surrounding commercial and residential areas aren’t set up for the fleets of trucks needed to whisk thousands of containers to other parts of the country.

“We’d have a very unhappy community if we had 3000 (boxes) coming off a ship” Borossay added.

The global supply crunch is providing lucrative opportunities for bulk cargo ship operators though; they are cashing in on a record spike in container shipping rates that has sent freight costs above $20000 per box on the biggest liner vessels.

Global container shipping players like AP Moller Maersk and Hapag Lloyd are flush with cash from the soaring rates. Major lines are “putting in every ship we can find” Hapag Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said.

While COVID-19 has had devastating effects on travel and tourism and the air transport industry writ large business aviation is already showing signs of a strong rebound: Honeywell expects business jet deliveries will increase 10 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 in terms of units billed with 3 percent annual average growth in deliveries to follow through 2031. The new forecast calls for 7400 new jet deliveries (with a total value of $238 billion) between 2022 and 2031 an increase of 1 percent compared to Honeywell's 2020 forecast.

Meanwhile used jets are already selling quickly with operator survey respondents reporting more plans to buy used jets a 12-percent increase in that metric corresponding to about 800 more aircraft purchases than the same group expected to make in 2020.

""The increased demand for used jets is estimated at more than 6500 units over the next five years putting pressure on an already record low inventory and driving additional demand for new jets"" said Honeywell Aerospace Americas Aftermarket President Heath Patrick in the October 10 forecast announcement. ""Our latest operator survey results support continued private jet usage growth as more than 65 [percent] of respondents anticipate increased business jet usage in 2022. Despite the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic flight hours have recovered and grown beyond pre-pandemic levels. The overall health of the business jet market is strong and growth is expected to continue.""

A few clouds remain over an otherwise sunny outlook particularly for the near term. Survey responses indicating plans to purchase new business jets in the next five years were down two percentage points from the 2020 survey which Honeywell attributed to uncertainty provoked by the rise of the COVID-19 delta variant which was much in the news when the survey was underway. Honeywell expects that will be largely offset by demand for used jets in the face of record-low inventory that ""will inevitably drive additional demand for new-build business jets.""

Aircraft use another key metric has increased and is on pace to end the year with a nearly 50-percent increase in flight hours compared to 2020 and about 5 percent higher than 2019. About two-thirds of current operators expect to log more hours in 2022 than in 2021.

Elon Musk CEO of Tesla addresses shareholders in an annual meeting held on Oct. 7 2021 in Austin Texas and broadcast over Zoom. Zoom screenshot courtesy Tesla.

UPDATE: On Oct. 8 the Registry real-estate news site reported that Tesla has agreed to lease 325000 square feet of a site that formerly housed HP’s headquarters at 1501 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto. This space will not be used as Tesla’s HQ however.

Tesla Inc. the electric vehicle and energy storage company is moving its Palo Alto-based headquarters to Austin Texas the company’s CEO Elon Musk said Thursday afternoon.

The announcement came during an annual shareholder meeting hosted from inside one of Tesla’s Gigafactories also located in Austin.

Musk gave vague explanations for the move but cited high housing costs and long commute for workers as well as growth limitations imposed by being in the Bay Area.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away. … There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area” he said.

But this is not the end for Tesla’s story in California. Musk added that the company will “increase output” from its Fremont and Nevada factories by 50%.

“This is not a matter of Tesla sort of leaving California” he said.

Propping up the benefits of the new location Musk said the new headquarters will be five minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from downtown. And while the company will continue to grow in California Tesla will expand “even more so” in Texas.

Tesla a company that has grown exponentially since it was founded in 2003 and set the standard for electric vehicles first arrived to Palo Alto in 2009 moving from San Carlos into a 350000-square-foot building in Stanford Research Park.

The company’s former chief technical officer and co-founder J.B. Straubel said one large incentive to come to Palo Alto was the city’s proximity to Stanford University. (Straubel is also a Stanford alumnus.)

Palo Alto City Manager Ed Shikada expressed disappointment in the news noting “Tesla has been a member of the Palo Alto community for over a decade.”

But he said in an email to this news organization “This change reflects the innovative cycle and nature of Silicon Valley where we are seeing highly mobile companies in our region evolve. We look forward to continuing to adapt to the economic forces at play.”

Musk recently became an increasingly vocal critic against the golden state and Silicon Valley. In an interview during The Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO Council summit the Tesla CEO revealed that he moved out of California as it had become “complacent” in its leading economic status. He also suggested that Silicon Valley had become increasingly irrelevant.

“I think we’ll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley” he said in the interview.

Tesla is not the first company to make an exit out of Palo Alto during the pandemic.

In August Palantir Technologies quietly moved out of its Palo Alto headquarters at 100 Hamilton Ave. to Denver Colorado. The company’s CEO Alex Karp previously expressed frustrations with Silicon Valley’s “increasing intolerance and monoculture.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise also announced in December that it will move from Palo Alto to Houston. HP Inc.

This is also the first time that we have seen the AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU lineup listed which means that AMD might be skipping the Ryzen 6000 CPU nomenclature altogether and go two steps ahead with the Ryzen 7000 branding.

As stated above the HP 24 & 27-inch AIO Desktop PCs come in Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake or AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU flavors feature up to 1 TB PCIe SSD and 2 TB HDD a full-HD display a camera & dual speakers. The AIO PC will come in White and Black colors and rock the Windows 11 operating system.

The AMD Ryzen 7000 series listed for the HP 24 and 27 inch AIO Desktop PCs might be Rembrandt CPUs instead of Zen 4 chips because 'Raphael' is almost a year away from launch. If AMD goes with the Ryzen 7000 series for both its next-gen Ryzen CPU and APU lineup that would include the AMD Ryzen 7000G APU 'Rembrandt' and Ryzen 7000 'Vermeer 3DX' chips. It is unlikely to see these All-In-One PCs rocking a desktop chip so a mobility chip like the next-gen Rembrandt APUs is more likely.

The two key technologies that will power Rembrandt will be a new Zen 3+ CPU & RDNA 2 GPU architecture. The Rembrandt APUs are said to be fabricated on the TSMC 6nm process node which is an optimized version of the N7 process. Other prominent features of the Rembrandt Ryzen APUs from AMD will include support for PCIe Gen 4 and LPDDR5/DDR5 memory support. The Rembrandt APUs will feature up to DDR5-5200 memory support 20 PCIe Gen 4 lanes and two USB 4 (40 Gbps) ports. As per the roadmap the Rembrandt APUs will feature support on the FP7 platform.

AMD is expected to announce its Rembrandt APU lineup (Ryzen 7000H Ryzen 7000U) during CES 2022 and will go up against Intel's Alder Lake-P and Alder Lake-M chips which are expected to be unveiled later this year with solutions arriving early next year. We will keep you updated as soon as we hear more on AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPU and APU lineup.

Why not consider working in Poland?

In recent years there have been a rising number of people moving to Poland for work. Quoting preliminary findings from a study by Statistics Poland (GUS) a government agency Notes from Poland said over two million foreigners were living in Poland making up around 5% of the country’s population at the end of 2019.

They add that Poland’s labour ministry data showed that in 2019 there was a further 35% increase in the number of work permits issued to immigrants from outside the EU. It’s worth noting that precise figures for the overall number of immigrants in the country have been hard to come by but these data suggest a somewhat positive sentiment towards Poland for work opportunities.

Meanwhile the London School of Economics notes that in 2020 Poland’s GDP contracted by “only” 3.5% significantly less than the OECD average of 5.5%. This was a stark contrast to the UK where the figure stood at 9.9%. They note that while unemployment rates have soared across Europe the official Polish figures have hardly budged and are the lowest in the EU according to the latest Eurostat figures.

The Polish economy was also performing well before the pandemic struck.

An increasing number of work permits being issued to migrants aside Poland is rich in history steeped with centuries of culture and tradition that makes the country appealing for those without Polish roots to settle in the country for job opportunities.

Coupled with the fact that the cost of living in Poland is cheaper than other countries in the EU in addition to being home to a wealth of natural beauty that makes outdoor adventures ideal for the adventurer at heart many cities have it all.

Here are three cities that make working in Poland a thing you won’t regret:

Wrocław

There are many reasons why Wrocław was awarded the title of one of the best destinations in Europe in 2018. Here architectural wonders rivers and more have dubbed it “the Venice of the North”.

There are numerous entertainment centres bars and clubs where people can let off some steam after a busy day. The city also has a well-developed network of public transport.

The city has a transportation system that connects it with the rest of Poland and neighbouring countries including Germany and the Czech Republic.

The city itself is crawling with opportunities. Many multinationals have set up shop here such as IBM Nokia Credit Suisse Volvo Group DataArt Google McKinsey & Company Dolby and HP Inc.

Poznań

Situated in western Poland on the Warta River Poznań is commonly known as the economically developed region of Wielkopolska voivodeship. It is also a beautiful city that is very rich in history offering its residents both a small-town feel and a vibrant metropolitan city life.

Here weekends can be spent exploring countless museums art galleries and theatres. By night restaurants bars and pubs abound for night-owls. It is also strategically located — Berlin is only a two-and-a-half hour drive away.

Poznań has been described as a business-friendly city. It is home to leading companies such as Roche Amazon Unilever Volkswagen and more.

Kraków

One word to describe the city of Kraków? Majestic. Situated on the famous River Vistula it is one of the oldest cities in Poland overflowing with historic architecture art culture and more. While historic it is also vibrant. Its large market square filled streets and entertainment offerings have made it a crowd favourite.

To get around trams buses and taxis abound. Accessibility makes it convenient for residents to explore beautiful parks and enjoy delectable cuisines.

First introduced in 1976 the Lotus Esprit kept being updated well into the ’90s when restyled for the fourth time the Series 4 was revealed in 1994. Despite its age though the car proved that evolution can be a good thing.

Although it was also available with a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V8 the version tested by MotorWeek in 1995 was the four-cylinder model. The Esprit S4S was powered by a 2.2-liter turbocharged inline-four that made 285 hp (289 PS/212 kW) and 277 lb-ft (375 Nm) of torque which was pretty competitive in 1995 although it could produce as much as 300 hp (304 PS/223 kW) for short bursts.

That was enough to get the four-pot supercar up to 60 mph (96.5 km/h) in just 4.6 seconds and through the quarter-mile in 13.6 seconds at 104 mph (167 km/h) performance figures that still impress today.

MotorWeek reports that the handling was excellent with the only mild criticism being the “agricultural” five-speed manual transmission.

“And it’s fast through the corners too. Stiffer springs and chassis bracing coupled with our test car’s optional extra-wide OZ 17-inch wheels give the S4S remarkable balance and grip” says host John Davis. “Laps around Georgia’s challenging Roebling Road Raceway also illustrated substantial improvements in steering feel and accuracy over that of the also impressive S4.”

Indeed Road &Track reported that the S4S was capable of 0.91 G on the skidpad and ran through the slalom at 61.7 mph (99.2 km/h).

It’s all evidence that if the engineering is sound in the first place then a car can be upgraded and be competitive for quite some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGJ1bGwuY29tL2diLWVuL3RoZXJlZGJ1bGxldGluL3hidXMtZWxla3Ryby1hdXRv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The electric car revolution: XBUS project,

Humana-Paredes and Pavan were leading 3-2 in the opening set on Saturday when Canada needed a medical timeout for the former to receive treatment on her left shoulder.

The right-handed player returned to the court a few minutes later and didn't favour the shoulder for the balance of the match.

Big challenge win

It rained heavily early in the set as the teams exchanged points before a Pavan kill opened a 14-11 advantage for the Canadians who entered the tournament ranked second to the U.S. on the Tour.

Minutes earlier Pavan won a challenge when she contested an ace from Ross was out of bounds that would have tied the match 9-9.

Pavan used her six-foot-five frame to dominate at the net and extend the Canadian lead to 17-13 and 20-14.

After Humana-Paredes served long she ended the set with a tip a diving Ross couldn't reach.

With Canada up 10-8 in the second set Humana-Paredes dove and extended her right arm to keep a rally alive before Pavan scored a point off the block.

Later Ross didn't receive a Pavan serve properly that allowed Canada to take a 14-9 lead.

Uncharacteristic errors

A Pavan kill to the back of the court made it 17-9 before Humana-Paredes delivered one of Canada's six aces on the day to make it 19-10.

Ross and Klineman placed ninth in their lone previous World Tour Final two years ago in Rome where they were eliminated in the first round by Barbora Hermannova and Marketa Slukova of the Czech Republic.

Besides uncharacteristic mistakes in Saturday's contest Ross and Klineman dropped two three-setters on Day 1 of play on Wednesday and went 2-2 in pool play.

They still have an opportunity to win their ninth career FIVB medal in Sunday's bronze-medal match against Makroguzova and Kholomina at 12 p.m. ET. But Saturday's loss ended a streak of three straight tournament victories that included the Olympics in Tokyo Manhattan Beach and Chicago.

MINNEAPOLIS — Insufficient funds. Declined. Those were a couple of the notifications many TCF Bank debit card holders received Friday night and Saturday morning in the wake of the company's merger with Huntington Bank.

""Went to fuel up the truck went in tried to pay debit card declined"" said TCF customer Matthew Koscielski.

Koscielski is one of several customers who say they were notified ahead of time that online banking would be down through the transition period over the weekend but could continue using TCF and Huntington Bank ATM's with no ATM transaction fees.

However customers say they never received any sort of outage warning involving debit cards.

""Especially you know the day of payday nevertheless"" said Koscielski.

Many customers took to social media voicing their concerns. One customer wrote: ""Its shameful people are trying to buy food medications ubers and lyfts with no one to contact.""

""It wasn't until people started complaining that they finally this morning started to answer those complaints"" said Koscielski.

The company responded on Twitter Saturday morning explaining there was a conversion error Friday night where debit cards were temporarily unavailable even though the old TCF debit cards were supposed to be active through Nov. 4th.

""After while yeah it got a little scary and it's like 'What's going on here? You know where's our money?"" said Koscielski. He went on to say ""no gas or you know risk of being stranded that kind of ... irritated me.""

While irritating and frustrating for many it's been a lesson in being financially prepared with a backup plan when all else fails.

""I always keep a little bit extra spare cash because I understand you know technology stuff fails"" said Koscielski.

Koscielski mentioned he was able to use his debit card as credit which worked.

As of Saturday night neither TCF Bank or Huntington Bank commented on when the error will be fixed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbGVhZGVyb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbW11bml0eS8yMDIxLzEwL3F1YWxpdHktcmVudGFscy1vcGVuLWZvci1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi1zdC1jbGFpcnN2aWxsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quality Rentals open for business in St. Clairsville,"St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce members welcome Quality Rentals a rent-to-own business located in the former Thomas Auto dealership at 252 E.

In the area of programming and STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) much work remains to be done to bring about gender equality. Programming and STEM continue to be a ‘man’s world’. Approximately 25% of programmers worldwide are women a recent study indicates. In India we don’t have data specific to programmers but when it comes to STEM only 14% of the STEM workforce is female against a world average of 28.8%.

It is interesting to note the evolution in the space of programming from being a woman’s field to becoming a male-dominated vocation. STEM spearheads research innovation design and problem-solving. The time has come to apply a gender lens to innovation research and policymaking to make societies and economies more gender-equitable. Policies and strategies often assume that what works for men will also work for women.

Usha Srikanth Senior Partner Client Services Leader at IBM talked to Rusen Kumar Editor of India CSR on India’s developing STEM culture. She realises that STEM Education among girls is taken up as an important social agenda in the country. Excerpts:

The demand for scientists and engineers from India continues to grow at an accelerated pace. There is a need not just to increase the overall STEM Workforce in the country but also to significantly increase the diversity representation in the workforce to keep pace with the exponential demand.

Given this context STEM Education among girls is taken up as an important social agenda in the country. We see schools colleges and universities strengthen their curriculum to promote critical thinking and scientific temperament in the students and are working on various models to enroll more girls. The Government is also taking up several steps in this direction. The combined drive between the Government and Educational Institutes is bound to accelerate the focus on STEM Education for girls.

While we have all these external drives it is key that girls get the required awareness encouragement and family support to enroll for STEM Education in the Country. While in the urban areas this is happening we have a long way to go in the semi urban and rural areas.

In India when it comes to STEM only 14% of the STEM workforce is female against a world average of 28.8%. What is the reason behind this disparity?

While India has accelerated adoption of STEM Education by girls the same is yet to translate to the Workforce. The Societal stereotypes for Women still expect women to be the primary care giver @ home & STEM careers carry a perception of being high pressure and intense which discourages many Women from joining / continuing in the STEM Jobs.

Lesser number of Women in STEM workforce automatically means lesser role models which comes in the way of more Women adopting and growing in their STEM Careers.

Family pressures and lack of organizational support makes many women who enter STEM careers to drop midway to take care of their families and after a break they find it hard to get back and pursue.

The breaks contribute to further lowering of the numbers in the STEM Workforce.

To have an accelerated growth of Women pursuing and sustaining STEM careers we would need to drive more awareness within the Women Workforce to build their confidence expand on role models in the society get organizations to provide a level of flexibility and drive change in thinking overall across the society.

With more women dropping out of the workforce due to the pandemic how critical it is for more women at work to complete education and pursuing STEM careers?

The pandemic has increased pressure on Women given the multitasking and balancing required between managing home children and official work. The long hours and challenges associated had several women dropping out of the workforce in 2020. However with this becoming the new normal women have adapted themselves very well and many are finding a natural balance leveraging Work from Home as a flexibile option. This is a huge advantage and should encourage more women to drive to STEM careers. Additionally the demand for STEM Workforce is steadily on the rise and it is right in terms of timing for more women to complete their STEM education and drive towards STEM careers.

Would like to share what is IBM doing in this area to support STEM education in India especially among girls?

Driving STEM Education for girls creating more job opportunities and helping women sustain their STEM jobs is a very Strategic Focus for IBM. IBM has been driving “STEM for Girls” in government high schools. Over 147000 girls from 11 states in India are getting benefitted through this program.

Beyond education it is important to guide the girls in choosing the right career options. IBM volunteers are playing a key role here driving this

IBM believes in partnership to scale this agenda and currently we partner with Navodaya Samiti (NVS) to create a robust STEM ecosystem – essentially strengthening the Vigyan Jyoti programme running in 100 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (NVS). We also have 2 National Implementation Partners Quest Alliance and American India Foundation and 10 sub partners. Getting this ecosystem together we will make a big difference on STEM for Girls Agenda in the country

As a part of IBM I am glad and proud to say that with all of the above we are working towards shaping up the future of our Country.

How can you we create an enabling ecosystem for girls to encourage and support them to explore careers in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)?

Success of STEM for girls is an end to end approach from education to employment. An enabling ecosystem goes a long way in driving the adoption and also accelerating this over some time. This requires bringing together a similar thinking and outcome approach around STEM for girls across educational institutions community setting the STEM candidates and their families (parents/guardians) counsellors and the corporates / institutions who employ them.

6. Gender equality is important from a business perspective and it should be made a business priority by companies. How do you think this can be achieved?

Gender equality is key for us to drive growth and expand on the available opportunities in the country. Few pointers to make this happen.

Driving this “top down” as a cultural shift with key senior leaders’ demonstrating by action.

Sensitizing the workforce to drive out “unconscious bias”.

Driving more opportunities and also enabling women to take the same across various levels.

Providing the required mentoring / coaching / guidance to help women succeed in the workplace.

In summary Making this a business priority and driving it requires a complete cultural shift by companies.

He proceeded to Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania to obtain his MBA in Marketing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL3lhc2hpc2gtZGFoaXlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Things You Didn't Know about Yashish Dahiya,"Yashish Dahiya is the CEO of PolicyBazaar an online general insurance and life insurance aggregator. His first job was at Illinois Tool Works and he hated it so much that he delayed reporting for 45 days saying he was sick. Fortunately the CEO was a visionary and asked Dahiya what work he wanted to do so the 23-year-old asked for the most challenging job. He has since learned so much working in various capacities and the best lesson is that one should never lie to cover up a lapse in judgment. There is a lot to know about the CEO of this insurance company as you will see from these facts.

1. He Has Grit

Maybe one of the reasons that Dahiya has been able to head the company successfully is his grit. The business executive showed this trait during the triathlon race in Sweden. By then he weighed 96 kilograms and had not given much thought to his nutrition which worked against him during the race. During the race he ate some banana gel and drank some coke which proved to be a bad idea and he started cramping in his stomach. Despite the intense pain and 37 kilometers more to go Dahiya decided he would not quit; if he could not run he would walk and complete the race.

2. He is a Sportsman

Dahiya may look like a stern CEO who spends hours in his corner office but he does take a break from work to enjoy cycling swimming or running. He has been an avid sportsperson for so long and holds the fifth-fastest Ironman and third-fastest half Ironman triathlon timings across all Indian age groups. For him to remain a competent athlete he is committed to training aggressively. It takes such a toll on his family life that by 9 pm he starts feeling sleepy and the CEO confessed that he might not turn up at most weddings as he takes time to recuperate.

3. How He Got Into Ironman

According to India Today Dahiya started his first Ironman race after losing a close school friend. He was later introduced to Ironman by Sameer Malik and the CEO wanted to try it. Another person Saurabh Aggarwal told him about Ironman Kamal and Dahiya registered for the 2015 race. He prepared himself by participating in a couple of Delhi International triathlons which he won making him confident enough to start his Ironman racing.

4. He Was the Entrepreneur of the Year 2010

Ernst & Young began the unique global program Entrepreneur of the Year to recognize the most ambitious leaders committed to building and sustaining successful businesses worldwide. Winners usually become lifetime members of a community of like-minded entrepreneurs. On February 19 2019 Dahiya won the award in the Financial Services category and EY said he was recognized for his disruptive thinking that enabled him to revolutionize the insurance industry.

5. His Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

In his interview with YourStory Dahiya advised entrepreneurs to think long-term instead of short-term. He added that they should always have the integrity to never lie to anyone else because they will end up lying to themselves if they do. Additionally the CEO said that when starting a business you should seek to have 50 people believe in your idea and not be too pegged on impressing them. With 50 people already believing in what you are doing you can have the freedom to pick one person who shares the same vision as you to push your business to the next level.

6. He Believes Actively Participating in Sports Builds Character

Dahiya does not allow employees to report to work before 8 am because that is when he usually exercises. He said the high energy levels keep him active throughout the day. He therefore advised the youth not to be engrossed in books alone because sports are critical in character building. The CEO quipped that sportspeople do well outside of their competitive fields because they will already have a never-giving-up attitude even when they pursue other careers.

7. He Was Embarrassed about Attaining the Unicorn Status

Economic Times interviewed Dahiya and when asked about achieving the unicorn status the CEO said he was embarrassed. He explained that he was not arrogant but it is because he knew the company's actual value. According to him if the company went public at that particular time it would have been valued at almost $2 billion. He added that he does not respect most of the companies that have attained the billion-dollar valuation.

8. His Greatest Achievement

Dahiya's most significant achievement is winning the cross country competition while he studied at IIM Ahmedabad. He did not care much about his grades or what kind of job he would get after graduating. Dahiya revealed that such an attitude enabled him to become unbiased even in his workspace. Therefore although he acknowledges work is essential he admits it is not as crucial as swimming or running.

9. His Children's Fees Were Higher Than His Salary

Dahiya chose to raise his family in the UK while staying in India as the CEO of PolicyBazaar. It came at quite a high cost because his salary was not much for the first six years at the insurance company. He disclosed that it was less than what he paid to put his two children through private schools in the UK. He said he only had a founder's salary therefore did not have much savings; he could not even invest in his own company.

10. He Avoided Family Investing in PolicyBazaar

Although Dahiya was strapped for cash he did not want his family to invest in the company because that would put unnecessary pressure on him. Even if they offered he declined and only accepted offers from his mother and father-in-law. He said that his father-in-law is a rational investor who managed an investment fund for the Indian Navy. On the other hand his mother tried convincing him her money was in the company because she believed in her son. However Dahiya knew she staked it because it was an investment that would yield something in return.",,,,,,,,,

August turned into a rapid pace due to Architecture Day 2021 then Hot Chips so we have a few pieces that we never got to. At some point we still need this piece up to reference in the future as Alder Lake arrives so we wanted to get it up before that cycle hits.

Intel Gracemont Low Power x86 Cores

As a “mont” processor we know this comes from the Intel Atom lineage. Let us be perfectly clear today’s Atom processors are not as fast as the big x86 cores from Intel but they are no longer the same very slow cores we saw in the Atom D525 days as they started migrating to low power severs. Today’s Atom cores are perfectly capable of running many workloads that would have required an Intel Xeon E5-2600 Sandy Bridge series processor in years past just at dramatically lower power. With Gracemont Intel needs something that is perhaps more akin to an Arm Neoverse N1 core. That is to say something that can run many workloads at a smaller silicon footprint and at a lower power figure. For the desktop these are the efficient offload cores for Intel in Alder lake.

Key to doing that is building a core that is taking advantage of the areas where Intel can drive efficient compute rather than trying to optimize for maximum performance.

On the front-end we still have the three wide out of order decode but we now have a 64KB L1 instruction cache up from 32KB. Intel also has an on-demand decoding function that can handle up to six uops into the queues.

We also get a bigger branch target cache and prefetchers at all levels. Many modern designs focus on a key problem which is keeping execution units fed and that is why we are seeing a lot of work on branch prediction here but also as the broader industry rolls out new lines.

Intel also has increased the out of order window to 256 entries. It is fun to see how far the Atom line has come since being introduced as an in-order architecture thirteen years ago.

The data execution ports get a big upgrade here to a total of seventeen that are enumerated on the slide below. This is up from twelve on the previous generation.

On the memory subsystem we get up to 4MB of L2 cache shared among four cores. Intel can vary caches based on SKU needs. Intel also has buffers and prefetchers to help efficiently use the caches.

Intel is adding AVX2 here and VNNI. We are going to see some base level of inference support on Intel’s products going forward. Intel’s direction here is basically that AI will be everywhere and therefore its processors should have a minimum amount of capability. Effectively by raising the bar of what the CPU can do it removes many use cases where a dedicated accelerator is necessary. When industry benchmarks are run like MLPerf Inference v1.1 the focus is on peak performance. Intel’s position is that its CPUs often run mixed workloads so it needs to account for inference acceleration as part of its offering but not as the main focus.

Something that is key here is that Intel is optimizing on low voltage and low power rather than maximum performance. That will also likely mean that we will see lower clock speeds than the larger cores but that is also the point of the Atom line.

This is a huge jump in the Atom architecture.

Final Words

Intel threw out some figures such as the concept that four of its E-cores (this Gracemont core) can fit into about the same die area as its performance core (P-core) series like Skylake.

The big benefit is that it says it can deliver performance at lower power than Skylake but not necessarily the same maximum frequencies. In Alder Lake these E-cores will be somewhat like offload cores that background tasks migrate to in order to free up the Intel Golden Cove Performance Cores (P-cores.) In the future we can imagine where Intel may use these cores as alternatives when customers need higher core counts instead of maximum frequency or general-purpose performance per core. Golden Cove is important for Intel’s story positioning against AMD. Gracemont is important for Intel’s position against not just AMD but also Arm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItem9tYmllcy1zZWFzb24tNi1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS1mb3JzYWtlbi1vdXRicmVhay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Zombies - Season 6 Intel Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItem9tYmllcy1zZWFzb24tNi1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS1mb3JzYWtlbi1vdXRicmVhay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9saW5rL2NyZWF0ZS1ib290YWJsZS1pbnN0YWxsZXItaW50ZWwtbTEtbWFjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Create A Bootable Installer For Intel With M1 Mac,"You can make a bootable installer for intel with your M1 Mac

Intel Core i9-12900K Alder Lake Benchmarks Show Fastest Single-Threaded Performance Up To 20% Faster Than AMD Ryzen 9 5950X

While we have already seen several benchmarks of the Intel Core i9-12900K Alder Lake CPU this is the first time we are getting results from a QS chip that should offer better performance & overall stability. The tests were carried out on a B660 motherboard along with DDR4-3600 memory in Gear 1 mode. The benchmarks were leaked over at Bilibili and spotted by HXL.

Intel Core i7-12700K CPU Specifications

The Intel Core i7-12700K CPU will offer 8 Golden Cove cores but cut down the Gracemont cores to 4. This will result in a total of 12 cores (8+4) and 20 threads (16+4). The P-cores (Golden Cove) will operate at a base frequency of 3.6 GHz and a maximum boost frequency of up to 5.0 GHz with 1-2 active cores and 4.7 GHz with all-cores active while the E-cores (Gracemont) will operate at 3.8 GHz across 1-4 cores & up to 3.6 GHz when all cores are loaded. The CPU will feature 25 MB of L3 cache and TDP values are maintained at 125W (PL1) and 250W (PL2).

Before moving over to the performance metrics it is stated that the Intel Core i9-12900K peaked at 250W in the AVX2 mode stress test while running at 108C temperatures. It looks like Intel has once again given away power efficiency and went with a brute-force approach to tackle AMD's Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs. It is also stated that there was some problem with Thermal Velocity Boost on the specific B660 motherboard and the max frequency that was achieved is 5.1 GHz (4.9 GHz P-Core & 3.7 GHz E-Core). The performance was evaluated in Windows 11 but the use of better BIOS & DDR5 DRAM would result in slightly better performance.

Intel Core i9-12900K Alder Lake CPU Power Consumption & Temperatures:

So coming to the benchmarks we first have the CPU-z results where the Intel Core i9-12900K is 20% faster in single-threaded and almost on par with the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X. Remember that AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X has 33% higher threads than the Intel flagship. In Cinebench R20 the Alder Lake chip once again offers a 20% performance boost in a single-threaded and similar performance in the multi-threaded benchmarks.

2 of 9

This is a very good showcase of the performance that Intel's Alder Lake CPUs have to offer especially in the single-threaded department however those high temperatures and power numbers are something to worry about. The Intel Core i9-12900K is expected to hit retail at around $550 US which should make it $250 US cheaper than the MSRP of the Ryzen 9 5950X & the same MSRP of the Ryzen 9 5900X. It could turn out to be a compelling option but will require lots of high-end cooling and power equipment to handle it.

Intel's Alder Lake Desktop CPUs will feature both DDR5 and DDR4 memory controllers and 600-series motherboards will also come with DDR5/DDR4 specific options. High-end motherboards will retain DDR5 while the more mainstream offerings will open up DDR4 support too. The Intel Alder Lake CPU lineup is expected to launch in November along with the respective Z690 platform and DDR5 memory kits.

As the next generation took the reins of the business the Ogden Road building that previously housed the jewelry store along with a bridal shop the family opted to close earlier this year was sold.

The jewelry store continued to operate there after the sale but the closure of the AmRhein’s Bridals meant there was extra unused space plus a move offered an opportunity to reflect the vision of the fourth generation to run AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry said Jackie Amrhein-Sells who owns the business along with her husband Tom Sells III.

The new store located in the nearby Old Country Plaza has a custom design VIP area and a lounge featuring memorabilia documenting the business’ history Amrhein-Sells said.

AmRhein’s deals with a lot of estate jewelry and also custom designs reimagining and modernizing a family member’s piece of jewelry or creating a unique engagement ring. Amrhein-Sells said it’s nice to have a private dedicated space to work with such customers.

“We just looked at who the majority of our customers were and we tried to cater to that type of person” she said.

The showroom is almost 2000 square feet with 12 jewelry cases Amrhein-Sells said and the space offers more room for storage and offices along with a staff area that the previous location did not have.

AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry is just down the road from its previous location which Amrhein-Sells said was strategic. The store was on Ogden Road for around 25 years she said so customers are used to traveling in that direction.

Being located in a shopping center offers opportunities for foot traffic Amrhein-Sells said whereas the previous store was more of a destination since it was in a standalone building.

“We’re excited for everybody to come in and [to] show them around what we have and what changes we’ve made” Amrhein-Sells said.

The jewelry shop began operating at its new location on Sept. 16. AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry will celebrate its 100th anniversary from Nov. 4-13.

AmRhein’s Fine Jewelry is at 4347 Starkey Road in Roanoke County. It’s open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday."

As stocks soar to historical highs some experts say conditions ripe for correction

The stock market has been a roller coaster ride in recent weeks with wild swings from day to day at times.

The major indices have also hit record after record this year as the as the economy roared back from pandemic lows and the government flooded the economy with stimulus cash.

The S &P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices for instance closed at record-highs last month besting highs that were only just set earlier in the year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large company stocks closed at a record-high a month prior. Despite a pandemic-battered economy the S &P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are both up approximately 30% compared to the same period a year ago and the Dow is up more than 20%.

The trends have left some experts wondering whether the ground underlying the rapid growth of the market fueled in part by a new crop of retail investors is solid or if there is a bubble building.

Risks abound from the debt ceiling crisis to inflation fears and even China's Evergrande saga which have led to daily swings.

But even as markets have fallen on news the newfangled hashtags like #BuyTheDip (which encourages market participants to buy rather than sell during these down periods) and #DiamondHands (encouraging investors to hold onto assets rather than sell) often trend on Twitter in tandem with the fear-ridden headlines. Even the Fed has warned of vulnerabilities associated with the ""increased risk appetite"" demonstrated by retail investor exuberance seen in the ""'meme stock' episode.""

While the pandemic's abrupt disruption to American life is another reminder that it's impossible to predict the future historical patterns and the precariousness of present market conditions have some economists warning that current growth rates may be unsustainable especially amid inflation worries and potential tightening by the Fed of monetary policy.

Here's what we know and don't about the market landscape:

Key overvaluation indicator at highest level since the Dotcom bubble

One measure often used by economists to predict a potential asset price bubble is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio developed by economist and Yale University professor Robert Shiller. The measure looks at firms' inflation-adjusted real earnings per share over a 10-year period to indicate possible over- or under-valuations.

Itay Goldstein a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business told ABC News that the measure is essentially used as ""an indication for whether the stock price is too high or not.""

When Shiller first published his research in 2000 he pointed to how high stock prices were at that point relative to the fundamentals that should underly their prices. His book ""Irrational Exuberance"" appeared in March 2000 highlighting how psychological factors can produce speculative bubbles and as it appeared the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite index began a 78% drop and the broader U.S. stock market took a 64% fall.

Presently the CAPE Ratio hovers at around 37 its highest level since the 2000-2002 Dotcom crash -- higher now than the 30 it reached before the Black Tuesday crash in October 1929 that triggered the Great Depression. The historical mean is 16.8.

There have been criticisms of CAPE. Jeremy Siegel a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business has argued in research that changes in accounting standards cause the earnings data to be biased downwards and thus the CAPE to be biased upwards. Others noted that the CAPE uses past earnings but what investors are interested in is future earnings.

""You basically see that it's now still in historically high levels"" Goldstein said of the CAPE Ratio. ""If you go back in history it was higher than that only around 2000 before the big crash of the Dotcom bubble it wasn't even at that high a level in 2008 before the big financial crisis."" In May 2008 before stocks started falling the CAPE was 23.70.

""It's been high for a long time and there was this crash last year when COVID started and then it climbed back up very quickly and continued to climb since then"" he added. ""It's hard to predict what will happen but certainly it could be that the level is too high and there could be some correction.""

Fears of overvaluation are not new especially in the tech sector where the value of certain traditional fundamentals or research and development may be harder to quantify. Many tech companies are not earning profits now but people are investing based on the hope that they will earn in the future. A measure such as CAPE that uses past earnings will not be useful for evaluating these companies.

Tech sector and risk appetite

Many market watchers for example have been ringing alarm bells surrounding the sky-high growth of Tesla stock in recent years -- arguing that its value does not align with its production output and fundamentals. On paper the argument seems valid: Tesla's market cap some $775 billion is larger than the next five largest automakers combined.

Yet some with so-called #DiamondHands who have been able to ignore this have seen themselves become ""Teslanairres"" in recent years as the electric vehicle maker's stock value continues to climb.

Tesla aside overvaluation estimates for the stock market as a whole is ""speculative"" Goldstein said.

""People can tell sort of an economic story that will justify -- my overall feeling is that it's too high and it's hard to justify that based on fundamentals"" Goldstein said referring to the market as a whole.

While he stresses it is ultimately difficult to know for sure whether stock prices are creeping towards a bubble Goldstein said that ""The indicators that we see I think give us some reason to be worried that stock prices might be too high.""

The Federal Reserve also warned off rising asset prices being vulnerable to ""significant declines should risk appetite fall"" in its semi-annual Financial Stability Report released in May noting that ""prices are high compared with expected cash flows.""

Fed Governor Lael Brainard pinned increased appetite for risk and rising valuations in part on retail investors referencing ""the 'meme stock' episode"" in a statement accompanying the report.

""Valuations across a range of asset classes have continued to rise from levels that were already elevated late last year. Equity indices are setting new highs equity prices relative to forecasts of earnings are near the top of their historical distribution and the appetite for risk has increased broadly as the ‘meme stock’ episode demonstrated"" Brainard said.

The increased appetite for risk has also been seen in the bond market Brainard added. ""The combination of stretched valuations with very high levels of corporate indebtedness bear watching because of the potential to amplify the effects of a re-pricing event"" he said.

Unique market conditions and inflation woes

When COVID-19 upended the economy in the spring of 2020 unemployment levels in the U.S. reached highs not seen since the Great Depression as lockdown orders forced businesses to shutter. In the midst of the crisis the stock market fell sharply in March (when it had been at record highs) -- but then rallied back to reach new highs within months.

Much of the pandemic stock markets gains can be pinned in part to aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic some economists say. The Fed pulled out all of the stops slashing the target for overnight interest rates to almost zero buying massive amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities encouraging bank lending and taking other steps to sustain the flow of credit.

""What the Fed has done is it reacted to a public health crisis"" Philip Schnaebl a professor in finance and asset management at New York University’s Stern School of Business told ABC News.

""Now the economy looks much stronger obviously there's still risks with [the] delta [variant] and what's happening in emerging markets and so on"" Schnaebl who is also a research associate in corporate finance at the National Bureau of Economic Research added ""But employment growth has been pretty strong it looks like the public health crisis is not as severe as it used to be.""

If the Fed starts tapering its purchases of securities -- which it signaled after its Sept. 22 meeting that it would likely start doing soon -- and when it looks to start raising interest rates many economists are bracing for what this could mean for the stock market. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month starting in March 2020. Tapering means the Fed would slow its purchase of these assets.

Ending these pandemic-era policies would ""lead to slow deflation of stock prices"" Schnaebl said.

The Fed said it found concerns that a change in monetary policy especially if the economic outlook hasn't improved could lead to a ""correction for risky assets"" according to the investors  academics and more it surveyed as part of its market intelligence gathering for its Financial Stability report.

""Contacts observed that valuations of many assets have derived significant support from low discount rates and therefore may be susceptible to a spike in yields especially if unaccompanied by an improvement in the economic outlook"" the report said.

Overall Schnaebl said he thinks the Fed has its ""eye on the ball"" and will be able to respond to stock market dangers that could spill over into the economy as a whole.

One possible wrench in the Fed's machine however would be if inflation takes hold and the central bank could no longer implement expansionary policy. Data from the consumer price index has stoked inflation fears though the Fed has largely said that it should be temporary due to labor and supply chains issues as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 shock.

Historically the stock market has served Main Street in the long run

Retail investors have pumped billions into the stock market in 2021 with some economists linking this to the rise of investing apps and pandemic stimulus funds that were distributed at the height of stay-at-home orders.

Ultimately Stern's Schnaebl says it is hard to tell until after the fact if stocks are overvalued and a crash looms.

""There can be a lot of volatility in the short run that's why the stock market is risky"" he said.

""I'm less concerned about the stock market just on its own sort of falling"" he added. ""I'm concerned about the health crisis and if that worsens I think it would show up in the stock market.""

A sudden drop in stock prices ""would be bad not necessarily because the stock market crashed but probably because something else happened which made the stock market crash and that's not good news for the economy.""

While price corrections can be scary for investors they can also be viewed as a part of how equity markets work when prices adjust to reflect longer-term values.

Goldstein notes that asset ""prices are just high they are high across the board across multiple assets."" He sees a ""significant likelihood"" that stock prices will fall. The trigger for this could be monetary policy tightening news coming out of China like Evergrande's threat to destabilize the international financial system or some other factor.

""People are looking for where to put to put their money and make a decent return"" Goldstein said of the new excitement in the stock market. ""With all this in place I think you have a combination of factors that contribute to high prices and there could be a trigger that could come from different places that will eventually start the drop.""

Even if economic outlooks in the labor market and beyond are positive outside of stock prices Goldstein notes a sudden drop would impact the real economy as firms ""become more cautious"" by spending and investing less.

Many major Wall Street players are feeling the uncertainty. Over three-quarters of respondents to a CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey say now is the time to be very conservative in the stock market when asked what kind of market risk they are willing to accept for themselves and their clients. Respondents include some 400 chief investment officers equity strategists portfolio managers and contributors to the financial news outlet.

Schnaebl noted that if a drop were to happen ""The question is why does it happen and usually these things don't come out of the blue.""

""I tend to think of the stock market in many ways is a reflection of what's going on in the economy rather than this is independent entity which is driving other things"" he added noting that if the a drop were sparked by the worsening of the virus it would be a blow to the economy as a whole that's reflected in the stock market versus not the other way around.

Still the stock market has historically been a useful vehicle for those with #DiamondHands looking to save over the long term.

""For investors -- especially people saving for retirement and thinking about where to put their money so they can have a safer time in 10 to 30 years from now -- historically the stock market has been a good place"" Schnaebl said.

""My advice to everyday investors would be two things: first of all diversify"" Schnaebl said ""And second of all invest for the long run.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoLXNpZ25hbHMtdGhhdC02MC1jcmFzaC1pcy1jb21pbmctd29sZmVuYmFyZ2VyLTIwMjEtMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Market Crash: Expert Shares 7 Signals That 60% Crash Is Coming,"Jon Wolfenbarger doesn't beat around the bush.

A stock-market crash is coming he told Insider on Friday morning.

""I think the next bear market will be worse than 2008 which will make it the worst since the Great Depression"" the former Allianz Global Investors securities analyst said. ""I'm not necessarily saying that's starting yesterday or tomorrow or right now but I think it could be starting now.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

He added: ""The S&P 500 fell 58% in 2008-2009. I think it could be worse than that. Somewhere over 60%.""

But such mammoth claims require convincing evidence. Wolfenbarger who now runs Bullandbearprofits.com said there are seven indicators that make him so sure.

Perhaps most obvious is the current average valuation in the market — historically high by just about any measure.

The Schiller price-to-earnings ratio is near all-time-highs. Or there's the Warren Buffett indicator which is the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP. It's currently 30% higher than it was during the tech bubble around 1999 and 2000.

Seeking Alpha

Next is investor sentiment which has been mostly bullish since the end of March 2020. Wolfenbarger pointed out that over-bullishness is a contrarian indicator meaning it signals a downturn ahead.

He cited the fact that the put/call ratio is near lows that haven't been observed in nearly 15 years meaning investors have recently been buying bullish call options relative to bearish puts at historically high levels.

Then there's margin debt levels which has seen 70% year-over-year growth. The last two times that happened were before the 2000 and 2008 crash he said.

Third is what he thinks is a weak economic outlook. ""It's remarkable that industrial production and employment have practically flatlined the last 20 years really since the tech bubble"" he said.

Seeking Alpha

Fourth the US's debt-to-GDP ratio is at a record high. Wolfenbarger said high amounts of debt has been the ""hallmark"" of every financial crisis in the past.

And then there's the fact that he thinks the Federal Reserve has little left work with in terms of their policy tools with interest rates near zero and their balance sheet at all-time-highs. Plus inflation could continue to rise which may force the central bank to tighten policy more than expected.

The final two indicators Wolfenbarger listed are ones that tell him that the bear market could already be underway.

First the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange above their 200-day moving average has dropped from about 80% to around 58%. Second the percentage of stocks on the Nasdaq above their 200-day moving average has dropped from 80-90% to 35% he said.

""The market's lost about five to six percent from the recent all-time-highs which obviously isn't a big deal. But if you look at the internals quite a bit of damage has been done"" he said.

Wolfenbarger said it is possible that the market's peak occurs before the end of the year. He also said the Fed tapering asset purchases and reversing bullish investor sentiment would trigger the crash. He warned too that it could be 10-15 years after a crash before the market recaptures its previous highs.

4 signals that bear market could be underway

Wolfenbarger shared four indicators that he believes will tell him a bear market has started.

1.) The price of the S&P 500 falls below its 250-day moving average.

2.) The price stays below it for an extended period of time and the 250-day moving average starts sloping downward.

3.) The 20-day moving average of the S&P 500 moves below the 250-day moving average.

4.) The 60-day moving average average of the S&P 500 moves below the 250-day moving average.

""If you have the price the 20-day and the 60-day all below the 250-day moving average that's pretty much the definition of a bear market"" he said.

Wolfenbarger's views in context

It is difficult to find a mainstream institution on Wall Street with an official view that stocks could suffer a 60% crash in the coming months.

Yet investors and strategists have indeed turned more bearish in recent weeks. Several big-name strategists have issued warnings that a correction is in store for stocks and their view started to play out in early September.

Stocks showed strength again this week though with the S&P 500 rising up to 2% since Monday. Strong corporate earnings and strong 2022 GDP forecasts could also continue to lift stocks after their first 5% pullback since October 2020.

Have stocks peaked? Markets Insider

But nothing is sure. There is an element of uncertainty around how stocks will react to Fed tapering and it remains to be seen how high inflation will go and for how long it will stay at elevated levels and how the Fed will react should inflation not be as ""transitory"" as it expects.

All of the above conditions laid out by Wolfenbarger also show how vulnerable stocks are — by historical standards — to suffering a larger downturn if a strong enough negative catalyst comes along. So he'll be keeping a close eye on those moving averages in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2lhY29tb3RvZ25pbmkvMjAyMS8xMC8wOS90aGUtd29ybGRzLW5ld2VzdC1jYWxsLWNlbnRlci1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Newest Call Center Billionaire,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2021/10/09/the-worlds-newest-call-center-billionaire/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2lhY29tb3RvZ25pbmkvMjAyMS8xMC8wOS90aGUtd29ybGRzLW5ld2VzdC1jYWxsLWNlbnRlci1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc5MTYxNTIvYmF5LWFyZWEtZ3JhbnQtcHJvZ3JhbS10cmFkZS1pY2UtZm9yLWV2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bay Area Grant Program Offers $9500 to Trade Your Gasoline Car for an EV,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37916152/bay-area-grant-program-trade-ice-for-ev/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc5MTYxNTIvYmF5LWFyZWEtZ3JhbnQtcHJvZ3JhbS10cmFkZS1pY2UtZm9yLWV2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1tYW55LWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtY2hvb3Npbmctbm90LXRvLWJlLWxpc3RlZC1oZXJlLXMtd2h5LTEyMTEwMDkwMDQzNl8xLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW1hbnktY29tcGFuaWVzLWFyZS1jaG9vc2luZy1ub3QtdG8tYmUtbGlzdGVkLWhlcmUtcy13aHktMTIxMTAwOTAwNDM2XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock market: Many companies are choosing not to be listed here's why,Stock markets reached all-time highs in 2021 bringing huge value to the companies riding the wave even when you allow for the dip in recent weeks.

.

China on Friday issued the country's first white paper on biodiversity detailing how the world's most biodiverse country has endeavored to protect its ecosystems in pursuit of harmony between humans and nature.

The white paper titled ""Biodiversity Conservation in China"" came days ahead of a key United Nations (UN) biodiversity meeting to be held in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming.

The move bears great significance as the UN begins its Decade of Action after the world sought to reach the Aichi Biodiversity Targets during the 2011-2020 period Zhao Yingmin vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said at a press conference on Friday.

The vice minister said that China's implementation of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets was better than the global average as the country recorded expectation-beating progress in three of the 20 goals and key progress in 13 others.

The issuance of the white paper will increase the international community's understanding of the country's efforts in the sector contributing Chinese wisdom to global biodiversity protection Zhao said.

CHINA'S BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION

To address biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation China has taken creative and up-to-date approaches forming a new pattern of biodiversity conservation according to the white paper.

China was the first globally to propose and implement the red line strategy for ecological conservation an important institutional innovation in its land-use planning and eco-environmental reform.

The country's proposal ""Drawing a 'Red Line' for Ecological Protection to Mitigate and Adapt to Climate Change"" has been selected by the UN as one of the 15 best Nature-based Solutions around the globe.

Liu Dong a senior researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences under the MEE said that such an innovative strategy allows the most important areas to be controlled producing the greatest environmental benefits from the smallest areas and drawing attention in the international community.

China has also optimized its in situ and ex situ conservation making efforts to build a protected area system with national parks as the mainstay and to launch systematic campaigns to save endangered species the document said.

A thriving ecosystem is proof of the country's biodiversity conservation progress. According to the white paper the population of giant pandas in the wild has grown from 1114 to 1864 over the past four decades while the Asian elephant population in the wild has grown from 180 in the 1980s to about 300 at present.

To improve biodiversity governance China has elevated biodiversity conservation to a national strategy rolling out measures to improve the legal and policy frameworks expand oversight on law enforcement and encourage public participation the document said.

AMBITIOUS YET VIABLE GOALS

Despite the progress achieved the pressure on global biodiversity is still aggravating as the trend of biodiversity loss has not been fundamentally reversed Zhao said.

At the upcoming UN biodiversity meeting participants are expected to sit around the discussion table and delineate a ""post-2020 global biodiversity framework."" Experience over the past decade will be reviewed and transformative changes in the global biodiversity drive might take place Zhao said.

The vice minister said that ambitious yet feasible biodiversity goals and strategies should be put on the table.

He said he expects the next decade's global biodiversity goals to boost the world's ambition and confidence but also underscored that participants should fully consider the accessibility and feasibility of new targets when drawing a biodiversity blueprint.

""The raging pandemic has reminded us that humans and nature have a shared future. The international community needs to intensify cooperation in the face of the challenges of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation"" Zhao said.

Over the past years China has firmly practiced multilateralism and actively carried out international cooperation on biodiversity conservation with stronger South-South cooperation in biodiversity conservation and improved multilateral cooperation mechanisms for green development under the Belt and Road Initiative according to the white paper.

Wei Fuwen an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that the biodiversity conservation drive entails a global perspective as many species live not only in China but also in surrounding countries.

""China will continue to actively participate in and promote international cooperation on global biodiversity through various means"" Wei said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9vcGluaW9uLXBhbmRvcmEtcGFwZXJzLXJldmVsYXRpb25zLWNvdWxkLXdlYWtlbi1kZW1vY3JhY3kvYS01OTQ1NjcyNtIBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9vcGluaW9uLXBhbmRvcmEtcGFwZXJzLXJldmVsYXRpb25zLWNvdWxkLXdlYWtlbi1kZW1vY3JhY3kvYS01OTQ1NjcyNg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pandora Papers revelations can weaken democracy,"The papers are the latest leak to expose tax evasion power and avarice — and implicate politicians across the world. The revelations serve to undermine trust in democracy Bastian Obermayer and Frederik Obermaier write.

Pandora Papers reiterate how the rich and superrich benefit from the offshore system Image: ICIJ

When we published the Panama Papers five years ago we knew that this leak would not be the only one. Indeed shortly afterward we were passed the Bahamas Leaks then the Paradise Papers. The FinCen Files followed sent by a brave whistleblower to our colleagues at Buzzfeed.

And now there are the Pandora Papers  possibly the biggest leak yet from the world of tax havens. The papers reveal how hundreds of politicians — including the leaders of 35 countries — have been hiding their money in shell companies trusts and foundations.

This takes us to the core of the problem: politics.

Booming offshore business

The existence of tax havens has been known for years. And the fact that shell companies are used by tax evaders fraudsters and other criminals is equally familiar. Despite this there has so far been little willingness to really change anything.

Investigations have been launched some politicians have stepped down and some were even put behind bars. A few laws were also tightened. At last there are more countries with a register in which it is possible to look up who really owns companies. The G20 nations even agreed on a global minimum tax rate though it is a ridiculously low 15% and applicable only to large corporations.

But no decisive move has been made. And the big business of offshore finance has continued unperturbed.

Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer work for the Süddeutsche Zeitung daily Image: Friedrich Bungert/SZ

We are far from having the practical means that would permit international investigators to rapidly exchange information and further still from any sanctions on tax havens. Indeed how would this be possible when one of the biggest tax havens in the world is the United States of all places. The US states of Delaware Nevada and Wyoming have been under fire for years but nothing has been done. In fact when the tax haven of the Bahamas tightened up its laws under pressure from the United States many offshore clients simply took their business elsewhere — to the US state of South Dakota.

Political irresponsibility

US governments have long been at the very forefront when it comes to calling on other countries to be more transparent and to turn away from dirty money. But at home in their own backyard they do not look as closely. The swindlers of the world are grateful for it.

But if it is hypocrisy you are looking for you don't need to go so far abroad. The European Union is hardly wrapped in a shroud of glory in the fight against tax havens. Just two days after the first publications from the Pandora Papers the EU's finance ministers took Dominica Anguilla and Seychelles off the tax haven black list — at a meeting in Luxembourg the picturesque tax haven in the heart of Europe.

How are we meant to explain to people that politicians have not taken action for years while at the same time we constantly reveal them to be beneficiaries of the offshore system? That the very actors in society who could and should put an end to this dire state of affairs have profited from the system? That they have taken barely any remedial steps since the Panama Papers?

All this is indeed difficult to explain.

Politicians from around the world are mentioned in the Panama Papers

Yet much is at stake. Almost every problem of the present day has something to do with tax havens shell companies and shadowy trusts or foundations. Be the issue climate change corruption financing of terrorism or the ruthless exploitation of entire continents a link to shell companies is always quickly found because such an arrangement is almost always used in an effort to obliterate any incriminating traces.

At the same time the world of tax havens is a world of the rich and the superrich. Doing offshore business means not only fewer taxes but also the liberty to choose which laws to comply with. That starts with taxes but also affects rights of inheritance and laws on liability and debt. And this is an unacceptable problem for society.

Fight for democracy

Permitting a small number of people to choose the laws that apply to them will create a two-class society: the offshore world and the rest of the world. People will no longer identify with a society in which there are different rules for different individuals and in which ""those on high"" can follow their own laws.

This poses a danger to our democracy as it makes it easy for populists to garner votes — they need do nothing more than inveigh against the financial elite. And we as journalists give them more grist to the mill with every leak because we confirm that this elite obeys its own chosen set of rules.

This makes the fight against tax havens a fight for democracy. That is an important fight — and one we cannot afford to lose.

The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) made the announcement official on Thursday with a private reception in Los Angeles. The global superstar joins an international roster of ambassadors whose goal is to use their platforms to advocate for the cause of ending world hunger.

""The U.N. World Food Programme is doing urgent and important work to change and save lives on a daily basis and I feel passionately about addressing world hunger and helping people in need"" The Weeknd said in a press statement. ""Our partnership is an authentic extension of all our efforts and intentions to help those in need and bring an end to so much suffering.""

This isn't the first time the singer is working with the WFP. Just this year he donated $1 million to the group's relief efforts in Ethiopia after months of deadly violence in the country. He was especially moved to do so as the son of two Ethiopian immigrants to Canada.

""Whether he is performing or speaking out about global hunger The Weeknd's voice is powerful and inspiring only matched by his dedication to helping people around the globe"" said WFP's USA President and CEO Barron Segar.

Yes Bank wants shareholders to vote on its proposals to sack Dish TV managing director Jawahar Goel the younger brother of Essel Group founder Subhash Chandra four other directors and induct two Yes Bank executives as nominee directors and five independent directors.

If the matter reaches the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) it will mark the rerun of the Zee Entertainment Enterprises-Invesco spat in which Chandra is locked in a legal battle with Zee’s largest shareholder Invesco.

A Yes Bank executive one of the three people said calling an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) by a shareholder is cumbersome if the company does not cooperate. “So the other option is to go to court and request it to direct the company to hold an EGM"" the person said requesting anonymity.

An email sent to a spokesperson of Yes Bank went unanswered.

“It is an inalienable right of a shareholder who holds at least 10% in the company to demand an EGM"" the second executive said also requesting anonymity. “The fact that the board (of Dish TV) is meeting on the 21st day (from the day of the receipt of the letter) suggests it is almost a given that they will reject our proposal. So we will have no option but to seek the help of NCLT.""

Yes Bank demanded the holding of the special shareholders’ meeting in a 21 September letter which was received by Dish TV on 23 September. Under the rules governing publicly traded companies a company is expected to announce a date for an EGM within three weeks if demanded by a shareholder with at least 10% stake.

“The company has been taking and shall continue to take necessary steps to comply with provisions of applicable laws in the best interest of all its shareholders. The outcome of the board meeting scheduled on 13 October 2021 will be duly intimated"" said a spokesman for Dish TV.

Yes Bank which owns a 25.63% stake in Dish TV is peeved at the Dish TV board’s decision to go ahead with a proposed rights issue despite the bank’s objections besides certain investment decisions including the one in content platform Watcho.

Noida-based Dish TV contends that removal and appointment of directors needs prior approval from the ministry of information and broadcasting.

Goel and his family own 5.93% in Dish TV of which about 40% of the shares are pledged with creditors.

In the shareholder revolts against Essel Group companies Dish TV and Zee Yes Bank is better placed than Invesco.

Yes Bank’s ownership in Dish TV is more than Invesco’s 17.88% in Zee. Additionally Yes Bank claims that its demands for a board reconstitution have support from an additional group of 19% shareholders. This implies that Yes Bank has the support of nearly 45% of shareholders.

Mint cannot independently ascertain if Invesco which is seeking to remove Zee managing director Punit Goenka and induct six board members on the board has support from any of the other 78% shareholders in Zee. Chandra and his family own 3.99% in Zee.

Invesco’s fight at Zee is also more complicated as Zee has signed a non-binding term sheet for a merger with Sony Pictures Networks India. The proposed merger with Sony the completion of which is expected to take a minimum of three months could find favour with some shareholders according to a fourth person who also declined to be identified.

As there is no such proposal at Dish TV this limits Goel’s options.

“The courts are a mere distraction: although they will push back the shareholder meeting to some date in the future investors will do well to remember that it is their vote alone that will decide the future of Zee – not NCLT not NCLAT not high courts and not even the Supreme Court"" proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Ltd wrote in a 7 October note to clients with regards to the ongoing Zee-Invesco courtroom battle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vc29jaWFsbHkvd29ybGQvZXhwbGFpbmVyLXdoeS1pcy1pbnZlc2NvLWVudGFuZ2xlZC1pbi1hLWxlZ2FsLWRpc3B1dGUtd2l0aC1pbmRpYW4tdHYtZ2lhbnQtemVlLWxhdGVzdC10d2VldC1ieS1yZXV0ZXJzLTI5MzQxMjEuaHRtbNIBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vc29jaWFsbHkvd29ybGQvZXhwbGFpbmVyLXdoeS1pcy1pbnZlc2NvLWVudGFuZ2xlZC1pbi1hLWxlZ2FsLWRpc3B1dGUtd2l0aC1pbmRpYW4tdHYtZ2lhbnQtemVlLWxhdGVzdC10d2VldC1ieS1yZXV0ZXJzLTI5MzQxMjEuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explainer: Why is Invesco Entangled in a Legal Dispute with Indian TV Giant Zee ... - Latest Tweet by,"Explainer: Why is Invesco entangled in a legal dispute with Indian TV giant Zee https://t.co/if0MtyCLzx pic.twitter.com/9wKCWrnVpa— Reuters (@Reuters) October 9 2021

Planners expect much of the growth will occur in western Benton County along major highways that exist or will soon exist.

Jeff Hawkins executive director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission noted that the area also is closer to the majority of jobs that are going to be available -- at companies such as Walmart and its suppliers at J.B. Hunt in Benton County and at Tyson Foods in northern Washington County.

The land is flatter west of Interstate 49 and is less expensive to develop he said.

[POLL: What do you think about recent plans for sustaining growth in the area?]

Hawkins said the growth is going to follow the infrastructure availability.

""That's a high-growth area between [I]-49 and say [Northwest Arkansas National Airport] and the area out that way. If they get sanitary sewer and they have adequate water out there and they address the roads infrastructure that's going to be a very high-growth area. That's going to fill in"" he said.

The bulk of the region's population lives and works along the I-49 corridor in or near the four largest cities. Planners expect those cities will begin to see more in-fill and vertical development -- taller buildings -- to achieve more density.

Unlike in most metropolitan areas no single city dominates the region and the four large cities of Northwest Arkansas are expected to remain the population centers planners say.

""In 25 years we'll have potentially four cities with over 100000 population two of those with potentially over 150000 population"" said Tim Conklin assistant director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. ""We're not showing one individual city becoming a big central core city. We'll have a polycentric region.""

People will go to the smaller cities and towns when the large cities run out of affordable land Conklin said. Northwest Arkansas has 27 other municipalities he noted. Fayetteville is the largest city but represents about 18% of the region's overall population Conklin said.

""You look at what I would call our big urban core cities -- Fayetteville Springdale Rogers Bentonville -- and the growth that they have seen but now those types of numbers are occurring in Elm Springs Cave Springs Tontitown Centerton adjacent to the major urban cities"" he said.

The sprawl will mean changes in the traditionally agricultural use of the land and in the culture of more rural living.

Mayors of the smaller towns note they already are growing but acknowledge that a newer larger wave is coming.

Most have tried to prepare.

GOING WEST

State highway officials are considering a new road to connect the Bella Vista Bypass and the Springdale Northern Bypass or U.S. 412 via Northwest Arkansas National Airport. The 2040 Northwest Arkansas Metropolitan Transportation Plan proposes such a north-south connector.

A study is looking at a huge oval-shaped area west of Bentonville and Arkansas 112 and east of Springtown Decatur and Gravette. It goes from the Bella Vista Bypass in the north to U.S. 412 in the south. The airport sits roughly in the middle.

Widening and improving Arkansas 112 building an access road to the airport and completing the U.S. 412 Springdale Northern Bypass are projects planned for the area.

Gravette has three exits along the I-49 Bella Vista Bypass which opened Sept. 30.

""It'll only be a few minutes down the road and that's what we're seeing people are moving in developers are looking in this area"" said Gravette Mayor Kurt Maddox.

Maddox said he took office in 2017 and was told then that the city needed to prepare for westward expansion.

""That's when we started preparing started looking at what we want the city to be like"" he said.

Maddox said the city has redone sidewalks and Main Street completed water and sewer infrastructure projects paved roads and focused on parks and the community center.

Twenty-five miles to the southeast Cave Springs has grown from a small town on a winding country road a decade ago to being recognized by the state as a city of the first class in the shadow of the metro area according to Mayor Randall Noblett.

Cave Springs officials expect growth to continue as Arkansas 112 is widened and made into a major four-lane roadway that will likely skirt the west side of town improving access to the area.

""We approved 18 subdivisions with more than 1850 lots in a city of 1100 people"" Noblett said. ""That's why we were able to grow after 2008 -- infrastructure to a large degree was put in place.""

Census data and estimates for small cities around the Bella Vista and Springdale bypasses show the towns have had large population increases since 2010.

Michelle Rieff mayor of Highfill said the proposed north-south connector would open up the area for growth.

""We know that road is going to come through Highfill. We don't exactly know where"" she said. ""But that is going to change Highfill drastically.""

Rieff said she expects the new roadway to drive development south of the airport and that the city wants to facilitate that growth by putting infrastructure in place.

WATER AND SEWER

Having enough water and wastewater treatment capacity will be an ongoing -- and expensive -- challenge in a region where smaller communities have historically struggled.

Bethel Heights West Fork Decatur Pea Ridge Cave Springs and Centerton have all grappled with the issue. Cave Springs adopted a sales tax and one of the primary reasons was to allow for sanitary sewer Hawkins said.

Perhaps no community is likely to see as much change as Highfill in the coming years. Long a tiny farming community it is now home to Northwest Arkansas National Airport and is largely a blank slate on which to build a city. The proposed north-south connector could provide needed access.

Rieff said Highfill has lots of open land and some of the few large parcels left in the county.

""I see industry developing on the west side of the airport. There's been some interest already"" Rieff said. ""That might be a manufacturing company. It might be some industry that complements the services of the airlines at XNA. I see a lot of housing.

""Our problem though is the money for the infrastructure"" she said.

Without a business or industrial base the city collects little sales tax and has limited property taxes to pay for wastewater facilities Rieff said. Highfill does have its own sewer system but the system is restricted by the state to 400 homes.

""We have one subdivision that we are about to finish that has 400 homes"" Rieff said.

Highfill depends on developers to put in the infrastructure needed for subdivisions she said.

""The big developers like us because we're easy to work with and they know we want to grow"" she said.

Highfill pipes sewage to Centerton and ultimately on to Decatur Rieff said.

One potential solution is a regional approach to wastewater -- something like the Beaver Water District has done with drinking water.

To that end some cities created the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority in 2002. The authority built a regional wastewater treatment plant in Bentonville that came online in 2010 and it's planning an expansion. The authority has nine member cities and three -- Bentonville Tontitown and Elm Springs -- currently send wastewater to the plant for treatment. Cave Springs is working toward doing so as well. The other member cities are Centerton Highfill Lowell Springdale and Rogers.

Joining is expensive. A town could spend more than $500000 to hook up to the facility plus having to build all or part of a line.

Sewer capacity is one of the first factors that developers look at when considering building in a community. They may look elsewhere if there's not enough capacity or if the system needs a major upgrade in order to provide service to a piece of property according to Hawkins.

Hawkins said wastewater systems can require costly and time-consuming fixes and a town's development can stop as the facility is brought back into compliance.

A lot of the region's treated wastewater goes into the White River which flows into Beaver Lake -- the main source of drinking water for Northwest Arkansas. Fayetteville's eastside plant discharges into the White River. Fayetteville also provides wastewater treatment services to Elkins Farmington Greenland and the southern part of Johnson and its growth areas.

Huntsville also discharges treated wastewater into the lake.

Other plants discharge into the Illinois River or its tributaries. The Illinois is considered a scenic river in Oklahoma which has generated lawsuits in the past.

LAND RUSH

The four big cities have annexed land around them for decades. Over the past 20 years or so smaller cities have extended their boundaries as part of an overall land rush.

Cities in Benton and Washington counties have increased their size by 33518 acres since 2006 according to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. Gravette's land area in Benton County grew 280% mostly from one annexation in 2012 commission records show.

Mayors of larger cites nearby were saying 15 years ago that their five-year plans included absorbing Cave Springs Noblett said. The town had to grow to survive he said.

""We are no longer that little city"" Noblett said. ""And Arkansas sees us no longer as a small town.""

Cave Springs had 5495 residents as of the latest census making it the fastest-growing city in Arkansas by percentage since the 2010 census Noblett said. It's the 63rd-largest city in the state moving up 82 spots.

""We've got 21 cities that share at least one common boundary line"" Hawkins said.

Some cities have failed in their attempts to grow by annexation but the efforts are expected to continue.

Cave Springs lost its bid to annex an unincorporated area in July. The proposed annexation of about 2800 acres included land between Cave Springs and Highfill.

Decatur unsuccessfully tried in 2019 to annex land along Arkansas 102 to the east Arkansas 59 to Bethlehem Road to the north and the east side of Arkansas 59 to the south including the newly built Simmons poultry processing plant.

Residents of the Hiwasse community asked Gravette to annex them in 2012 -- and Gravette agreed to do so -- when Bella Vista declared its intention to take them.

One area of Benton County that already has been the center of a dispute bordered Rogers and Cave Springs on the east Bentonville on the north and Highfill on the west.

The Rogers City Council voted in 2017 to hold an annexation election so it could obtain about 3175 acres west of the city. The largest portion included nearly 2838 acres between Rogers and Highfill along with a smaller tract farther north.

Property owners petitioned Bentonville instead. The Bentonville City Council accepted a request from 39 property owners in the area to annex. The move cut a 2-mile-long and quarter-mile-wide strip out of a 4.4-square-mile area that Rogers had hoped to annex.

Rogers sued to stop the Bentonville annexation but lost. Cave Springs also was trying to annex some of the land.

GROWING ANXIETY

Mayors of the smaller cities welcome the growth but want to limit the changes it brings. Regional leaders talk about managing the growth to avoid common urban woes.

""I do hope that our growth is better planned and we don't have some of the problems that you find in other fast-growing areas like Austin [Texas] where traffic is a nightmare and housing has gotten expensive"" said Mike Harvey chief operating officer with the Northwest Arkansas Council.

""For some of these smaller communities you're going to see more people that have lived there less than five years than people that have lived there their entire lives"" Conklin said.

Noblett said he hopes Cave Springs can become a destination area with events such as craft fairs music festivals and amenities like nice restaurants.

""I think a big part of that is embracing the historic downtown"" he said.

Noblett said he'd like for new or replacement buildings downtown to be state of the art inside but look like the early 1900s buildings that surround them.

Maddox noted that Gravette residents have experienced the growth firsthand.

""It's a lot of change for the people living here too. Our job is to manage that understanding that growth is coming but try to maintain that hometown feel as much as you can"" he said.

Rieff said Highfill is a place where people want to live and that she expects housing options to range from smaller lots to multifamily housing to larger estates.

""Some people don't want change but I think the change will be for the better"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's now transition to our quarterly results. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we've now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year's full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we're continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I'll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client's Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven't spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry's framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It's been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry's brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on over the past year. This year's report details how we are we're supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

An executive overviewing a data center full of servers and systems managing their technology solutions.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company's overall success and we'll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave's leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I'm honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let's look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we're pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let's now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we're nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I'll conclude with guidance changes. As you're aware yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we've seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven't had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years.

He is a role model of service leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?

David Foss: Well thank you Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me both personally and professionally. And I'm beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I've cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis.

I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special. With that we'll open up the floor for questions. Alan if you would please open the line.

(AP) — Federal prosecutors announced Friday that they won’t file charges against a white police officer who shot Jacob Blake in Wisconsin last year — a shooting that sparked protests that led to the deaths of two men.

Officer Rusten Sheskey shot Blake who is Black during a domestic disturbance in Kenosha in August 2020. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down and sparked several nights of protests some of which turned violent. An Illinois man shot three people killing two of them during one of the demonstrations.

State prosecutors decided not to file charges against Sheskey earlier this year after video showed that Blake who was wanted on a felony warrant was armed with a knife.

The U.S. Department of Justice launched its own investigation days after the shooting. The agency announced Friday that a team of prosecutors from its Civil Rights Division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee reviewed police reports witness statements dispatch logs and videos of the incident and determined there wasn’t enough evidence to prove Sheskey willfully used excessive force or violated Blake’s federal rights.

“Accordingly the review of this incident has been closed without a federal prosecution” the Justice Department said in a news release.

Blake’s uncle Justin Blake called the decision “unconscionable” and said it “definitely steps on every civil right we can imagine this country owes every African American descendant.”

“If we had a heart to be broken it would be” he said. “But because we’ve been through all we’ve been we’re not.”

The Justice Department’s findings dovetail with Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley’s determination in January that Sheskey could successfully argue that he fired in self-defense.

Sheskey and other officers encountered Blake after they responded to a call from a woman who reported that her boyfriend wasn’t supposed to be at her home. When they arrived at the scene the woman told them that Blake was trying to her kids and her SUV.

Blake fought the officers as they tried to take him into custody. Sheskey and another officer tried to shock him with their stun guns to no avail. Blake tried to get into the SUV with his young children in the backseat prompting Sheskey to grab his shirt. Sheskey told investigators that he was afraid Blake would drive off with the children or use them as hostages.

Graveley said video shows Blake turning toward Sheskey with a knife and made a motion toward the officer with the knife prompting Sheskey to fire.

The shooting came three months after George Floyd died while white Minneapolis police officers restrained him. Black Lives Matter supporters flooded downtown Kenosha for several nights with some demonstrators setting fire to buildings and cars. Gov. Tony Evers was forced to call in the National Guard.

Kyle Rittenhouse of Antioch Illinois answered a local militia’s call to protect Kenosha businesses from looters and vandals during the third night of protests. He ended up shooting Joseph Rosenbaum Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz killing Rosenbaum and Huber and wounding Grosskreutz in the arm. All four men involved were white.

Prosecutors have charged Rittenhouse with multiple counts including homicide. He has argued that he fired in self-defense after the three men attacked him. He’s set to stand trial next month.

Conservatives frustrated with Black Lives Matter protests have rallied around Rittenhouse. They raised $2 million to cover his bail. Black Lives Matter supporters have painted him as a trigger-happy vigilante who made things worse in Kenosha by bringing a gun to the protests.

Tyler Matzek was also placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to May 5 with his own case of elbow inflammation. Snitker did not provide an update on his injury except that he had been shut down from throwing.

Hopefully each of them will recover well and get back to the pen in due time.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9uZXdzL3NwZWFrZXItbWlrZS1qb2huc29uLWRlY2xpbmVzLXJ1dG8tdXMtY29uZ3Jlc3MtYWRkcmVzcy1yZXF1ZXN0LTQ2MjAxNTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Speaker Mike Johnson declines Ruto US Congress address request,"The United States House Speaker Mike Johnson has turned down a request by top Democrats for President William Ruto to address a joint session of Congress.

The request to address the joint session was made by the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs in April which formally requested Speaker Johnson to invite President Ruto to address a joint session of Congress potentially giving the Kenyan leader a new podium to promote his ideals.

But in a statement Johnson's deputy chief of staff Raj Shah said the speakers' decision not to invite Dr Ruto to address lawmakers was due to ""scheduling constraints"".

“Speaker Johnson welcomes President Ruto to the Capitol. We have offered the Kenyan embassy over 90 minutes of engagement including a one-on-one visit with Speaker Johnson (a) bipartisan leadership meeting with Speaker Johnson Leader Jeffries and Committee Chairmen and Ranking Members and a bicameral meeting. Unfortunately due to scheduling restraints we could not accommodate a request for remarks before a Joint Session” he said.

Security headache

According to Shah a joint session consumes a lot of energy on Capitol Hill. The chamber closes for hours a security headache and the House leadership loses a large chunk of the day's floor time.

Last month Committee Chairman Michael McGaul and Ranking Member Gregory W. Meeks wrote to Speaker Johnson asking him to send a formal invitation to Nairobi to coincide with President Ruto's upcoming state visit to Washington in late May.

“This year we are celebrating the historic 60th anniversary of the US-Kenya diplomatic relationship. Such an invitation would underscore the importance of the US-Kenya relationship and send a valuable signal to the people of Africa” the two lawmakers said.

After the Speaker’s decision Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard E. Neal blasted Speaker Johnson’s failure to recognise the importance of this diplomatic relation.

“Africa and its people helped shape our great nation allowing it to become the superpower that it is today. Strengthening ties across the continent including with a key strategic partner Kenya is of great importance to our shared economic aspirations and democratic values” part of the statement read.

He added that the continent deserves the same level of respect given to its partners in other parts of the world.

He noted that the Republican leadership has invited Prime Minister Fumio Kishida President Isaac Herzog Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Yoon Suk Yeol to address joint meetings of Congress during their official visits to the United States and “I see no reason why President William Ruto’s upcoming state visit should be any different. Even in times of great tragedy and global conflict the Congress has historically shown a depth of focus and amid appliance acts there should be time to recognise the importance of President Ruto’s visit.”

Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta

He went on: “I had the privilege of hosting former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta where we spoke about the great opportunities to strengthen relations between our two economies present and since then Kenya has only continued to demonstrate its commitment to reaffirming our 60-year partnership. With the Biden Administration already rising to the rightful occasion by hosting a state dinner the Congress must do the same.”

President Ruto would have been the first Kenyan leader to address a joint meeting of Congress and the first African leader to do so since Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf spoke in the House chamber in 2006.

President Ruto is scheduled to be in Washington US on May 23 2024 on an official State visit where he will be hosted by US President Joe Biden the first such visit to the White House by an African leader since 2008.

His trip to the US later this month will come as Washington pushes allies across the world to stand against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Mounting atrocities in Gaza

The US has also struggled to defend Israel in the face of mounting atrocities in Gaza.

Nairobi has played on the Washington side on both issues even though it also raised concerns about the human rights violations in Gaza.

But on Friday during the UN General Assembly Kenya threw its support to grant the Palestinians additional rights in the global body and backed their drive for full membership which is blocked by the United States.

The resolution which was adopted by a tally of 143 votes to nine with 25 countries abstaining allows Palestinian representatives to the UN to sit with cooperate with and debate with member states.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

They were right.

Johnson’s first year in office has been a roller-coaster ride filled with the ups of having delivered on a checklist of progressive promises — and the downs of managing contentious relationships with Gov. J.B. Pritzker the Illinois General Assembly the business community and police.

There’s even mounting tension with a City Council emboldened by Johnson’s failure to deliver on his signature promise to secure a new revenue source to combat homelessness.

In an interview with the Sun-Times and WBEZ Johnson reflected on his “remarkable journey” to the mayor’s office and the very “different trajectory” he followed to get there.

He said he’s proud of fulfilling so many items on his progressive to-do list and described a year of accomplishments tempered by impatience.

“There are frustrating moments that I do have where you … just wish you could address everything at the same time” Johnson said. “That’s just unfortunately not where we are — just because the damage has been so severe and it has been so widespread” especially in “historically marginalized” communities.

Johnson acknowledged he hasn’t made everybody happy but that comes with the turf.

“If the role of the mayor is to satisfy everyone then we would not have had 56 prior to me” he said.

Migrant crisis missteps

From the beginning Johnson has been dogged by the migrant crisis he inherited. One of his first Council meetings included a cathartic vote on $51 million in surplus funding for the crisis — after a contentious “us-versus-them” debate that reduced one alderperson to tears.

Johnson’s handling of the crisis telegraphed the freshman mayor’s growing pains. He unveiled plans for a winterized camp at a contaminated Southwest Side industrial site only to have Pritzker reject the idea amid environmental concerns.

The local alderperson a progressive ally felt blindsided by the mayor’s plan and was subsequently physically accosted by furious constituents.

The abandoned plan ended up costing Chicago taxpayers nearly $1 million.

But Johnson succeeded in emptying Chicago police station lobbies filled with migrants and returning Chicago Park District field houses to their intended use. He did that by opening brick-and-mortar shelters at a furious pace. At its peak 27 shelters held more than 14600 migrants.

“When I stepped into office … you had contracts that were bloated and it was costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of dollars. ... We’ve transformed all of that. … We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million” Johnson said.

But the biggest shelter in Pilsen was crowded and unsanitary. A 5-year-old boy there died of sepsis and it later was the epicenter of a measles outbreak.

Alderpersons are now pushing back on the mayor’s 60-day eviction policy — which was delayed three times and already has forced more than 650 people from shelters.

Johnson also stumbled by initially reneging on a deal with Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle one of his political patrons to provide $70 million in additional city funding to support migrants through 2024.

His first budget included just $150 million in funding he knew would last only until April 1. He deliberately lowballed the figure to put pressure on the federal government but the tactic failed. At one point he used $95 million in federal stimulus money to slap an end-of-year Band-Aid on the migrant crisis. But that alienated some alderpersons who control spending and were not consulted.

Johnson’s hand-picked chair of the Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee has frequently complained about being shut out of conversations about the migrant crisis including about the mayor’s eviction policy. Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) eventually strong-armed the administration into publishing regular data on evictions.

“There needs to be some work done as it relates to transparency and accountability as well as cooperation and engagement and dialogue with the alders” Vasquez said. “It’s about figuring out how to engage with everybody.”

Alderpersons’ grievances with Johnson were on full display at the last Council meeting where they called for the mayor to be more forthright about migrant funding and equal spending on long disinvested communities.

Even after the griping the Council ultimately passed two of Johnson’s top spending priorities including $70 million from city reserves for migrant spending to honor the deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle.

“I know how to count and both those votes received more than 30 votes from City Council” said Workforce Development Chair Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd). “That sounds like a win to me.”

After closing nearly a dozen shelters amid declining numbers Johnson said he’s “preparing” for a possible influx of migrants in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August. But there are “limitations to what we can do” without more federal help he said.

Progress on progressive wish list

Johnson’s legislative successes have been impressive.

In the first year alone he has phased out the subminimum wage for tipped workers; pushed through the most generous paid leave policy in the country; reinstated the city’s Department of Environment; and laid the groundwork to reopen two shuttered mental health clinics.

The mayor has also begun to ease the pressure on Chicago police officers by expanding a plan to send mental health providers instead of police to nonviolent mental health emergencies.

Johnson kept his promise to put a binding referendum on the ballot that would have authorized the Council to increase the real estate transfer tax to create a dedicated funding source for homelessness prevention. But Chicago voters rejected it a major defeat widely viewed as a referendum on the mayor’s first year in office.

Mayoral allies in the Council’s Progressive Caucus heard the message loud and clear and vowed to work harder to win voters’ trust and simplify a complicated referendum that many voters didn’t understand.

“Ignoring what those critiques are and thinking that we’re just morally right isn’t going to lead to future wins” Vasquez said.

At the time Johnson responded to the defeat with bravado warning anyone who might assume one defeat would make him put the brakes on his progressive agenda to “buckle up.”

More recently the mayor won Council approval for a $1.25 billion bond issue devised by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to fund housing and economic development programs. The same goes for Lightfoot’s plan which Johnson expanded to transform nearly vacant buildings along La Salle Street into more affordable residential units.

Canceling the city’s contract with the gunshot detection technology company known as ShotSpotter also delivered on a progressive promise. Johnson and his base have long viewed ShotSpotter as a surveillance tool that leads to overpolicing in Black and Brown communities.

But Johnson’s decision was somewhat overshadowed by his delivery. He announced it just days before the contract was to expire then scrambled to negotiate an extension through the historically violent summer months and the Democratic National Convention.

ShotSpotter and the broken migrant funding promise with Pritzker and Preckwinkle were the subject of a disastrous Feb. 15 news conference showcasing a communication problem dominating Johnson’s first year in office.

He evaded some questions answered in platitudes and declined to say if he’d walked away from a migrant funding deal with Pritzker and Preckwinkle or nailed down the ShotSpotter extension before announcing a phase-out.

That defining moment in his relationship with the media seems to have led to a course correction. Johnson finally named a permanent communications director in Ronnie Reese who had essentially filled the role since Johnson took office. Johnson also hired a chief strategy officer Joe Calvello who learned the art of being “radically open and honest” while guiding U.S. Sen. John Fetterman D-Pa. through a difficult campaign dominated by health issues.

The changes appear to have made an impact already with Johnson taking media questions more often and answering those questions a bit more directly.

Mixed bag for business

Johnson’s aggressive agenda such as costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage put him at odds with the business community.

But labor leaders said Johnson also had displayed a willingness to compromise on both issues even as business groups kept “moving the goalposts.”

“They were looking not to compromise. They’re just looking to stop the policy. And that’s not realistic” said Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter noting similar policies have been adopted by other major cities.

Johnson also appeared to extend an olive branch with recent rollouts of pro-development policies. And his choice of seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright as commissioner of Planning and Development also was applauded by the business community.

Besides the La Salle Street plan the mayor proposed recommendations to cut bureaucratic red tape on business development and revived the long-stalled O’Hare expansion project by hammering out a cost-cutting deal with the major airlines.

Johnson also held the line on city property taxes — though he allowed Chicago Public Schools to boost property taxes to the limit two years in a row.

“It’s been a little bit up and down. Some positives. Some negatives” Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin said of Johnson’s first year adding there’s “a lot of work to be done to improve communication” and trust between the mayor and the business community.

“He has a tax agenda. We have ideas on how we can grow the economy. And we’re going to have to come together because federal money is drying up. There’s lots of fiscal cliffs and fiscal challenges coming up” Lavin said. “He’s the mayor. We’ve all got to work together. If the mayor is not successful Chicago’s not going to be successful.”

With two of four city employee pension funds hovering perilously close to insolvency Johnson has displayed some financial acumen by continuing a Lightfoot policy of making additional payments. He also appointed a working group to study the $35 billion crisis — which has yet to produce any ideas on solving it.

Goodwill from police is short-lived

Johnson’s choice of Larry Snelling as police superintendent played to rave reviews. A commanding and reassuring presence he’s already won the support of the demoralized rank and file.

The mayor also extended the police contract and sweetened police raises. But the feel-good period was somewhat short-lived.

He infuriated officers by twice asking Council members to reject an arbitrator’s ruling allowing officers accused of the most serious wrongdoing to bypass the Police Board taking their cases to arbitration.

“For a Democratic mayor to be so anti-union it’s pretty breathtaking” said Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara.

As expected a judge sided with the union — but agreed to make the arbitration process more public and that meant the back-to-back Council votes were more than “symbolic” Johnson said.

Johnson did keep a campaign promise to hire 200 new detectives and free officers for street duty by hiring civilians to perform office jobs. And to the consternation of some progressive allies he increased the police budget to nearly $1.99 billion.

Still Snelling told a town hall in Jefferson Park recently that Chicago remains down about 2000 officers citywide and struggles with low recruitment.

Like Lightfoot Johnson has devised a plan to get at the root causes of crime. His hyperlocal version focuses on 10 multiblock areas in four neighborhoods: Englewood Austin Little Village and West Garfield Park.

Those neighborhoods — plagued by school closings and high dropout rates while lacking public amenities like parks and libraries — will receive an array of services including priority in another round of the city’s guaranteed minimum income program.

Johnson has also put a heavy focus on creating more summer jobs and neighborhood recreational opportunities for young people to give them alternatives to a trend of mass downtown gatherings that have turned violent.

Shootings and homicides are down slightly but robberies remain stubbornly high. In neighborhoods citywide Chicagoans continue to feel unsafe waking up to reports of another wave of strong-armed robberies store break-ins and carjackings.

Reducing violent crime remains such a priority alderpersons who believe ShotSpotter is an effective prevention tool have vowed to perhaps symbolically defy the mayor and tie his hands on ending the contract.

Johnson plays Council tie-breaker

Twice in the first year Johnson was forced to cast tie-breaking Council votes: To save his now-ousted Zoning chair and floor leader Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) from censure; and to approve a nonbinding resolution for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The cease-fire resolution strained Johnson’s relationship with many Jewish leaders and the only Jewish alderperson Debra Silverstein (50th). Some Jewish elected officials and civic leaders — including the Anti-Defamation League Midwest state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz and state Rep. Bob Morgan — later declined the mayor’s invitation to a recent meeting meant to ease the tension.

But not supporting the resolution would have diminished his relationships with progressives and Arab Americans. He noted that calling for a cease-fire is in line with his values and several progressive pro-Palestinian Jewish groups did attend the meeting.

“As far as me calling for peace I hardly consider that controversial. ... The entire country and people around the world are calling for that. That’s something that we value as residents of the city of Chicago but it’s also part of our responsibility as global residents that calling for peace and an end to war is a part of our very profound tradition” he said.

The Chicago area’s large Palestinian community demanded for months that Johnson and his Council majority take a stand voicing their feelings at numerous raucous Council meetings.

The division caused by the war has spread to college campuses in Chicago and nationwide foreshadowing the civil disobedience that might occur when Democrats gather here in August to formally nominate President Joe Biden for reelection.

If Johnson is too timid he risks allowing demonstrators to run roughshod over Chicago. If he allows Chicago police to be too heavy-handed he runs the risk of civil rights violations and the inevitable comparison to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Johnson’s first chief of staff Rich Guidice a seasoned City Hall lifer was widely expected to serve through the convention bringing the expertise garnered from guiding Chicago through decades of major events. But Guidice abruptly resigned last month.

The tie-breaking vote that spared Ramirez-Rosa from censure followed his resignation from leadership after apologizing for bullying and threatening colleagues to block a symbolic referendum on whether Chicago should remain a sanctuary city.

Johnson hasn’t named a replacement for Ramirez-Rosa — either as Zoning chair or floor leader. Some Council members are demanding a replacement from the Latino Caucus but Johnson has yet to find someone he trusts who can also win alderpersons’ support.

Meanwhile some of Johnson’s progressive supporters said they believe rushing to force Ramirez-Rosa’s resignation went too far and an apology should have sufficed.

Backing the Bears puzzles progressives

Progressives were also left scratching their heads when Johnson embraced the Bears’ plan for a sprawling domed stadium south of Soldier Field — a project requiring billions of state and federal dollars that haven’t been approved or identified.

When the Bears unveiled their stadium plan Johnson acted more like a cheerleader than a guardian of taxpayers and protector of precious lakefront parkland.

Asked if the plan violated the city ordinance prohibiting new construction along the lakefront Johnson referred to the Bears’ promise of increased green space on the Museum Campus. But he failed to mention those additional 14 acres are possible only if the state and federal governments cover all $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs.

Putting the Bears stadium near the top of his legislative wish list contradicts Johnson’s campaign stance. Now though Johnson calls Soldier Field a “100-year-old building” — even though it was rebuilt in 2003. Paying off what’s owed on that renovation will drain city coffers unless the debt is refinanced in the new stadium funding package.

“If someone else has another solution that addresses this problem then they should put that on the table” Johnson said.

Every mayor loves a giant public works project. They generate jobs contracts and political donations and are a feel-good diversion from Chicago’s intransigent problems. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley had his failed 2016 Olympic bid. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel had Elon Musk’s high-speed tunnel train to O’Hare Airport.

Johnson’s stadium plan similarly appears to be going nowhere. Springfield has far higher priorities.

“The position he’s taking there … seems to run at odds with his key base of support from progressives. I understand the temptation and desire to put forward a signature project — a legacy project if you will … But it just seems like an unforced error in the way he rolled it out” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.

“Unforced errors is sort of a common theme that we are seeing in many respects. … Communication with the public and the press remains lacking” he said.

At the Bears’ announcement Johnson was “speaking in platitudes from scripted remarks” and couldn’t “really engage with the questions being asked” Greising said which undermined “his ability to earn support from people most affected by the decisions he is making.”

Pritzker did not address the Bears stadium controversy or other points of tension with Johnson saying instead: “The first year of any administration is often the most challenging and I commend Mayor Johnson and his team for reaching this milestone.”

Springfield stumbles

A stadium defeat would not be Johnson’s first in Springfield.

Last month the Illinois House voted 92-8 to approve a bill curbing the power of Johnson’s revamped hand-picked school board. A Senate committee did the same last week during Johnson’s first Springfield lobbying trip as mayor. The bill would prevent Chicago Public Schools from making any admissions or funding changes to selective-enrollment programs and from closing any schools until a fully elected school board takes control in early 2027.

There was no mistaking the message to Johnson’s board which wants to prioritize investing in neighborhood schools over choice schools like selective-enrollments. The original bill was amended to extend an existing moratorium on closing all schools and not just selective schools after lobbying by the CTU.

Asked what message he took from the vote to tie his hands on an important education issue Johnson noted it still needs final approval.

“It’s not a law so nothing has happened” he said.

An emotional CTU President Stacy Davis Gates — perhaps reflecting on setbacks like these — told supporters last fall she was “ashamed of myself” for having helped put Johnson — “my brother” she called him — in “an impossible place.”

Asked recently what made her ashamed Davis Gates talked about the resistance Johnson had faced during his first year.

“Transformation is happening right now in Chicago and every corner of the city because of his leadership. And that level of transformation either makes you a hero or it makes you a villain” Davis Gates said. “It’s not lukewarm. It’s either hot or cold and that is a very precarious position to live in.”

Remaking Chicago Public Schools

As a candidate Johnson promised to make progressive changes to CPS and he has.

His revamped board is led by former science teacher Jianan Shi who also led the parent advocacy group Raise Your Hand for Illinois Public Education. Johnson’s board is filled with others with community-organizing experience.

That board has delivered on a promise to shift away from student-based budgeting that progressives argue exacerbates challenges at schools serving low-income communities and toward a need-based funding model.

But he’s already disappointed some parents by sticking with a plan for a phased-in elected school board instead of delivering that pivotal reform in one fell swoop.

Johnson will also have to find a way to deliver for the schools parents and his former colleagues at the teachers union without breaking the bank in the CTU contract he is now negotiating. Teachers started out by demanding a 9% raise or to match inflation whichever is higher.

“I know what it takes — from a teacher’s perspective as well as a parent’s perspective and a student’s perspective — to have a more transformational educational experience” Johnson said. “And that’s what our focus has to be: funding our schools and actually transforming them so that they are fully fully expressed in an equitable way.”

CPS faces a $391 million deficit for the upcoming school year not including raises being negotiated for teachers and a 4% raise already promised to support staff. The CTA and other mass transit agencies are facing their own funding cliffs.

That’s another point of contention between Johnson and Pritzker.

The governor and others are demanding a leadership change at CTA before providing any new money. Others want to merge all four Chicago-area mass transit agencies into a single super-agency to reduce costs improve operations and create a uniform fare system.

Johnson harshly critical of CTA performance during the campaign has stuck with embattled CTA President Dorval Carter Jr. no favorite of Chicago alderpersons.

Room to grow into job

Johnson likes to say he intends to serve for 23 years — long enough to become Chicago’s longest-serving mayor bypassing Richard M. Daley.

But that will require him to grow and mature in the job and survive many upcoming tests. While his first budget made no real political waves the second will demand making cuts raising property taxes or finding new sources of revenue while still chipping away at his commitment to invest in people.

Despite Johnson’s gestures to the business community Greising said many business leaders he talks to “feel like they still don’t know him still don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what they can do for him — and still don’t feel heard by him.

“Every successful mayor has found a way to have the business community with him. And this mayor so far doesn’t seem to work very hard on that.

“We shouldn’t be all that surprised when we elect someone with his background that there’s a very steep learning curve” he said. “But … he really needs to invest his effort into growing in those areas where he is falling short. If he doesn’t do that with urgency then it will be too late.”

Davis Gates acknowledged the growing pains.

“For so long in this city people who have needed [the most] have been told ‘no’” she said. Now after years of “demanding a thing happens fighting for a thing to happen protesting rallying door-knocking” progressives are in charge she said.

“To make things happen those are different muscles ... The muscles that we have to develop now — not just as a movement not just as a mayor but as an entire city — is No. 1 we’ve got to get more inclusive. We’ve got to figure out how to work past our differences” she said.

It will take some time for this “new formation that we have in Chicago” to settle in Johnson said.

“The way these systems have been built particularly government they have been built in a very complex way to favor the few” he said.

“There has been sort of an unfettered access of a handful of powerful people having access to the fifth floor” the mayor said. “Maybe they’re not used to sharing. And that’s going to take some adjustment.”

Mayor's up-and-down first year in office Mayor’s up-and-down first year in office • The migrant crisis has dominated much of Johnson’s first year: The crisis exposed the growing pains of a new mayor and exacerbated historic tensions between Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities. One key setback: Johnson’s determination to locate a migrant camp at a contaminated industrial site in Brighton Park. Gov. J.B. Pritzker canceled that project over those environmental concerns.



• It’s been a mixed bag on progressives’ wish list: Johnson was able to get the Chicago City Council to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and require city employers to give their employees at least 10 paid days off a year. But voters rejected his “Bring Chicago Home” referendum which would have increased the real estate transfer tax and used the money to fund programs to reduce homelessness.



• His relationship with the business community has been rocky: He enacted those costly mandates on paid leave and the subminimum wage but also helped developers with an initiative to cut bureaucratic red tape and his decision to move forward on a plan to convert some LaSalle Street office buildings in the Loop for residential use. And he broke a stalemate with United and American airlines to reduce costs and move forward with a massive multi-billion-dollar expansion and renovation of O’Hare International Airport.



• Unease about Johnson’s inexperience was soothed by some of his early appointments: Rich Guidice a City Hall veteran recently retired from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications returned as Johnson’s chief of staff though he lasted less than a year. Seasoned real estate executive Ciere Boatright became commissioner of the city’s Planning and Development Department. And Johnson’s choice as police superintendent Larry Snelling had been with CPD for years and remains popular with the rank-and-file.



• Johnson spent some of his fragile political capital in casting tie-breaking votes in the Council: One was on a symbolic resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The mayor’s other tie-breaking vote was to save Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa from censure. The alderperson Johnson’s floor leader was accused of bullying some fellow members.



• Every mayor loves a big jobs-creating public works project: Richard M. Daley had his Olympic bid Rahm Emanuel had his high-speed tunnel to O’Hare that Elon Musk was going to build. Johnson’s appears to be the Bears’ bid for a new lakefront domed stadium but jumping on board so soon when the level of public funding is so high — and still in doubt “seems like an unforced error” said David Greising president and CEO of the Better Government Association.



• Johnson’s experience as a teacher plays a role: Johnson a former organizer for the Chicago Teachers Union owes his election in part to the support of that union and entered office with teachers’ support. And while he has remade the CPS board — and the board has shifted schools to a need-based funding formula he also disappointed parents by backing away from shifting to an all-elected school board right away opting instead to phase in elected members.

A split field in the Iowa River Corridor project on Thursday Oct. 7 2021. Reed canary grass which is an invasive species can be seen on the left while native species to Iowa Wetlands flourish on the right after removal of the reed canary grass.

After a long and difficult battle against reed canary grass an invasive plant species living along the Iowa River Corridor for decades the Johnson County Department of Natural Resources says it has successfully controlled its spread.

Reed canary grass reduced the diversity along the Iowa River Corridor by out-competing the native plants around it. This created a monoculture — an environment surrounding the growth of one plant — that lacks the food and habitat needed for wildlife to survive in the area decreasing wildlife populations.

Wildlife Management Biologist Steve Woodruff said the natural resources department has seen an abundance of diversity in plants and animal species after introducing a three-year rotation method.

“Where we’re doing this we are slowing it down quite a bit” Woodruff said.

Every year the department visits different locations and determines where the reed canary grass is taking over again Woodruff said. Once the locations are determined he said tenant farmers who have partnered with the DNR will bale the reed canary grass as hay which will be used to feed cattle or as bedding.

Once the reed canary grass reaches a height of six inches it will be sprayed with chemicals like Roundup to kill the root systems Woodruff said. He added that most of the reed canary grass will be idle after a year allowing the native plant species to grow.

By the third year the reed canary grass will begin overtaking the native plants again and the process of baling and spraying will restart.

University of Iowa Associate Professor Erin Irish a plant biologist said reed canary grass is difficult to eliminate.

“Their underground structures are such storage organs that even if you manage to kill off the top with herbicide there’s enough residual life left in the plant that it comes roaring back” Irish said.

Reed canary grass was introduced in Iowa after major flooding in the 1800s because it helped prevent soil erosion along waterways said Chris Jones research engineer for the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research.

While the grass was able to provide short-term benefits Jones said it quickly outcompeted the native vegetation.

“There’s trade-offs with all environmental stuff” Jones said. “Whether it’s good bad or indifferent is difficult to say depending on what everyone’s environmental objectives are.”

Woodruff said the battle with reed canary grass has been a varying effort to contain its spread over several decades. The back and forth was exacerbated by major flooding in Iowa which allows the plant’s seeds to travel and germinate he said.

Part of this year’s success in managing the invasive plant can be attributed to drought conditions Woodruff said. Because reed canary grass thrives in moist wet environments the dry conditions over the year have stopped the plant’s seeds from spreading and germinating along the corridor.

The fight against reed canary grass has been filled with progress and setbacks but Woodruff said he believes this time around could be different.

“I think because we know more about how to manage it it’ll become a more long-term success” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvb2xpbmdwb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2R1dGNoLXNlaXplLTgwMDAtcXVvdGEtYnVzdGluZy1haXItY29uZGl0aW9uZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dutch seize 8000 quota-busting air conditioners,"NETHERLANDS: Dutch authorities have taken enforcement action against two unnamed companies for importing over 8000 air conditioners and heat pumps without the necessary F-gas quota.

According to the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) the Dutch body responsible for enforcement of the F-gas regulations says the two companies illegally imported about 128 heat pumps and 8230 air conditioners onto the European market in the past two years. All contained HFCs.

The units originated from China and were sold to customers in Europe.

The ILT is said to have drawn up an official report against both companies. The Public Prosecution Service determines the sanction. In addition the ILT has imposed a penalty on both companies. For the heat pumps the penalty amount to be collected can rise to a maximum of €345000 and up to €500000 for the air conditioners.

Under the European F-gas regulation (517/2014) producers and importers of fluorinated greenhouse gases must have a European registration and an allocated quota.

In brief Consumer product companies have set ambitious targets for incorporating recycled plastic into their packages—25% of their total packaging by 2025 in many cases. These brand owners seem newly committed to the goals and their suppliers are mobilizing to get them more of the high-purity resins they need for food-grade packaging. Companies are rolling out recognizable brands in 100% recycled bottles and are redesigning packaging to ease recycling. But with just a few years to go companies have made only modest progress toward their targets and will need to accelerate efforts to succeed.

AMP’s technology is based on machine learning and works on the same principles as phone apps that identify wildflowers or sensors in autonomous vehicles that scan the road. “These approaches are fundamentally using a form of pattern recognition that is based on training in an artificial neural network” says Rob Writz AMP’s director of commercial partnerships.

AMP’s machines deployed in 160 recycling facilities across North America “infer in real time” what items are whizzing by on a conveyor belt Writz says. If they identify an unwanted object—a metal can contaminating a stream of plastic beverage bottles for example—a pneumatic arm descends to suck it off the line.

The machines are discriminating Writz says. They can tell polypropylene cups from polystyrene ones recognizing the differences in luster clarity and the patterns they exhibit when bent and distorted. And they can do the job of identifying objects and pulling them off the line twice as fast humans who can pluck out only about 40 objects from a stream per minute.

Plastics recycling desperately needs such innovation. Despite years of lip service to the need to recycle the US plastics recycling rate is still less than 10% according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Other regions perform better but need improvement. In Europe for example the rate is nearly 33% according to Conversio Market & Strategy.

Improving recycling will require new technologies to solve the problems that make plastics difficult to recycle. It will also demand collaboration and investment across the complex ecosystem of brand owners consumers municipalities waste management firms recyclers and chemical companies.

Lofty goals for brands

Facing mounting pressure over plastic waste industry has promised to improve. The world’s largest consumer product companies—Coca-Cola Unilever PepsiCo and others—have set ambitious targets for replacing virgin resins with recycled ones a typical goal being 25% by 2025. The undertaking is massive. Coca-Cola alone produces 112 billion plastic bottles a year enough to buy the world a Coke as the firm’s famous ad campaign suggested 14 times over.

To help hit these targets chemical companies are promoting chemical recycling—processes such as depolymerization and pyrolysis that break down plastics into feedstock that can be converted into new plastics. But chemical recycling is largely untested with the first large-scale plants only starting to come on line.

For now plastics recycling relies almost exclusively on traditional mechanical recycling—as it has for decades.

This decidedly unglamorous process starts when residents leave recyclables for their local trash haulers. Materials recovery facilities sort the metal glass and plastics with equipment such as optical sorters that use infrared light to separate plastics or the newer artificial intelligence machines from AMP. Material reclaimers shred wash melt and repelletize the plastics for sale to molders. Higher-purity resins destined to go back into food packaging go through more meticulous finishing steps.

To reach their ambitious goals consumer product companies will need to draw from this system more than ever before. Coca-Cola aims for 50% recycled content across all its packaging by 2030. But in 2020 it was 22% and just 11.5% for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) the main polymer used in beverage bottles. Keurig Dr Pepper has reached only 2% recycled plastic against a goal of 25% by 2025.

Many of these firms are introducing recycled packaging for their most famous brands to boost their numbers and signal to the public that they care. In 2019 Unilever introduced its Hellmann’s mayonnaise in containers with “Jar Made from 100% Recycled Plastic” printed conspicuously on the label. Coca-Cola launched 100% recycled bottles in the US this year. PepsiCo is introducing them in Europe.

Whether companies will meet their goals—more than doubling in most cases their use of recycled resin in a few short years—is possibly the most important question facing the plastics industry today. Given decades of glacial progress many observers are not confident that they will.

“There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through” says Conrad MacKerron senior vice president of As You Sow an organization that prods big corporations on environmental performance.

For instance according to an As You Sow study Coca-Cola set a goal of 25% recycled content in the early 1990s only to abandon it in 1994. The company unveiled a new target in 2011 of incorporating 25% recycled or renewable content by 2015 but achieved only 12.4%.

PepsiCo had a goal of 50% recycled content in its containers by 2018 that it quietly abandoned. The company later set a target of 25% recycled content by 2025. Just last month the firm tweaked its goal again raising its target to 50% while pushing the deadline to 2030.

But times may have changed. MacKerron says those previous missed goals were set before plastics became the hot topic they are today. “It was more of a back-burner issue and we were working on it but not a lot of groups were working on it” he says. And MacKerron notes companies are more open to collaboration than they were in the past when sustainability initiatives were largely internal.

Moreover companies realize they must invest significantly to achieve recycling goals. Nestlé for example has allocated $1.6 billion to pay premiums for recycled material over virgin plastics. Nestlé aims to motivate recyclers and waste management companies to expand their operations.

“If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge” says Evan Arnold vice president of business development at Glenroy which makes flexible packaging for clients such as Costco Wholesale. Earlier this year Glenroy launched a line of stand-up pouches which boast 48% recycled resin content for food and personal care products.

“We really have to be the one that stands up and says ‘Yeah we’ll utilize this’ ” Arnold says about recycled resin. “We’ll explain to our customers the benefits of using this and face the challenge of using recycled products head-on.”

One of the biggest challenges for consumer product companies is procuring enough of the high-quality resins they need for containers that contact food and beverages. These plastics are a cut above the recycled plastics used for carpet fiber or detergent bottles in terms of purity and performance.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued guidelines on recycled resins for food packaging and sends letters of no objection to companies that meet them. Recyclers must for example demonstrate that only food-contact containers enter their process. The FDA recommends recyclers subject their operations to surrogate contaminant testing in which plastics are spiked with chemicals like chloroform or toluene to see how well they are removed. Ultimately the aim is to keep residue levels below 200–300 µg/kg.

The FDA has issued more than 250 of the no-objection letters for food-packaging plastics in recent years mostly for products containing PET. That resin is recycled more than other plastics with a US recycling rate of 28% according to the National Association for PET Container Resources. But that number hasn’t moved much for years and lags behind the global figure of 50%. Moreover only about 28% of recycled bottles become food and beverage containers again. The rest are downcycled into products like carpet fiber and strapping used to tie lumber together.

Jon McNaull vice president of resins for DAK Americas an Alpek Polyester business and the largest virgin-PET producer and recycler in the Americas says PET naturally lends itself to recycling because it is resilient and less likely than other polymers to break down while being re-formed into finished goods. And any breakdown can be reversed through solid stating a process in which the polymer is heated to just above its glass-transition temperature so its chains react and build molecular weight.

There has been this history of making big grand promises on recycling and not following through. Conrad MacKerron senior vice president As You Sow

“You can create a consumer product beverage container and you can send it to the consumer and you can bring it back and you can put it through this industry and make it back into a suitable safe consumer container again” McNaull says.

A lot goes into that transformation explains Srinivasan Prabhushankar CEO of recycling for Indorama Ventures the world’s largest PET maker and recycler. Indorama buys bottles that have been collected at curbsides or through local deposit systems. Workers remove errant metals paper non-PET containers and even PET containers that are tinted brown or green. The PET is then chopped into flake and washed.

Such flake at this point might be good enough for strapping or carpet fiber. But to meet the FDA’s food-contact guidelines it needs more treatment. Indorama scans the flake with infrared light that helps machinery identify the remaining contaminants—for instance bits of off-color PET that previously escaped notice.

The flake is then melted. A near vacuum of about 1 mbar of pressure is applied to the molten resin to suck up any remaining volatile compounds. The resin is also filtered to remove microscale particles. Solid stating builds up the molecular chains until the PET has the right viscosity for bottles again. Every Indorama plant has a quality-control lab where resin samples are collected frequently and analyzed in gas chromatographs mass spectrometers and other instruments.

The process is expensive Prabhushankar says. Brand owners are willing to pay more for the recycled PET but recycling still doesn’t make money. “They are only compensating us for the cost that we incur” he says. “There are many recyclers who are unable to continue.” Case in point he notes is the high-end PET recycler CarbonLite which was liquidated recently and sold to competitors.

Two of those competitors were DAK and Indorama both of which are plunging increasingly into PET recycling in a bid to be one-stop shops that offer virgin resin recycled resin and blends to an increasingly environmentally conscious clientele. “Our customers’ requirements change and we are going to modify our capital expenditures and our strategy to service their needs” McNaull says.

DAK has nearly 400000 metric tons (t) per year of recycling capacity some of it from a CarbonLite plant it bought in Reading Pennsylvania. Of that capacity some 120000 t goes into pellets for food and beverage containers. The company aims to make recycled PET 25% of its sales by 2025.

Indorama plans to spend $1.5 billion on recycling to reach a goal of annually recycling about 50 billion bottles—representing about 750000 t of PET—by 2025. To further this goal the company bought a CarbonLite plant in Dallas. That purchase along with other expansion projects should bring the company to half its objective by next year Prabhushankar says.

Recycling polyolefins for food-contact applications is even more challenging than recycling PET largely because those plastics are used in a much wider variety of packaging.

Troy Alabama–based KW Plastics is the world’s largest recycler of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene. The company has 250000 t of annual capacity and is expanding by 65%.

It is also one of only a handful of US polyolefin recyclers to receive a letter of no objection from the FDA. Meeting the agency’s standards is a multistep process according to Scott Saunders KW’s general manager. Workers start by thoroughly inspecting the bales of plastic that arrive from materials recovery facilities. The firm can process yogurt containers for example but must remove the non-food-contact items like kitty-litter buckets and shampoo bottles.

KW carefully shreds and washes the containers and like the PET recyclers applies a vacuum to molten resins to remove volatile compounds. It then adds colorants antioxidants and other food-contact additives to meet customer specifications.

KW’s products don’t go into food packaging but rather personal care containers like shampoo bottles and deodorant sticks for which its customers in consumer products want a high-purity polymer with food-grade quality. Saunders worries that selling into actual food-contact markets might expose his firm to liability.

And business in the personal care segment which KW serves is booming. Not long ago Saunders says KW’s material was sold as a low-cost alternative to virgin plastics. Now big brands are clamoring for high-end polyolefins. “In 2014 or 2015 we couldn’t get an audience with a lot of consumer product companies” he says. “Today we know all of them.”

The solvent solution

If high-volume recycling has been difficult to achieve for PET and polyethylene it has been nearly impossible for polypropylene and polystyrene. Solvent extraction could solve this problem.

The most prominent practitioner of solvent recycling is PureCycle Technologies which is trying to turn polypropylene recycling around. Polypropylene is one of the most ubiquitous polymers found in soft-drink cups face masks and car bumpers. But only 1% of polypropylene is recycled according to the American Chemistry Council. Many municipalities don’t even bother to collect it.

It is polypropylene’s very versatility that hinders its recycling says Dustin Olson PureCycle’s chief manufacturing officer. “The reason it isn’t getting recycled at a higher rate is because of the various applications that it’s in” he says. Each of them requires its own set of dyes fillers impact modifiers and other additives.

I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO Polystyvert

A consumer product company Procter & Gamble developed PureCycle’s process in the early 2010s. In a presentation last November John Layman director of sustainable materials development at P&G said the company uses polypropylene more than any other plastic—for example in items like toothbrush and razor-blade handles nonwoven fabrics and container caps. P&G he said is also a cleaning specialist which led its technologists to wonder: “Can we put our powers of cleaning to work on cleaning recycled resins?”

The process it developed uses supercritical butane to dissolve polypropylene. Olson says PureCycle plays with temperature and pressure so pure polypropylene precipitates out of the solvent and leaves contaminants behind. “What we are doing is dry-cleaning the molecules” he says.

PureCycle went public earlier this year by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. PureCycle is building a plant in Ironton Ohio that will have about 50000 t of annual capacity when it opens next year. The company plans to spend $440 million on a much larger plant in Augusta Georgia. With local partners Mitsui & Co. and SK Geo Centric it is studying operations in Japan and South Korea as well.

Solenne Brouard Gaillot CEO and founder of Montreal-based Polystyvert has a similar ambition for polystyrene another notoriously difficult-to-recycle resin with a US recycling rate that also hovers around 1% according to the EPA.

Polystyvert’s technology uses p-cymene a solvent with a particular affinity for polystyrene. After dissolving the polymer and filtering out contaminants the firm precipitates it by adding heptane.

In June Polystyvert completed an investment round that included the European packaging firm BEWI. Brouard Gaillot won’t say how much money Polystyvert raised but she says it is enough to build the company’s first commercial-scale plant a 10000 t unit in Montreal. “We can use it as a showcase to license the technology” Brouard Gaillot says.

The environment for new recycling technology is better than it has ever been. Like others Brouard Gaillot contends that interest by consumer product companies and the public is bringing constructive change.

“I started the company 10 years ago and at the beginning I had to explain why it’s important to recycle. People were not ready to put money on the table” she says. “Now the demand for recycled polystyrene is very high and it’s more expensive than virgin. That’s a speedy evolution.”

Big challenges remain

But improving plastics recycling will take more than just new technology and the willingness of consumer product companies to buy more recycled resin. Plastics recyclers say two big advances are needed if the recycling rate is to increase appreciably: a vast expansion in collection and easier-to-recycle plastic goods.

PET firms see the main bottleneck as the collection step. “We will expand our business to the extent we can get bottles to support the expansion but collection expansion is key” DAK’s McNaull says.

Indorama’s Prabhushankar says people often don’t have the options or the motivation to dispose of their bottles responsibly. “Consumers are not fully educated on the value of the bottles that they have” he says. “If they make the wrong choice and put the bottle in the trash bin then it’s gone. That one decision point decides the entire fate of the bottle.”

Bottle deposit systems where people get a monetary incentive to bring their bottles back to the store help but only 10 of the 50 US states have them. In California which has a deposit system the collection rate is nearly 70% Prabhushankar says. In Alabama which has no deposit or even curbside collection in some places it is less than 10%.

If there is no demand then no one is going to recycle which is going to add to the plastics waste challenge. Evan Arnold vice president of business development Glenroy

In a 2020 report the Recycling Partnership says only 32% of the 37.4 million t of commodities of all kinds that could be recycled annually in the US actually are. Only 52% of US households participate in curbside recycling programs either because they aren’t available or because people aren’t using them. The report says $9.8 billion in investment is needed to close the gap.

Experts agree that collection is the rate-limiting step of the entire recycling system. For example KW’s Saunders says that the US recycling rate for high-density polyethylene bottles—the kind used for milk and detergent jugs—is currently 28%. But it could be doubled through additional collection without new processing plants.

“The low-hanging fruit is to maximize the capacity of what’s already installed” Saunders says. “And to do that as an industry and a country and a society we’ve got to convince people that have that container in their hand to put it in a recycling bin somewhere and not in the trash.”

But Saunders has noticed changes for the better. “We’ve seen a tremendous amount of investment happening in sortation” he says. “We’re seeing growth in the material and we’re seeing the quality improve.”

Further improvement advocates say will require consumer product makers to redesign their packaging so it is easier to recycle in today’s mechanical systems. In one example of designing for recycling Unilever modified the black plastic used in its Axe deodorant and TRESemmé hair care brands so they are detected by optical scanners. PepsiCo is eliminating the green tint in its 7Up bottles in Europe. Danone is selling its Evian water in France with no label at all.

Keurig Dr Pepper transitioned its coffee pods from styrenic resins to polypropylene. And the company has been working with AMP Robotics so the new pods will be recognizable to the artificial intelligence machines. Many more and varied collaborative efforts will be needed to make a dent in recycling Writz says. “To make more packaging truly recyclable you have to work on different aspects of the supply chain.”

And more design for recycling is needed to reverse momentum that for decades has made plastic goods complicated and difficult to recycle. For example brands and stores love multilayer packaging for colorful stand-up pouches but the multiple plastics and metallized layers they involve make them tough to recycle.

Glenroy’s Arnold says 95% of his firm’s technical development time is spent tackling such problems and advising clients to adopt simpler packaging. “If the brand feels much safer with a metallized option even if it isn’t needed they would have probably in the past leaned that way just to have the extra protection” he says. Now brands are seeing that they can have sufficient protection in a simpler nonmetallized more sustainable material he says.

Steve Alexander president of the Association of Plastic Recyclers a trade group says consumer product firms need to recognize that in a circular economy they are their own raw material suppliers. “You cannot create a supply of recycled resin if you’re contaminating the very stream of material you want the recycling community to create” he says.

Chemical recycling offers itself as a different solution to the multimaterial problem. Chemical recycling especially pyrolysis is billed as a technology that can break down whatever plastic is fed into a reactor into basic molecular building blocks. But Alexander fears this yet-to-be-realized promise will give consumer product companies an excuse not to design their packaging for mechanical recycling.

Alexander sees chemical recycling as a complement to the current incumbent. “The collection infrastructure we have in this country and how recycling programs work is always going to be mechanical recycling. Where chemical recycling fits in is taking those materials that are not appropriate for mechanical recycling” he says. He’d like to keep that category to a minimum.

And veterans of mechanical recycling are skeptical that chemical recyclers will ever achieve what they have been doing day in and day out for decades. “If somebody builds a chemical plant and they can take a variety of resins blended together in a bale and deal with 20% contamination by rocks dirt glass paper chicken bones—all the things that we deal with—I’ll be a big cheerleader of that” Saunders says.",,,,,,

The man who wishes to remain anonymous bought a Kentucky Jackpot ticket on Sunday while at the Kroger on US Hwy 42 in Union. It was the only Kentucky Jackpot ticket he bought that day but he told lottery officials he plays the lottery often.

He was at home with his wife when he scratched off the ticket. It was the last row on the game where he discovered he matched the number 36. It was then that he revealed the game’s $250000 top prize.

“I reacted a little different than usual and she thought something was wrong” he said. “It was a nice surprise.

“I quickly signed into my Kentucky Lottery account and scanned the ticket. That’s when I saw ‘Congratulations you won $250000.’

“My persistence has finally paid off. I’m a regular player and the Kentucky Lottery has been good to us.”

The Boone County man drove to Louisville the next day to claim his ticket. After taxes he received a check for $177500.

Once the check was deposited in the bank he shared the news with his two sons by texting them a picture of the ticket. They were both happy for him and one told him “You better buy mom something nice.”

He told officials the something nice is going to be a new car.

Kroger will receive $2500 for selling the winning ticket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd5bXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDkvc2VjLW5hdGlvbi1icm9hZGNhc3RzLWxleGluZ3Rvbi1haGVhZC1sc3Utc2hvd2Rvd24v0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3ltdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wOS9zZWMtbmF0aW9uLWJyb2FkY2FzdHMtbGV4aW5ndG9uLWFoZWFkLWxzdS1zaG93ZG93bi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEC Nation broadcasts from Lexington ahead of LSU showdown,"LEXINGTON Ky. (WKYT/WYMT) - Time is ticking before the sold-out showdown between Kentucky and LSU at Kroger Field. The last time UK beat the tigers was back in 2007.

SEC Nation in Lexington is shining bright lights upon Big Blue Nation.

“It’s a great atmosphere and the Big Blue Nation is up to the challenge of being the best fanbase in the country” one Kentucky fan says.

Even some Tigers fans agree.

“The fans are pretty nice compared to some” an LSU fan said. “Some of the other SEC environments are pretty hostile.”

The ESPN show’s hosted by fan favorites including Laura Rutledge who sings BBN’s praises.

“Big Blue Nation shows up no matter what” Rutledge said. “I think the hospitality here is one of my favorite things about this place and no matter where you go you are welcome with open arms by this fanbase.”

This week fans are amped after last Saturday’s win against Florida. Now some are calling UK a football school.

“The more that we have environments like this and the younger generation sees it the more they’ll get into football” a UK fan said. “I think you’ll see the younger generation be more of a football state than a basketball state.”

As for Saturday’s big LSU game Kentucky fans feel momentum is on their side.

“I think we’re going to take the win” one fan said. “We’re gonna beat LSU and then we’re going to beat Georgia next week.”

The big game kicks off at 7:30 pm. You can catch it on the SEC Network.

LHX,L3Harris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2dyYW5kcmFwaWRzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcvZGVmZW5zZS1jb250cmFjdG9yLXRha2VzLW92ZXItbXVza2Vnb24tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zaXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defense contractor takes over Muskegon manufacturing site,"This summer Melbourne Fla.-based defense contractor L3Harris Technologies Inc. sold off its Muskegon Township-based Combat Propulsion Systems operation to German defense contractor RENK Group. With the move RENK established the existing 1.2 million-square-foot facility located at 76 S. Getty St. as the headquarters for what is now known as RENK America. RENK Group manufactures automatic transmissions and gearing for the armored vehicle defense and civil marine energy production plastics and oil and gas sectors. The company employs 2600 people globally and generated 550 million euros in revenue last year which equates to approximately $650.5 million. MiBiz spoke with RENK America CEO Ted Trzesniowski who also managed the operation when it was part of L3 Harris about what to expect from the new ownership.

L3 Harris is an $18 billion business with a large focus on satellites and technology while RENK Group seems to be a better fit for the Combat Propulsion Systems division. What are the benefits of being with RENK?

We were very happy that this new owner understands our business and comes from the same line of business that is focused on the technology. (With L3Harris) there was little attention to details and investment was not very easy to obtain. Here with the RENK Group it’s all about creating jobs and new products and putting investments in Muskegon where we created the headquarters of RENK America.

What sort of synergy comes from the two like-minded businesses?

We have this very affordable solution. I say we have a Ford vehicle — very reliable dependable quite inexpensive and has quite a good reputation in the field. RENK comes with highly advanced technology. Their transmission is what I call the BMW of the industry. It comes with very increased functionality and they were not able to get to the U.S. market.

Now the product will be built in the United States. It will offer a higher functionality solution and more sophisticated solution to our military because we have it in the family. Second our legacy product will continue and I believe will be able to get the cost decreased on both product lines because our plant will be full of production.

What are the geographical benefits of establishing a headquarters in Muskegon?

We have over 100 years of history in the town.

… You can imagine 90 percent of my customers are within Detroit and Michigan including primes like BAE (Systems) and GE. We are very blessed with very good talent that we were able to move within Michigan or actually tap into Grand Rapids. We have a lot of people from Grand Rapids who are commuting to Muskegon. When (RENK visited before the acquisition) they looked at this from the perspective of future growth. They looked at the building and the acreage that we can use for the testing of the vehicles.

Are any capital investments or workforce training plans on the horizon for the site?

Both are right now in planning for future years. The short answer yes. One thing our business needed was some capital investment. We never hid this. We are looking for an opportunity to add increased efficiency. Why? At the end of the day it would benefit our company and our customers.

Of course training is something we always pay attention to. Definitely with the new workforce — and potentially people who would come and be cross pollinated from one business line to another — the training would be something that we’d intensify.

How pronounced have supply chain issues been in RENK’s corner of manufacturing?

We work with a lot of small businesses and smaller vendors and because of the situation in the market and COVID they are struggling. We have situations where in spite of their agreements they come back and say we cannot honor the pricing or we cannot provide the product on time. We’ve had this very often now and we have to manage that.

How does RENK America plan to engage with the local community?

We are proud sponsors of a few organizations (including) the robotics team in the local high school. We work closely with the chamber of commerce and have a great relationship actually. We had a couple meetings with local CEOs so we can exchange some ideas or some opportunities to collaborate in Muskegon County.

We’re supporting some of the local veterans organizations which is absolutely dear to my heart and to my team. We believe that being part of the community is a very important part of who we are.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjEvb2N0b2Jlci8xMDgxOS1sMy1oYXJyaXMtd2lsbC1jb250aW51ZS10by1zdXBwb3J0LW1rLTIwLWVsZWN0cm8tb3B0aWNhbC1zZW5zb3Itc3lzdGVtcy1mb3ItdXMtbmF2eS1zaGlwcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L3 Harris will continue to support MK 20 electro-optical sensor systems for US Navy ships,"According to a contract released by the United States Department of Defense on October 4 2021 L-3Harris Technologies Inc.

Companies were ready to be back in action.

“A lot of the students come here not sure what they want and I would really like them to all walk away with an idea of a career choice and a career path”Jerilee Thurston representative for J. H. Kelly a commercial mechanical contracting company said.

Some students had never attended a career fair before but were eager to reap the benefits. Josh Carnahan a student at the fair prepared for the event in advance.

“I’m looking to get an internship this summer for my major so I shopped around beforehand and came with a handful of companies in mind and went and talked to them all” Carnahan said. “It went pretty smoothly. My favorite booth was Ballard Marine Construction.”

Many company representatives wanted students to find their own passions and be an individual in the workplace.

Ballard Marine Construction representative Rebekah Troxell said “I hope that we will be able to impart a little bit of our mission onto students and hear their vision for their futures.”

Other representatives expressed pride in their company and hoped their management style would draw students in.

Ballard Marine Construction representative Jayme Newbigging said “We purely run our company based on merit and how hard you work. We are proud of our company and think it can be appealing to a younger generation.”

Students had an overall positive reaction to the career fair and felt a connection with the companies.

“I had a very nice time today. A lot of the people running the booths were very informative about what they do as a company and what they’re passionate about” Binyam Ayele a student attending the fair said.

Most booths focused on construction but the Lamb Weston booth was unique: their company manufactures french fries.

“There’s more out there in safety than just construction” Lamb Weston representative Mary McCurdy said. “We are hoping to get some high quality safety professionals to show interest in our company and come work for us. Whether it’s an internship or full-time CWU has a great program so we always have good luck with their students.”

While many booth attendants said the traffic was a little slower than previous years companies remained optimistic for the event.

“There’s a lot of opportunities even if it’s not directly in the major you’re looking for” Caley Larson a representative for Sellen Construction said. “There’s a lot of overlap between different positions. Most companies you can find a fit with.”

Many companies hoped that students would gain an understanding of their business function.

“My hope is that students take away what we do every day for work because what we do [with fire sprinklers] isn’t very well-known throughout the industry” Jim Stewart Western States Fire Protection Co. representative said. “I’m hoping the students are getting comfortable … interacting with people who do hiring and get an understanding of what people in business expect.”

The Engineering Technologies Safety and Construction Fair will continue virtually on Friday Oct. 15 from 1 – 3 p.m. where students can find more employment and internship opportunities.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Big loud dazzling slot machines were the stars of the Global Gaming Expo show last week.

New variations on table games held their own.

But it was the supporting cast of products and their technology that wowed many of the thousands of attendees who wandered the trade show the casino industry’s largest product supermarket which ended its run Thursday at The Venetian Expo.

“As G2E has evolved over the years the importance of technology and its integration into the entire guest experience remains the predominant evolutionary aspect of the industry” said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors. “While you can never replace the people that deliver the hospitality that the industry is built upon technology can aid if executed properly into enhancing that experience.”

In some cases the new technology involves merging features into a single device.

“One of the other products that was discussed by a number of attendees was the integration of slots and sports betting into one device” Bussmann said. “As sports betting continues to expand across the country devices like this will become more commonplace as individuals look to maximize the experience by watching a game while playing a slot or other game.”

Acres Manufacturing Co. introduced the PayAction Sports Bonus as part of its 2021 G2E lineup. The bonus uses a live sports data feed to trigger a bonus round on any slot machine connected to Acres’ Foundation casino management system.

What that means is that if you’re a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights and you note that in your player profile you could win a special bonus on a slot machine if the Golden Knights score a goal.

“These machines will pay double whenever the Golden Knights score in an NHL game” said Noah Acres.

The machines are programmed to produce a goal horn sound effect indicating a celebration mode — and all pays would be doubled for 90 seconds.

IGT also showed interactive technology that enables slot machine players to place sports bets while they sit in front of the slot.

‘Biggest resonating trend’

While sports-betting innovations were high on the list of must-see technology companies offering cashless gaming products and digital funds transferring were also hot commodities.

“While there were several new innovations I think the biggest resonating trend is the continued desire to advance cashless gaming” Bussmann said.

“While the rest of the world has and continues to use cashless as some of its mainstream forms of payments the gaming experience still has a long way to go to pay catch up but the desire to move the industry forward is there with the advancements in technology across the board” he said.

IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGTPay products were recognized at G2E last week as “Product Innovation of the Year.” Resort Wallet enables operators to offer “carded cashless” or “cardless cashless” gaming and in combination with IGTPay provide players access to external funding sources such as bank and debit cards and e-wallets.

That means money from a bank account can be transferred to an electronic wallet on a smartphone and transferred directly to a slot machine via a Bluetooth connection. Transactions are verified through personal identification numbers to keep a player’s funds secure.

Location location location

Exhibitors had other technological surprises for the more than 13000 attendees.

Lindsay Slader managing director of gaming for GeoComply of Vancouver British Columbia showed her company’s location verification system growing in demand because of the rapid spread in sports wagering.

States that offer sports betting must continue to verify that someone placing a bet is within the borders of the state. “Our technology is wrapped into the mobile apps and the websites where you’d be placing your wager” Slader said.

GeoComply’s system is designed to detect spoofing or any manipulation of location data.

The system includes a color-coded screen showing the location of iPhones and iPads Android devices and any desktop computers PCs or Macs.

Slader demonstrated a system showing data validation at the New York-New Jersey border where the locating system is so precise that it can verify a bettor’s location within a tunnel beneath the Hudson River and to make sure a New York player is past the river centerline before betting in New Jersey.

Brooke Fiumara co-CEO of Optix a Las Vegas company founded in 2019 said her company analyzes player data that can be used to make better marketing and player development decisions.

“Optix is a casino data platform” Fiumara said. “We take all of the data around the casino and operationalize it for slots marketing and player development. For each one of those products we have an artificial intelligence component that makes recommendations on how to optimize a slot floor or marketing campaigns or make recommendations of players to contact. It takes the guesswork out of operating.”

‘PayPal for the casino world’

Las Vegas-based GlobalPayments works in the digital payment world serving more than 3 million patrons in 500 online and brick-and-mortar casinos.

“We’re all about data and cash access in the casino space” said Justin Sprague senior vice president of marketing for GlobalPayments.”We’re like a PayPal for the casino world.”

The company has been operating for 20 years in mobile funding and cashless transactions and has doubled down now that casino companies are wanting more touch-free digital payment solutions.

And some of the biggest displays on the G2E floor weren’t that technological but they were important supporting cast members for resorts.

Dennys Patir of the Germany-based Patir Casino Seating has been attending G2E since 2005. The COVID-19 outbreak enabled him to deliver new products that protect casino guests with antibacterial materials to apply to a vast array of casino seating. They include chairs for poker table games slot machine and hospitality seating dining chairs banquet chairs barstools lounge chairs sofas and sportsbook seating.

Patir said some of the sportsbook chairs are as comfortable as the entertainment room overstuffed recliner.

Certain chairs do carry a bit of technology — a wireless charger located on the arm of some of them.

This week on October 9 2021 John Lennon would have turned ​81-years-old. The star was tragically assassinated in 1980 but nine years before his death he almost brought The Beatles back together just a year after they split up in New York State just in time for his 31st birthday.

The Fab Four broke up in 1970 after releasing their 12th and final studio album in the same year following a year of high tensions arguments and legal battles. ​ Following that each band member went on to create their own solo bands including Paul McCartney's Wings and Lennon's Plastic Ono Band. A year later in 1971 Lennon's wife Yoko Ono set up an art exhibit in Syracuse New York titled This Is Not Here. The exhibition ran at the Everson Museum of Art for a month beginning on October 9 1971. To commemorate the opening of the event Ono and Lennon arranged for Ringo Starr and George Harrison​ to attend and put on a performance with them.

John Lennon almost brought The Beatles back together

The Beatles' record label Apple flew Starr into the county on a ""chartered"" plane alongside the band's ally Klaus Voorman. They also brought in prominent Fab Four musicians Nicky Hopkins and Jim Keltner. Harrison was due to fly to the country but was ultimately stuck in England. It is ""unknown"" if McCartney was invited due to the ongoing feud he had with Lennon at the time.

John Lennon: The Beatles never reformed

Eventually the one-off midnight Beatles reunion was called off​ - all because of their fame. ​ Word got around that the Fab Four were reuniting for one night only sparking more than 6000 people to arrive at the museum. Ross a Syracuse University attendee at the time commented: ""That evening the doors to the Everson were broken down because people had heard there’d be a secret Beatles concert at the Everson. ""The entire museum was filled with people furious that it had been cancelled and we were afraid they’d trash the place.""​ (Via Syracuse.com)​

John Lennon later tried to reunite the band again

Another attempt to bring the band together occurred at the same part of New York State in 1974 - but again it didn't work out. In 2012 McCartney addressed the band not reuniting despite their many tries. He said: ""There was talk of reforming the Beatles a couple of times but it didn’t jell. There was not enough passion behind the idea."" (sic) He added: ""More importantly it could have spoiled the whole idea of the Beatles. So wrong that they’d be like: 'Oh my God they weren’t any good.'""

After an eventful week for the social media giant that saw a whistleblower share shocking revelations about the company’s potentially negative impact on national security as well as an outage that took down its sites for an entire day hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che were ready to pounce with some sharp jokes at the company's expense.

After being the subject of the show's cold open Jost began the segment with a dig at the Facebook CEO saying: ""This week we found out that sometimes a guy in a hoodie actually can be dangerous.""

The comedian who many may not know graduated from Harvard University in 2004 noted that he was at the school around the same time that Zuckerberg was there infamously creating Facebook.

""I feel terrible"" he said. ""Sometimes I wish I had a time machine so I could go back to college and find Mark and say ‘hey man!… Can I be part of your company?""

Jost also commented on a recent report from The Wall Street Journal that states using Instagram can increase the likelihood that a person will have body image problems.

""Which explains their rival’s new slogan ‘TikTok bring your fat a-- over here"" he joked.

Che then took the reins and continued to lambaste Facebook over its outage last week which left all users unable to access the site or its other apps like WhatsApp and Instagram.

""This week Instagram was down for an entire day forcing many Instagram addicts to fill their time with Twitter TikTok or hosting ‘SNL’"" Che said as a picture of the week’s host Kim Kardashian appeared on the screen.

Kardashian in addition to being one of the most popular reality TV stars she and her family have some of the most followed accounts on Instagram where they have each created massive business empires in cosmetics clothing and more.

Kim Kardashian was not shy about lambasting herself and her family during her time on the show. In her opening monologue the 40-year-old star made hay out of her estranged husband Kanye West’s failed bid for president in 2020 as well as her father Caitlyn Jenner’s failed run for governor of California. She also impersonated her sister Kourtney for a sketch that put the entire family on trial in a mock-up of ""The People’s Court.""

Just a week before her fourth birthday Adele was hidden inside her mum Penny's trench coat and smuggled into the Brixton Academy in South London to watch the Beautiful South in concert. The problem was it was standing-only and little Adele couldn't see a thing. So Penny asked a well-muscled bodybuilder type if he wouldn't mind putting her toddler on his broad shoulders. Adele now had the best view in the house and recalled happily: ""It was amazing - my clearest memory of when I was little.""

But the evening got even better. Her new hero came to the rescue when a host of balloons were released into the audience and she couldn't manage to grab one. ""He walked through the crowd and knocked someone out who wouldn't give me a balloon"" she said. Her father Marc Evans had already settled back in South Wales so it was just her and her mum Penny who had become pregnant at 18. She gave up college to raise the daughter she had named Adele Laurie Blue Adkins but was determined that having a child was not going to stop her living her life. They were a team and Penny never treated her daughter as an inconvenience but always as someone to be included in whatever was going on. Their flat in Tottenham north London was filled with music and she even allowed Adele to stay up to watch Later with Jools Holland which was broadcast at 11.15pm every Friday. She took Adele to her first pop festival when she was five a one-day event in Finsbury Park headlined by Penny's favourite band The Cure. The post-punk band provided the soundtrack to Adele's Tottenham years although she was really scared of the lead singer Robert Smith because she thought he looked like Johnny Depp's fictitious film character Edward Scissorhands. By the time Penny loaded up her old Citroen CV and took them off to Glastonbury Adele was an old hand at festivals. Then aged eight the youngster sat happily in the mud to watch Radiohead and The Prodigy on the main Pyramid stage. The old Citroen also frequently made the journey down the M4 to the elegant seaside town of Penarth to visit Marc's parents John and Rose Evans.

If Penny ever needed a break then she always knew she could leave Adele there and her daughter would be loved and well cared for by the grandparents she adored. Grampy John who was only in his mid forties when Adele was born in 1988 became a father figure in Adele's life simply by giving her so much time and affection. Her dad Marc who had split from Penny when Adele was just nine months old recalled: ""He was a very honest straight up sort of guy. He really was a lovely man."" John who had built up his own plumbing business was very fond of Penny and gave her a monthly allowance to help care for Adele. Some years mother and daughter would spend Christmas in Wales. One Christmas Eve when Adele was asleep and Nana and Grampy had gone to bed Penny carefully cut up a newspaper in the shape of feet and placed them on the stairs. When her daughter awoke in the morning she said: ""Look Adele it's Santa's footprints. He's been."" Adele loved her mother's large extended family in north London but in Tottenham she was one of many while in Penarth she was the centre of attention. The big treat each summer was joining her grandparents when they took to the ""open road"" in their caravan.They didn't go far just down the coast to the beautiful Gower peninsula or further on to Tenby but Adele loved it. It was such an adventure. She was a kind and pretty little girl with fair hair and green eyes and she made friends easily in South Wales. Her proud father observed: ""She was more of a tomboy type than a girl with dolls. She was a lovely kid. She was one of those kids who if she had a bag of sweets would give them all away and keep just one for herself.""

She also despised bullies particularly at school in north London. She went to the very diverse Coleraine Park Primary School round the corner. Marc recalled: ""Tottenham is a rough place but if another kid was being picked on then she would be the one sticking up for them. She was also very protective of her friends."" From a very early age Adele was putting her feelings down on paper - a habit that would stand her in good stead as a songwriter - particularly if she had been told off by her mum for not tidying her room. Then she would shut herself away and push a note underneath the door to let Penny know that she wasn't coming out for a year! While her mother's musical tastes were more edgy Adele became a big fan of the Spice Girls and would dance around her bednce room singing Wannabe. She was determined that when she ""grew up"" she was going to be Ginger Spice. She took to heart the group's Girl Power mantra: ""Approach life with attitude. Don't let anyone tell you that you can never do something because you're a girl. Have fun."" Adele and her mum left Tottenham when she was nine first settling in Brighton before returning to south London when Penny began a new relationship. Leaving north London was one of the two big events that shaped her childhood. The other happened just before her 11th birthday in May 1999. Her Grampy John Evans had been diagnosed with bowel cancer and the prognosis was poor. Penny drove Adele up to see him during the last weeks as he slipped away at a cancer centre in Cardiff.

Adele later admitted she was overwhelmed: ""I couldn't face the fact that the love of my life my granddad was dying."" He passed away aged 57. Despite being griefstricken Adele bravely went with Penny to the funeral. Even though she coped well on the day Adele struggled to get over it. After a few weeks her worried mother decided to seek professional help and took her to a counsellor experienced in dealing with bereavement in children. Adele it became clear was a far more sensitive girl than people realised. She had wanted to sing and perform at secondary school but didn't have the opportunity although she surprised everyone by becoming highly proficient on the clarinet. She was still only 13 and doing her best impression of a bolshie teenager when a friend of her mum's heard her singing at their flat above the Co-op in West Norwood one day and suggested she should take singing more seriously. Penny encouraged her to apply to the BRIT School in Croydon south London and went along to support her at her audition. Adele sang Free a StevieWonder ballad and played Tumbledown Blues on the clarinet. The deputy head of music Liz Penney was impressed ""I thought 'That's a larger voice than you would expect in a 13-year-old. She's in!'"" Adele soon established herself as one of the brightest of her year group. Liz recalled: ""She was very quick witted."" Her favourite school day was Thursday when five solid hours were dedicated to music. She knew she had been given a huge opportunity and was determined not to mess up.

Liz noticed Adele's commitment right from the start. She was forever passing the young teenager in the corridor ""Working by herself writing lyrics picking up the guitar and learning to accompany herself."" Her famous singing style developed aged 15 when she found an album by the legendary Etta James in the bargain bin of the Oxford Street branch of HMV. Most evenings when she got home she would listen to the CD in the bedroom practising Etta's rasping raw power. Despite taking school seriously she was very sociable smoking roll-ups with her friends on the benches behind the canteen enjoying a bacon and egg sandwich at a local café for lunch and going to see bands playing locally. Often she would catch the train into school with Kate Nash who would also become a well-known singer. The two girls laughed at the same things. The famous Adele cackle was what another BRIT contemporary pop star Jessie J remembers about her: ""You could hear her laugh from a mile down the corridor. ""She was very kind of loud and everyone knew her and she was the girl everyone loved.""

“With this delivery we’ve taken another leap in advancing this capability to support the U.S. Army’s long-range precision fires vision in support of joint all domain operations” said Eric Scherff vice president for Hypersonic Strike Programs at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re achieving great efficiencies by supporting this program and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic program through the use of a common missile. We’ve invested heavily in creating digital factories across the corporation that employ advanced materials and precision capabilities needed for hypersonic strike and bringing this digital factory approach to hypersonics means shorter delivery spans and greater affordability.”

In a ceremony held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord today the U.S. Army and industry team celebrated this delivery of ground equipment including the battery operations center and four transporter erector launchers. The overall system is being developed in partnership with the U.S. Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office and its Hypersonic Project Office. Led by Lockheed Martin other industry teammates include Dynetics General Atomics General Dynamics i3 Moog Northrop Grumman Penta Research Raytheon and Verity Integrated Systems.

You can’t move ahead you can’t move back … you can’t even lift your head without it being blown off — the enemy has the upper hand and you know it.

Thankfully circling high above this firefight is an AC-130J Ghostrider Gunship — the aircraft that became a legend in the Vietnam War for hosing down the Viet Cong.

Nicknamed “Hell in the sky” it normally features three … yes three side-firing weapons — a 25mm gatling gun a 40mm Bofors cannon and a 105mm howitzer.

Easy to see how it got its name. Anything in that field of fire about the size of a football field will die.

But this time it is equipped with some completely different — it is armed with a high-energy laser weapon — and the aircraft is unmanned!

An operator at a ground station thousands of miles away perhaps even on a different continent receives a desperate plea for help by secure sat-phone — it is code-named “Broken Arrow.”

It translates to a ground unit facing “imminent destruction from enemy attack” and all available air forces are to provide air support immediately.

A message is sent to the circling gunship that is packed with defensive jammers.

Instantly its artificial intelligence system kicks in — in seconds it is able to discern who are the friendlies and who are the bad guys.

The go signal is sent and the gunship’s laser wreaks havoc on the ground. The US troops will live to fight again as an evac chopper arrives to get them out of danger.

That entire scenario may be farfetched perhaps something out of the future. Could it really happen?

You’re damn rights it could. Laser weapons are no longer sci-fi. Neither is AI.

In fact it appears to be happening.

Lockheed Martin has delivered the new Airborne High Energy Laser (AHEL) to the Air Force for flight testing on an AC-130J aircraft following a successful factory acceptance testing period Defense Daily reported.

“Completion of this milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for our customer” Rick Cordaro vice-president of Lockheed Martin Advanced Production Solutions said in a statement.

“These mission success milestones are a testament of our partnership with the US Air Force in rapidly achieving important advances in laser weapon system development. Our technology is ready for fielding today.”

Lockheed Martin received a contract in January 2019 to integrate and demonstrate AHEL on an AC-130J with the laser system now set to go through ground testing ahead of demonstration on the aircraft.

In July the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division then awarded Lockheed Martin a five-year US$12 million deal for further post-delivery services with AHEL to include integration and demonstration activities.

Tyler Griffin business development director for Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems’ advanced product solutions told reporters the company could not disclose AHEL’s specific power level but added it’s in “the same class as the HELIOS high-energy laser that was delivered to the US Navy.”

Lockheed Martin delivered its production unit 100-kilowatt-range High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance or HELIOS to the Navy in January.

US Navy destroyers will soon be armed with new ship-fired lasers able to sense and incinerate enemy drones low-flying aircraft and small boat attacks — all while firing at the speed of light National Interest reported.

HELIOS is engineered to surveil track and destroy targets from an integrated ship system consisting of advanced radar fire control technology and targeting sensors.

The farther away an incoming attack can be detected the more time commanders have to make time-sensitive combat decisions regarding a possible response. Therefore having one system that synthesizes sensing and shooting changes the equation.

Lockheed Martin is also working toward outfitting a directed energy system on fighter jets by the middle of the decade.

“We’re committing to putting a laser pod equipped with a high-energy laser in the air within five years” said Mark Stephen business development lead for strategic technology development at Lockheed Martin’s missiles and fire control division.

The company is a core member of an industry team partnering for the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator or SHiELD program Stephen said during a media roundtable in September.

AFRL is developing a directed energy system on an aircraft pod that will demonstrate self-defense against surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles the organization said.

There is also a strategic missile defense potential being explored — the possibilities seem endless.

Pentagon officials say that even if laser weapons are not yet strong enough to for instance knock out an ICBM in its mid-course phase of flight beyond the earth’s atmosphere — they might be able to help with targeting or identification.

In this respect lasers as sensors could help with targeting and sensor-shooter time when it comes to destroyer launched missiles developed to knock approaching ballistic missiles out of the air.

The technology might even have an Army application through the Indirect Fire Protection Capability-High Energy Laser program.

“This is a 300-kilowatt class laser weapon system which mounts on the ground vehicle to defeat drones rockets artillery and mortars” said Robb Mansfield senior manager of business development for laser and sensor systems within Lockheed Martin’s integrated warfare system and sensors business.

“The beam director is the optical system that puts the high-energy light on target and keeps it there with enough precision to defeat the threat” he said.

According to a report in The War Zone the Air Force has announced that recent directed energy (DE) systems tests have taken place in the four-foot transonic wind tunnel or 4T belonging to the Aerodynamics Branch of Arnold Engineering Development Complex at Arnold Air Force Base Tennessee.

By experimenting with a DE system in a wind tunnel of this type it’s possible to assess how the weapon behaves when it encounters shockwaves left by the aircraft carrying it as well as other disturbances that might affect the weapon’s energy beam and prevent it from engaging the target properly.

“The idea that this (lasers) is 5 or 10 years away is no longer the case” says Chris Frei director of short range air defense at Northrop Grumman Corp.

“In the fight there tends not to be a ‘silver bullet’ so the services are looking at a mix of different solutions each with its strengths and weaknesses.

“So it is critical to have a system that can pull all that together so you can defend against 30 threats in the sky or a half dozen on the ground. Doing that gets the maximum effect out of any of these technologies.”

Evan Hunt director of business development for high-energy lasers and counter-unmanned systems at the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment agrees.

“Laser weapons will be a core part of layered air defense employed by DOD and its coalition allies. That means laser weapons in any integrated system we have protecting serious assets in our territories. In five years any large base that needs to defend its assets will have laser weapons regardless of service.”

In other words whether you like it or not laser weapons are coming to a war zone soon and they can’t be stopped.

That and the onset of artificial intelligence and robot killing machines will only get bigger.

Welcome to the new world.

According to the U.S. Department of Defense work for this most recent contract will be carried out in Virginia Washington and Florida and is expected to be completed by July 2026.

It remains unclear exactly when flight testing of an AC-130J armed with the AHEL system might begin but U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has previously said it expects to start in the Fiscal Year 2022. SOCOM has also revealed that the power rating of the AHEL will likely be in the 60 kilowatt range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL3NlYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEtYnV5cy0xMi1tb3JlLW1oLTYwci1oZWxpY29wdGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia buys 12 more MH-60R helicopters,"The US State Department has approved the potential sale of an additional 12 Lockheed Martin MH-60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

The approval announced by the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on 8 October covers 12 helicopters equipment training and related services and is valued at US$985 million.

Some of the equipment included in the proposed deal are: 30 General Electric T700-GE-401C engines (24 installed and six spares); 12 Telephonics APS-153(v) Multi-Mode Radars; 12 Raytheon AAS-44C(v) Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems; 20 Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems (MIDS); 12 Airborne Low Frequency Sonars (ALFS) – albeit ‘aircraft provisions only’; 18 Northrop Grumman AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning Systems (MAWS); 18 BAE Systems ALE-47 chaff and flare dispensers/ECM; 12 Lockheed Martin ALQ-210 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems; 24 M299 Missile Launchers; 12 GAU-21 door guns and 18 L3 ARQ-59 Hawklink terminals.

The RAN currently operates 24 MH-60R Seahawks in the naval combat helicopter role sufficient to provide eight flights (of a single helicopter) at sea and concurrently deliver shore based training and operational tasking. They are shore-based at HMAS Albatross near Nowra and serve with 725 and 816 Squadrons.

With the number of Navy surface combatants set to increase in coming years more flights at sea will be needed but the RAN also has a requirement to phase out its six NHI MRH 90 Multi Role Helicopters which are operated in the utility role from some of its larger surface ships.

Whether these additional ‘Romeos’ are intended to replace the MRH 90s in the shipboard utility role (albeit readily re-configurable to ASW/ASuW roles) or whether they are being acquired to bolster the existing combat helicopter remains to be seen. The notification that only aircraft provisions for the ALFS sonar system – the primary ASW sensor – are included in the deal would seem to indicate the RAN intends to rotate aircraft between roles.

The recent Force Structure Plan 2020 calls for both an ‘expansion and rationalisation of the support and logistics helicopter fleet consistent with the expectations for larger naval operations’ and continued investments in ‘acquisition and through-life upgrades of the MH-60R anti-submarine helicopter’.

Interestingly the DSCA notification notes the additional helicopters will “Improve Australia’s capability to perform anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions along with the ability to perform secondary missions including vertical replenishment search and rescue and communications relay.”

ADM has contacted Defence and will update this story as further information comes to hand."

It was the first game for the Utes since safety Aaron Lowe was killed in a shooting at a post-game party on Sept. 26 nine months after running back Ty Jordan died of an accidental gunshot wound to the abdomen on Christmas night 2020.

“To see just their sheer enjoyment and that’s the best way to describe it and they obviously had Ty and Aaron on their mind and it’s gonna be a constant the rest of the season” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. “But to see them have the success they had tonight was great and I think this team needed that. I know they did.”

Rising was 22-of-28 passing for 306 yards Brant Kuithe and Tavion Thomas each ran for a touchdown and Utah (3-2 2-0 Pac-12) won a road game against the Trojans for the first time since 1916 which predates the opening of the Coliseum in 1923.

Drake London had 16 receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown for USC (3-3 2-3) which has lost three straight at home by at least 14 points for the first time in school history. The Trojans also lost three consecutive conference home games in 1991 and 2000.

“The guys fought to the end but that’s not good enough at all especially for USC” interim coach Donte Williams said.

Whittingham credited a team meeting last week with Lowe’s mother Donna Lowe-Stern for giving players permission to turn their attention back to football. And they delivered an inspired performance with the offense taking charge by scoring touchdowns on four straight possessions in the second and third quarters.

Utah took control when Thomas went 43 yards up the middle to take a 28-10 lead 2:19 into the second half. After Vonte Davis intercepted a pass by Kedon Slovis on fourth down to give Utah a short field Rising scored on a 17-yard keeper to send fans to the exits with 9:13 left in the third.

“I feel like there’s a lot of like ups and downs with the emotions but I feel like we were really able to come together as a team” defensive end Mika Tafua said. “Really lean on each other so that really helped and we saw the results tonight.”

As a passer Rising was able to take advantage of the aggressive tendencies of USC’s defensive backs. He found Money Parks off play-action for a 12-yard touchdown and Devaughn Vele for a 37-yard touchdown off a flea flicker on fourth-and-1 late in the second quarter before connecting with Dalton Kincaid on a 1-yard pass in the fourth.

USC was able to move the ball early on with each of its first four drives ending in Utah’s territory but had just 10 points to show for it because of continued poor play in the red zone. Parker Lewis missed a 34-yard field goal to compound those issues and the offense couldn’t keep pace once the Utes began exploiting weaknesses in the Trojan defense.

Slovis was 33 of 53 passing for 401 yards two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions and Vavae Malepeai had a short rushing touchdown.

THE TAKEAWAY

Utah: Playing to honor Lowe the Utes came through with their most complete performance of the season. Utah players coaches and staff will now travel to Texas on Monday to attend Lowe’s funeral. Then they will return home to face Arizona State with first place in the Pac-12 South at stake and a win would put them in favorable position to play in the conference title game in Las Vegas on Dec. 3.

USC: The Trojans’ path to bowl eligibility is now in serious jeopardy. It’s also no longer out of the question that this could be the first senior class at USC to have two losing seasons in their career since John McKay had two sub-.500 years in 1970-1971.

CHANGES COMING?

Williams said USC would comprehensively review personnel and schemes during its upcoming open week before playing at Notre Dame.

“Making sure that we play the right guys making sure we calling the right plays making sure we doing things the right way” Williams said. “This is the first half of the regular season so we have a whole second half to go so we got to make sure we the right combination of guys and plays going on on that field.”

INJURIES

Utah left tackle Jaren Kump did not return after sustaining a left leg injury when he was rolled up from behind in the second quarter.

USC tight end Michael Trigg sustained a knee injury in the third quarter and left the Coliseum using crutches with his right leg in a brace.

""I've been through a unique experience to say the least but I'm grateful for where I am today"" said Lowe one of 22 super seniors on the Illini who were granted an extra year of eligibility following the pandemic. ""Being a young father husband student and athlete takes a lot out of you. But I've found a good balance and I'm happy.""

He sure looked it after last Saturday's 24-14 win over Charlotte. Lowe helped running back Chase Brown rush for 257 yards and this week Pro Football Focus released its lineman grades and Lowe graded out at 93.7 the top grade of any offensive tackle in the country for last weekend.

That provided a big boost to a lineman looking to make the leap to the NFL. Overall this season PFF ranks Lowe 26th in the nation among offensive tackles with a 77.8 grade. But he appears to be moving up the list.

He is happy with his life off the field as well. He recently got married welcomed his second son into the world and gained legal guardianship of his younger brother Vydalis Cockrell moving him out of Rockford and in with his family in Champaign.

More Fighting Illini:How this Freeport all-American became a record-setting Illini soccer goalie as a freshman

On Saturday Lowe will make his 47th start — the Fighting Illini record for the most games started in a career is 48. Here are Lowe's thoughts on a number of key items headed into a big stretch in his college career:

Q: How special was Saturday's performance for you?

A: I had a lot of pancakes and a lot of solid blocks and we ran the ball really well. It was pretty special. When they came my way or even when they didn't I felt like I had my guy down and I was making plays. ... I definitely take a lot of pride in that game.

Q: What's it like balancing a growing family with two young sons and legal guardianship of your 15-year-old brother and college football?

A: It's never easy; there's never a dull moment at my house. It can get pretty crazy at times. Sometimes the oldest will be drawing on the walls and everything is happening and it's tough. And then there's those times when everybody goes down smoothly and everything is nice and quiet and it's just nice.

Q: What has it been like changing head coaches from Lovie Smith to Bret Bielema?

A: It's been a cultural shift for sure. They are two different men two different people and they both came from different backgrounds different teams different places. It's been a cultural shift but it's all worked out. Coach B came right in and we bought in. All he wants to do is win big games.

Q: Do you think about your chances in the NFL much?

A: You have to stay focused on what's in front of you and the rest will take care of itself. But I'd be lying to you if I said I never think about it. It's not hard to think about but it's hard to get it out of your head. I just know you can't get ahead of yourself. My wife (Haylee) helps me a lot with this one. She keeps me focused.

Q: Does this part of the season still feel like a grind even in your fifth year?

A: It is sure. This is the seventh game of the year and it definitely gets tougher when you get to this point in the season. But I've picked up a lot of nuances and ways to get through the tougher parts and I know what I need to do. Like I know what it takes to keep my body fresh and healthy by now so it gets easier in that sense... At this time of year though nothing is really easy.""

Q: How big is Saturday's home game against Wisconsin?

A: This is what college football is all about — that's how big. This is two great programs who have had some great battles in the past going at it. It doesn't really get much better than this. This this right here is why you go to a great program like Illinois or Wisconsin — for games like this.

Desde el lunes pasado dos helicópteros del Ejército Mexicano fumigaron cientos de hectáreas de amapola de los pueblos ubicados en la zona de la sierra de Chilpancingo “tan solo aquí en esta zona del poblado de San Vicente nos destruyeron más de 50 hectáreas” denunció Eduardo N campesino de esta comunidad.

San Vicente es un poblado enclavado en la parte media de la sierra de Chilpancingo y cuenta con dos mil habitantes que en su mayoría se dedican a la siembra de amapola para sobrevivir. Pese a los daños que causó el huracán Manuel en 2013 fue reubicado tras ser declarado como zona de riesgo se encuentra en la misma situación de pobreza y total abandono.

Entrevistado en las inmediaciones de un plantío de amapola Eduardo señaló que además de San Vicente “también los helicópteros militares fumigaron plantíos de amapola en las comunidades vecinas de El Fresno Xocomamatlán Huacalapa Chautipan por mencionar algunos pero realmente es en toda esta sierra del municipio de Chilpancingo”.

El campesino amapolero invitó al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador a que visite la sierra de Chilpancingo “para que vea como nos tienen abandonados porque no somos malos el dinero que obtenemos lo utilizamos para educar a nuestros hijos para curarlos cuando se enferman y en general porque es la única manera de mantener a nuestras familias aquí no hay trabajo”.

Reconoció que el precio de la goma de opio producto de la amapola ya es muy bajo “el kilo se cotiza entre cinco y seis mil pesos; y si es de riego llega a costar hasta 10 mil pesos; pero en otros lugares de la entidad llega a pagarse hasta en 13 mil a 15 mil pesos por kilo”.

Eduardo N insistió en que van a continuar sembrando amapola: “aquí casi nunca han llegado cosas o apoyos a nuestra comunidad somos olvidados en educación en salud y en obras; no hemos visto que lleguen los apoyos a nuestra comunidad ¿cómo va a crecer nuestra comunidad ¿cómo nuestros hijos van a van a superarse en estudios si no contamos con escuelas?; no contamos con internet gratis con recursos materiales que el gobierno debe darle a nuestros a nuestros hijos”.

Luego nos dicen manden a sus hijos a estudiar “váyanse a la ciudad; y cómo nos vamos a la ciudad con qué. Podemos mandarlos un mes con lo poco que tengamos; pero se termina el mes y qué es lo que hacemos nosotros pues se regresan nuestros hijos ya no nos alcanza. Hemos visto que aquí nadie sale profesional porque falta la economía”.

Dan becas “pero pues en la ciudad no nos alcanza una beca para seguir estudiando. El dinero de la amapola lo ocupamos para la educación la salud y para todo lo que se necesita; lo que ocupan las amas de casa para preparar los alimentos a nuestros hijos”.

Por eso le pedimos a AMLO que nos dejara nuestros trabajos “para seguir sobreviviendo para poderle seguir dando más educación a nuestros hijos que ya no vengan a fumigar (los plantíos) que se olvidaran de eso que nos dejen trabajar”.

Ustedes vieron el camino “está en mal estado más en tiempos de lluvia aquí de donde estamos hay derrumbes; vean las viviendas en mal estado y así es desde que me empiezo a acordar que vivo en esta comunidad no he visto mejorías”.

Cuando pasaron los huracanes Ingrid y Manuel “venía mucha gente mucha gente de gobierno a prometernos que nos iban a reubicar; aquí trajeron topógrafos que hicieron estudios a la zona y salió que estaba en mal estado estábamos en riesgo y seguimos estando en riesgo en nuestra comunidad”.

Nosotros no tenemos empleos “no tenemos donde buscar trabajo no contamos con recursos ni apoyos del gobierno no contamos con nada. Tenemos buscamos la forma de cómo sobrevivir y cómo sostener a nuestras familias. Nosotros nos mantenemos y sobrevivimos de la amapola”.

No nos da vergüenza decir que sobrevivimos de la amapola como muchos pueblos “pero hablo de mi comunidad de mi gente de San Vicente que de eso vive; de eso mantenemos a nuestra familia: de la amapola”.

Desde el lunes “nos mandan sus helicópteros a destruir los plantíos; pero el gobierno se olvida de darnos apoyos; se olvida de la educación se olvida de todo; pero nunca se olvida de que nos va a mandar destruir los plantíos. Nuestro único sustento que tenemos que es la amapola. De ahí sobrevivimos de ahí nos mantenemos de ahí salvamos vidas porque aquí no hay centro de salud no no hay medicamentos no hay nada. Bajamos a Chilpancingo un hospital privado”.

Tiene tres días que (el Ejército) está destruyendo todo: “es todo lo que tenemos nuestros plantíos de amapola y nos los destruye: ¿por qué hace eso?; quisiéramos saber ¿por qué hace eso? si nosotros de eso sobrevivimos”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO canceled $100M Neom contract after Saudis bulldozed villages,"The site of NEOM in Tabuk Province Saudi Arabia. NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

MRO,Marathon Oil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS8yMDIxL2Zvc3NpbC1mdWVsLWNsaW1hdGUtYm9udXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fossil fuel CEOs earn annual cash bonuses for environmental ‘excellence’,"Marathon Petroleum’s former CEO got a $272000 bonus for surpassing environmental goals the same year the company spilled 1400 barrels of fuel in an Indiana creek

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

[Can the market save the planet? FedEx is the latest brand-name firm to say it’s trying.]

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

Wilmington a predominantly working-class and Latino immigrant community of more than 50000 people has some of the highest rates of asthma and cancer in the state according to a report by the non-profit Communities for a Better Environment. It's surrounded by six oil refineries and wedged in by several freeways and the ports of L.A. and Long Beach. California the seventh-largest oil-producing state in the U.S. has no rule or standard for the distance that active oil wells need to be from communities. For many Californians especially Black and brown residents acrid smells noise and dirt from oil production is part of the neighborhood. Walking around Wilmington pumpjacks are visible in public parks next to schoolyards where children play and outside of people's windows at home. At night the sky is lit orange from refinery flares. The discovery of oil in the 1920s led to significant population growth in the area. People built and bought houses next to the oil fields and refineries which employ thousands of residents in the area. In L.A. County the industry employs about 37000 people according to a report by Capitol Matrix Consulting.

More than 2 million California residents live within 2500 feet of an operational oil and gas well and another 5 million — 14% of the state's population — are within 1 mile according to an analysis by the non-profit FracTracker Alliance. Residents are especially vulnerable in L.A. County which is home to the Inglewood Oil Field. The 1000-acre site is one of the largest urban oil fields in the country and is owned and operated by Sentinel Peak Resources. More than half a million people live within a quarter mile of active wells that release hazardous air pollutants like benzene hydrogen sulfide particulate matter and formaldehyde. Sentinel Peak did not respond to requests for comment. Sanchez-Hall didn't understand the link between the nearby refineries and the health issues in her community until she left. She graduated college and pursued a masters degree at UCLA where she took environmental law classes and now advocates for clean air and energy in her neighborhood. ""Wilmington is ground zero for pollution"" Sanchez-Hall said. ""Now I understood why people were dying of cancer around me. We're not disposable people. There is a huge disadvantage because many of us don't know what's happening.""

No buffer zone between drilling and people

Research shows that people who live near oil and gas drilling sites are exposed to harmful pollution and are at greater risk of preterm births asthma respiratory disease and cancer. Residing near oil wells is linked to reduced lung function and wheezing and in some cases the respiratory damage rivals that of daily exposure to secondhand smoke or living beside a freeway according to a recent study published in the journal Environmental Research. Another study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives analyzed nearly 3 million births in California of women living within 6.2 miles of at least one oil or gas well. The authors concluded that living near those wells during pregnancy increased the risk of low-birthweight babies. Environmental advocacy groups have urged California Gov. Gavin Newsom to instate a 2500-foot buffer zone or setback between fossil fuel operations and homes and schools. This year a bill to ban fracking and instate a buffer zone failed in a state committee vote. Other oil-producing states including Colorado Pennsylvania and Texas have already implemented some form of buffer zone between properties and wells. In 2019 Newsom ordered his regulators to study such a health-and-safety rule but they didn't meet the December 2020 deadline for action. State oil regulators also missed a more recent deadline in the spring to release new regulations that would help protect the health and safety of people living near drilling sites. The California Geologic Energy Management Division which oversees the state's fossil fuel industries hasn't yet set a new timeline for regulations. Meanwhile the governor since 2019 has approved roughly 9014 oil and gas permits according to an analysis of state data by Consumer Watchdog and FracTracker Alliance. ""Frontline communities have been waiting for very basic protections from dangerous oil and gas projects for too long"" said Hollin Kretzmann an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity which recently sued the state for approving thousands of drilling and fracking projects without the required environmental review. ""A safety buffer is the bare minimum"" Kretzmann said. ""The fact that our state continues to delay is frustrating and completely unacceptable.""

The Western States Petroleum Association and the State Building and Construction Trades Council have opposed a statewide mandate to establish buffer zones arguing that doing so would harm workers and increase fuel costs. ""A one-size-fits-all approach for an entire state for an issue like this is rarely good public policy"" said WSPA spokesman Kevin Slagle. ""Setback distances not based data specific to a region could lead to significant impacts on communities jobs and the affordability and reliability of energy in the state."" Environmentalists have also called on Newsom to place an immediate moratorium on all new oil and gas permits in those zones. Earlier this year the governor directed state agencies to halt new fracking permits by 2024 and to consider phasing out oil production by 2045. The announced marked a shift in position by Newsom who's previously said he doesn't have executive authority to ban fracking which accounts for just 2% of oil extraction in California according to the state's Department of Conservation. Newsom's office did not respond to requests for comment. Newsom's predecessor Jerry Brown who held office between 2011 and 2018 approved 21397 new oil wells. More than three-quarters of new wells under Brown's administration are in low-income communities and communities of color according to state data analyzed by the Center for Biological Diversity.

'I could have had a better life'

Josiah Edwards 21 grew up in Carson a city located in the south bay region of Los Angeles and near the West Coast's largest oil refinery owned by Marathon Petroleum Corp . Edwards and his family members suffered from asthma and were constantly concerned about breathing in emissions of the nearby refineries. ""Oil drilling and refineries were always an ever present background in my life"" said Edwards who now volunteers for the Sunrise Movement an environmental advocacy group in Los Angeles. Edwards recalled getting bloody noses as a child and coming to connect them with the pollution from refineries. He dove into research on how exposure to pollution may contribute to the development of asthma in childhood and wondered if his life would have been different growing up elsewhere. ""It makes me angry and upset. There's a situation where I could have had a better life with improved health outcomes"" Edwards said. ""Even though it still makes me feel angry I find a lot of hope in what could be. There's a potential for change."" Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company's refinery in Carson has invested in air emissions control equipment and cut its criteria pollutant emissions by 35% in the past decade. It's also invested $25 million to install air monitoring systems along the perimeter of its facilities and is providing those results to the public.

Phasing out oil and gas locally

Some parts of the state have taken matters into their own hands. Culver City in L.A. County passed an ordinance to phase out oil and gas extraction in its portion of the Inglewood Oil Field within five years in one of the most ambitious moves by an oil-producing jurisdiction. The ordinance also requires that all the wells be plugged and abandoned in that time period. Ventura County located northwest of L.A. has adopted a 2500 buffer zone between oil wells and schools and 1500 feet between wells and homes. And L.A. County supervisors voted unanimously earlier this month to phase out oil and gas drilling and ban new drill sites in the unincorporated areas. The county is set to determine the quickest way to shut down wells legally before providing a timeline on the phase out. Jacob Roper a spokesperson for the Department of Conservation of which CalGEM is a sub-agency said the department is ""hard at work developing a science-based health and safety regulation to protect communities and workers from the impacts of oil extraction activities."" ""This is a complex set of rules with subject matter outside of our previous regulatory experience"" Roper said. ""It involves close collaboration with other state agencies and an independent public health expert panel in an effort to ensure a thorough analysis of relevant science and engineering practices."" L.A. could become one of the first major cities in the U.S. to nearly phase out fossil fuels from power supply without disruption to the economy according to a recent study commissioned by the city. Technologies like solar farms wind turbines batteries and electric vehicles would make the transition possible while mitigating harmful air pollution in the most vulnerable communities. ""There are local officials who are taking this issue seriously"" Kretzmann said. ""But the fires ongoing drought and heatwaves in California are stark reminders that we need much bolder action on fossil fuels.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL3VzL2Fjcm9zcy1hbWVyaWNhL2V4LW1hcmluZS1ydW5uaW5nLWJvc3Rvbi1tYXJhdGhvbi0xLWRheS1hZnRlci1jaGljYWdvLW1hcmF0aG9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Marine Running Boston Marathon 1 Day After Chicago Marathon,"Community Corner Ex-Marine Running Boston Marathon 1 Day After Chicago Marathon Your 5-minute read to start the day: Manatees could get endangered status; 15 shot at Minnesota bar; cop killed on his first day.

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

More than 2 million California residents live within 2500 feet of an operational oil and gas well and another 5 million — 14% of the state's population — are within 1 mile according to an analysis by the non-profit FracTracker Alliance. Residents are especially vulnerable in L.A. County which is home to the Inglewood Oil Field.

No buffer zone between drilling and people

Research shows that people who live near oil and gas drilling sites are exposed to harmful pollution and are at greater risk of preterm births asthma respiratory disease and cancer. Residing near oil wells is linked to reduced lung function and wheezing and in some cases the respiratory damage rivals that of daily exposure to secondhand smoke or living beside a freeway according to a recent study published in the journal Environmental Research. Another study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives analyzed nearly 3 million births in California of women living within 6.2 miles of at least one oil or gas well. The authors concluded that living near those wells during pregnancy increased the risk of low-birthweight babies. Environmental advocacy groups have urged California Gov. Gavin Newsom to instate a 2500-foot buffer zone or setback between fossil fuel operations and homes and schools. This year a bill to ban fracking and instate a buffer zone failed in a state committee vote. Other oil-producing states including Colorado Pennsylvania and Texas have already implemented some form of buffer zone between properties and wells. In 2019 Newsom ordered his regulators to study such a health-and-safety rule but they didn't meet the December 2020 deadline for action. State oil regulators also missed a more recent deadline in the spring to release new regulations that would help protect the health and safety of people living near drilling sites. The California Geologic Energy Management Division which oversees the state's fossil fuel industries hasn't yet set a new timeline for regulations. Meanwhile the governor since 2019 has approved roughly 9014 oil and gas permits according to an analysis of state data by Consumer Watchdog and FracTracker Alliance. ""Frontline communities have been waiting for very basic protections from dangerous oil and gas projects for too long"" said Hollin Kretzmann an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity which recently sued the state for approving thousands of drilling and fracking projects without the required environmental review. ""A safety buffer is the bare minimum"" Kretzmann said. ""The fact that our state continues to delay is frustrating and completely unacceptable.""

The Western States Petroleum Association and the State Building and Construction Trades Council have opposed a statewide mandate to establish buffer zones arguing that doing so would harm workers and increase fuel costs. ""A one-size-fits-all approach for an entire state for an issue like this is rarely good public policy"" said WSPA spokesman Kevin Slagle. ""Setback distances not based data specific to a region could lead to significant impacts on communities jobs and the affordability and reliability of energy in the state."" Environmentalists have also called on Newsom to place an immediate moratorium on all new oil and gas permits in those zones. Earlier this year the governor directed state agencies to halt new fracking permits by 2024 and to consider phasing out oil production by 2045. The announced marked a shift in position by Newsom who's previously said he doesn't have executive authority to ban fracking which accounts for just 2% of oil extraction in California according to the state's Department of Conservation. Newsom's office did not respond to requests for comment. Newsom's predecessor Jerry Brown who held office between 2011 and 2018 approved 21397 new oil wells. More than three-quarters of new wells under Brown's administration are in low-income communities and communities of color according to state data analyzed by the Center for Biological Diversity.

'I could have had a better life'

Josiah Edwards 21 grew up in Carson a city located in the south bay region of Los Angeles and near the West Coast's largest oil refinery owned by Marathon Petroleum Corp . Edwards and his family members suffered from asthma and were constantly concerned about breathing in emissions of the nearby refineries. ""Oil drilling and refineries were always an ever present background in my life"" said Edwards who now volunteers for the Sunrise Movement an environmental advocacy group in Los Angeles. Edwards recalled getting bloody noses as a child and coming to connect them with the pollution from refineries. He dove into research on how exposure to pollution may contribute to the development of asthma in childhood and wondered if his life would have been different growing up elsewhere. ""It makes me angry and upset. There's a situation where I could have had a better life with improved health outcomes"" Edwards said. ""Even though it still makes me feel angry I find a lot of hope in what could be. There's a potential for change."" Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company's refinery in Carson has invested in air emissions control equipment and cut its criteria pollutant emissions by 35% in the past decade. It's also invested $25 million to install air monitoring systems along the perimeter of its facilities and is providing those results to the public.

Phasing out oil and gas locally

Some parts of the state have taken matters into their own hands. Culver City in L.A. County passed an ordinance to phase out oil and gas extraction in its portion of the Inglewood Oil Field within five years in one of the most ambitious moves by an oil-producing jurisdiction. The ordinance also requires that all the wells be plugged and abandoned in that time period. Ventura County located northwest of L.A. has adopted a 2500 buffer zone between oil wells and schools and 1500 feet between wells and homes. And L.A. County supervisors voted unanimously earlier this month to phase out oil and gas drilling and ban new drill sites in the unincorporated areas. The county is set to determine the quickest way to shut down wells legally before providing a timeline on the phase out. Jacob Roper a spokesperson for the Department of Conservation of which CalGEM is a sub-agency said the department is ""hard at work developing a science-based health and safety regulation to protect communities and workers from the impacts of oil extraction activities."" ""This is a complex set of rules with subject matter outside of our previous regulatory experience"" Roper said. ""It involves close collaboration with other state agencies and an independent public health expert panel in an effort to ensure a thorough analysis of relevant science and engineering practices."" L.A. could become one of the first major cities in the U.S. to nearly phase out fossil fuels from power supply without disruption to the economy according to a recent study commissioned by the city. Technologies like solar farms wind turbines batteries and electric vehicles would make the transition possible while mitigating harmful air pollution in the most vulnerable communities. ""There are local officials who are taking this issue seriously"" Kretzmann said. ""But the fires ongoing drought and heatwaves in California are stark reminders that we need much bolder action on fossil fuels.""",,,,,,,,,

The 135-room Fairfield by Marriott in Jodhpur opened in 2017 in a city which has been firmly established in the tourist trail of the country for decades. The hotel had not been operational since the first wave of Covid-19 hit and opened to guests only on October 1 2021. ET HospitalityWorld caught up with the hotel manager Vivek Sharma about the challenges of being in a city which is already so prominently leisure-centric.“Jodhpur as a city is famous for its handicraft business which makes up a significant market segment with a lot of the products holding high domestic and export demand. The medical and banking fraternity also make up a significant target segment with a lot of offsite conferences being hosted in the city” Sharma said when asked about the sectors he aims for while targeting customers adding that since the city attracts leisure business as well as wedding customers they had been catering to all three segments since the launch of the hotel.“We opened our doors in September 2017 and business was really promising before the pandemic. We were home to many international series and guests from across the globe while domestic demand remained consistent with leisure and business travellers—given the history and lure of the destination. The hotel hosted more than 20 weddings annually pre-Covid” he said.Since resuming operations on October 1 2021 business in Q4 was looking promising with domestic travel picking up and numerous auspicious dates for weddings opening up across November and December.“Given these recovery patterns hold we are looking at a good fourth quarter by way of business. As international flights and borders are yet to fully open domestic leisure is the main focus and the business is increasing gradually” he said. As business gradually resumed they would continue to remain the top choice for corporations such as Mahindra & Mahindra Daimler and others he added.As far as competition went Sharma felt that the Radisson was in their comp set along with several standalone boutique properties that did attract a lot of the leisure and wedding business in the city."

ConsenSys announced in an April press release that it had raised $65 million from investors J.P. Morgan Mastercard UBS and others in what the company called a “formation round.”

Headquartered in New York and founded in 2014 by Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin ConsenSys develops and invests in projects built on the Ethereum blockchain according to the report. The platform is a competitor to bitcoin and can be used to develop apps for financial services.

The digital asset most closely aligned with Ethereum is ether which Lubin used as the central source of funding to launch ConSenys the report stated.

The company is also the developer of MetaMask a fast-growing gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi) programs. MetaMask is projected to bring in some $1 billion in revenue within the upcoming 12 months according to FT.

MetaMask launched MetaMask Institutional in December to bring increased DeFi exposure to crypto funds market-makers and trading desks according to a Tuesday (Oct. 5) press release. The institutional version of MetaMask integrates institution-compliant custody operational risk and other compliance features.

Since it was launched last year MetaMask has handled over $8.9 billion in trades via a special feature that enables people to exchange digital tokens according to the report.

“MetaMask Institutional’s focus is to provide unrivaled access to DeFi even in the face of rigorous institutional requirements” said Johann Bornman product lead for MetaMask Institutional per the Tuesday release. “Qualified custodians and custody technology play a fundamental part in these requirements.”

Cary De Van who lives in the Broyhill Villas in the Village of Ashland was arrested on a warrant and booked at 9:10 p.m. Saturday at the Sumter County Detention Center.

The Philadelphia Pa. native’s legal trouble started on July 30 2020 after crashing his golf cart in a golf cart tunnel in the vicinity of Buena Vista Boulevard and Rainey Trail. When law enforcement arrived on the scene the golf cart had a broken axle and was missing its windshield. De Van told Sumter County sheriff’s deputies he had been “watching President Trump on TV then got really mad at what he said” according to the report. That’s when he started pouring the vodka. By the time the crash occurred De Van was “not able to stand under his own power” during field sobriety exercises and provided breath samples that registered .149 and .148 blood alcohol content.

As a result of that arrest De Van’s license was suspended. However he was caught back behind the wheel in January in Ocklawaha. He claimed he did not know his license had been suspended. He was released on $10000 after that arrest. He did not comply with requirements from the Marion County Court and in March an order was issued instructing De Van to “Report immediately to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office.” He did not report to the sheriff’s office leading to his arrest this past weekend in Sumter County.

De Van was also named in July in a small claims case by Citibank which contends that De Van owes $2923.79 in an outstanding balance on a Sears Mastercard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbi1vdmVydmlldy1vZi13b21lbi1lbnRyZXByZW5ldXJzaGlwLWluLXRoZS1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1hbmQtYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Overview of Women Entrepreneurship in the Middle East and Africa,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thefintechtimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Bakery is one of the largest markets of the food processing sector in India. The Indian bakery industry offers a plethora of opportunities for growth innovation and career prospects. Due to this very reason over the years there has been a noteworthy surge in entrepreneurial endeavors in the sector. While home baking was an easy resort to chase one’s dreams digital disruption coupled with the pandemic-induced social distancing norms have further boosted the sector. Consequently home bakers especially females have been able to transform their hobby into their profession as well as monetize their ventures. As per Mastercard’s reports India currently ranks 52nd in the index of women entrepreneurs. It can be aptly said that the bakery segment is the most popular and go-to business idea for females as it gives them creative freedom as well as the convenience of working right from their homes at flexible timings.

A Paradigm Shift: Women Covering The Journey From Homemakers To Professional Home Bakers

Chef Alisha says “Passé are the days when the bakery was just associated as a hobby. The sector is now emerging to be empowering for women and is giving them opportunities to carve a career path out of it. There has been a paradigm shift from women being addressed as homemakers to home bakers and women entrepreneurs all thanks to the bakery market. The concept of home baking has given birth to women entrepreneurs not only in the urban areas but in the rural as well as remote areas as well.” The women community has been participating in the bakery entrepreneurial race with equal zeal and fervor. The female entrepreneurs are dropping their inhibitions to pursue their passion for baking. Breaking the typical societal norms that males are the bread earners and females belong to the kitchen women entrepreneurs are in fact building a career right from their kitchen’s bakery section! From cupcakes to assorted popsicles cheesecake to customized fusion delicacies and bakery items the sheroes are leaving no stone unturned to satiate the country's sugar cravings with their hand-crafted masterpieces.

The Rise Of Female Bakery Entrepreneurs In India Females have explored their passion and are turning it into a profitable business. They have been stepping up the ladder of success and are securing opportunities in what was once a male-dominated segment. Be it a variety of bread cookies trendy cakes customizable cupcakes the women are whipping whisking and baking efficiently. This rise in the female bakers in India is just a testimony of the fact that women can be both ambitious and homely that they can successfully handle both career and home. Harnessing the potential of technology and social media and putting their interest and skill to best use they have making the most out of the opportunity to give a professional touch to their skills of baking. With more females entering the space the sector is becoming diverse and inclusive and is also moving towards gender equality. Female bakers put in their love care heart and soul along with the so-called ‘motherly instinct’ that is inherently present in every women. Delivering within the timelines offering diverse variety along with the scope for customization and personalization at unimaginable levels has led to a significant surge in the demand for female home bakers."

Manchester United’s Scott McTominay scored the decisive goal at close range from a corner in the 94th minute.

The two teams were battling each other for second place in their group which guarantees a playoff spot for the finals. Scotland’s win in a hard-fought breathless encounter cements its place with 14 points while Israel is stuck on 10 and in third place overall.

Eran Zahavi gave Israel the early lead with a free-kick from outside the penalty box on five minutes after being fouled.

John McGinn equalized after 29 minutes but Israel again took the lead almost immediately with Munas Dabbur slotting home after an Israeli free-kick ricocheted around the book.

Shortly before half-time Scotland had the chance to equalize with a penalty after a foul narrowly judged to be just inside the penalty area.

But goalkeeper Ofir Marciano who had apparently done some homework on Lyndon Dykes’ penalties stayed in the center of the goal and was able to kick Dykes’ shot to safety.

After 57 minutes Scotland did equalize with a Dykes volley. Initially ruled out for dangerous play the goal was allowed after a VAR review.

Marciano kept Israel in the game with a series of fine saves as Scotland dominated the second half and urged on by the home crowd sought a winning goal.

Three minutes into stoppage time the home side found the breakthrough when McTominay forced home at the back post from a corner. Israel could find no way back in the game’s dying seconds.

Denmark leads the group with 221 points and is guaranteed a place in Qatar; it thrashed Moldova 4-0 later Saturday.

Israel hosts Molodova on October 12 when Scotland takes on minnows the Faroe Islands. The Group F teams then play their final two qualifying games on November 12 and 15.

The game was a make-or-break moment for Israel.

In September the Danes beat Israel 5-0 hurting the latter’s prospects of moving forward. For Israel it was an abrupt return to reality after the euphoria of a 5-2 win against Austria.

If it finishes second in Group F when all the qualifying games are over Scotland will win a playoff spot and a shot at reaching the World Cup; Israel will be eliminated.

SEOUL--With two defeats out of three games already in World Cup qualification Japan needs to beat Australia on Tuesday in Saitama or face the genuine prospect of missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1994. In contrast the Socceroos are in excellent form and will take a huge step towards Qatar with a win.

With just the top two of the six-team group automatically qualifying for the World Cup Japan is already six points behind Australia and Saudi Arabia in Group B.

A 1-0 loss to Saudi Arabia in Jeddah last Thursday has raised questions why Japan with a team full of European-based stars such as Liverpool’s Takumi Minamino Kyogo Furuhashi of Celtic and Arsenal’s Takehiro Tomiyasu is struggling.

The most recent loss which came after a shock home defeat against Oman in September was full of uncharacteristic errors and misplaced passes. It also increased criticism of coach Hajime Moriyasu.

“We got tired and lost our rhythm that’s when they capitalized and scored” Moriyasu said. “If we don’t give up I believe we can still win a ticket to the World Cup” the 53-year-old added.

Australia on course for a fifth successive World Cup arrives in Japan full of confidence after winning its last 11 games.

“It’s something we’ll probably reflect on in the future and what a great feat it has been especially playing 10 out of 11 games away from home” said Australia coach Graham Arnold. “But to me it’s all about going to Japan and getting ready for Japan in Japan and making it 12.”

Saudi Arabia can make it four wins out of four to stay on course for a sixth World Cup appearance when it hosts China. The visitor aiming to return to the global stage for the first time since its debut appearance in 2002 picked up a first win in the group on Thursday defeating Vietnam 3-2 thanks to a last-minute Wu Lei goal.

Vietnam is still looking for its first points and travels to Muscat to take on Oman level on three points with Japan.

In Group A the big clash comes as Iran in first place with maximum points hosts South Korea in second. Korea has yet to impress but stayed on course for a tenth successive World Cup appearance on Thursday as a late Son Heung-min goal defeated Syria 2-1.

The game in Iran is Korea’s first away trip of the group.

“It’s not a decisive game. It’s just one more game” Korea’s coach Paulo Bento said. “It’ll be a tough game and a very good challenge for us. But I am sure it will be a tough game for them as well.”

Korea has never won in seven meetings in Iran losing five and drawing two though Bento insisted that he will not just settle for one point against Asia’s best team ranked 22 by FIFA.

We should play and fight to take three points” he said. “From the beginning we’re not going to play to draw the match. We’re going to play to win the match.”

The other four teams in Group A have yet to win. United Arab Emirates hosts Iraq in Dubai while Syria and Lebanon who are both still looking for a first World Cup appearance also meet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWJwbGl2ZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvaWNjLXQyMC13b3JsZC1jdXAtZWFjaC10ZWFtLXRvLWdldC0yLWRlY2lzaW9uLXJldmlldy1jaGFuY2VzLXVuZGVyLW5ldy1kcnMtcnVsZXMtaW4tdXBjb21pbmctdDIwLXdjLTE0ODY5NjjSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFicGxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L2ljYy10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLWVhY2gtdGVhbS10by1nZXQtMi1kZWNpc2lvbi1yZXZpZXctY2hhbmNlcy11bmRlci1uZXctZHJzLXJ1bGVzLWluLXVwY29taW5nLXQyMC13Yy0xNDg2OTY4L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ICC T20 World Cup: Each Team To Get 2 Decision Review Chances Under New DRS Rules In Upcoming T20 WC,"After IPL 2021 the T20 World Cup is going to start in UAE and Oman from October 17. The ICC has decided to use the Decision Review System (DRS) for the first time in the history of the Men's T20 World Cup this year.

According to an official statement of the ICC in every innings both the teams will get two chances of review under DRS.

Usually in T20 matches a team gets only one review in an innings but keeping in mind the absence of experienced umpires in many matches during the Covid-pandemic the ICC in June decided to increase one review in each format of cricket.

Changes were also made in the rule of minimum overs

For the T20 World Cup the ICC has also changed the rules for delayed starts or rain-stopped matches. In the group stage as in the previous general rule it will be mandatory for each team to bat at least five overs to get the result of the match with Duckworth-Lewis. At the same time in the semi-finals and final each team will be required to bat at least ten overs to get the result of the match with Duckworth-Lewis.

The Women's T20 World Cup played in the West Indies in 2018 was the first ICC International T20 tournament where DRS was used. After this it was going to be used in the 2020 edition of the T20 World Cup in Australia which was cancelled due to Covid-19.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGlieWFvYnNlcnZlci5seS9zcG9ydHMvZWd5cHQtdG9wcy1ncm91cC1mLWFmdGVyLWhhcmQtZm91Z2h0LXdpbi1hZ2FpbnN0LWxpYnlh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Egypt tops Group F after hard-fought win against Libya,"On Friday the Mediterranean Knights gave their Egyptian hosts a hard time at the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match which ended with a 1-0 win for Egypt.

The national team managed to keep the score to a zero tie throughout the first half of the match that took place at the Burj Al Arab stadium in Alexandria.

They also held off a wave of desperate attacks in the second half until Omar Marmoush opened the deadlock in the 49th minute for Egypt.

The two teams will meet next Monday at the Benina Martyrs Stadium in Benghazi as part of the fourth round of the World Cup qualifying matches.

With this win the Egyptians top Group F with seven points while Libya slipped down to second place with six points then comes Angola with three points and Gabon trailing with one point at the bottom of the ladder."

The team announced that they have signed fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round defensive tackle Logan Lee. Both players signed four-year deals with the team.

McCormick was one of three offensive linemen that the Steelers drafted last month. He played in 70 games for South Dakota State that included a school-record of 57 straight games so the Steelers are getting an experienced rookie.

Lee had 158 tackles 18.5 tackles for a loss and nine sacks in 43 games at Iowa.

The Steelers also announced the signing of four undrafted free agents. They are West Virginia cornerback Beanie Bishop Jr. Georgia running back Daijun Edwards UCF quarterback John Rhys Plumlee and Michigan State linebacker Jacoby Windmon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts."

Branded as ""Big Mac Rubik's Cube"" the NFTs will be distributed among employees and consumers as a part of the giveaway.

The Big Mac Rubik's Cube NFTs are designed based on the three-dimensional structure of McDonald's China’s new office headquarters which was inaugurated along with the launch of the NFTs.

The NFTs are built on the Conflux public blockchain and are created in partnership with Cocafe a digital asset creation agency ensuring that “each work is unique indivisible and can not be tampered with.”

It is also important to note that a majority stake of McDonald’s China is owned by CITIC Group a state-owned investment company of the People's Republic of China.

McDonald's China did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment.

And while the pledge is in line with what other major companies have promised to accomplish in order to minimize their climate change impact experts are crying foul and expressing skepticism about whether McDonald's is actually capable of reaching this goal.

According to EcoWatch the Center for Biological Diversity a science-reliant nonprofit that works on protecting endangered animal species issued a statement criticizing the chain. ""This is another stunt in a long line of greenwashing trends from McDonald's. Net zero is not a climate solution it's an accounting trick"" their statement read. ""The company's beef footprint alone produces more than 22 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually.""

""If McDonald's changed its menu immediately it would make a big difference"" Center for Biological Diversity's Jennifer Molidor said: ""But waiting until 2050 is insufficient to avoid climate catastrophe. We don't have 30 more years to get this right.""

So what would McDonald's have to do in the here and now to actually make a difference in the fight against climate change? In a nutshell it would need to severely alter its menu and its message. For more check out McDonald's Subway and More Are Expected to Be Investigated By the FTC.

McDonald's would need to cut down its production of meat

There are currently well over 39000 McDonald's restaurants spread across the globe but the sheer number of locations isn't the main issue when it comes to the climate. Far and away the largest problem is its beef-heavy menu—McDonald's Corporation's largest emissions come from farming and supply chain activities with meat production being the main driver according to Reuters. To meaningfully curtail greenhouse emissions the chain would have to dramatically reduce the amount of livestock it raises for meat.

Fewer burgers? Fat chance

McDonald's uses more than one billion pounds of beef per year in the United States alone according to Inc. As in more than 5.5 million cattle are slaughtered for McDonald's beef each year. Why? Because it sells cheap accessible burgers to the masses.

""Can everyone have a hamburger? No they simply can't"" Andrew Hoffman professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan said to VICE. ""And if companies [like McDonald's] keep pushing the idea that we can then frankly we're doomed.""

In short McDonald's would have to completely rebrand their identity and their message in order to truly become part of the solution.

McDonald's could influence customers in a positive way . . . if it wanted to

According to Jennifer Molidor of the Center for Biological Diversity McDonald's could lead customers to a less meat-heavy more plant-based consumption simply by changing the offerings on their menu. Speaking to VICE Molidor said: ""When [customers] want cheap fast food [they choose McDonald's]. If the company provided different food that's what people would buy."" But instead of reducing its sales of meat-based foods the company is working on ways to sell more.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The chain has been dragging its feet on plant-based menu options

You can already get plant-based burger alternatives at many McDonald's locations around the globe but the chain has been dragging its feet on making them universally available and has been sluggish in adding the forthcoming plant-based burger McPlant to its US stores.

Earlier this year CEO Chris Kempczinski said it isn't up to him to make the chain's menu healthier and that McDonald's is in the business of giving people what they want.

""The way I approach the job today is: whatever the customer wants to buy"" Kempczinski said. ""If they want to buy plant-based and they want to buy enough of it I could make my whole menu plant-based. If they want to be able to buy a burger we'll sell a burger.""

In other words it's unlikely McDonald's would be willing to drive any type of meaningful change in the diets of millions of consumers worldwide.

This isn't the first time McDonald's has been accused of greenwashing

McDonald's has a prior reputation of ""greenwashing"" aka making itself and its goals sound more environmentally friendly than they are.

For example in 2019 it came to light that the apparently eco-friendly paper straws the chain used to replace plastic straws were actually non-recyclable according to The Independent. And in 2018 after making claims of dedication to better animal welfare it was revealed that the chain was using chickens bred to grow unnaturally large unnaturally quickly which led to animal suffering.

The McPlant will be available in 18 cities and 250 restaurants becoming a permanent part of McDonald’s menus everywhere from January.

The chain quietly began a trial run a few weeks back serving it to customers in its Coventry branches and burger fans have already been flocking there to try it with many taking to social media to give their overwhelmingly positive verdicts.

‘No I didn’t just drive 30 miles to try Maccas’ new #McPlant why’d you ask?’ tweeted one alongside a picture of said burger and many thumbs up.

‘Yesterday I had my first-ever #McPlant burger and now I can’t stop thinking about it’ exclaimed another.

Barney Calman and Eve Simmons pictured both tried out McDonald's new meat free burger the McPlant at a branch in East Finchley ahead of the official launch on Wednesday

The McDonald's McPlant has 200 fewer calories than the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe

The McPlant is based on the McDonald’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe but contains a patty developed in collaboration with vegan meat-alternative brand Beyond Meat to taste just like its real beef burgers. Like all Beyond Meat patties it’s made from a pea and rice protein-textured ‘mince’ combined with starches colouring and flavouring (naturally derived from ingredients such as beetroot but highly processed).

The vegan ‘cheese’ is a combination of coconut and other oils and emulsifiers.

The vegan burger sauce has been ‘taste matched’ to the tangy mayonnaise used in McDonald’s chicken sandwiches.

On Friday McDonald’s invited MoS Deputy Health Editor Eve Simmons and me to try it at its North London headquarters.

And I can confirm that it tastes EXACTLY like the real thing.

I have to admit when I heard rumours that McDonald’s was developing a plant-based burger I was intrigued. I don’t eat meat – I haven’t for the past six years. I got fed up with reading horror headlines about beef products containing ground-up horses and chickens labelled organic actually being from battery farms. I’m not alone: figures show British meat consumption has dropped by 17 per cent over the past decade.

Half a million people signed up to Veganuary this year – spending January eating a purely plant-based diet. The one thing I really miss though are burgers – and in particular McDonald’s. Its Double Cheeseburger was my go-to.

McDonald’s has turned up late to the fake-meat party. Something of a novelty a few years back beef-a-like patties can be found everywhere from Burger King to Harvester. McDonald’s took its time to get the formula right ‘so it tastes like a McDonald’s burger’ explained its food technologist as she prepared our McPlants.

The McPlant will be rolled out on Wednesday in 18 cities and 250 restaurants before going nationwide in January

It was worth it: the McPlant hits all the McDonald’s sweet spots – the ratio of bun to burger the sweet tang of the ketchup and sauce the shredded lettuce and little bits of onion and those gherkin slices.

Eve was less impressed. ‘Bland’ was her verdict. ‘It doesn’t taste like beef. Gristly yet melty. The only thing that was really like the original is the sauce.’

She claims she likes McDonald’s burgers usually but admits despite being a meateater she can’t remember when she last had one. So I’m not convinced by her appraisal.

More to the point Eve is one of the first British journalists to sample Beyond Meat’s burgers – interestingly it launched its fake-meat patty a few years back at technology trade show CES in Las Vegas which she was covering at the time. She was unimpressed then and remains so.

To check whether I was imagining just how convincing the McPlant is I decided to forgo my vegetarianism and ordered a Big Mac and a Quarter Pounder. The Quarter Pounder patty interestingly has a far meatier chargrilled taste than the Bic Mac patty.

Flavour-wise I think you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the Big Mac and the McPlant. With the McPlant you could also be doing your health a favour: at just 450 calories almost 200 fewer than the meat version it’s practically diet food.

As we’ve highlighted in the past this isn’t always the case with vegan alternatives. For instance trendy burger chain Honest Burgers does a bacon plant burger – also made with a Beyond Meat patty albeit a far larger one than in the McPlant – and the fake bacon slices tot up to almost 1000 calories. And that’s before you add chips.

The burger contains a patty developed in collaboration with vegan meat-alternative brand Beyond Meat to taste just like its real beef burgers

Pea-protein mince is naturally pretty dry and Beyond Meat creates juiciness by adding coconut oil. This means in the case of Honest Burger’s bacon plant burger the chunky patty has just as much fat as the meaty version – at 14g this is three-quarters of a woman’s and half of a man’s daily recommended allowance of saturated fat. It also contains 14g of sugar almost half your daily recommended allowance.

By comparison the McPlant contains 6.6g sat fat half the amount in the meat version and 19g of protein just 5g less than a beef one. The two and a half teaspoons of sugar will mostly come from the condiments and bun – sugar is third on the list of bun ingredients after flour and water.

The most mysterious thing is the high fibre content. Beyond Meat burgers are usually low fibre but the McPlant has almost 5g of fibre roughly the same as a small bowl of porridge contributing to the 30g a day recommended.

The burger is made out of pea protein mince but McDonald's are tight-lipped about the exact formula

This is almost double the amount of fibre found in a standard McDonald’s Quarter Pounder or Big Mac – which include just as much bun if not more and garnishes – so it must be a modification to the patty.

McDonald’s remains tight-lipped about its exact formulas.

Of course I understand that to a red-blooded meat eater this all might sound revolting but along with the McDonald’s partnership in February Beyond Meat signed a deal with Yum! Brands which owns Pizza Hut KFC and Taco Bell meaning these products will be in the majority of fast-food chains fairly soon. So it looks ever more likely that fake meat will be a permanent fixture on menus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMS8xMC90ZWFjaGVycy1zY2hvb2wtc3RhZmYtY2FuLWdldC1mcmVlLWJyZWFrZmFzdC1hbmQtY29mZmVlLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy10aGlzLXdlZWsuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vZWR1Y2F0aW9uLzIwMjEvMTAvdGVhY2hlcnMtc2Nob29sLXN0YWZmLWNhbi1nZXQtZnJlZS1icmVha2Zhc3QtYW5kLWNvZmZlZS1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtdGhpcy13ZWVrLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teachers school staff can get free breakfast and coffee at McDonald’s this week,"McDonald’s is thanking teachers and school staff for everything they do by giving them free breakfast all week long.

If educators and school staffers show a valid work ID they can drive-thru or walk into any McDonald’s location and receive a free breakfast starting Monday Oct. 11 through Friday Oct. 15.

Although menus might vary by location eligible teachers and school staff can choose to receive an Egg McMuffin a Sausage Biscuit or a Bacon Egg and Cheese Biscuit.

The meal also comes with a side of hash browns and a choice of a medium hot or iced coffee iced tea or soft drink.

The giveaway is the company’s “first big national thank you gesture” for teachers Jennifer “JJ” Healan the company’s vice president of marketing brand content and engagement told USA TODAY.

All “Thank You” meals will be packaged in a Happy Meal box but instead of a toy educators and staff will receive a thank you note.

“We wanted to build on that idea and thank our educators in our communities for all that they’ve been doing and what they do really every day” Healan said.

McDonald’s came up with the program after hearing about teacher appreciation events at local restaurants. It is a follow-up to last year′s “Thank You” meals for first responders.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

Three California doctors filed a proposed class action lawsuit in which they alleged the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) and the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) had for years abused their positions within the American medical community by illegally obtaining revenue through anticompetitive means. According to the 31-page lawsuit the defendants’ and their directors’ conduct had “sharply curtailed if not eliminated” fair competition in the arena for medical specialty certification maintenance for doctors nationwide.

The partnership will allow cross-chain compatibility across gaming platforms.

Under the first phase of the partnership new players can start accumulating the resources necessary for purchasing the first in-game NFTs. Warena promises that Phase 1 will see higher user-orientation and greater attention to personalization.

The second phase entails cross-game integration allowing players to migrate their characters from other games into the Warena metaverse and expand gameplay opportunities.The partnership is aimed at alleviating issues of cross-platform compatibility which impede the development of the metaverse market into a unified environment powered by NFT technologies. At present in-game NFTs are restricted to their respective metaverses limiting gameplay diversity. Cross-platform compatibility will make digital items collected on one platform available to players in other games.



Economies of scale and network effects will apply with cross-platform compatibility as NFT value will increase unrestricted by real-world rules that do not apply in digital metaverses. The ability to teleport NFT-based gaming assets across connected gaming ecosystems through interoperable blockchains will unleash the full value of NFTs.



Warena is a Play-to-Earn metaverse that allows players to create their own unique characters and interact with others across various universes in a variety of combat games. The internal marketplace offers numerous warriors to choose from each endowed with their own characteristics. Players earn rewards in-game in NFT format and can buy or sell assets earning money for their actions that contribute to the game’s ecosystem. The project raised over $1.5 million during the latest funding round which was attended by ​​Genesis Builders DAOMaker Momentum 6 Master Ventures Animoca Clovers Ventures and others.

Illuvium which raised over $5 million in the round led by Animoca Brands is a decentralized ecosystem based on a vast open-world full of NFT collectibles that feature “four-dimensional-shading holographic” NFT designs. The players interact via Illuvials – magical creatures that can be captured and endowed with powers as they progress up the level-up tree. Players can earn income by selling their creatures for ETH on an exchange. Illuvium is set to launch a DAO in the near future that will usher community governance and turn the game into a self-sustaining gaming platform.



NFT projects continue to see impressive exposure as evidenced by the latest investment rounds. In October the Recur NFT-focused startup closed its $50 million funding round with a valuation of $333 million backed by billionaire Steve Cohen’s family office. Another project – Sky Mavis – a Play-to-Earn NFT platform raised $152 million at a nearly $3 billion valuation.

Grosser has been exploring the role of Web-based corporate logic in everyday life and politics for over 10 years now focusing on how Facebook has radically changed the way we use and think about the Internet. His approach mocking and bitter at the same time seems to come directly from a particular moment in the recent history of digital culture. In 2011 Facebook transformed itself from a hugely successful online platform to a gargantuan media juggernaut that has dominated social media this past decade for better or for worse.

Grosser was part of a small group of artists who following the tradition of the 1990s net.art were interested in digital culture as an emanation of codes and languages. “How do social media design and algorithms affect the way we see reality?” is one of the recurring questions in the works of Grosser who has moved between playing the role of Cassandra the Trojan priestess of Apollo in Greek mythology whose true and bleak prophecies were not believed to that of someone who has witnessed the changes he had expected and even inspired.

Software for Less is an opportunity to learn more about a perspective on digital technology that combines technical expertise with a certain passion for metalanguage. For example Grosser’s “Safebook” (2018) is a Web browser plugin that purifies Facebook pages by filtering out texts and images to leave only the interface elements: gray buttons blue circles white squares. These design elements lose their primary function and once released become geometric shapes with which we interact in a playful and inconsequential way. In a certain sense it is a utopia of interaction: Without relying on archaic forms of communication such as texts images and reactions we can move freely between galaxies of round balloons in a space where it seems impossible to meet friction.

Ben Grosser “Safebook” (2018) (screenshot of website courtesy the artist)

As well as “Safebook” there are many other works by Grosser in which his interest in cropping and eliminating the content in order to highlight aspects otherwise hidden becomes evident. “Order of Magnitude” (2019) is a supercut of Mark Zuckerberg saying the words “more” “grow” and every utterance of a metric such as “two million” or “one billion” resulting in a hypnotic albeit alienating experience. The speed with which the words are spoken is reminiscent of the precision of a machine scanning a document for keywords to highlight.

Among Grosser’s most recent works is “Minus” (2021) a finite social network where users get only 100 posts for life. The platform shows how few opportunities they have left instead of how many likes and reshares they have accumulated. The limit imposed on the user presents problems of scarcity in a context — the online world — which has made overabundance a fundamental part of its functioning. By using Minus our usual interaction with Facebook Twitter Instagram and other traditional platforms must be redefined: What is really worth sharing? What thoughts or events in our life can aspire to be part of the 100 posts we have available on Minus? Scarcity leads to a reassessment of how we experience our life no longer perpetually prone to being streamed because it is easy to press two buttons and go live but made of moments that do not perpetually and implicitly ask to be shared with our public.

Exhibition view of Software for Less at Arebyte Gallery London

Ultimately the exhibition doesn’t want to provide answers to the stream of menacing news regarding the increasingly pervasive role of Facebook in the way we express ourselves and communicate with others. Instead the main aim of the show is to offer a creative clever perspective on the reasons behind the alienated and addicted relationship we sustain with social media platforms. Ben Grosser has a formidable ability to explore the junctures between the demands of social media’s marketing teams and our social aspirations. His is a consolatory optimistic point of view that demands that the public take an active role to have a better less monetized future.

Software for Less continues at Arebyte Gallery (Java House 7 Botanic Square London City Island E14 0LG) through October 23."

He’s so popular that he receives emails from men who say they would be “honored” if he slept with their wives.

Santos shared his inbox intrigue at the Saturday Oct. 9 show of Aventura which he fronts at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. The show was billed as the last of a farewell tour for the Bronx band dubbed the Kings of Bachata.

There was lot of bachata at MetLife on Saturday and into Sunday morning. Bachata music born in the barrios of the Dominican Republic is a guitar and percussion-based music and Aventura has brought a contemporary urban sound to the mix.

Contemporary but not too edgy. The Aventura sound fairly soars with lilting melodies percolating beats and Lenny Santos’ nimbly-fingered acoustic guitar runs.

Aventura which also features Henry Santos and Max Santos had previously disbanded — but Romeo brought his bandmates who are not all related on stage for his solo show at MetLife in 2019. That spurred a reunion/farewell tour. It was delayed until the past two months due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Yet Saturday at MetLife felt like Romeo’s show which wasn't a bad thing. He comes off as a cracking-wise bilingual Lothario on stage who will steal your woman and make you think it was an honor.

But he has a heart too. He received a request in his email to allow a marriage proposal on stage Saturday. Good luck Janelle and Victor. They’re childhood sweethearts Romeo said so it should be a good match.

Romeo proved to be particularly irascible when it came to finding an audience member to rap the Bad Bunny part of their new hit single “Volvi.” The selection process went on for about 20 minutes as fans were pulled on stage and then jettisoned as they did not meet Romeo's standards.

“It’s a letdown” said Romeo about one fan.

They had better luck finding someone to sing the Don Omar part of their song “Ella y Yo” although the way the substitute was jostled on stage by group members suggested it wasn't successful. It all seemed to be in good fun — we think.

Even though Saturday's sold-out show was billed as a “farewell” there were no good-bye speeches or parting words from band members. The tour previously played Miami; Arlington Texas; Chicago; and Los Angeles.

“I have a feeling this may be the last one” said fan Leslie Heredia from Brentwood N.Y. who attended with Moises Lopez also of Brentwood N.Y.

Or perhaps Romeo's problems finding new players during Saturday's audience searches will serve as a warning that might keep the members of Aventura together?

If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

Aziz who spent more than 20 years overseeing foreign and U.S. casino expansion for MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts was convicted on two counts of conspiracy by a jury in a Boston courtroom after prosecutors said he paid $300000 in bribes during 2018 to get his daughter enrolled into the University of Southern California as a basketball player.

Aziz left the gaming industry in September 2016 when he resigned his position as president of Wynn Macau. He spent three years with Wynn Resorts as the president of development overseeing foreign and domestic expansion opportunities.

Prior to joining Wynn Aziz spent 18 years with MGM Resorts International including 13 years as president of MGM Grand Las Vegas and five years as president of MGM Hospitality where he oversaw the company’s non-gaming international expansion.

His attorney told reporters in Boston Friday that Aziz – who was listed in the complaint by his given name Gamal Adbelaziz – would appeal the conviction.

Aziz was alleged to have bribed a senior associate athletic director at USC in order to help his daughter get recruited by the USC basketball team and facilitate her admission to the university.

He is alleged to have paid a $300000 donation to USC’s gift account for the Galen Center the arena for USC’s basketball and volleyball programs and $20000 per month in payments to the senior associate athletic director.

Aziz a native of Egypt is currently listed as chairman and CEO of Legacy Hospitality Group according to his LinkedIn page.

The trial was the first stemming from the bribery scandal that was uncovered in 2019. Prosecutors and federal law enforcement officials filed hundreds of charges against 57 parents including Hollywood celebrities and wealthy financial executives alleging they had conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to fraudulently secure college placement for their children.

Forty-seven of the 57 defendants including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman have pleaded guilty to reduced charges paying fines with minimal jail time. The longest sentence any parent pleading guilty has received was nine months. Aziz was found guilty along with private equity firm founder John Wilson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZ2VvcmdldG93bmVyLmNvbS9ldmVudC9icnVuby1tYXJzLWF0LW5hdGlvbmFsLWhhcmJvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bruno Mars at National Harbor,"NATIONAL HARBOR Md.

The house doesn’t always win.

NFL bettors dealt Las Vegas sportsbooks their first losing week of the season on what was a big Sunday for popular public teams.

“We don’t win every week” Caesars Sportsbook vice president of trading Craig Mucklow said. “It’s nice to give back once in a while.”

Favorites are 9-6 ATS in Week 5 — their first winning week of the season — after the Bills beat the Chiefs 38-20 on “Sunday Night Football.” Bettors won big as the Packers Buccaneers Titans Cowboys and Cardinals all covered the spread.

“It was by far the worst day of the year” MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said.

The victorious Bills (+3) and over (57) was the worst-case scenario at Caesars which suffered a multiple seven-figure loss.

“Because it’s prime-time parlay liability” Mucklow said. “The Bills were a sexy pick.”

Buffalo and over also increased BetMGM’s loss to almost seven figures with Green Bay’s wild 25-22 overtime win accounting for a big chunk of that.

Stuck in the middle

Books got middled or lost on both sides after the Packers opened as 3½-point favorites and the line closed at -2½.

“The worst-case scenario was the Packers winning by 3” Stoneback said. “Early sharp money came in on the Bengals +3½ and all the public money was on the Packers -2½ and everybody won.”

It was the heaviest bet game of the day at Caesars where bettors had $275000 on under 50 and seven figures of action on Cincinnati including $300000 on the money line $500000 +3 and $500000 +3½.

“If the Bengals would’ve won it would’ve been a bloodbath” Mucklow said.

After Cincinnati rallied to tie the game late in regulation the teams combined to miss five straight field goals in the last 2:14 of regulation and overtime.

Packers kicker Mason Crosby missed three in a row before he finally delivered a 49-yard game winner.

“Our hearts were in our mouths on that game” Mucklow said. “The trading room got loud very quickly. On every missed field goal it was crazy.”

Rising Arizona

Arizona (5-0) remained the NFL’s only unbeaten team after it defeated the 49ers 17-10 as 6-point favorites.

“That’s the sign of a good team that the Cardinals don’t have to win a shootout every week” Red Rock Resort sportsbook director Chuck Esposito said. “They can win a low-scoring game as well.”

Caesars took three big bets on the under (48½) and major wagers that cashed on the Cardinals’ first half and 49ers’ second half.

“That cost us just short of a million with all those winning” Mucklow said.

How ’bout them favorites

■ Dallas is the league’s only 5-0 team ATS after it whipped the Giants 44-20 as a 7½-point home favorite.

■ Tampa Bay easily covered the biggest spread of the day in a 45-17 rout of Miami as an 11-point favorite.

■ Tennessee (-4) rolled to a 37-19 win and cover over winless Jacksonville (0-5).

“It was a rough day for us. We didn’t get any upsets” Westgate SuperBook vice president Jay Kornegay said. “It was not a disaster but it was a pretty heavy punch.”

Great escapes

The Raiders helped books escape further damage in their 20-9 loss to the Bears who produced the day’s biggest upset as 5½-point underdogs at Allegiant Stadium.

“That’s the one game that really saved us” Kornegay said.

The Vikings saved 1343 $1000 entries in the Circa Survivor contest from elimination when Greg Joseph made a 54-yard field goal as time expired to give Minnesota an unlikely 19-17 win over the winless Lions.

Detroit (+10) erased a 10-point deficit in the final 2:30 and led 17-16 after new coach Dan Campbell successfully called for a go-ahead 2-point conversion with 37 seconds left.

New England bailed out 443 Circa Survivor entries when it rallied from a 22-9 hole at Houston in a 25-22 win. But the Patriots (-8) were one of five favorites that didn’t cover.

According to a report by The Australian the sale and leaseback option – which is reminiscent of the “asset light” strategy recently pursued by US casino giant MGM Resorts – would see Star retain a majority 51% stake in its Sydney property while paying around AU$120 million to AU$130 million (US$88 million to US$95 million) in rent annually to the new owner of the remaining 49%.

The plan is seen as a means of raising additional capital to fund its Sydney expansion plans which include development of a luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel tower and potential purchase of 1000 new gaming machine licenses.

Star has reportedly hired Credit Suisse to oversee the process.

The company’s Chief Financial Officer Harry Theodore told The Australian “We see the potential to unlock value from our property assets via a sale and leaseback or similar transaction.

“Transactions of this nature have become prevalent in the US casino market including some large deals this year in Las Vegas. It demonstrates a strong appetite from property investors for prop co transactions.

“The Star has initiated a formal process to explore those same opportunities.”

Star had previously hinted at potential sale and leaseback opportunities when it submitted a proposal to merge with the other major player in Australia’s casino market Crown Resorts in May. The company later withdrew its proposal due to uncertainty around Crown’s future pending the outcome of a Royal Commission into Crown Melbourne’s suitability to retain a casino license.

The recommendations of that Royal Commission are due to be handed down this week however Star has stated the door remains open to revisiting a merger should Crown either retain its Melbourne license and be offered a path back to suitability as was the case with its Crown Sydney development.

US hedge fund giant The Blackstone Group has also been named as a potential suitor to acquire the 49% stake Star is currently offering. Blackstone already holds a 9.99% interest in Crown it acquired from Macau’s Melco Resorts last year and has recently been involved with sale and leaseback deals for Las Vegas icons MGM Grand and the Bellagio among others."

Industry officials have separately called for a pan-European electronics strategy but until a recent EU proposal becomes concrete legislation the long-term effects on military programs may prove difficult to gauge.

EU leaders recently announced the European Chips Act meant to support increased research design and testing capacity as well as ensure national investments are coordinated with those of the broader union.

“The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem including production that ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her Sept. 15 state of the union address in Strasbourg France. The ultimate goal is to increase Europe’s global share of semiconductor production to 20 percent by 2030 per the commission .

Digital technology is the “make-or-break issue” facing the European market today and “there is no digital without chips” she said. While the global demand for semiconductors has exploded the European share of designing and manufacturing those microchips has diminished and nations have largely become reliant on Asian-made products she noted.

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global microchip shortage that prompted other governments including the United States to introduce a domestic semiconductor strategy as the chips enable systems in virtually every sector from the military to health care and from computers to clean energy.

Nations are developing interconnected highly software-enabled platforms to operate in increasingly joint environments and “digitalization” has become a buzzword across the global defense sphere. In Europe those platforms include the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System program that would ultimately feature a next-generation fighter unmanned drones and a slew of sophisticated sensors and weaponry all interconnected with each other.

Meanwhile NATO has highlighted “ emerging and disruptive technologies” as a key focus area for the alliance. Many of the technologies it cited will rely on digitalization.

The United Kingdom Sweden and Italy are also co-researching and developing cutting-edge technologies to enable sixth-generation air combat platforms under their own initiative dubbed Tempest by the British. Industry and government officials involved in that effort were asked about domestic electronics sourcing during a panel discussion at the biennial DSEI conference in London last month which took place the same day as von der Leyen’s speech.

A conference attendee asked whether the British-led effort would rely on European-sourced and -manufactured parts rather than Chinese or American electronics. Richard Berthon director of future combat air for the British Defence Ministry said his team will access the global market for parts “where it’s cost-effective [and] where our sovereignty and security are not impaired.”

Berthon emphasized that the program office is taking security “incredibly seriously” and that the entire Tempest enterprise “is all about ensuring that for the U.K. we’ve got the technology we need the skills we need that we can secure those and we can sustain them over time.”

Another panelist Saab Deputy chief executive Anders Carp called for a “pan-European or pan-Western strategy” to help governments and their industry partners prioritize key technology research and development efforts. Saab represents Swedish industry participation in the British-led aircraft push.

The electronics sourcing conversation is broader than just one such technology initiative — or the fighter aircraft portfolio — and could encompass some other mix of trusted allies and partners Carp noted. However it’s organized “there should be some sort of strategy in place to look at how do we make sure that we don’t end up being reliant on someone ... that we don’t want to be reliant on or may not want to be reliant on in the future” he said in an interview with Defense News.

When it comes to the broader Tempest effort industry partners are discussing these issues “at a headline level” as the program’s design phase remains in the study stages Carp noted.

Multiple European industry representatives declined to comment on the European Chips Act citing the recent nature of the initiative. The EU has yet to announce when the European Chips Act might be formally unveiled or voted on.

Thierry Breton the European commissioner for internal markets laid out proposed elements of the effort in a Sept. 15 LinkedIn post  including building European-based fabrication plants and establishing a European semiconductor fund.

With 27 EU members there will be divergent opinions involved in developing the legislation and “a lot of different interests on the ground level” said Dan Darling a senior analyst for Forecast International a U.S. market intelligence firm.

The focus on domestic semiconductor sovereignty makes sense but the EU needs to move from “a declaration of vision and intent” to actual momentum he said. Europe is home to a plethora of defense electronics companies and a domestic supply of resources is sure to trickle up eventually he added.

That being said European defense contractors have established business relationships with overseas chip suppliers — such as Samsung in South Korea and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — not the existing suppliers on their own continent said Franz-Stefan Gady a cyber space and future conflict fellow at the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies.

“At the moment European advanced semiconductor manufacturers produce low-volume niche products with limited military applicability” he told Defense News. Some such niche products could make headway in Europe like those related to aerospace sensors or security chips for crypto processing and other cybersecurity technologies.

But it’s unlikely European chipmakers would supply individual European nations’ defense industries over the next two decades as the expense would be too great even with strong political will behind the effort Gady added.

“There is no real market and very little genuine demand from the European defense industry for indigenous European products en masse despite paying lip service to the concept of strategic autonomy” he said.

Von der Leyen who previously served as Germany’s defense minister acknowledged in her speech that boosting sovereign semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will be a “daunting task” but one required at this point in time to support both European competitiveness and technological sovereignty.

“Let’s put all of our focus on it” she said.

Some automakers like Cadillac are opting not to put new safety features on cars because the global microchip shortage is causing shortages. Consumer Reports says Cadillac has temporarily suspended its Super Cruise driver assistance system in new Escalade SUVs. Customers have asked us if Subaru will stop putting its EyeSight driver-assist system on the newly-refreshed 2022 Forester and other models.

Consumer Reports says manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover Mazda Nissan Subaru and Toyota say that ""although the chip shortage is having an impact on overall vehicle production they’re not limiting features as a way to deal with the problem.”

Subaru of America responded to CR and said the chip shortage will not affect the availability of its EyeSight safety technology on the new 2022 Forester 2022 Outback and other models.

Subaru of America told CR “The chip shortage has impacted our overall vehicle production but we have not reduced the availability of our advanced safety features including the EyeSight driver-assist system on any of our models.”

Subaru offers EyeSight as standard equipment on every trim level of the 2022 Forester 2022 Outback 2022 Ascent and 2022 Legacy. The Japanese automaker offers EyeSight on most trim levels of Crosstrek Impreza WRX and BRZ models. They also provide a new fuel-saving feature.

The fuel-saving feature called Auto Stop-Start is a new technology that customers wouldn’t mind if Subaru would withhold or suspend from its new models because of the microchip shortage.

Customers are not thrilled with Subaru’s Auto Stop-Start engine feature that automatically shuts off the engine every time the car stops at a stop sign or you wait at a traffic light. It’s designed to save fuel but customers don’t like how it works.

The frequent starting and stopping of the engine are tiresome to some drivers especially those who live in urban areas who commute in heavy stop-and-go traffic every day. Many Subaru Forester Outback Crosstrek and Ascent owners say they don’t like the car stopping and starting because it shakes the car every time the engine starts back up.

There is a way to shut the Auto Stop-Start feature off. You can read the full report here and check out the video below.

Subaru of America has said they will not limit the availability of EyeSight or any other safety technology on new models like the 2022 Forester. But some automakers are temporarily suspending some high-tech features so they can get new cars on dealers’ lots.

Many high-growth tech stocks doubled in value in 2020. That's not normal. It usually takes a bit more time for a stock to rise that much even for an especially fast-growing business with an in-demand product or service. 2021 has been a different story. Many of these outperforming stocks of 2020 have taken a breather some of them even declining by double-digit percentages.

Nevertheless that doesn't mean growth investing is dead. On the contrary many of them still offer compelling reasons to invest today. Three that could double over the next four years or so are Skyworks Solutions (SWKS -0.05%) Micron Technology (MU 2.91%) and T-Mobile US (TMUS -0.29%). Here's how three Fool.com contributors think it could play out.

An ever expanding need for high-quality mobile connectivity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Skyworks Solutions): The last couple of years have been busy ones for mobile connectivity chip designer Skyworks Solutions. The initial 5G mobile network rollout from telecoms translated into booming sales of new smartphones with a 5G connection-enabling chip in them. Sales at Skyworks are fast on the rise as a result up 41% over the last two-year stretch -- impressive considering sales briefly hit the skids last spring.

5G phones will no doubt continue to provide some upward momentum for Skyworks in the next three years as more of the next-gen mobile network becomes available to the masses. But Skyworks is much more than a smartphone component supplier. It also plays a hand in the design of infrastructure equipment used to build telecommunications systems as well as the design of other devices that contain connectivity semiconductors: things like smart home devices audio equipment internet modems and routers fitness equipment and security systems.

The market for chips for products outside of smartphones -- which Skyworks calls its ""broad markets"" business -- has been steadily growing for years and makes up about one-third of revenue. But it will get a big boost in this department from the acquisition of Silicon Laboratories' (SLAB -2.63%) automotive and network infrastructure segment. The acquisition will add about $400 million a year in sales at the most recent annualized run rate and yield Skyworks exposure to some massive new markets specifically the growing connected and electric auto movement.

With its own core business still growing at a fast double-digit percentage clip adding a new breed of chip designs into the mix should help Skyworks sustain its momentum. Granted as is the case with semiconductor stocks I don't expect this advance to move up in a straight line. Chip industry sales are cyclical and can ebb and flow from year to year. But over the next few years 5G will continue to proliferate and dozens of more technologically advanced vehicle models will hit the road. I see plenty of room for this chip company to grow -- it could be double the size it is now in another four years' time.

Micron shares trade at an oversize discount today

Anders Bylund (Micron Technology): Memory chip maker Micron Technology has seen some hard times lately. Let me clarify that. Micron's stock is in dire straits at the moment. The business is as healthy as ever.

Micron generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow and $12.6 billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the last four quarters. These generous profits were generated from $27.7 billion of top-line revenue. All of these important metrics have surged higher in the last two years:

Micron set many operating records in the recently completed fiscal year 2021. Mobile memory sales reached new highs. Automotive and industrial memory chips also topped their old record sales by significant margins. Even the consumer-facing business landed record sales this year.

All of these records were achieved in the midst of a sector-wide manufacturing crisis. Micron runs its own chip-making plants which helps the company dodge the logjam in the leading contract manufacturing specialists' production pipelines. Production technology upgrades are generally on time and within Micron's generous infrastructure budgets.

So Micron's operations are humming right along while most of the semiconductor industry suffers production-level restrictions. Market makers must be impressed right?

Well no. Micron's stock has retreated nearly 30% from April's multi-year highs and trades at a mere 7.9 times forward earnings. In other words Micron's shares are hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin despite the company's impressive business results. The company will set the record straight over time and I will be amazed if share prices haven't at least doubled from this rock-bottom level in the next three years.

This 5G leader should have little trouble doubling in the years ahead

Billy Duberstein (T-Mobile): When you think of large telecom stocks you don't normally think of big-time gains. Yet that's exactly what investors should see if T-Mobile hits its long-term financial targets as a result of its leadership in 5G.

T-Mobile's stock has fallen recently following an unfortunate data breach and the stock is currently down about 16.5% from recent highs. But as the news around the data breach falls further into the past it sets T-Mobile stock up to potentially double in the next four years.

In fact it wouldn't even take a herculean effort for the stock to double by 2025. At its March analyst day management raised its long-term forecasts having grown even more bullish on both revenue and cost synergies stemming from the 2020 acquisition of Sprint.

That integration takes some upfront investment so T-Mobile's profits and free cash flow are muted at the moment; however management now sees $13 billion to $14 billion in free cash flow by 2023 to 2024 and over $18 billion in free cash flow by 2026.

Assuming $18 billion in free cash flow -- the low end of T-Mobile's target -- and just a 15 P/E ratio in 2025 one could see T-Mobile trading at a market cap of $270 billion up about 75% from today's share price. However T-Mobile also plans to return $60 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases by 2025. That's nearly 40% of T-Mobile's market capitalization today.

Of course T-Mobile's share price will likely go up as repurchases are made and the share count declines; however even if T-Mobile retires only 20% of its shares outstanding compounded with a 75% increase in market cap its share price would appreciate about 118%.

Skeptics would point out that T-Mobile's rivals Verizon Communications and AT&T have forward P/E ratios of just 10 and 8.5 respectively. However those bargain-basement valuations could reflect the fact that T-Mobile has taken the lead in 5G capabilities and appears set to gain market share from each in the years ahead. Both Verizon and AT&T also pay out dividends instead of repurchasing stock and both companies also have more sizable debt loads by comparison.

With the overall market's forward P/E multiple around 21.5 today it's not unreasonable to use 15 for an industry leader like T-Mobile. And given that T-Mobile has a history of beating its own forecasts a doubling in its share price by 2025 is not only possible but I think likely.",,,,,,,,,

The Surface Pro hadn't received a full update since October 2019 when the Pro 7 was introduced. That seems like eons ago -- and even then it didn't change much from the Surface Pro 6.

Earlier this year Microsoft did introduce the Surface Pro 7 Plus for Business. However it has the same design as the Pro 7 but with 11th-gen Intel processors and Windows 10 Pro. There's also the 13-inch Surface Pro X that uses a custom Arm-based chipset from Microsoft instead of an Intel processor. With Windows 11 now available though this is a good time to update it inside and out and that's what we got.

While the Surface Pro 7 is no longer in the lineup you'll still be able to buy one -- likely at a discount -- until retailers sell through their stock. Microsoft is keeping the Surface Pro 7 Plus around and will have a consumer version of it with Windows 11 Home for those who want a ""classic Surface Pro.""

Watch this: Microsoft's new Surface Pro 8 is the flagship for Windows 11 05:44

A larger faster display

The Surface Pro 8 is essentially a mashup of the Pro 7 Plus and Pro X; it's the same-ish body of the 13-inch Pro X with the processors of the Pro 7 Plus. The Pro 8 is thicker and heavier than the Pro X but not by much. Since the Pro 7 and Pro 7 Plus are built around a 12.3-inch display the 13-inch Pro 8 is larger than that model too.

Although the Surface Pro 8 display is the same size and resolution as the Pro X the Surface Pro 8's screen has a refresh rate that goes up to 120Hz which should make writing and drawing on the display a smoother experience (and gaming too). When the extra speed isn't needed it can drop to 60Hz to save battery life.

Buh-bye USB-A; hello Thunderbolt 4

With the move to 11th-gen Intel processors Microsoft added not one but two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports. This makes it easier than ever to connect external displays directly to the Surface Pro as well as giving you high-speed data transfers and more expansion options with a dock or hub. And even though Microsoft still uses its proprietary Surface Connector for the power adapter you can charge the Pro 8 via the USB-C ports.

Of course with the addition of the USB-C ports something had to go: There is no more good ol' USB-A port on the Surface Pro 8. Microsoft also did away with the microSD card slot for expanding storage. The two-in-one does offer a removable SSD option though it is a short M.2 2230 drive. Still it's an option down the road if you need more physical storage.

New keyboard new pen; neither are included

As you might expect the increased screen size of the Surface Pro 8 means the keyboard cover from the Pro 7 won't fit. If you're upgrading to the Pro 8 you'll need a new keyboard cover too. Microsoft did develop a new one for the Pro 8 that has a spot at the top to hold and charge the new Surface Slim Pen 2.

Like past Surface Pro models the keyboard cover isn't included with the Surface Pro 8. Neither is the pen. They are not cheap. The keyboard alone is $180 the pen is $130 and bundled together they're $280. At least the kickstand is built into the body of the Pro 8 so you don't have to buy a separate cover for that function.

A lot more time to work create and play

While the 11th-gen Intel Core processors will certainly boost performance over the Surface Pro 7's 10th-gen chips it'll also give you much better battery life. True it helps that the Surface Pro 8 also has a larger battery pack. But according to Microsoft's numbers the Pro 7 Plus using the same size battery as the regular Pro 7 gets up to 15 hours of battery life compared to the Pro 7's 10.5 hours. The Pro 8 will run for up to 16 hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGFwdG9wLXN0dWRpby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio Review: Surprisingly Adept,"Microsoft's Surface Laptop Studio is a laptop that's also a media center and tablet all rolled into one. It's designed to be your workstation video gaming center Netflix screen and sketching slate. That's a tall order and tackling too many use cases is often a recipe for succeeding at none of them.

But the Surface Laptop Studio surprises. It's not perfect but it's pretty good at all of those tasks. It's a shame the operating system it runs keeps it from excelling.

Design Chops

Apple gets all the design credit but Surface devices really cemented the hybrid laptop-tablet concept which is now a billion-dollar business for Microsoft and has been picked up by Dell Lenovo and others.

The Surface line remains the leader though and the new Surface Laptop Studio continues the tradition of successful Surface experimentation. Exactly where Microsoft is headed with this device isn't entirely clear but the Studio is at the very least the best-performing Surface available and the unusual design mostly works. Unlike the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Go 3 the screen doesn't detach from the keyboard.

Photograph: Microsoft

The first thing you notice about the Laptop Studio is that the keyboard hangs about a quarter inch over a recessed base. The extended upper surface—the same level as the keyboard—is where all the Studio's ports live. Two grills sit on either side of the recessed base. It looks somewhat bizarre when you first pull it out of the box but it's not all that noticeable when the Studio is sitting on a flat table.

Carrying it around does feel very different than any laptop I've ever used but despite the odd design this is a very good-looking machine. The silver magnesium/aluminum shell reminds me of the Macbook Pro but the Surface has a slightly chunkier feel to it. The rounded corners also feel fitting with the more rounded interface in Windows 11.

The comparison to the MacBook Pro is also apt in the sense that this is not a svelte lightweight Surface that doubles as a tablet. This is a powerhouse laptop that happens to fold down to a completely flat tablet-like screen. At 4 pounds you aren't going to use this the way you'd use an iPad or a Surface Go but that might be OK because you have significantly more processing power at your disposal.

If you've ever tried to for example create or work with a complex multilayer document in an Adobe app on the iPad and found it wanting you're one of the people most likely to enjoy the Surface Laptop Studio.

All the World’s a Stage

Opened up as a laptop the Surface Laptop Studio looks just like well a laptop. To move the Surface into Stage Mode you pull the bottom half of the lid forward so that it covers the keyboard until you feel it lock in place with a satisfying magnetic click. The hinge is a complicated affair from an engineering viewpoint but it's surprisingly easy to use once you get the hang of it. It does require two hands to move though.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy90ZWNoLW5ld3MvMjAyMS0xMC0xMC90eS1hcnRpY2xlL3RoZS1wcm9ibGVtLXdpdGgtbWljcm9zb2Z0cy1tYXNzaXZlLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wbGFucy1pbi1pc3JhZWwvMDAwMDAxN2YtZWI1ZC1kNGNkLWFmN2YtZWI3ZDc3YzMwMDAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Problem With Microsoft’s Massive Expansion in Israel - Tech News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.haaretz.com', port=443): Read timed out.

In a first-of-its-kind victory for the right-to-repair movement Microsoft has agreed to take concrete steps to facilitate the independent repair of its devices following pressure from its shareholders.

On Monday Microsoft and the investor advocacy nonprofit As You Sow reached an agreement concerning a shareholder resolution As You Sow filed in June urging the tech company to analyze the “environmental and social benefits” of making device repair easier. After months of negotiations Microsoft has agreed to comply—and then some. Not only will the company study how increasing access to the parts and information needed for repair can reduce its contributions to climate change and electronic waste it has also agreed to act on the findings of that study by the end of next year.

This is the first time a US. manufacturer has agreed to change its repair policies following investor pressure. But it might not be the last: In September Green Century a mutual fund company focused on environmentally responsible investing filed two similar right-to-repair resolutions one with Apple and another with Deere & Co. the agricultural equipment manufacturer best known for the John Deere tractor.

Collectively these resolutions represent a new front in the right-to-repair fight one that explicitly links corporate environmental responsibility to repair policies. The battle is being led by shareholder organizations that have had success pressing companies for greater transparency on climate change. For instance As You Sow has previously convinced the major utility Duke Energy to disclose the methane emissions associated with its natural gas infrastructure and pressed Twitter to report its carbon footprint.

When consumers are unable to fix their devices quickly and cheaply they’re more likely to buy new ones and that has consequences for the planet.

“We’ve seen shareholder resolutions become a significant tool for climate activists” Kerry Sheehan the U.S. policy director at the repair guide site iFixit told Grist. “We’re seeing it get adopted in the repair context as well in part because these are very connected.”

When consumers are unable to fix their devices quickly and cheaply they’re more likely to buy new ones and that has consequences for the planet. A significant fraction of the carbon emissions associated with the devices we own—81 percent in the case of Apple’s new iPhone 13—occur during manufacturing. Replacing our stuff before we need to causes those emissions as well as the pollution natural resource use and land degradation associated with extracting and refining raw materials to multiply. In the case of consumer electronics it also leads to more toxic e-waste.

Despite the environmental benefits of using our stuff as long as possible companies like Microsoft Apple and Deere make extended use difficult by restricting access to parts manuals and software tools needed for repair and by designing products that aren’t easy to fix. These corporations also have a history of lobbying against bills that would make independent repair more accessible.

Kelly McBee the waste program coordinator at As You Sow started intensively exploring the issue of electronic waste several years ago. After learning that Microsoft was actively contributing to the crisis through its restrictive repair policies she reached out to the company to have a “good faith conversation” in May. It didn’t go well.

“The company presented a very antagonistic view of repair” McBee said adding that Microsoft’s legal counsel told her they didn’t see “any connection between improved sustainability and repairability.”

But after As You Sow filed its shareholder resolution in June which garnered media attention and raised awareness among Microsoft’s investors McBee says the company’s attitude shifted dramatically.

“Microsoft came back with different legal counsel and representatives on the line and said ‘We are really changing our tune on this issue we think this study is a great idea let’s work together to make this change’” McBee said. “Which is night and day.”

As You Sow has now agreed to withdraw its resolution with the company.* In exchange McBee says Microsoft has agreed to hire an independent consultant to study the benefits of increasing consumer access to parts and repair documentation including impacts on carbon emissions and waste. While the study will not be made public due to concerns over proprietary information Microsoft is required to publicly post a summary of its findings by the beginning of May 2022.

iFixit will be “closely watching” to see how Microsoft follows through and whether it changes its tune on right-to-repair legislation.

Based on those findings Microsoft has also agreed to make new parts and documentation available beyond its authorized repair network by the end of 2022. It has also agreed to launch new as-yet-unknown initiatives to facilitate local repair according to McBee.

Sheehan called the agreement between As You Sow and Microsoft a “step in the right direction” adding that iFixit will be “closely watching” to see how Microsoft follows through and whether it changes its tune on right-to-repair legislation. Nathan Proctor who heads the right-to-repair campaign at the nonprofit U.S. Public Research Interest Group noted that Microsoft is still a member of lobbying groups that oppose right-to-repair bills like the Entertainment Software Association.

“We really appreciate what they’re doing for this report but if they show up to kill right-to-repair bills there’s still more work to be done” Proctor said.

In response to questions about the agreement a Microsoft spokesperson told Grist that Microsoft is committed to meeting consumers’ needs and desires including device repairability. “We believe customers are entitled to repair options that are safe and reliable” the spokesperson said in an email. “We currently provide customers with repair services that ensure the high quality of repairs safeguard customers’ privacy and security and protect customers from injury.”

“As You Sow asked us to investigate the connections between our sustainability commitments and device repairability” the Microsoft spokesperson added. “It was a productive discussion and we have agreed to undertake that important study the results of which will be used to guide our product design and plans for expanding device repair options for our customers.”

McBee says she’s “very happy” with the agreement adding that she “hopes it has sway” on the Green Century resolutions currently before Apple and Deere. Like As You Sow’s resolution those proposals ask the two companies to evaluate the benefits of making tools and information needed for repair more accessible to consumers.

Green Century shareholder advocate Annalisa Tarizzo told Grist that over the past year the investment company has “grown concerned” that Apple and Deere’s antagonistic stances toward independent repair were harming the companies’ reputations and exposing them to regulatory risk. Many state legislatures are actively considering bills that codify the right to repair and in July the Federal Trade Commision or FTC vowed to “ramp up law enforcement” against illegal repair restrictions.

Apple has “very ambitious climate goals but that anti-repair stance really does not align with what they are presenting to the public.”

Apple has “very ambitious climate goals but that anti-repair stance really does not align with what they are presenting to the public” Tarizzo said. “And given Deere’s positioning in the market we were concerned that they could face some lawsuits.” Deere which has captured more than half of the agricultural equipment market in the U.S. doesn’t allow farmers to access diagnostic software needed to fix their tractors a policy that costs farmers money by forcing them to wait for a dealer to repair their equipment.

Apple and Deere didn’t respond to requests for comment on the shareholder resolutions filed by Green Century and Tarizzo couldn‘t offer details on the investment firm’s conversations with the companies. But she hopes that both “agree to make some substantial changes in their policies” in the coming months in which case Green Century will withdraw its resolutions before their respective shareholder meetings.

Otherwise the resolutions may be put to a vote at the companies’ annual shareholder meetings in early 2022. While shareholder resolutions are legally nonbinding Tarizzo says that typically when more than a third of corporate shareholders vote in favor of one “it sends a pretty strong signal to the company that they should probably address whatever issue the company voted on.” As the Microsoft resolution demonstrates even the prospect of such a vote can compel a company to take action.

These shareholder resolutions come as the grassroots right-to-repair movement continues to garner support from high places. In May the FTC came out strongly in favor of independent repair when it released a report that found “scant evidence” to justify manufacturer-imposed restrictions. In July President Biden issued an executive order asking the FTC to craft new rules that would address “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair.” Support for independent repair is also growing among lawmakers: A record 27 states have considered right-to-repair bills this year and in June a US representative from New York introduced the first-ever national right-to-repair bill targeting everything from computers to tractors.

Sheehan of iFixit sees shareholder activism as “part and parcel” of the right-to-repair movement’s expanding reach. Even if some of these resolutions fail to garner investor support or the companies being targeted don’t take aggressive enough action Sheehan believes that all manufacturers are “going to have to reckon with right to repair eventually.”

It’s made up of two sections: a top section that offers widgets for weather sports your latest photos and other personalized topics and a news section that offers clickable headlines from a variety of sources.

Here’s how to make the most of the current Windows 11 widgets.

Access your widgets

To access the widgets select the Widgets icon in the taskbar (it’s the one that looks like a square divided into white and blue sections). You can also hit the Window + W keys or if you’ve got a touchscreen swipe from the left.

You’ll probably see a variety of starter widgets on top that will give you info about sports scores the weather stock prices and any images you may have in your OneDrive account. There is also a search field and a button that lets you add new widgets. Under that you can scroll down to find a number of news sources.

Adjust your widgets

There are a variety of ways you can tweak your widget panel.

To move your widgets around long-press on the top of a widget until you see an open hand. (This is as opposed to a “pointing” hand which enables you to click on a link.) You can then change its position on the panel.

To change the size of a widget remove it from your panel or customize it click on the three dots in the upper right corner. The selections that you see will depend on the widget; for example the Weather widget can be small medium or large and you can customize it to set a default location and work either in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The Photos app meanwhile only sizes to medium or large and has no other customizations.

The three “More” dots let you adjust the size of the widget customize it or remove it.

Click on the name of the widget in the upper left corner and you will be taken to a separate page where you can access more information — more details on the weather for example or more of the latest sports scores.

If you want to see the current selection of widgets available click on the “Add widgets” button that is between your widgets and the news feeds. It’s not a large list right now — I counted 11 all available are Microsoft-produced. Hopefully however there will be additional third-party entries coming.

Windows 11 doesn’t yet have a great many widgets but that may change.

News feed

The news section is below the “Add widgets” button. It is headed by a “Top stories” section that highlights several headlines followed by individual stories. Both come with Facebook-like icons that you can attach to each story (including thumbs-up heart “surprised” “thinking” sad or angry).

You can “react” to each news item with an appropriate mood icon.

Select the three dots next to each headline and you can see more or fewer stories like that hide stories from that source save it for later (in other words bookmark it) or report it. Any bookmarked stories will have a gray square around those three dots.

Personalize your interests

The “Add widgets” button also offers a link (in the lower-left corner) that lets you tell the Widget app what you are and are not interested in. (You can get to the same place by clicking on the three dots next to a news story and select “Manage interests.”)

You can influence what shows up in your news feed.

Either way you’ll end up on the Microsoft Start page — essentially the settings page for the Edge browser. Using the “My Interests” tab you can tell Windows what types of news stories you want or don’t want. On the left side of the page you can choose from categories such as News Sports Travel Health etc.; as you click on each of those categories you’ll get a list of specific topics in the main window. For example if you select “Entertainment” you can choose from topics such as “Celebrities” “Music” or “Books” among others.

Other tabs you can choose from include “Profile” (which introduces you to what is called the “Microsoft News Community”) “My Saves” (any stories you saved) “History” (a list of stories you’ve read within the last 48 hours) and “Experience Settings.” You may want to visit this last: it lets you choose the language of your feed (the default is English) or toggle several features on and off including those Facebook-like reaction icons. You can also toggle off some of the basic information cards such as finance or weather.

If you’re not in the mood for community reactions you can remove them."

Around one million doses of Moderna's vaccines have been sent to low-income countries.

The company has been accused of focusing on profit The New York Times reported.

Moderna told the Times it has limited production capacity and is fulfilling existing orders.

Poorer countries have received significantly fewer doses of Moderna's vaccine compared to wealthier nations The New York Times reported.

Data from Airfinity a firm that tracks vaccine shipments showed only about a million of Moderna's vaccine doses have gone to low-income countries compared to 8.4 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and around 25 million of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine.

The Times also reported that a few middle-income countries have had to pay more for the vaccine than the United States while others like Botswana have made deals with Moderna but have yet to receive their doses and others like Tunisia haven't even been able to get in touch with Moderna.

Moderna's vaccine appears to offer better protection compared to Pfizer's and Johnson & Johnson's over time Insider previously reported. Data collected from hospitals in 20 cities showed that after four months Moderna's vaccine was 92% effective at preventing hospitalizations. During the same period Pfizer's effectiveness had dropped to 77% and Johnson & Johnson's to 68%.

In a press release the company said: ""From the beginning our goal has been to help protect as many people as possible around the globe. To date more than 250 million people have been vaccinated globally with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. However we recognize that access to vaccines continues to be a challenge in many parts of the world. So we remain focused on implementing a comprehensive and always evolving strategy to ensure that low-income countries get access to our vaccine.""

According to Times executives said they're making as many doses as possible but their ""production capacity is limited"" and doses produced are going towards existing orders.

Dr. Tom Frieden a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told The Times the company is ""behaving as if they have absolutely no responsibility beyond maximizing the return on investment.""

In their press release Moderna said there were five ""pillars"" to expanding vaccine access:

Not enforcing the patent on their vaccine

A May 2021 agreement with COVAX to provide 500 million doses

Working with governments who plan to donate vaccines to COVAX

building a state-of-the-art mRNA facility in Africa but did not specify when

Investing to expand capacity to deliver an additional billion vaccines to low-income countries next year.

There's been a disparity overall in vaccination rates between wealthy countries and low-income countries. While more than 46% of the world's population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine that number is not evenly distributed with only 2.5% of people in low-income countries getting at least one dose.

Countries like the United Arab Emirates Portugal and Singapore lead the way with more than 80% of their populations fully vaccinated. Less than 1% of the population in countries like South Sudan Uganda and Ethiopia are fully vaccinated.

Moderna did not respond to Insider's email request for comment at the time of publication.

Scripps scientists have teamed with Moderna to develop and test an HIV vaccine that will use the same RNA technology employed against COVID-19.

After developing a COVID-19 vaccine in record time Moderna is teaming with scientists at Scripps Research in La Jolla to use the biotech’s technology to make shots against HIV the virus that causes AIDS.

A Scripps team is working with Moderna to test an HIV vaccine engineered to teach the immune system to make antibodies powerful enough to stop the virus. Researchers are using the same RNA vaccine technology that proved safe and effective against the COVID-19 coronavirus with an initial clinical trial set to begin in November.

The effort is made possible in part by years of work by San Diego scientists who have played a leading role in deciphering how the immune system responds to HIV — one of the world’s most complex and crafty viruses — and why most of the time those responses are weak and limited.

Though antivirals are widely available in wealthier countries there’s clear need for a vaccine researchers and advocates say. About one-third of infected people are not on any kind of treatment according to the World Health Organization often because of limited access to medication in lower-income nations. Last year 700000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses.

Every other HIV vaccine strategy in the past 40 years has failed or produced lackluster results. But observers say there’s cause for genuine albeit cautious optimism this time.

“I don’t know if Scripps has figured it out” said Mitchell Warren executive director of the nonprofit AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. “But we definitely want to follow the science and the science looks exciting right now.”

A problem gone viral

If scientists ever develop an HIV vaccine they’ll have to overcome decades of disappointment.

Vaccine efforts have flopped for a few reasons. One is that HIV covers up its most vulnerable spots. Just like the coronavirus HIV looks a bit like a spiky ball and the spikes allow the virus to grab onto cells and slip inside them. But HIV’s spikes are mostly hidden beneath a thicket of sugar molecules.

Another issue is that the virus mutates its genetic code with mind-boggling speed dwarfing the mutation rate of the coronavirus. The immune system tends to recognize the areas on the virus that change the most making the responses weak and short-lived. Any would-be vaccine must do much better according to Dennis Burton an immunologist at Scripps Research.

“That’s one of the great problems with HIV” he said. “It’s literally hundreds of thousands of different strains and you don’t know which one you’re going to be exposed to. So you need to be protected against them all.”

‘A long and winding road’

Dennis Burton chairman of the department of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and his team have spent years understanding how the immune system naturally responds to HIV — and why those responses are often too little too late. (K.C. Alfred / The San Diego Union-Tribune)

Burton’s team has taken an unorthodox approach to hunting for a vaccine. Rather than test a slew of candidates and hope one produces the right kind of immunity the researchers are taking cues from patients. Their goal is to find people whose immune systems produce unusually powerful counterattacks to the virus then design vaccines that do the same in those who have yet to be infected.

Anyone carrying the virus produces antibodies against it; in fact HIV is usually diagnosed with an antibody test. But Burton’s team has found that only 10 percent to 20 percent of patients produce so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies. These Y-shaped immune proteins latch onto the virus tightly enough and at the right spots to stop most strains from infecting. To do so the antibodies grip some of the few regions on HIV’s surface that don’t change because mutations there would cripple the virus’s ability to infect and spread.

Animal studies and a recent clinical trial have shown that infusing someone with high levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies could help them fight off the virus. That’s the same idea behind the convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapies now in use against COVID-19.

It’s a temporary and expensive way to protect people however as antibody treatments must be regularly administered intravenously. A much cheaper and longer-lasting solution would be to teach the body to make the antibodies.

But researchers now understand why that seldom happens naturally.

People with broadly neutralizing antibodies have usually been infected for about two years which is too late. That’s because HIV slips its genetic code inside our own within days of infection. This reservoir of viral DNA lies dormant but can be reactivated at any time triggering infected cells to churn out new viral copies. That’s why HIV-positive people must take antiviral medications throughout their lives.

Part of the issue is that the most powerful anti-HIV antibodies are only forged after a drawn-out process of cellular evolution. When an antibody-producing cell known as a B cell first recognizes a virus it divides over and over. Most cells in the body split into identical copies but newly activated B cells mutate their antibody-coding genes producing cells with different versions of the original antibody — a bit like musical variations on a common theme.

Some versions grab onto a virus better than others. The ones that latch on best survive while those that don’t die. It’s survival of the fittest on a microscopic scale.

This is a normal part of any immune response but broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies rely on it much more than usual.

“The fact that such antibodies exist shows that a vaccine is in principle possible” Burton said. “[But] it’s a long and winding road to get to broadly neutralizing antibodies. And we have to shorten that road into effectively three or four shots.”

A new shot at immunity

Bill Schief a protein design expert at Scripps Research has spent a decade trying to reverse-engineer an HIV vaccine. He and colleagues think any HIV vaccine must consist of multiple shots that guide the development of antibody-producing immune cells. (K.C. Alfred / The San Diego Union-Tribune)

Figuring out what goes into those shots is where protein design expert Bill Schief comes in.

Schief a trained physicist who left the University of Washington to join Scripps Research in 2011 is trying to reverse-engineer a vaccine from the antibodies Burton and others have discovered.

His team takes everything researchers have learned about the antibodies — such as where they latch onto the virus and their 3D shape — and uses algorithms to reconstruct what those antibodies looked like before they evolved into powerful weapons against HIV.

It turns out that the initial “baby” versions of the antibodies don’t attach to HIV very well. So simply injecting someone with a piece of the virus as is won’t work. Instead Schief said researchers need to inject a series of modified HIV proteins to guide the baby B cells as they mature into full-fledged virus blockers.

Scientists tested the first step of this process in a trial of 48 participants 12 of whom got a placebo injection while the 36 others were inoculated with a protein meant to activate B cells with broad HIV-neutralizing potential. These cells are few and far between Schief said perhaps as rare as one of every million baby B cells. But researchers announced in February that 35 of the 36 vaccinated volunteers responded to the vaccine.

“My first reaction was ‘OK it can’t be this good. Something must be wrong in our analysis pipeline. We need to double-check this before we get too excited’” Schief said. “It wasn’t just a wimpy little small response that might or might not help later in a real vaccine. It was a big response.”

The results have not yet been published in a scientific journal. But the Scripps team working with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative a global nonprofit has already partnered with Moderna to test whether an RNA version of the vaccine can produce the same results.

Despite the success of COVID-19 vaccines using RNA won’t guarantee the HIV vaccine works. But researchers say it’s a faster cheaper and more efficient approach. Rather than manufacture vaccine proteins in a factory scientists will deliver genetic instructions to the billions of tiny protein-producing factories inside your body: your cells.

“It’s actually we think totally transformational in terms of our ability to learn how to develop an HIV vaccine through human clinical testing in a reasonable amount of time” Schief said.

Moderna’s trial which likely will begin in November will recruit 56 volunteers across Georgia Texas Washington D.C. and Washington state to test whether the results Scripps scientists reported earlier this year can be reproduced with an RNA version of the vaccine. Researchers also will give some participants a second shot eight weeks later meant to guide newly activated B cells toward the next step in producing broadly neutralizing antibodies.

“We know we can start” Burton said. “We now need to know that we can do the middle bit and that we can finish.”

He thinks it could take about five years to know whether this sequential strategy produces broadly neutralizing antibodies in people and longer to know whether those antibody responses prevent infection the ultimate goal. But using RNA makes the timeline years faster than it would be otherwise.

Advocates say the need for an HIV vaccine won’t go away regardless of how long it takes to get one.

“We need an HIV vaccine as desperately today as we’ve ever needed in 40 years of the pandemic” Warren said. “COVID hasn’t changed that.” ◆",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2ljZWxhbmQtc3VzcGVuZHMtdXNlLW9mLW1vZGVybmFzLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtZHVlLXRvLWhlYXJ0LWluZmxhbW1hdGlvbi1mZWFycy00MTkzMjTSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW9uZXdzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9pY2VsYW5kLXN1c3BlbmRzLXVzZS1vZi1tb2Rlcm5hcy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWR1ZS10by1oZWFydC1pbmZsYW1tYXRpb24tZmVhcnMtNDE5MzI0L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iceland suspends use of Moderna`s Covid vaccine due to heart-inflammation fears,"Iceland has decided to suspend Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine citing concerns of increased risks of cardiac inflammation.

""As the supply of Pfizer vaccine is sufficient in the territory ... the chief epidemiologist has decided not to use the Moderna vaccine in Iceland"" a statement published on the website of the Health Directorate read.

This decision has been taken at a time when more than 88 per cent (370000 locals) of the eligible population of ages 12 and above have already been fully vaccinated.

Iceland had been administering the additional dose of the Moderna vaccines to locals on an almost exclusive basis. The country had also been using additional dose of Janssen a single-dose serum by Johnson & Johnson for the elderly and people with weak immunity systems. These doses were being administered even on people who had received the first two doses of some another vaccine.

WATCH | This decision from Iceland has come a little after Sweden and Finland too suspended the use of Moderna vaccine for people under the age of 30. The reason behind the two countries suspending use of Moderna for under 30s has been the same — risk of inflammation of the myocardium the heart muscle and the pericardium the membrane covering the heart.

Denmark and Norway have imposed a complete ban of usage of the Moderna vaccine for everyone under the age of 18."

For the past twenty years and more Tiger Woods has emerged as the biggest star in golf. With his career earnings and other investments Woods is currently one of the richest athletes in the world. According to reports Woods earns millions a year and will continue to do so even if he doesn’t play golf.

Woods a child prodigy makes most of his money from his endorsements. Of course even with the PGA Tour Woods is the highest earner of all time. Both on and off the course the 45-year-old has earned himself a name and a lifetime’s worth of money. Let’s take a look at Woods’ endorsements and how much he earns in a year.

How much do Tiger Woods’ endorsements earn him in a day?

According to reports Woods is making $60 million in endorsements in one year. However that total is $45 million less than his highest total. Forbes also reported that the 15-time major winner made $105 with endorsements back in 2009 which included deals with brands like Accenture AT&T EA Sports Gatorade Gillette Golf Digest NetJets Nike Tag Heuer TLC Laser Eye and Upper Deck.

However Woods is also associated with companies like Bridgestone Discovery Communications Inc. Hero MotoCorp Monster Energy Nike Rolex TaylorMade and Upper Deck.

Of course endorsements like Nike Bridgestone and TaylorMade also tie in with his game. Upper Deck deals with sports cars and memorabilia whole Monster Energy is an energy drink he endorses. Additionally Woods also deals with Discovery Communications Inc. which owns Golf Digest and GolfTV.

How much did Woods make in golf?

For the past year Woods made $2.3 million in golf. That means his endorsement money makes up a whopping 90 percent of his total earning.

In a speech in Michigan on Tuesday and again in a speech back in Washington on Friday President Joe Biden touted the potential economic impact of his two major current legislative proposals: a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger still-being-negotiated Democratic reconciliation package that would expand the social safety net in various ways.

Biden said in Michigan that earlier this year “a Wall Street outfit called Moody’s projected that the investments in these bills could help our economy create an additional 2 million jobs per year every year. Two million per year. That’s going to bte transformative.”

On Friday Biden omitted the word “help.” This time he said that Moody’s Analytics projected that the bills would produce “an additional 2 million jobs per year.”

Facts First: Biden’s remarks were misleading – because he created the impression that Moody’s Analytics projected a much bigger jobs impact from his two new bills than Moody’s actually did. Contrary to Biden’s suggestion Moody’s did not find that the passage of the two bills would produce an additional 2 million jobs in each successive year. In other words Moody’s did not find that in 10 years the economy would have 20 million extra jobs because of Biden’s bills. Rather Moody’s found that in 10 years the economy would have 2.2 million more jobs if the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion spending package were passed than it would if they were not passed.

A White House official explained to CNN that Biden was referring not to an additive figure but to an average figure – the fact that Moody’s found that between 2022 and 2031 the average level of nonfarm employment would be nearly 2 million jobs higher if the bills were passed than it would be otherwise. Presented with this White House explanation Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said it was a valid way to assess the impact of economic legislation.

But Zandi still took issue with Biden’s own comments – saying they were likely to leave Americans with an inaccurate impression of what Moody’s found. In fact until he was sent the White House explanation Zandi – who co-authored the July report Biden was citing – himself did not understand Biden’s assertions about the report’s findings.

Zandi said of Biden’s words: “I would say they were incomplete. Or not well explained.”

This is the second Moody’s report this year that Biden has described misleadingly.

What Moody’s found

Here’s the problem with Biden’s description of the Moody’s data from July.

When Biden says that Moody’s found his bills would create “an additional 2 million jobs per year” and especially when he emphasizes the “every year” as he did in Michigan he makes it sound like Moody’s found that the passage of the bills would result in 10 million more jobs after five years than would exist if the bills didn’t pass or 20 million more jobs after 10 years than would exist if the bills didn’t pass.

But that’s not what Moody’s found.

Moody’s found that five years down the road in 2026 passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion reconciliation package would mean that 2.5 million Americans would have jobs who otherwise wouldn’t (157.2 million jobs with the two new bills and the American Rescue Plan that Biden signed into law in March versus 154.7 million jobs with the American Rescue Plan alone). And Moody’s found that 10 years down the road in 2031 passage of the two new bills would mean that 2.2 million Americans would have jobs who otherwise wouldn’t (161.4 million jobs with the bills versus 159.2 million jobs with the American Rescue Plan alone).

To look at the Moody’s report a different way: Moody’s found that the economy would add 12 million jobs between the first quarter of 2022 and the last quarter of 2031 if the two new bills were passed or add 9.9 million jobs if the two bills weren’t passed. That’s a gain of 2.1 million jobs over this period.

So what was Biden talking about when he spoke of Moody’s projecting an additional 2 million jobs “per year every year”?

The annual average the White House said.

The White House official noted that Moody’s found that on average in the years from 2022 through 2031 there would be nearly 2 million extra people employed with the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion reconciliation package than if these bills did not pass.

The White House math

Here’s how the White House calculated the average.

Moody’s found that in 2022 there would be 150.8 million people employed if the two bills were passed or 150.5 million people employed if the bills were not passed. That’s a difference of 300000 jobs.

Then in 2023 there would be 153 million people employed if the two bills were passed versus 152.1 million people employed if they were not passed. That’s a difference of 900000 jobs.

In 2024 the difference would be 1.5 million. In 2025 it would be 2.2 million. In 2026 it would be 2.5 million. In 2027 it would rise to its highest point 2.6 million. Then it would be 2.4 million in 2028 2.3 million in 2029 and again in 2030 and 2.2 million in 2031.

If you take the average of these annual differences from 2022 to 2031 you get 1.9 million. That’s close to the “2 million” number Biden used.

Still Biden did not explain that the “2 million” figure was the product of this kind of calculation.

Final analysis

If the President wants to communicate that on average over the next decade Moody’s found there would be about 2 million more people employed if his bills are passed than if his bills aren’t passed he can say that explicitly.

There’s one other key point here. As noted above these Moody’s estimates are based on the initial $3.5 trillion Democratic proposal for the reconciliation package. But it has been clear for weeks that the final reconciliation package will have to be made much smaller than $3.5 trillion – possibly less than half that size – to earn the necessary votes of two holdout Senate Democrats Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Zandi told CNN that a bill smaller than $3.5 trillion would have a smaller jobs impact than the one projected in the Moody’s report.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What Happened?,"Philly’s Housing Encampments of 2020 Led to a Nationally Celebrated Deal. Then It All Began to Unravel

It was supposed to be a historic agreement between the city and activists that would revolutionize the way Philly — and the country — dealt with homelessness. What happened?

Edwin Jones spent many of his days riding the El as it hummed over Philadelphia and his nights sleeping in 30th Street Station. Jones who has gone by “Beast” for nearly 50 years was homeless and had been ever since the city seized his mother’s West Philly home a couple years ago over unpaid taxes. It was hard but Beast got along by checking in with the city’s homeless services and connecting with childhood friends who were also unhoused.

Things changed for Beast and other Philadelphians experiencing homelessness last June when the George Floyd protests ripped through the city and the nation calling for an end to police violence and racial injustice. Beast supported the cause; he remembers standing behind police barricades and shouting at cops while they attacked the MOVE compound in 1978. But the weeks of unrest disrupted his life. Services paused while the city scrambled to respond so Beast couldn’t get food as easily or medical care for his diabetes and foot sores or even a shower. Eventually he’d had enough. One day at a march he confronted the protesters. He told them they were making his life worse than the police ever had and he pleaded with them to consider homeless people as they fought for justice.

After Beast’s impassioned speech he was approached by two men. Alex Stewart and James Talib-Dean asked if he might want to join their own protest. They weren’t homeless themselves but they wanted to bring more attention to the issue and the city’s ineffectiveness at addressing it. They told him that the city and the Philadelphia Housing ­Authority — PHA the public agency that builds and manages low-income housing in the city — owned thousands of vacant properties even as thousands slept on the streets or doubled up in single-family homes. It didn’t make sense. Stewart and Talib-Dean had a plan to build encampments of homeless people that would put Philly’s housing problems out in the open and give the city little choice but to act. “Y’all find a place” Beast told the two men “I’ll be there.”

And that’s how Beast joined a housing movement unlike anything Philadelphia has seen since 1988 when a group of homeless people took over a collection of vacant properties in the Northeast. The encampments that formed in the summer of 2020 off the Ben Franklin Parkway and in North Philly were organized armed with sophisticated knowledge of housing laws and squatting. They provided community and basic services with a kitchen a medical tent and a library. The protesters captured local and national attention throughout the summer. As they resisted the constant threat of eviction a black banner hung above their tents like a pirate flag proclaiming HOUSING NOW!

But what really set the encampments apart from similar movements was that they appeared to accomplish something major and tangible. In October 2020 after weeks of negotiations between representatives of the encampment the city and PHA the parties struck a legally binding agreement. Fifty vacant homes half from PHA and half from the city would be transferred to the encampment residents through a to-be-established community land trust. The city would also provide land and some funding for two villages of “tiny homes” that advocates hoped would serve as proof-of-concept projects to open the door for even more tiny homes across the city. And it was all supposed to happen fast.

The story of the encampment deal is changing. Rather than one of triumph it’s become one of negotiating naivete lack of execution government roadblocks and perhaps inevitable bureaucratic slow-rolling.

Academics housing activists and journalists nationwide celebrated the victory. The encampment protesters hadn’t solved homelessness but they had demonstrated it seemed a way to jump-start systemic change. A March 2021 article in the New Republic profiling one activist Jennifer Bennetch was titled “How Housing Activists Took on Philadelphia and Won.”

But in the year since the negotiators shook hands and the camps cleared very little of the deal has been accomplished. Once it seemed that the encampments and their protesters had created a new replicable model for housing-rights activism. But as time has passed the story of the encampments and the deal has gone from one of triumph to one of negotiating naivete lack of execution government roadblocks and perhaps inevitable bureaucratic slow-rolling. The obvious victims are the encampment residents who for a fleeting moment believed they had won — but so far have not.

If any city was ready for sweeping housing change it was Philadelphia. Its issues are severe yet relatively small compared to those in other major cities. Currently about 6000 people living in Philadelphia are considered homeless and about 1000 of them sleep on the streets each night. The numbers don’t mean much to those like Beast who wade through often dangerous overcrowded shelters or shut their eyes on the El but for comparison in Los Angeles roughly 41000 people are homeless and in New York the number is 80000.

Philly’s housing problems are deeper than homelessness though. This is the poorest big city in the country; some 23.3 percent of its citizens live in poverty. And for thousands of people the line between having a home and being homeless is razor-thin; affordable housing options are limited and the waiting list for homes through PHA is 82400 names long.

Despite its serious lack of affordable housing the city currently owns more than 5000 vacant properties — a collection amassed over decades through claiming of abandoned properties eminent domain and acquisition of tax-delinquent properties. The city aims to turn vacant property into affordable and relatively low-cost market-rate housing but has struggled to do so. Back in 2015 the city created the Philadelphia Land Bank to consolidate its land holdings and convey property to private ownership. The goal was to clean up a process that was convoluted and easily abused. Yet over the past five years the Land Bank has disposed of fewer than 350 properties according to officials. New legislation encourages the development of “workforce housing” intended for middle-income residents. Such units fit the technical definition of affordable housing — accessible to households earning up to 120 percent of the median area income — but are still out of reach for more than two-thirds of all Philadelphians. One of the Land Bank’s creators City Councilmember María Quiñones-Sánchez said recently “The Land Bank is still inefficient. It doesn’t have the capacity or willingness to process all of the pending applications” to buy city properties.

COVID made matters even worse. Between March and April of 2020 the city lost more than 100000 jobs. People were told to stay inside their homes while communal spaces for the homeless — shelters soup kitchens public buildings — shut down or restricted access. With nowhere else to go the city’s homeless increasingly gathered at the Convention Center and the airport. In March of 2020 despite CDC guidance that explicitly cautioned against it the city began clearing those informal encampments in the name of containing the spread of the virus. Some residents were accepted into the few open shelters or drug treatment centers but others were forced out on their own again. Into the spring Philly’s housing situation became desperate.

•

The foundations of the protest encampments that garnered so much press in the summer of 2020 were built well before that by five Philly activists who knew each other from the city’s small and well-connected housing activism community. Alex Stewart and James Talib-Dean the two men who approached Beast were leaders of a grassroots activist group called the Workers Revolutionary Collective. They were joined by Talib-Dean’s cousin Sterling Johnson who worked at the time with the Black and Brown Workers Co-Op. There was Jennifer Bennetch a formerly homeless Sharswood resident who gained prominence in 2019 for her Occupy PHA protest of the agency’s handling of vacant property and its policing practices. She worked closely with Wiley Cunningham another longtime Philly resident and housing advocate. Early in 2020 the activists began scouting out vacant properties seeing which of them were safe and livable and had electricity and running water. They helped people move in sub rosa — usually single mothers and their ­children — and regularly supplied them with necessities.

But when support swelled for the Black Lives Matter movement and the fight for racial equality in the wake of George Floyd’s murder some of the housing activists saw an opportunity to seize that momentum. It would require a change in strategy. No more working in the shadows. They would start an encampment.

Alex Stewart identified Von Colln Memorial Field as an ideal location. It’s a grassy baseball field on the Ben Franklin Parkway in the shadow of luxury apartment buildings a Whole Foods and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It would be impossible for the city to ignore the encampment and the contrasts it presented as wealthier Philadelphians shopped for groceries and tourists lined up across the street to take pictures with Rocky. They named the encampment Camp Maroon an homage to escaped slaves who built their own settlements and communities in the wilderness rather than integrate as free people into white society.

The encampment protesters first demanded that the city transfer ownership of vacant properties to a community land trust. Such a trust is typically organized as a nonprofit that takes title to multiple properties. Those properties are permanently removed from the market and instead leased back to community members at low (i.e. below-market-rate) prices via long-term agreements. Community land trusts have been used effectively in such cities as New York Oakland and Washington D.C.

The second demand called for a moratorium on the city’s acquisition and sale of additional properties because the protesters believed these transactions produced gentrified housing not low-cost options.

Camp Maroon protesters also demanded that the city allow them to self-fund and set up tiny homes in Philly. Across the nation tiny homes (literally very very small houses with an inside footprint of 100 to 400 square feet) have proven to be a cost-effective tool in combating homelessness but they’re not currently permissible under the city’s building codes. “We need a diversity of housing options [in Philadelphia] and I think tiny houses and the dignity and community associated with them will serve a portion of the population” says Stephanie Sena an anti-poverty fellow at Villanova’s Charles Widger School of Law and a tiny-homes advocate who worked closely with the encampment protesters. The land trust tiny homes and a moratorium would all work together to create the encampment protesters’ own maroon communities. The goals were clear and the encampments successfully grabbed Philadelphia’s attention. But privately dysfunction was brewing.

•

Tragically James Talib-Dean died of an overdose shortly after the encampment was built and Camp Maroon was renamed Camp JTD in his honor. His death say some protesters marked a shift. “When it started it was nice and quiet” Beast recalls of the camp’s early days. “As the summer progressed it got worse and worse.” Fights broke out among residents and tensions escalated between the encampment and the surrounding neighborhoods. The stress and emotions of that summer — from the protests and COVID to the growing fear that police would evict the encampment — all weighed on the residents and leaders. “We were broken” says Chelsea Dalsey an activist and a volunteer at the camp.

Deep fissures between the camp’s leaders and residents began to form threatening to undermine the movement. Jennifer Bennetch was a skilled intuitive leader of protest and agitation. But that didn’t necessarily translate to management of a prolonged encampment and negotiation. Of her organizing strategy Bennetch told the New Republic “I’m not a planner. I just do shit.” She clashed with encampment residents volunteers and other leaders. “People was questioning her motives” says Beast. “Everything with her was always ‘I did’ ‘I I I’ instead of us we or they.” Multiple sources said they found Bennetch to be intimidating and scary and said that she occasionally threatened others with violence. Bennetch acknowledges an incident in which she helped to physically remove a volunteer from the encampment but otherwise denies issuing threats or committing violence.

Bennetch left Camp JTD at the end of June to start a second encampment Camp Teddy in North Philadelphia. She and some others set up in the Sharswood neighborhood on a vacant PHA-owned lot across from its new $45 million headquarters (the site of her 2019 Occupy PHA protest). The Camp Teddy parcel had been designated by the PHA for an impending $52 million mixed-use development project that would include a shopping center and apartments.

Concerns with leadership went beyond Bennetch though. Sterling Johnson worked closely with Bennetch during the process. In a December 2020 Facebook video months after the encampments had been cleared three members of the BBWC accused Johnson of harassing someone working with the co-op and then of doxing a co-op member who was attempting to mediate the issue internally. Johnson says the allegations are all lies. Johnson and the BBWC split last fall.

Negotiations between the protesters and the city began over the summer and quickly became contentious. Bennetch leading the negotiations for the protesters was combative and at times stormed out of meetings people close to negotiations say. Alex Stewart described the talks as “screaming matches that really didn’t amount to anything.” He withdrew from negotiations after the first few meetings with the city and refocused on caring for residents at the camp. “It went terribly” says Tara Taylor a resident who had risen to a leadership position and later withdrew from negotiations as well.

Taylor and Stewart felt that Bennetch and Johnson were putting their own priorities over those of the residents. “We were talking about PHA police policies and harm reduction policies that were not addressing the immediate issues of the camp” Stewart says calling it a stark departure from the camp’s original vision. Ultimately a schism developed within leadership with Bennetch Johnson and Wiley Cunningham operating separately from Stewart Taylor and other activists. According to Stewart and Taylor Bennetch and Johnson sometimes called those opposing them white supremacists. (Bennetch is white.)

By the end of the summer talks stalled. But there was no time for an impasse. The PHA had a deadline to develop the land that Camp Teddy sat on and if it and Mosaic Development Partners the local firm contracted for the project didn’t break ground there by October 6th they would lose tax credits and lender financing; the project would likely be dead. Bennetch learned of the critical deadline too which gave her negotiating leverage.

According to reporting from the New Republic the encampment negotiations were revived in September when Kelvin Jeremiah PHA’s CEO called Bennetch secretly. Jeremiah offered to transfer nine vacant homes to the protesters’ yet-to-be-established community land trust. In the final agreement seven of the nine homes located in Strawberry Mansion were to be rehabbed with PHA funding. The offer included job training for residents policing reform and a moratorium on for-profit house sales. But according to the New Republic there were two big conditions: Camp Teddy would need to be cleared within four days and Bennetch was to keep the agreement confidential. Bennetch accepted the offer and moved the Sharswood protesters out over that weekend. Some were put into squats and others went down to Camp JTD.

Jeremiah reportedly followed the same playbook with Bennetch a week later when he made another secret offer this time regarding Camp JTD. In a conference call to her with Tumar Alexander the city’s managing director Jeremiah offered that in exchange for clearing the encampment in six days Bennetch would receive 25 more vacant houses from the PHA and 25 from the city all to be placed in the community land trust. In the final agreement the city also agreed to solicit proposals for two tiny-home villages — one of 10 to 12 self-contained units intended to be permanent affordable housing for homeless seniors and another 10 to 12 “pods” for people transitioning from homelessness with communal bathrooms and a kitchen. (A PHA spokesperson denied that Jeremiah demanded confidentiality in his dealings with Bennetch.)

Bennetch was overwhelmed with the magnitude of the decision. Tensions were high at Camp JTD and she didn’t know how much longer they could resist the growing threat of forcible eviction. Begrudgingly Bennetch says she took the deal. “We don’t feel like 50 houses is enough at all” she told me adding “We had to take the agreement and just hope the city keeps their word to reproduce it.” The final agreement between the city the PHA and the encampment was signed on October 12 2020.

Bennetch’s decision enraged some encampment residents and leaders. She says that after receiving Jeremiah’s offer she and her husband went from tent to tent; she believed she had the support of the majority of residents. But Beast says he found out about the deal while scrolling through news headlines on his phone and was angry at what they had settled for. “This is a bunch of bullshit” he told others at the time. To Tara Taylor the deal was “an absolute betrayal of the unhoused community.”

JTD residents were in shock. They would have to leave within six days while the 50 vacant units and the tiny homes wouldn’t be ready for months. Some argued over who should get the first properties since there wouldn’t be enough for everyone — reports said there were between 150 and 200 people at the encampment at peak occupancy. Still Bennetch moved quickly to clear everyone out. According to multiple people at Camp JTD one resident who worked closely with Bennetch went around the encampment and slashed tents with a knife to render them useless. (Bennetch says no one instructed the resident to slash tents.)

A fortunate group of nearly 50 residents was accepted into a pilot program with the Office of Homeless Services that was established as part of the negotiations. The Street to Home program gave its participants housing from the private market and two years of rental assistance. But most of the encampment protesters left the Von Colln field for shelters or vacant squats — or headed back to the streets.

•

One year later no homes have been transferred to the community land trust. And the city bureaucracy and private involvement that often distort good intentions have altered the tiny-homes project drastically from the original vision.

Stephanie Sena jokes that she’s gotten so frustrated with it all that she falls asleep like Arya Stark from Game of Thrones repeating the names of those who’ve helped fuel Philly’s growing housing crisis. Sena the Villanova law school fellow founded the Student-Run Emergency Housing Unit of Philadelphia (SREHUP) in 2011. It’s an emergency homeless shelter system operating in several locations across the city.

She has become a prominent advocate for affordable housing solutions particularly tiny homes. Last summer she worked with the encampment organizers to strengthen and prolong their protest once suing the city to halt evictions at the site. Johnson Stewart and Taylor came over to her house now and then for dinner though not at the same time because of the conflicts among them. She and Jennifer Bennetch have an up-and-down relationship but worked together on strategy. As the Camp JTD organizers entered negotiations with the city Sena pushed to make tiny homes part of the final agreement.

Tiny homes are truly small with just enough space for a bed a kitchenette a bathroom and some storage. But small size has virtues; the units can be built modularly off-site quickly and at low cost. They can make efficient use of available land even small lots.

Stephanie Sena says she’s gotten so frustrated that she falls asleep like Arya Stark from Game of Thrones repeating the names of those who’ve helped fuel Philly’s growing housing crisis.

Although other major cities like Detroit and Seattle use tiny homes as part of their affordable housing solutions Philadelphia’s and Pennsylvania’s building codes currently don’t allow for them. The codes are older and outdated and also outlaw similar space-saving housing strategies like partitioned homes and accessory dwelling units. Sena’s goal was to build a tiny-home village under special exemptions from the city as a test pilot. If the village was successful Pennsylvania could look to it as a reason to update its building codes instantly unlocking affordable housing options citywide. She had support from state legislators and officials in the city’s Department of Licenses and Inspections. With the encampment deal Sena felt she’d finally landed the pilot opportunity she’d been looking for.

Since each village would target different populations the city delegated their management to separate agencies. The Office of Homeless Services assumed responsibility for the pod-like transitional units. (A city spokesperson says the city has contracted a developer for this project and plans to complete construction and begin occupancy in 2022.) The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) took control of the village of self-contained permanent units — the project Sena wanted to build.

The PRA tiny-homes project is led by Angel Rodriguez a senior vice president of land management at the Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation the parent organization of PRA. This fact worried Sena. Rodriguez is also the executive director of the Land Bank the same organization seen as slow and ineffective in recycling the city’s vacant properties back to communities.

The problems began immediately. In the encampment agreement signed last October the city agreed to issue a request for proposal (RFP) for the tiny-homes project within 10 business days. But when the RFP was finally issued in November it signaled to Sena that Rodriguez and PRA weren’t aligned with the spirit of the Camp JTD agreement. The first requirement listed in the RFP was that units be a minimum of 600 square feet and “must be developed based on current zoning.” While a 400-square-feet figure was crucial to the tiny-home advocate’s plans the figure appears nowhere in the final agreement. According to a PHDC spokesperson the larger size was chosen “in accordance with the Philadelphia Residential Code that is currently in effect.” With the bigger size Rodriguez and PRA weren’t allowing any special exemptions that might lead to a change in codes and unlock more housing as Sena had hoped; PRA wanted a one-off development. Those larger units would also be more expensive to build which defeated another main purpose of the tiny-home endeavor.

The land that PRA chose for the site a vacant lot in West Philly’s Mill Creek neighborhood has been undeveloped since PRA acquired it for $1 in 1965. The area has a history of sinkholes and cave-ins as well as significant environmental waste. But in a question-and-answer session with potential developers PRA stated that it wouldn’t provide environmental reports (which test for contaminants) or geotechnical reports (which test for soil and drainage conditions) for the site. Developers could conduct their own tests but the property was being offered “as is.”

And while city-sponsored redevelopment projects often include some sort of development subsidy or construction financing the RFP made clear none of that would be offered. The only financial incentive was two years of rent subsidies for the tenants paid by the city’s Office of Homeless Services.

Still Sena and her team scrambled to submit their bid by the deadline of December 11th. In the proposal Sena likened Philadelphia’s COVID-exacerbated housing crisis to the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. She described how San Francisco responded to the destruction by creating small cottages that still exist today arguing that Philadelphia had a similar opportunity to use a crisis to change how it housed Philadelphians in the future. Her organization SREHUP would partner with Philadelphia-based companies to build 12 units of roughly 300 square feet each. The one-story units would have a single bedroom a kitchenette a bathroom and a private patio. Six units would be fully wheelchair-accessible. The village would also have a small community center a shared outdoor kitchen and a communal laundry area. The houses would be built off-site each for between $40000 and $60000 funded by private donors. At the time of the submission several of the homes already had financial support; Sena intended to have the entire cost of the project committed before beginning construction.

Sena knew the smaller units strayed from what the RFP stipulated. She had consulted with the former head of the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections David Perri who advised her to submit designs that fit the building codes she wanted adopted not Rodriguez’s larger size. It didn’t seem like it would matter much if Sena veered from the RFP. At the time she told me “I believe we will win [the RFP] mostly because I’m fairly certain nobody else is applying for it. I think we’ll win on default.”

On March 9th three months after she submitted her proposal Sena got an email from Angel Rodriguez. “The PRA has determined that your bid did not meet threshold requirements” he wrote. “We are unable to extend an award to you.”

As it turned out another group did submit a response to the RFP — Mosaic Development Partners the same group that was partnering with the PHA to develop the Camp Teddy parcel. Mosaic a Black-owned private developer has been awarded large projects throughout the region. The company develops for-profit projects like the $2.6 billion Navy Yard and mixed-use apartments as well as mission-based projects like Edison 64 a housing development for military veterans. Still it was surprising that Mosaic wanted the tiny-homes project which wouldn’t be profitable and was much smaller than its other recent projects. One of Mosaic’s co-founders Greg Reaves told me this project was completely mission-based: “Frankly the economics are nonexistent from an investment standpoint. And that’s fine.” Mosaic won the RFP.

Its proposal was thin on specifics compared to SREHUP’s. The company would partner with an Ohio-based architecture firm to design and build 12 two-story units ranging in size between 672 and 756 square feet. None of the units would be fully wheelchair-accessible and the only village component would be a designated green space for gardening. The houses would be built off-site for an average cost of roughly $76000 apiece; funding for the project wasn’t specifically identified.

Sena was devastated but arranged a meeting with Mosaic in an attempt to salvage parts of the larger project. Mosaic wasn’t persuaded.

“We’re the only ones who’ve been working on this in Philadelphia for years. I don’t think they have any idea what a tiny home is” Sena says now. Reaves acknowledges that his development won’t unlock affordable housing options across the city as Sena envisioned but he still believes there’s value in Mosaic’s project beyond the few people it will house: “We don’t really take a traditional developer approach to anything we do. We think future projects could benefit from what we’re able to apply [here].”

It isn’t clear when construction on Mosaic’s village will begin or when residents will be able to move in. The first step is for PRA and Mosaic to agree to a contract which then needs to be approved by PRA’s board of directors and City Council. At press time none of that had occurred. Mosaic’s proposal estimated that from contract agreement to resident move-in would take one and a half years. At this pace occupancy isn’t likely until at least 2023.

As a result of the housing protest and subsequent agreement there will be a village of small homes in West Philadelphia but it stands to be a major departure from the vision Sena and the encampment leaders once had. For now Sena is focusing her efforts elsewhere including a new shelter just across the city line in Delaware County: “There’s a million other projects that I’m going to be working on and am currently working on but the tiny homes I’m just like peace out. You’re a mess Philly.”

This past May new encampments arose in Kensington. There was no protest or strategic organization behind them. This time people were just gathering to find community with nowhere else to turn. The city cleared those encampments in August.

In the year since the first tents were pitched on the grass off the Parkway not much has changed for Philadelphia’s homeless citizens.

Almost no part of the Camp JTD agreement concerning vacant properties and the community land trust has materialized. According to a city spokesperson and a PHA spokesperson at the time of this writing neither entity has transferred properties to the encampment protesters including the homes from the North Philadelphia Camp Teddy deal. That’s because the community land trust which would hold those properties doesn’t appear to be fully operational yet. There are still several lengthy and expensive steps that organizers working on the land trust primarily Bennetch and Johnson must go through like acquiring liability insurance and extensive permits and approvals. These requirements which the city inserted into the agreement are significant and daunting. It’s not clear that there’s a timeline for when the land trust will be up and running.

The Camp JTD agreement does include a clause allowing the encampment protesters to notify the city of any potential breach of the contract under which the city would have a week to begin rectifying that breach. The protesters haven’t yet issued any notice of or filed a lawsuit concerning a breach but Bennetch says she’s considering doing so after the community land trust is operational. She didn’t specify which part of the agreement such a notice would concern.

Even once the community land trust is established the vacant properties will need to be renovated before they’re truly livable. PHA president Kelvin Jeremiah speculated that some could cost between $100000 to $250000 to rehab with construction clearing accumulated waste installing appliances and more. Bennetch disputes that assessment; she says most of the vacant units just need cosmetic repairs that could be paid for largely by grants and future fund-raising. She points to former encampment residents she’s helping to inhabit dozens of vacant PHA houses including some of the same 50 vacant properties that are part of the agreement as evidence that major renovations aren’t necessary. But when some of Camp JTD’s residents first moved into these vacant homes ahead of the encampment’s clearing multiple activists say a number of them quickly returned to the encampment because the homes weren’t in livable condition. The gap in assessments is significant; a city spokesperson states that when the properties are conveyed to the land trust they will still be subject to Philadelphia building and fire codes. Additionally the agreement contains a reversion clause allowing PHA to take back properties if they remain undeveloped or “become a source of blight and nuisance.”

“They city got the press and they did not have to give anything in return” says activist Chelsea Dalsey. “And then they get to say ‘Oh look these assholes can’t do this kind of thing.’”

Shortly after the encampment deal was announced Jeremiah told a reporter with Shelterforce somewhat cynically “This is where the rubber meets the road. There are so many people who think they can do this job better than the professionals.”

It’s not clear whether it was by design or simply because these things are difficult and navigating bureaucracy is maddening but the city responded as cities often do when faced with a burgeoning social movement. Tactics employed by the city like overwhelming leadership with secret negotiations and offering then publicizing meager concessions were prime examples cited in the 1977 book Poor People’s Movements: Why They Succeed How They Fail. And some activists do feel like they were set up to fail. Chelsea Dalsey one of the Camp JTD activists puts it bluntly: “A lot of what occurred is what the city wanted. It’s played directly into their hands. They won here. They got the press and they did not have to give anything in return. And then they get to say ‘Oh look these assholes can’t do this kind of thing.’”

A year ago Sterling Johnson and Jennifer Bennetch signed off on the agreements with the city and PHA. Now Johnson downplays the significance of the Camp JTD deal preferring to look forward. “There’s a lot of focus on this one agreement” he says adding “There’s nothing [in the deal] that’s going to stop the amount of people [in Philadelphia] that are going to become homeless in the next five years.” Bennetch still believes the Camp Teddy agreement which is supposed to net seven fully renovated homes paid for by the PHA was a good one. But now she doesn’t see the headline-grabbing Camp JTD deal the same way. “At the time I didn’t realize how bad that deal was” she admits contemplating how little they ended up with and the work ahead on the community land trust. “I don’t know if I would do that again.”

Last summer as the news of the encampment deal spread among Camp JTD residents Bennetch approached Beast just as Alex Stewart and James Talib-Dean had several months earlier — after hearing him speak his mind while making a scene telling others “We just got shafted.” Bennetch told Beast that as part of the deal PHA had agreed to give a small number of newly rehabbed units separate from the 50 vacant units and the Street to Home program to encampment protesters through something called the Shared Housing Initiative. She asked if he’d be interested.

A couple weeks later Beast had the keys and a signed two-year lease. His North Philly apartment is small just enough for him and his tall wide frame. The one-bedroom was bare when Beast moved in last October. There was no refrigerator no curtains to offer privacy from the outside world. He made his own window coverings out of children’s blankets and got mostly everything else including a fridge and a bed from friends and family. Now a TV quietly buzzes on a dresser near the far window a stereo booms Michael Jackson on the radio and a fleece blanket covers the linoleum floor. Beast suspects Bennetch offered the unit to him even though they’d clashed before to get him out of the encampment before his feelings about the deal started rubbing off on others. But ultimately that didn’t matter much to him. Beast had already seen and been through enough to know — promises and hope were nice but it was always best to take a sure thing.

Age: 63

Family: Husband and 3 grown daughters. 4 grandchildren — all of which attend local public schools.

How long have you lived in Dacono: Seven years

Professional background: Motorola Solutions INC 22 years project management and pre-sales.

Political/community experience: I have assisted in bringing the Weld Food Bank into the city of Dacono and last year alone we served an estimated 28000 meals to needful families.

Education: Graduated from Longmont High School in 1976 Front Range Community College Liberty Bible College – bachelor of theology

How would you better the lives of Dacono residents if you were elected as a City Council member?

We are an independent people that live in Dacono. In the almost 20 years that our family has actively worked and/or lived within this community one of the hallmark issues that has been promised by its politicians has been to go after a greater level of business growth to help lead the amount of the people moving in. What has actually happened was Dacono has watched as the communities around it have grown and prospered while Dacono has remained somewhat stagnant. With the current leadership leading the way we have watched businesses move into Frederick and Firestone bypassing our fair city.

We are at one of the great crossroads of I-25 with Colo. 52 bringing through its corridor close to 25000 cars daily only to watch our wonderful city stay somewhat stagnant in its growth. That needs to change.

While we have added a few great businesses we have been dwarfed by growth external to our boundaries. I am excited to be part of a council that can make a difference now that leadership is changing.

What’s your plan to address any growing pains Dacono might face as the city continues to face increasing industry and residential development?

Much of the Front Range is feeling the strain of its expansion. Dacono is not. Historically our town has been lived in by a growing senior community. In fact in the last complete census Dacono’s senior community provided over 63% of the primary care for its children and grandchildren compared to a 6% national average. We need to address the care of our seniors while bringing in a balanced housing growth that can offer affordability to all families.

What inspired you to run for City Council and what are the pillars of your campaign?

This will be my second term as council member if elected to serve this term. Never having served in local government I learned the workings of local city government in my first term and am now better equipped with knowledge and experience to better serve Dacono’s residents. It’s my goal to envision myself as being a servant to those who elect me to give of my time to fairly represent the will of those people. I want to be connected/available to my constituents so they feel that they truly have a connection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmtpbmctcG9sYW5kLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3R1ZGVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best cities in Poland for international students to live and work,"Are you an international student who’s looking to carve yourself an international career? Why not consider working in Poland?

In recent years there have been a rising number of people moving to Poland for work. Quoting preliminary findings from a study by Statistics Poland (GUS) a government agency Notes from Poland said over two million foreigners were living in Poland making up around 5% of the country’s population at the end of 2019.

They add that Poland’s labour ministry data showed that in 2019 there was a further 35% increase in the number of work permits issued to immigrants from outside the EU. It’s worth noting that precise figures for the overall number of immigrants in the country have been hard to come by but these data suggest a somewhat positive sentiment towards Poland for work opportunities.

Meanwhile the London School of Economics notes that in 2020 Poland’s GDP contracted by “only” 3.5% significantly less than the OECD average of 5.5%. This was a stark contrast to the UK where the figure stood at 9.9%. They note that while unemployment rates have soared across Europe the official Polish figures have hardly budged and are the lowest in the EU according to the latest Eurostat figures.

The Polish economy was also performing well before the pandemic struck.

An increasing number of work permits being issued to migrants aside Poland is rich in history steeped with centuries of culture and tradition that makes the country appealing for those without Polish roots to settle in the country for job opportunities.

Coupled with the fact that the cost of living in Poland is cheaper than other countries in the EU in addition to being home to a wealth of natural beauty that makes outdoor adventures ideal for the adventurer at heart many cities have it all.

Here are three cities that make working in Poland a thing you won’t regret:

Wrocław

There are many reasons why Wrocław was awarded the title of one of the best destinations in Europe in 2018. Here architectural wonders rivers and more have dubbed it “the Venice of the North”.

There are numerous entertainment centres bars and clubs where people can let off some steam after a busy day. The city also has a well-developed network of public transport.

The city has a transportation system that connects it with the rest of Poland and neighbouring countries including Germany and the Czech Republic.

The city itself is crawling with opportunities. Many multinationals have set up shop here such as IBM Nokia Credit Suisse Volvo Group DataArt Google McKinsey & Company Dolby and HP Inc.

Poznań

Situated in western Poland on the Warta River Poznań is commonly known as the economically developed region of Wielkopolska voivodeship. It is also a beautiful city that is very rich in history offering its residents both a small-town feel and a vibrant metropolitan city life.

Here weekends can be spent exploring countless museums art galleries and theatres. By night restaurants bars and pubs abound for night-owls. It is also strategically located — Berlin is only a two-and-a-half hour drive away.

Poznań has been described as a business-friendly city. It is home to leading companies such as Roche Amazon Unilever Volkswagen and more.

Kraków

One word to describe the city of Kraków? Majestic. Situated on the famous River Vistula it is one of the oldest cities in Poland overflowing with historic architecture art culture and more. While historic it is also vibrant. Its large market square filled streets and entertainment offerings have made it a crowd favourite.

To get around trams buses and taxis abound. Accessibility makes it convenient for residents to explore beautiful parks and enjoy delectable cuisines.

What you need to know about the Motorola MH7020 router

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

Motorola MH7020: Rs. 6999

Rs. 6999 Motorola MH7020 (two pack): Rs. 12999/$159 The Motorola MH7020 is a mesh-ready Wi-Fi router that is being sold by the company individually but also in a two-pack and three-pack configuration for larger homes. The tri-band router supports the Wi-Fi ac standard and has a dedicated backhaul channel for faster routing between multiple satellite routers. Additionally the entire setup and management can be done via the intuitive Moto Manage app. Read more: The best mesh routers

The Motorola MH7020 router is available via Amazon in both the US and India. Only the two-pack and three-pack configurations are being sold in the US. The router is designed for mid-sized apartments and with maximum rated speeds of 2200Mbps it should be able to handle multiple 4K streams simultaneously with ease. Finally some of the software services like advanced parental controls are locked behind a paywall in the US but that is not the case in India.

What’s good?

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

The primary concern when picking out a router is good coverage and network speeds and the MH7020 delivers. I tested out the router placed alongside my personal Ubiquiti Amplifi setup to test out the range and network speeds across a 2300 square foot apartment. The apartment has multiple concrete walls and the router performed swimmingly when testing out coverage both in the same room and at the periphery of the apartment.

Owing to the sheer size of the router the MH7020’s built-in radios are large enough to broadcast a strong wireless signal across multiple rooms. In fact in my tests the single router outperformed my Ubiquiti mesh router along with two satellite antennas as far as download speeds are concerned.

Comparing the router to the prosumer Ubiquiti Amplifi router the two devices scored similarly in on-device internet speed tests. The tests were carried out with a symmetric 300Mbps broadband internet line. Ubiquiti’s latest firmware update has slowed down WAN throughput drastically which is reflected in the tests here. However the MH7020 still managed to reach download speeds of 244Mbps and upload speeds of 168Mbps which is similar to what the much pricier Ubiquiti delivers on most days. Not bad.

That speed dropped drastically at the outskirts of my apartment where the download speeds reduced to a still usable 36.49Mbps. Upload speeds were however an abysmal 3Mbps.

﻿

To test out read and write speeds over local LAN I simulated a mixed workload of files ranging from a couple of kilobytes all the way to a few hundred megabytes for a total of three gigabytes of test data. This was transferred over the LAN to an Ethernet-connected NAS with a fast SSD to remove any bottlenecks. At 139Mbps the write speeds are good enough to saturate most consumer hard disks if you plan to store a lot of data over the local network and read speeds are perfectly fine for high bit-rate 4K content. Those speeds of course drop down over a distance but the read speeds are still sufficient for streaming 4K content.

The Motorola MH7020 delivers excellent speeds and enough range to cover a mid-size apartment.

I was also impressed by the range offered by the Motorola MH7020 which comfortably covered most of my apartment. That said getting a second unit as a satellite would do wonders for coverage as the router includes a dedicated backhaul channel for strong connectivity between the router and satellites.

The other interesting aspect of the router is the software. Motorola has partnered with Minim to offer cloud-connected goodies like privacy and security protection. From onboarding to the feature set itself Minim has done an excellent job at making high-end software features accessible and more importantly just like we saw with the Xiaomi Mi Router 4A Gigabit Edition easy for users to understand.

The feature set includes filtering not just for ads but also malware. While Minim doesn’t expose the filter lists it is using the company claims that it is using multiple sources including open-source ad filtering lists that are regularly updated over the air. Users can also block off all websites hosting adult content with a single swipe — a nifty feature for users with younger children at home. Disabling the filters is easy enough as well. Interestingly enough a global filter search list lets you specifically check what list is blocking a specific piece of content. You can also switch off internet access across your network should you want some downtime.

For more granular control it is possible to create profiles that can have one or more devices. These profiles have their own individual set of controls for adware or adult-oriented websites. Moreover you can maintain device-specific whitelists or blacklists to better control what content you can or cannot view. You can even set schedules or time limits for internet access.

The Motorola MH7020's focus is on features.

All the functions work exactly as advertised and for once I do expect the average user to capitalize on these features. They’re not new features per se — we’ve seen them before on other devices. However setting them up can be quite a chore that tends to dissuade not-so-tech-savvy users and that’s a hurdle that the MH7020 crosses with aplomb. A lot of that has to do with how well the expanded features are laid out. From the easy-to-understand shortcuts for privacy security and malware to the onboarding process for profiles even an average user should have no trouble getting started. The ability to set everything up from the app is an added bonus.

There are a few other aspects of the MH7020 worth touching upon including a built-in speed test as well as user profiles. Building on the security aspect the app includes two-factor authentication support as well. The Motorola MH7020’s focus is on features but its ease of use makes it stand out amongst the dozens of routers I’ve tried out so far.

What’s not so good about the Motorola MH7020?

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

I’ll be straightforward here: the Motorola MH7020 is not a good-looking router. For a device that can’t be entirely hidden away it wouldn’t have hurt if the company had put a little more effort into the design. The build quality is barebones and borderline cheap. The Motorola logo at the front glows in fairly bright green and I haven’t figured out a way to dim or switch off the light entirely. Simply put the router will be an eyesore no matter where you place it.

The focus on affordability shows in the design and calling the Motorola MH7020 an eyesore wouldn't be wrong.

The router also disappoints in terms of port selection. If you prefer to keep basics like computers or video game consoles wired up you’ll have to invest in a network switch since the router has just one single ethernet port at the back in addition to the WAN port for connecting your internet line.

Motorola MH7020 review: Should I buy it?

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

As a user of prosumer networking products I had limited expectations from the Motorola MH7020. That said I came away rather impressed with what the company is offering. The Motorola MH7020 router is well priced and doesn’t skimp out on the hardware. Speeds are excellent even at a distance and network coverage is pretty solid for a mid-sized apartment. Users looking to cover a larger area can of course buy a second or even third satellite to expand coverage.

The Motorola MH7020 balances range and speed with easy to use software that makes high-end features accessible to everyone.

However it is the Minim-powered software that truly impresses. The feature set is robust with meaningful additions done in a consumer-friendly way. In case you need more range than speed the TP-Link Deco E4 ships with two additional satellites in the box but most users with mid-sized apartments should be perfectly well served by the MH7020.

The router goes up against full-fledged mesh solutions like the TP-Link Deco E4 (Rs. 8599) that includes two satellites in the box at the cost of lower speeds. Meanwhile options like the TP-Link Archer AX73 ($199/Rs. 10999) offer drastically higher speeds and Wi-Fi 6 compatibility as well as a wider selection of ports for a little more money.

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

Rawson says energy company boards have failed to hold executives accountable for substantive action on environmental issues. (James Forde For The Washington Post)

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

The release of 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana waterway in 2018 was Marathon Petroleum’s worst spill in several years. It involved a crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

The aim had been to offer diversified exposure to fast-growing countries outside the rich world. Since then emerging and developing countries have in aggregate gained economic and corporate clout. But the vast disparities between them makes lumping them all into a single category increasingly odd. What might a new framework for investing outside of the rich world look like?

In the early 1980s emerging and developing countries made up about 25% of global GDP according to the IMF . Today they account for about 40% and more than 20% of total global market capitalisation.

As everyone rushed to try out Charlie Brooker’s interactive Black Mirror show there was one thing most people didn’t consider: Netflix was gathering every choice they made and using it to further fuel its dominance as a streaming provider.

Netflix is a company that’s built on data. It’s common knowledge that Netflix collects data about what you view and how long you watch it for. Combined with the streaming service’s vast big data analytics capabilities it’s why Netflix is so good at offering recommendations for what to watch next. More widely Netflix’s data-driven programming helps to inform the TV shows it commissions. The streaming service allegedly greenlighted political drama House of Cards without even seeing a pilot.

Netflix doesn’t include adverts inside its service despite pressure from investors and analyst predictions that it could reap a $1 billion annual windfall by doing so. But the streaming giant does collect rich data from over 200 million subscribers and this information is so core to its service that you can’t opt out of it.

“Online content streaming is increasingly dependent on collecting a vast treasure trove of data about you” says Pat Walshe a data protection and privacy consultant who has researched Netflix’s use of data. On Netflix this includes what you watched and when you watched it where you paused where you stopped the devices you used to stream the content and where you were at the time.

“Every data point says something about you” Walshe says. “As well as offering recommendations Netflix can use this data to understand things such as where most customers stop watching so they can improve next time.”

So what data does Netflix collect and are there any steps you can take to make the service more private?

What Netflix knows about you

According to its privacy policy Netflix collects data including device identifiers geo-location browser type and details you gave it to sign up such as your email address and payment information. If you are using Netflix on your browser cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information about your interests. This is still the case if you use a tablet smartphone or streaming device via device identifiers.

Netflix also knows your viewing habits. The streaming service will log that you binged every episode of Breaking Bad in a week and that you abandoned Seaspiracy 20 minutes in. This sort of data is core to the personalisation Netflix prides itself on – the resulting recommendations based on what other people like you have watched. It is all done via specialist personalisation algorithms fuelled by data about the films and TV you watch and how you interact with the service. Netflix says the recommendations system does not take into account demographic information such as age or gender as part of the decision making process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1vcmlnaW5hbC1tb3ZpZXMtY29udGVudC1nb29kLWJhZC1ub3QtbWF0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Netflix Doesn't Really Care If Its Movies Are Good,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1vcmlnaW5hbC1tb3ZpZXMtY29udGVudC1nb29kLWJhZC1ub3QtbWF0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIxLTEwLTEwLy1zcXVpZC1nYW1lLWlzLW5ldGZsaXgtcy1maXJzdC1rb3JlYW4taGl0LWEtamFwYW5lc2Utc2hvdy1pcy1uZXh00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Squid Game And What Does It Mean For Netflix Non-English TV?,Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information people and ideas Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information news and insight around the world,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV0ZmxpeC1yb2Jpbi1yb2Jpbi1hYXJkbWFuLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's 'Robin Robin' is the stop-motion wonderland of your holiday dreams,"If your holiday wish was for a picture-perfect tale about celebrating our individuality while trashing someone's house with their own red wine and decorations consider Robin Robin a wish granted.

Created and directed by Dan Ojari and Mikey Please through Wallace and Gromit studio Aardman Animations Robin Robin is a truly wondrous and impressively ambitious stop-motion film made for the holidays — but it's just as easily enjoyed year round. Premiering at the BFI London Film Festival and coming to Netflix in November the 30-minute film is one that will likely find itself firmly planted in holiday viewing lineups for folks of all ages.

Having fallen from her nest in the egg Robin (Bronte Carmichael) has been raised by a family of mice. Led by their loving mouse dad (Adeel Akhtar) the family scurries into houses perfecting the art of stealth pilfering crumbs of food and paraphernalia — if you loved Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox in this respect you'll love this as well. Not quite having the delicate touch of her family members Robin struggles with her abilities in stealth and questions her place.

As a stop-motion film Robin Robin is both incredibly beautiful and super playful in the medium. Crafted not of plasticine but of needle felt (a material not known for its malleability) this production is magical in its ambition — from a splattering snowball fight to an explosive fireworks display and a fast moving icy river. Every last frame of Robin Robin is a feast for the eyes especially when there's a literal feast being covertly ransacked by animals onscreen.

If you look closely at each scene you can spot little Easter eggs — for example the mouse family home with its tree root bunks and leaf blankets is filled with tiny bits and pieces humans would throw away like the Grinch’s house but less brimming with banana peels and general hatred. Plus it's all beautifully scored by English duo The Bookshop Band with a handful of truly memorable songs.

Christopher Robin star Carmichael is delightful voicing Robin a character so determined to become a ""real"" mouse like her family that she fashions adorable mouse ears from her feathers. Not content to steal mere crumbs when she could aim for a whole juicy sandwich to prove her worthy of mousehood Robin tries to infiltrate a house on her own meeting new characters (both helpful and hungry) along the way — namely voiced by Gillian Anderson and Richard E. Grant.

Of course you need a villain somewhere in this sweet tale. Anderson is perfectly chilling as classic bird/mouse nemesis Cat without being too scary for young’uns. Lurking in her house of doom she gets a nervously funny song about fitting in...her belly that is. ""It's what's inside that counts"" quite literally for Cat.

But stealing the entire show (and aiming for a certain ""magic shiny wishing star"") is Grant as Magpie collector of all things shiny and newfound friend to Robin. At the first screening of Robin Robin the room absolutely erupted amid Magpie's version of Robin's song about the rules of stealing grown-ups and kids alike. And Magpie gets his own song about loving THINGS which is reminiscent of Jermaine Clement's Bowie-like ""Shiny"" as the villainous crab in Moana combined with...well...Mr Burns' ""See My Vest"" from The Simpsons. You'll hear it.

Robin Robin is an ambitious beautiful technical triumph a moving story of celebrating our individual strengths and differences and a delightful tale that should be installed firmly on your holiday viewing rotation for life.

The owners of an AirBnB in Spallumcheen raised $1000 in a silent auction for the Special Olympics.

Thea and Troy Siever are the owners of Blue Grass Farms Country Events and Accomodations in Spallumcheen.

“During the winter of 2021 we signed up for the Enterprize Challenge 2021 as we were entertaining the idea of expanding our business into a rustic outdoor farm wedding venue” says Thea.

“This summer we successfully hosted two beautiful weddings despite the heat wave the smoke and the evacuation alerts.”

Thea says as their business began to gain ground she and Troy wanted to find a way to help a charity “that we hold close to our heart during these difficult times.”

They contacted the Special Olympics and donated a four-night stay at their AirBnB along with packages from local businesses to create a North Okanagan experience to the Newmont Invitational Golf Tournament’s silent auction.

“As all the proceeds go to The Special Olympics we got to work and our vision snowballed into something bigger than imagined” says Thea.

“We were blown away by the generous donations from all these amazing local businesses - together we were able to create a package for the silent auction that would offer an unforgettable North Okanagan experience and showcase amazing local flavours and our community.”

The auction closed in the morning of Sept. 29 and their bidding item raised $1000 for the Special Olympics.

“This was our first year participating in this charity event and we are already looking forward to creating a bigger auction item for next year to generate more money for this wonderful cause” says Thea.

Businesses that donated to the package for the silent auction include Intrigue Wines The BX Press Cidery and Orchard the Overlander Restaurant the Small Axe Road House Village Cheese Company The Fig Fieldstone Organics Wild Antho and Synergist Media.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A tuck-in acquisition refers to a larger company absorbing another organisation which is usually smaller in size and integrating it into its own platform.

CSS Corp which is looking at going in for an IPO towards the end of 2023 as a standalone business counts India among its largest talent base with a headcount of about 6000 employees.

Speaking to PTI CSS Corp Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mittal said the company is keen on inorganic growth options and is looking at tuck-in acquisitions to enhance its offerings and get to new customers.

""We're looking at companies with revenues of anywhere between USD 30 to 80 million in terms of revenue ticket size and we're looking at maybe a couple of them tuck-in acquisitions at various service lines. If you look at our strategy in the digital engineering space or in the cloud and data center space or in the customer experience space these are the three focus areas"" he explained.

Mittal said these acquisitions should either build competency for CSS Corp or help it get exposure to a newer sector like healthcare.

""We are not looking at acquisitions just to increase our revenue or margins. Our organic growth is already very industry-leading...the focus (for acquisitions) is in terms of can we create another engine of growth which gives us more capability and/or exposure to new sectors"" he added.

""The other sector that we want to focus on is this whole e-commerce internet-based business model companies SaaS. That's where the future is. We want to get exposure to sectors which are growing and which are the future"" he added.

The company is looking at hiring about 1300 people in India from various campuses in the coming year in line with the strong growth momentum being experienced by it. Out of its 10000 employee base around 6000 are in India.

In February this year Capital Square Partners (CSP) - a Singapore-based private equity Fund Manager and Startek's majority shareholder - had acquired a controlling stake in CSS.

At that time Startek - which competes with CSS Corp - had said it has participated in this transaction by contributing total USD 30 million in a limited partnership managed by CSP to acquire both an indirect beneficial interest of approximately 26 per cent in CSS as well as an option to acquire a controlling stake.

CSS Corp grew at 25 per cent in FY21 and expects to do better than that in FY22.

Mittal said the company is well-positioned for growth in the coming years.

When contacted by the Courier Penn and Palmer confirmed they’re moving in next week and are already putting their own personal touches on the residence built circa 1905 for shipwright Alfred Whetton whose family built Circular Quay’s first wharves.

“We hope to do the home justice” Penn said.

In the two weeks since they’ve settled landscapers have converted a garden into a level family-friendly lawn. “Eventually we’d like to redo the whole house” Penn added.

Being on about 710 sqm of elevated land there are panoramic north-easterly views across Point Piper and Rose Bay to Manly from every level and a pool.

Among their plans are replacing the pool with a smaller one and converting two of the bedrooms into a huge luxurious master suite.

Weideman joins a growing list of deceased VFL/AFL players to have been diagnosed with the condition including Graham “Polly” Farmer Danny Frawley and Shane Tuck.

CTE is a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include behavioural and mood problems as well as issues with thinking.

Weideman the grandfather of Melbourne forward Sam Weideman suffered multiple concussions during his playing career in the 1950s and 60s and according to the Herald Sun his final days were “wracked with torturous pain and mood swings” before he passed away in February aged 85.

According to the Australian Sports Brain Bank’s report which was shared with News Corp by Weideman’s family Weideman was found to have suffered from Stage II CTE. Frawley suffered from the same stage.

Weideman’s son Mark who also played for the Magpies in the early 1980s urged Weideman to donate his brain so not only could more be learned about his condition but to make things potentially easier later down the track for current and future footballers.

“I said ‘Dad we have got to do this we have got to help’” Mark Weideman told the Herald Sun.

“The more science can build up and get evidence the better things will become in the future.

The news comes a couple of months after the AFL enlisted former Western Bulldogs president and renowned lawyer Peter Gordon to help with the establishment of a concussion compensation and support fund for players.

Many players in recent times such as Liam Picken Ben Jacobs and Daniel Venables have been forced into early retirement due to concussion-related injuries.

Earlier this year veteran player agent Peter Jess was preparing a class action against the AFL on behalf of retired players who were battling with the effects of repeated head knocks.

Concussion and brain injuries are not only looming as the biggest footy issues of our time but they’ve already been causing huge ripple effects in overseas sports.

In recent years the NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements to players allegedly impacted by frequent blows to the head.

Weideman was one of Collingwood’s most loved players playing in two premierships and captaining their 1958 triumph.

He is also a member of the Magpies’ Team of the Century won their best-and-fairest on three occasions and was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2007."

Mittal said these acquisitions should either build competency for CSS Corp or help it get exposure to a newer sector like healthcare.

Rahm started Saturday one shot off the lead but a rough third round left him six strokes behind new leader Rafa Cabrera Bello heading into the final round.

Rahm holds a share of ninth after carding a 1-over-72 through the third round at Madrid’s Club de Campo Villa. He hit a double bogey on the sixth hole and bogeyed the fourth 11th and 12th holes to go with four birdies.

“Everything that could go wrong did go wrong” Rahm said. “Now I have to see if I can start well tomorrow to give myself a shot. It is too bad that I played so poorly. (But) in golf unless it is the last day you always have an opportunity.”

Rahm is back playing in Spain for the first time in two years. The U.S. Open champion is the two-time defending champion at the Spanish Open which was called off last year due to the pandemic. A third victory would tie him with Seve Ballesteros at the event.

Cabrera Bello shot a bogey-free 7-under 64 to move to the top of the leaderboard. He finished second to Rahm here in 2019. He is seeking his first win since the 2017 Scottish Open.

Cabrera Bello is two shots ahead of fellow Spaniard Adri Arnaus and France’s Julien Guerrier. Englishman Jack Senior is another shot back. Overnight leader Wil Besseling slipped to five shots back with three more players.

“It would be amazing” Cabrera Bello said. “I’ve won every Spanish amateur title there is and I’m missing this one which would be the pinnacle of Spanish golf.

“I played really good I drove it well I hit really good iron shots and I did hole some very nice important putts. I guess that’s what happens when you’re playing good.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vY2FsbHMtZm9yLXNhY2stb2YtbnBhLWJvc3MtcG9saXRpY2FsbHktbW90aXZhdGVkLW5vcnRoZXJuLWdyb3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calls for sack of NPA boss politically motivated – Northern Group,"The Alliance for Progressive Professionals a northern-based group has described the call for the sack of the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)…

The Alliance for Progressive Professionals a northern-based group has described the call for the sack of the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Mohammed Bello-Koko as politically motivated.

This was contained in a statement issued after an emergency meeting of the group in Kaduna to review the security situation in Northern Nigeria and other emerging issues.

The group described the youth association known as Unified Nigeria Youth Forum as a faceless saying it is plotting to undermine the country’s interest especially Northern Nigeria.

The statement signed by the Secretary-General of the group Mallam Hamza Abdullahi commended the efforts of investigative journalists and watchdog organizations that led to the leakage of the operations in global secrecy jurisdictions.

However it cautioned the public to avoid hasty generalizations and desist from drawing imaginary conclusions from media trials that are often politically motivated.

According to the group “When significant leakage like this happens there is often a global outrage which may lead to different interpretations. From what we know there is nothing wrong with investing in a tax haven because of low tax rates and according to international laws registering a trust or a shell company is not a crime on its own. What must be established is the source of funds and whether they can be linked to questionable or politically exposed persons.”

In the specific case of Mr. Mohammed Bello-Koko the group stated thus: “We have examined the allegations against the NPA boss and it is clear that no case of criminality has been established against him yet. Like many business people he invested in a low tax jurisdiction and did not break any law in the process.

“The funds he invested were not proceeds of crime and cannot be linked to any illicit sources. He did not hide his identity from anyone ab-initio. He could have used proxies but he did not. He reportedly provided evidence of his investments to relevant authorities upon his appointment as contained in his asset declaration documents. The ongoing media persecution is unnecessary and unjustifiable.

“We are aware that there are some desperate individuals who have been running from pillar to post are casting aspersions on the person of Mr Koko to undermine him before the public prejudicially.

“We urge them to sheath their swords and admonish him to maintain a dignified silence concentrate on his job and allow the relevant investigative authorities to do their work and establish his innocence.”",,,,,,
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL25vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4tZ29lcy1hbGwtaW4tb24tc3BhY2UtdG93LXRydWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman Goes All-In on Space Tow Trucks,"Northrop rolled the dice and won itself a monopoly market in space (for now).

Five years ago Orbital ATK announced plans to build a single ""Mission Extension Vehicle"" to help other companies' satellites live in orbit around Earth a bit longer. Five years later this single spaceship has evolved into an entire new division for Northrop Grumman (NOC 0.29%) the company that bought Orbital ATK in 2018.

They call it ""Space Logistics"" and one day it could grow into an entire fleet of space tow trucks circling Earth keeping the world's satellites in tip-top shape.

Baby steps to build a space business

Northrop's first big success with MEV took place in February last year when the company's MEV-1 spaceship docked with an Intelsat telecommunications satellite. MEV will continue to provide guidance and propulsion functions to keep the satellite in service through 2025 then tug the satellite into a ""decaying"" orbit where it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

Northrop's fee for adding five years to the service life of a 20-year-old satellite that cost $300 million to build and tens of millions more to launch: Just $65 million.

One year later a second Northrop spaceship -- the MEV-2 -- duplicated MEV-1's feat when it docked with a second Intelsat satellite also for a five-year mission (although Northrop hasn't said whether it will charge the same price less or more for the service). Both MEV-1 and MEV-2 are in theory capable of docking with and supporting multiple satellites over their lifetimes collecting revenue for each year of service they add until the MEV's own fuel runs out.

What comes next

In the meantime Northrop is already improving its space tow truck capabilities in two ways: in-orbit satellite repair and point-to-point delivery of replacement engines.

As the company announced last month the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- DARPA the Pentagon's ""mad scientists"" division -- has hired Northrop Grumman to be its primary contractor on the Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program. Under this contract Northrop will build a ""Mission Robotic Vehicle"" to demonstrate its ability to inspect repair and upgrade satellites in orbit and to assemble structures in orbit as well in addition to simply towing satellites from orbit to orbit as the MEVs are already doing.

MRV will be an evolution of Northrop's basic MEV design supplemented with a ""robotic payload"" equipped with ""two dexterous robotic manipulator arms"" developed for DARPA by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

Separately Northrop is developing an MRV equipped with three ""Mission Extension Pods"" (MEP). This vessel's mission will be to visit a defunct satellite attach an MEP to it to perform the same guidance and propulsion functions that the MEV pioneered then move on to a second satellite and then a third -- adding effectively six years of service life to each satellite it visits. (And in fact customers seem to be lining up for the service. Northrop says it already has six customers signed up to receive MEPs for their satellites.)

At $13 million per year per MEP deployed you can see how the revenue will add up for Northrop Grumman's space business already the company's fastest growing division according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Northrop certainly recognizes the possibilities and now says it's intent upon building an entire ""fleet of commercial servicing vehicles in GEO that can address most any servicing need"" for its space customers.

The best news for Northrop Grumman investors

And here's the best part: For the time being at least it looks like Northrop Grumman has this space market all to itself. Originally you see DARPA had planned to partner with space firm Maxar Technologies (MAXR) on the RSGS program but in 2019 Maxar inexplicably withdrew from its contract -- leaving RSGS up for grabs and permitting Northrop to swoop in and snap up the contract. (Maxar is however still working to develop a space tow truck capability for NASA.)

Speaking of which Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.10%) once floated the idea of getting NASA to pay it to develop a space tow truck prototype in 2015 but NASA declined to pay for it. Instead Lockheed is now investing (alongside Northrop Grumman) in a start-up called Orbit Fab which wants to develop a space fuel truck for satellites running low on fuel).

While competition is forming up for the time being Northrop Grumman looks to be in control of this market -- effectively a monopolist in space tow trucks. For shareholders of this mighty defense contractor that's very good news indeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXVmZmVyZnVuZXJhbGhvbWUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdG9tLWJlY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Beck Obituary 2021,"Tom Beck 61 of Frederick Maryland passed on Saturday October 9th 2021 at Frederick Memorial Hospital.

A three-day aerospace tradeshow saw about 2500 industry professionals government officials and academics converge on Long Beach recently — further reinforcing the city’s recent burgeoning reputation as “Space Beach.”

The Space Tech Expo saw aerospace experts gather at the Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center this week to market their newest products learn about rising trends and network with representatives from organizations like NASA Northrop Grumman or Aerojet Rocketdyne.

Long Beach has recently become an aerospace hotspot home to companies like Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit as well as longtime local industry giant Boeing. Even SpaceX headquartered in Hawthorne but with major operations in Texas has set up shop at the Port of Long Beach for recovery operations. These companies have staked build rockets satellites and all the parts that go inside them.

The industries growing presence in the seaside metropolis has led some to call the city “Space Beach” and the industry has created many new jobs — high-paying ones at that.

“Long Beach could rename itself ‘Rocket City’ because of all the launch companies that have sprouted up” Eric Stallmer the executive vice president of Voyager Space Holdings said in an interview Friday morning Oct. 8.

“Long Beach is a growing player like others” he added. “So many communities want to be part of this growing space market and it’s competitive.”

Long Beach Stallmer said reminds him of other space hubs across the country like Huntsville Alabama or Denver.

Lucius Martin a special projects officer in the city’s economic development office said the city has a lot of momentum in the aerospace industry and a lot of companies are following that. Long Beach for its part does not provide any tax incentives or give land to these companies Martin said. Instead the city has grown naturally into a space hub he said.

He also said the Long Beach area has a lot of commercial space for companies that need it and there’s a lot of local talent for aerospace companies to hire from.

“We have companies in Silicon Valley looking for space in Long Beach” Martin said.

Southern California — including Long Beach — has a long aerospace industry first booming after World War II when folks migrated out west for prime engineering jobs; much of the work however was in aviation though there were also jobs related to the space race.

Long Beach for example was home to a massive Boeing plant that produced the C-17 Globemaster — a military cargo plane — for two decades until the last one left the city in 2015.

But now the space race has renewed — with companies such as SpaceX and Virgin Orbit shooting to one-up each other.

While this iteration of the aerospace industry is fairly new to the city it’s been in Los Angeles County for a while. Aerojet Rocketdyne is originally from Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley and SpaceX has called the South Bay home since its inception.

“The West Coast is probably the central place for aviation to start” said Mike Ash director for business development at CalTech’s Center for Technology and Management Education. “You have a lot of skills in the Long Beach area and mechanisms to help companies grow and survive.”

And it’s important for these companies to grow Ash added because developing aerospace technology is good for humanity. In the short term he said being in space and studying the atmosphere gives scientists on earth an opportunity to learn more about the weather and climate change.

In the long term Ash added innovations in aerospace technology will also lead to improvements that benefit everyday consumers.

“If we can keep innovation happening at a strong clip a lot of that trickles down to us normal people eventually” Ash said by phone Friday. “There’s so much great stuff happening in space that makes us better stewards of the planet. We’re learning about the weather and the climate and the atmosphere. We benefit from that immediately.”

Stallmer whose Voyager Space Holdings acquires other space companies to further space exploration also said space travel could ultimately benefit other industries such as agriculture biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.

Of course there are always vacations on Mars. Companies from Long Beach help could get us there.

“I would wager a bet that commercial companies get settlements on Mars before NASA” Stallmer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtcHJvdG90eXBlLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtaGFyZHdhcmUv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWZlbmNlLWJsb2cuY29tL2xvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1wcm90b3R5cGUtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1oYXJkd2FyZS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin delivers first prototype hypersonic hardware,"Pentagon’s No.1 weapons supplier Lockheed Martin Corp. delivered critical ground equipment for the U.S. Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system to Soldiers of the 5th Battalion 3rd Field Artillery Regiment 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord Wash.

“With this delivery we’ve taken another leap in advancing this capability to support the U.S. Army’s long-range precision fires vision in support of joint all domain operations” said Eric Scherff vice president for Hypersonic Strike Programs at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re achieving great efficiencies by supporting this program and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic program through the use of a common missile. We’ve invested heavily in creating digital factories across the corporation that employ advanced materials and precision capabilities needed for hypersonic strike and bringing this digital factory approach to hypersonics means shorter delivery spans and greater affordability.”

In a ceremony held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord today the U.S. Army and industry team celebrated this delivery of ground equipment including the battery operations center and four transporter erector launchers. The overall system is being developed in partnership with the U.S. Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office and its Hypersonic Project Office.

It's a robust foundational blockchain much like Bitcoin or Ethereum with full smart contract capabilities. But before we explore the breadth and depth of its other offerings let's dig into Energi's smart contract functionality.

Energi 3.0 has smart contracts

Smart contracts are mini-computer programs that run on a blockchain. They're useful because they execute or negotiate a contract without the need for a third party. So smart contracts don't need lawyers brokers or intermediaries of any kind to take effect. Smart contracts were developed to lower fees for a wide range of transactions while also providing better security than traditional contracts.

Energi 3.0 is compatible with apps written for the largest smart contracts platform in the world: Ethereum. This means users and software developers can easily move to Energi's smart contract platform. The move got even easier with the launch of Energi's Bridge feature which seamlessly moves Ethereum-based ERC-20 assets back and forth between Ethereum and Energi.

ERC stands for ""Ethereum Request for Comment"" a programming standard developed in 2015 that creates and enables smart contracts on the Ethereum network. So anything that can run on Ethereum's $405 billion blockchain can run on Energi's blockchain.

The same way app stores on mobile devices want to attract the best apps for users Energi wants to attract the best developers of decentralized apps (dApps) to its blockchain. Energi Bridge enables that. Those software developers can take advantage of Energi's smart contract platform to continue work on their Ethereum compatible dApps while benefiting from Energi's Defense Team and its Incubator Lab which provides technical and marketing support. Those benefits help position Energi for a potential breakout and make it an investment worth considering.

Energi Defense Team is a unique security feature

The Energi Defense Team -- including the Energi Bureau of Investigation (EBI) its version of the FBI -- are unique differentiators of this blockchain. The sole purpose of its Defense Team and EBI is to protect the Energi community from criminal activities hackers and scammers. The Defense Team is made up of cybersecurity experts and veterans of the intelligence community including the actual FBI and CIA. No other crypto has this.

Understanding Energi's four pillars

At Energi's foundation are its four pillars the technological cornerstones that set it apart from any other current crypto project.

Its smart contract platform Ethereum-compatible and ready for apps in decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On-chain governance to vote on programing updates marketing activities and security measures. Those measures include its proprietary Recovery Tool which enables funds retrieval for scammed users; a three-day waiting period to finalize transactions (allowing time to detect and report fraud); and 24/7 customer service support. A powerful masternode network which functions as a second tier of consensus on top of the first-tier proof of stake ensuring the integrity transparency and accuracy of the Energi decentralized ledger. Its two-layer system also ensures it can scale to meet higher levels of use and demand. Energi is designed to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second in a stable decentralized network -- that's much greater scale than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined can currently manage. Energi has a self-funding treasury which enabled it to launch in 2018 without any external funding venture capital or an initial coin offering. This novel treasury model ensures Energi's independence its commitment to its user community and its ability to pivot based on macro conditions. Every month the Energi network releases 1 million new NRG coins dispersed to the following areas:

10% is allocated to investors who rather than trading stake their NRG tokens to power Energi's proof-of-stake consensus model to authenticate validate and codify new blocks that get added to the Energi blockchain.

10% goes to the Energi senior leadership community as compensation.

40% is earmarked to the Energi self-funding treasury and is used for developer activities marketing customer support the Defense Team business development and other expenses.

40% is dispersed to the individuals who run masternode servers.

Additional features

The developers launched the EnergiSwap decentralized exchange in Q1 2021. A decentralized exchange (DEX) is an automated cryptocurrency market where users can easily exchange coins or tokens. (For clarity coins run on their own blockchains while tokens run on another blockchain.) With DEX transactions no third party brokers the deal so it's known as a ""permissionless"" transaction. DEXs run on smart contracts. The blockchain and smart contract execute the transactions without a credit check bank approval or delay.

Two other novel aspects of this ecosystem include the Energi Arcade an interactive social setting for Energi users to have fun and build stashes of NRG by completing tasks and games and Energi Impact an educational platform with free video tutorials in personal development and self-awareness.

Additionally the Energi team has publicly announced plans to launch ""yield farming"" (a way to increase the number of digital funds by lending your coins to others via interest-bearing smart contracts) as well as its intent to launch an Energi NFT marketplace. These latest enhancements almost guarantee wider adoption of the Energi platform.

While some crypto projects may have one or two of these technology drivers or community-building elements no other has all of them at the same scale. This gives Energi a unique competitive advantage making it a viable investment consideration.

Energi (NRG) basics

What it does: Energi is a layer one blockchain with its own DEX security defense team 24/7 support self-funding treasury smart contract platform a gamification site for users and more. It also has its own NRG coin crypto currency designed to be a store of value and a method of exchange -- making it an ideal form of digital cash.

Date launched: April 14 2018

Market cap: $89.53 million (CoinMarketCap October 2021)

Availability: It's available on several major DEXs: Kucoin Uniswap DigiFinex and its own EnergiSwap DEX. Energi offers a customized wallet you control or you can use Metamask dApp's wallet feature.

Should I buy it?

Since its 2018 inception Energi has built and achieved more than the vast majority of competing projects. Aside from its DEX launch it's offered a blockchain upgrade to allow smart contracts and its own bridge to port ERC-20 tokens over to the enhanced Energi blockchain. ERC-20 tokens are purpose-built to run on the Ethereum blockchain.

Energi seems very similar to the long-awaited Cardano (ADA) project but Energi (NRG) has actually deployed and is already doing all the things Cardano plans to do within 12 to 18 months. Also NRG has a severely undervalued market capitalization of $89.5 million and is in a much better position to get to a 100-fold increase than Cardano -- such a rise would place NRG at $8.9 billion. Given all its current use cases and functionality that valuation would still make NRG a bargain compared to Cardano's $71.4 billion market cap total.

Here are a few other benefits worth considering:

1. Passive income

Staking of NRG coins enables your idle coins to generate annual yields at more than 15% according to StakingRewards.com at the time of writing. It also lets anyone with 1000 NRG coins (approximately $2040 U.S. at the time of writing) establish a masternode which earns an annual percentage yield of an additional 17%. Lastly Energi plans to soon enable yield farming on EnergiSwap. Those are three possible ways to put your NRG coins to work when traditional banks are offering pocket change for savings account interest.

2. Decentralized freedom

Energi investors benefit from unrestricted access to their funds thanks to its decentralized design. There are no intermediaries approvals or credit checks due to its permissionless and transparent system. That's not always the case for other assets or fiat currencies.

3. Security against fraud and scams

Energi's Defense Team and the Energi Bureau of Investigation exist to protect users and community members. They have identified and brought to justice multiple fraudsters including the largest scammer on Discord. Since the launch of EBI Energi says it has reduced cybercrime within its ecosystem by more than 70% -- no other project can credibly make that claim and prove it.

4. Current and pending use cases across its blockchain

Energi is a layer one blockchain with its own decentralized exchange security defense team 24/7 support self-funding treasury smart contract platform gamification site for users multiple passive income streams a planned NFT marketplace and more. Its NRG coin is designed to be both a store of value and an efficient method of exchange. There are a limited number of projects that provide this high level of value at a bargain basement price.

Bottom line

Energi provides a tremendous amount of utility value and growth potential. It's been quietly laying the foundation as it continues to work toward its lofty ambition of becoming ""the world's leading cryptocurrency platform"" and is poised for a significant pump.

Its only major drawback is that it's not currently available on any centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Robinhood or Gemini. But that doesn't change its tremendous potential value which continues to build.",,,,,,,,,,,,

So I stuck the Leap 15.3 ISO on a flash drive booted into the live environment and installed it; it went without a hitch and was easy as can be.

ADVERTISEMENT

But before we get into the issue I faced and the resolution let’s look at some details.

What is OpenSUSE Leap? Tumbleweed?

OpenSUSE is a community-driven and created distribution sponsored by SUSE with many of the famous SUSE technologies built into it.

Starting back in late 2015 OpenSUSE in essence forked into two versions Tumbleweed and Leap rather than being a singular version. Tumbleweed is a rolling-release model receiving the latest bleeding-edge updates as soon as they are ready...Where as Leap is a more typical annual release model with security updates in-between.

My decision to go with Leap rather than Tumbleweed is quite simply for maximum stability. While Tumbleweed is said to be quite stable and users only facing major breakage every year or two at most...That’s still breakages I don’t want to have to fix that I didn’t directly cause myself due to my own mistakes. If I break Leap I know it’s my own fault.

My setup

AMD Ryzen 5 3500x

Gigabyte NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super

16GB DDR4 3000Mhz

KDE Plasma environment

The problem

When installing OpenSUSE Leap I did not see any option to use proprietary drivers for my GPU out of the box...Which makes sense OpenSUSE primarily focuses on open-source software though there are community repositories that grant access to a plethora of proprietary packages. Instead the system installed using the Nouveau driver which is an open-source driver designed for NVIDIA hardware.

However this Nouveau driver did not play nicely with my system whatsoever and I found myself unable to reach a graphical login screen and seeing messages that Nouveau had timed out. As well I use full-disk encryption and found that typing in my password was a nightmare as after already typing it twice (once for my system partition once for my swap partition) I was typing in a third time to mount my system but finding that there was an insanely long input delay of upwards of 30 seconds per button press. I attributed this as well to Nouveau hanging and causing issues.

The solution

The first step I took was to disable all forms of graphical acceleration / video drivers and run in a pure software mode in order to at least be able to access my desktop / a graphical environment. To accomplish this I added the ‘nomodeset’ option to my boot line in my grub installation. To do this yourself:

At your GRUB/GRUB2 menu screen upon booting press E on the menu entry (such as OpenSUSE) you wish to edit. Find the line that starts with either linux or linuxefi  and add nomodeset to the end of it after the quiet splash options. Press CTRL+X to boot.

Then after reaching the desktop open the YaST control center application by clicking the Applications Menu launcher navigate to System and click YaST.

From within YaST select Software Repositories click add select community repositories and select the NVIDIA repository.

Now you will be able to access NVIDIA drivers. Next from within YaST select Software Management and you should see that the NVIDIA drivers have already been selected as YaST will detect your hardware. In the scenario that it has not select the following packages to install assuming you are using an NVIDIA GPU from the Geforce 600 series and newer:

nvidia-computeG05 - NVIDIA driver for computing with GPGPU

nvidia-gfxG05-kmp-default - NVIDIA graphics driver kernel module for GeForce 600 series and newer

nvidia-glG05 - NVIDIA OpenGL libraries for OpenGL acceleration

x11-video-nvidiaG05 - NVIDIA graphics driver for GeForce 600 series and newer

kernel-firmware-nvidia - Kernel firmware files for Nvidia Tegra and graphics drivers

Uninstall the xf86-video-nouveau package and then reboot your machine to complete the process.

Final thoughts

While not overly challenging for the linux-experienced something like this might be enough to throw a new user completely for a loop and scare them off using an amazing system like OpenSUSE. Thankfully YaST is powerful easy to use and there is plenty of OpenSUSE related documentation available online too!

Far Cry 6 is the latest entry in Ubisoft's open world first person shooter franchise and like past games in the series it's a stunning-looking game especially on PC.

Of course that means that we couldn't wait to fire it up on our 8K test rig and see just how good it looks – and how well it performs – at 7680 × 4320. For these tests. we're using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 currently the most powerful consumer graphics card in the world.

We've been doing these 8K tests for a while now and we've seen an exciting increase in visually-impressive games managing to hit that magic 60 frames per second such as Cyberpunk 2077 and even Red Dead Redemption 2 thanks to a recent patch.

This is thanks to Nvidia's DLSS technology which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to upscale games running at lower resolutions so that they appear to be running at higher resolutions with minimal impact to image quality.

It's impressive stuff and it's allowed games that support DLSS to hit 8K at playable frame rates on compatible hardware while games that don't support it barely run at such high resolutions.

No DLSS here

What's interesting is that Far Cry 6 doesn't support Nvidia DLSS. Instead it comes with AMD's similar FidelityFX technology.

While it doesn't use AI or machine learning like DLSS AMD FidelityFX also takes games running at lower resolutions and cleverly upscales them so they appear to be running at higher resolutions and there's a similar uptick in performance as well.

In our tests it allowed us to play the visually-demanding Far Cry 6 at 8K and at 60 frames per second (fps) which is very impressive indeed. Best of all unlike DLSS which is exclusive to Nvidia's RTX range of graphics cards AMD FidelityFX can run on AMD or Nvidia GPUs which is why our 8K rig with the RTX 3090 could benefit from it.

Far Cry 6 8K performance

To begin with we set the Far Cry 6 resolution to 8K but put all the settings on 'Low'. According to the game this takes up 8.57GB of VRAM – less than half of the 24GB available on the RTX 3090.

We kept AMD FidelityFX off and in our tests we hit 33fps on average. That's not bad as we consider 30fps as the minimum for an acceptable playing experience.

However despite it being 8K the game looked pretty basic with the 'Low' settings and there was quite a bit of pop-in especially around the grass.

So we upped the graphics settings to 'Medium' which requires 9.77GB of VRAM and our machine averaged 30fps. It looked better but still not good enough and that 30fps frame rate isn't that impressive when you've paid $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030) for the RTX 3090 on its own.

So we decided to put the pressure on a bit more and turned the graphics settings on 'High'. This requires 10.28GB of VRAM so even the mighty RTX 3080 wouldn't be able to handle it.

That being said it doesn't seem like the RTX 3090 can either as we ran the game to benchmark it... and it promptly crashed.

AMD FidelityFX to the rescue

We tried it a few more times and Far Cry 6 just wouldn't load up. So we finally relented and turned AMD FidelityFX on with the setting on 'Ultra Quality'. This setting means that the impact to visuals should be minimal but also the performance gains won't be as high.

The good news however was that it allowed the game to load and it hit a very respectable 41fps.

It also looked a lot better with 'High' settings and AMD FidelityFX on than at 'Medium' settings with AMD FidelityFX off - and it performed better. That's certainly a win in our books.

Next we turned HD Textures to 'on'. This is an optional download that adds higher resolution textures to the game. This bumped up the VRAM use to 11.3GB but in our tests it didn't impact performance hitting 41fps again. The impact to how the game looked however was definitely noticeable.

Next we changed AMD FidelityFX's setting from 'Ultra Quality' to 'Balanced'. As the name suggests this means AMD FidelityFX tries to strike a balance between performance and image quality so it runs the game at a lower native resolution but it should hopefully still look pretty good at 8K.

It certainly did the trick as our test PC hit 62fps on average passing that golden 60fps milestone. The game looked fantastic as well though there is a noticeable shimmering around some moving objects. It's a small thing and not immersion-breaking but it's an example of the compromises you have to make when using an implementation like AMD FidelityFX or DLSS (we saw something similar with Red Dead Redemption 2) rather than running the game at a native resolution.

We upped the graphics settings to 'Ultra' and put AMD FidelityFX back to 'Ultra Quality' and the VRAM usage was 11.80GB. Performance took an expected drop to 35fps. Not awful but by turning AMD FidelityFX to 'Balanced' we got it up to a respectable 55fps.

Finally we turned on DXR Reflections and DXR Shadows which uses ray tracing for more realistic effects. These are demanding settings and it cut our frame rate to 45fps which upping VRAM usage to 12.4GB - meaning only the most powerful and expensive GPUs could run this. With a bit of tweaking we'd be able to get a nice mix of graphical effects and hit 60fps at 8K with Far Cry 6. Very impressive indeed.

However just to see how demanding 8K was we kept those settings but dropped the resolution down to 4K. This saw our framerate leap to 73fps and there was little if any noticeable difference in image quality.

This is because while you can play Far Cry 6 at 8K Ubisoft has understandably concentrated on 4K performance as 8K-capable hardware is still so niche. That means textures and effects have been made for 4K displays so increasing the resolution to 8K doesn't change a whole lot - especially considering the performance impact it brings.

A great showing for both Far Cry 6 and AMD FidelityFX

Overall these results are a real testament to the Far Cry 6 developers and art team who have created a gorgeous world that looks fantastic and runs well on the hardware we tested it on.

Of course the Nvidia RTX 3090 should also take a bow. It's one of the only GPUs that could even dream of running Far Cry 6 at 8K resolution and the fact that it manages to proves that it remains your best means of playing games at 8K.

AMD FidelityFX has also proved to be an excellent tool for getting games to run at higher resolutions and effects without hitting performance too much. It enabled us to breeze past that 60fps milestone at 8K on an incredibly good looking game and the results were on the whole very good.

The fact that it runs on both AMD and Nvidia hardware (as well as older GPUs) is commendable so we have to give AMD props for going that route.

And while gaming at 8K still isn't quite worth it this all bodes well for how AMD FidelityFX can help people with older less powerful graphics cards run modern games like Far Cry 6 in almost all their glory. With GPUs still hard to get this is the real revolution we need.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXZzLWFtZC1yYXktdHJhY2luZy1zdXBwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia vs. AMD: Which GPUs Support Ray Tracing?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXZzLWFtZC1yYXktdHJhY2luZy1zdXBwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9mYXItY3J5LTYvYmVzdC1zZXR0aW5ncy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1iZW5jaG1hcmtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best Far Cry 6 settings for performance on PC,"While our Far Cry 6 review finds the game far from revolutionary it’s distinctly Far Cry for better or worse. This means a lush open world to wander plenty of enemies to bring to an untimely end and makeshift gadgets that guarantee your gaming monitor will almost always be lit up with gunfire. With so much happening on screen it’s time to head into Far Cry 6’s settings to make sure you don’t put too much stress on your system and instead squeeze every last frame out of your gaming PC.

Far Cry 6 doesn’t mess with its well-established formula but it does up the ante with new features under the hood. It’s the first in the series to officially include ray tracing – at least on PC sorry console folks – and also packs AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology to lower the performance overhead.

It’s not quite as well-optimised at launch as we’d hoped however with some CPU threading issues and an astonishingly high 11GB VRAM asking price for the HD texture pack. Don’t lose hope though as there are a few key settings to look out for that can help improve performance.

Far Cry 6 asks for a little more than previous entries but Ubisoft outlines exactly what your rig needs to attain your preferred resolution and frame rate. So before we get into what you can do to boost fps here’s a reminder of the Far Cry 6 system requirements:

Far Cry 6 presets

Sticking with conventional names Far Cry 6 lets you choose between four graphics presets including Low Medium High and Ultra.

Much the same as New World’s settings all options follow suit when you select a preset rather than giving you an intuitive mix of lows mediums and highs. Simply put if you choose to stick with the Medium preset water shadows and all other graphics will also be on medium and it’ll be down to you to fine tune this to your liking. More on this later.

Choosing the right preset will entirely depend on what your gaming PC is capable of but we recommend starting with High at your preferred resolution and then scaling your settings accordingly. This presents the Cuban-inspired land of Yara in all its glory with beautiful greenery and detailed textures without taking up too many resources as it nets a 16% performance increase compared to Ultra.

Alongside the biggest frame tax Ultra is also one of the most inconsistent presets with a larger gap between the minimum and maximum frame rates. This means you’re more likely to see frame drops occur especially during the intense explosive moments that are fairly frequent throughout the world.

Opting for Medium provides another 10% increase compared to High while Low boosts performance 22% compared to our preferred preset. The latter muddies the detail too much for our liking and we wouldn’t consider it worth the trade-off. However it could be useful if dropping to a double digit frame rate is a deal breaker or you’re skirting below the minimum.

Best Far Cry 6 settings

Far Cry 6 has a fair few options to navigate but you can find these under Video across the Quality and Advanced Settings tabs:

Texture filtering : ultra

: ultra Shadows : medium

: medium Geometry and vegetation : medium

: medium Environment : ultra

: ultra Water : high

: high Terrain : medium

: medium Volumetric fog : ultra

: ultra HD textures : optional

: optional Anti-aliasing : TAA

: TAA DXR reflections : off

: off DXR shadows : off

: off FidelityFX CAS : on

: on FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 : on

: on FSR Mode: ultra quality

We determined the best Far Cry 6 settings using the built-in benchmark tool which isn’t quite as demanding as the game itself but it gives a good baseline of what to juggle. As a result we ended up with a healthy blend of mediums highs and ultras that strike a balance between fidelity and frame rate. If you want to tweak things further however these are the settings that affect your performance the most:

Geometry and vegetation seems to have the biggest impact on your game because it’s behind much of the greenery – and facing facts there are a lot of trees and leaves in Far Cry 6. We suggest setting it to medium because you’ll see a double digit frame loss if you push it up but the benefits might be worth the toll if your hardware can afford it.

Terrain is responsible for much of the world’s detail but it’s also the next setting you should probably adjust. It does a good job of adding depth to the game’s finer features like dirt and blades of grass but weighing up the price for performance it’s worth the extra 4-5% going from ultra to medium.

Shadows only saves you an average of 3% performance on medium compared to ultra. But when you consider that everything stacks up and it isn’t a big loss if shadows aren’t quite as sharp as they otherwise would be it’s a no-brainer taking the hit here.

Water naturally surrounds the island and you’ll see a lot of it throughout your journey. If you turn this down to low it loses the natural ripples and tides which leaves the world feeling increasingly lifeless. Much like shadows switching to medium adds another 3% you can benefit from without too much of a sacrifice.

Texture filtering volumetric fog and environment settings all give negligible performance increases when lowered from ultra but tank the visuals in the process. If you’re keen to churn as many frames out of your system as possible switching environment to medium is your best bet for just over a 2% jump but we’d recommend keeping all on high or ultra.

HD textures are an optional 35GB package you can download on top of the 60GB base game. It’s difficult to recommend with a sky-high 11GB VRAM requirement that even Nvidia’s flagship RTX 3080 doesn’t quite meet but it’s worth a shot to see how it runs on your gaming PC. Just stick to 1080p or 1440p as textures sometimes fail to load in 4K resolution in the current patch. This is something Ubisoft might hotfix later down the line.

DXR reflections and DXR shadows make their first ever appearance in the Far Cry series here but to little fanfare. For the former Ubisoft opts for hybrid reflections which combines screen space reflections with ray tracing and surfaces aren’t always as sleek as a result. The latter doesn’t really do much to improve on the default shadow mapping either.

Sadly even though these techniques set the barrier to entry a bit lower than the full shebang the performance hit you take is a bit too much for us but you should try for yourself to see if it ticks the right boxes for you.

FidelityFX CAS and FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 are absolutely worth switching on regardless of what graphics card you run as they work on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs. CAS stands for contrast adaptive sharpening and aids your anti-aliasing by cleaning up blurry and shimmering outlines. FSR does a similar job to Nvidia DLSS in that it renders Far Cry 6 at a lower resolution before upscaling it to your chosen native resolution. While it works at 1080p you’ll benefit most at 1440p and 4K resolution where it can be considered free performance since it doesn’t seem to have artifacts and distortions that often come with upscaling. And if you need to pump out any more performance you can swap ultra quality out for balanced – just be prepared for a small visual downgrade if you do.

If you have any trouble with frames then your first port of call is to make sure V-Sync is switched off and you instead rely on an AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync display if you own one. V-Sync can be helpful to prevent screen tearing if you have no other option but is often the source of many other issues including stuttering. You can also lock your frame rate if it’s proving problematic which is off by default. And lastly adaptive resolution makes an appearance which you can set so that your resolution automatically adjusts if your frame rate dips below a certain marker. This is a bit of a nuclear option as textures end up suffering but having the option at your disposal is never bad.

Far Cry 6 accessibility settings

Far Cry 6 puts accessibility front and centre allowing you to activate menu narration immediately after the James Bond-like introduction. You can toggle this on and off by pressing L on your gaming keyboard. This is followed by several accessibility presets that give you context as to how they help you play the game but are initially a little vague in what settings they alter. You get more granular control of these when you reach the main menu and dive into the options of your own accord. These are:

Vision preset : automatically enables menu narration increases the scale of UI and fonts turns on enemy outlines pickup outlines large subtitles bold reticles aim assist for PC controllers and gets rid of reticle sway and most camera shakes.

: automatically enables menu narration increases the scale of UI and fonts turns on enemy outlines pickup outlines large subtitles bold reticles aim assist for PC controllers and gets rid of reticle sway and most camera shakes.

You can also alter most elements of the HUD to declutter your screen or provide as much information as you need to make your experience the best it can be. For a more in-depth breakdown read our Far Cry 6 accessibility settings review.

Far Cry 6 issues

Far Cry 6 isn’t a perfect release with a few launch issues to watch out for.

Running the HD texture pack at 4K resolution is strangely problematic even on some graphics cards that meet the steep 11GB video memory requirement. It can result in textures not loading or a mixture of high definition and low definition textures that’s a little jarring. The best solution to this is to avoid 4K resolution and stick with 1440p or switch the pack off in the options menu.

Far Cry 6 has a CPU bottleneck that can hinder your performance. Fortunately there are two workarounds you can consider. Switching HyperThreading off in your BIOS can add another 10fps onto your frame counter and if you’re running the game through Ubisoft’s platform disabling Ubisoft Connect’s overlay goes a long way to increasing fps too.

There are plenty of people complaining about crashes on PC which is something we experienced several times during testing. We were particularly affected when tinkering with ultra settings despite running an Nvidia RTX 3080 and Intel Core 10850K on our test bench but there’s little rhyme or reason we can see just yet. Ubisoft Support suggests Windows 11 is partially responsible for hiccups for those running the new operating system but we didn’t fare much better on Windows 10 with this particular issue.

Co-op is a problem for some who are continually served an error message that the ‘Far Cry service is not available’. It’s not clear whether this affects Ubisoft Connect players exclusively or those that own the game on the Epic Games Store but we should have a clearer idea soon.

Designed for next-generation graphics cards schematics of the power connector show that it will allow up to 600W of power to be delivered directly to the GPUs.

Next-Gen PCIe 5.0 Graphics Card Compatible High-Power Connector Delivers Up To 600W To GPUs

According to Igor Wallossek the existing power delivery systems are becoming obsolete as GPUs become more power-hungry. This generation saw the most graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD to feature triple 8-pin connector interfaces. While NVIDIA opted for a 12-pin Microfit solution for its own Founders Edition variants AIBs were reluctant to use the new power standard but the stopgap made them ready for the true deal and that's the upcoming PCI Express 12VHPWR connector.

We will be getting PCIe Gen 5.0 platforms from Intel next month and AMD is expected to hop on board the bandwagon sometime in 2022 too. Intel may also launch its ARC lineup on the new PCI Gen 5.0 standard so this means that we are definitely going to see some PCIe Gen 5.0 action in the graphics cards segment too. There have been rumors that NVIDIA and AMD flagships will offer up to 2.5-3 times the performance increase but that also means that power consumption would get a massive increase too.

As such there would be demand for a new power connector and that's where the 12V High-Power Connector that is designed specifically in conjunction with the PCIe 5.0 interface comes in. The new standard is said to provide 55A continuous power through a 12V rail which would allow up to 600W power to be delivered to the graphics card. The connector has an interesting form factor where it looks like a slightly bigger version of the MicroFit connector with 12-pins but then it also has 4 extra pins on the bottom. It is also less spacing than the traditional power connector measuring 3.0mm vs 4.2mm but overall accomodating 16-pins means that it ends up bigger but it's one connector to do the job of three 8-pin connectors (600W vs 450W).

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

[Can the market save the planet? FedEx is the latest brand-name firm to say it’s trying.]

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

The release of 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana waterway in 2018 was Marathon Petroleum’s worst spill in several years. It involved a crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

Wouldn't hitmaking country band Old Dominion choose its home base or its origin state to celebrate the release of its fourth album? Nope the reigning three-time Country Music Association vocal group of the year headed to the heartland.

After entertaining Friday in Des Moines Old Dominion settled into Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake Saturday for the first of two sold-out nights. It was an up-beat eminently likable ""underplay"" in a 2100-seat theater by a prominent band that has headlined the much much larger Minnesota State Fair grandstand and Winstock festival.

Old D showcased five songs from ""Time Tequila and Therapy"" (which was released Friday) as well as its seven No. 1 country hits and a special Minnesota bonus — ""I Can't"" the group's collaboration with Caitlyn Smith the Cannon Falls-reared singer. A hard-earned declaration about moving on the song is actually Smith's current single featuring Old Dominion. The surprise guest brought verve and emotional fire sparking Old D lead singer Matthew Ramsey to match her demonstrative passion.

Old Dominion is a different kind of country band — a songwriter's band. In concert the quintet emphasizes songs over musicianship and showmanship. To be sure the ever-smiley Ramsey breezed through the audience early in the evening and played a glittery silver guitar at one point and Brad Tursi offered some tasty passages on electric and acoustic guitar. But Old Dominion lacked the musicality and depth of Zac Brown Band the slick stagecraft and sweet harmonies of Rascal Flatts and the virtuosity and humor of Old Crow Medicine Show.

For 90 minutes on Saturday this felt like a two-man band. Old D – four beards and a blond dude – did not turn the spotlight on any of the other three musicians. Even when Ramsey made a fuss about keyboardist/guitarist Trevor Rosen the blond dude playing accordion on the summer smash ""I Was on a Boat That Day"" the accordion was barely audible in the sound mix. And when Ramsey introduced his bandmates at show's end he announced only their first names as if these musicians were as familiar as John Paul George and Ringo.

Now in their 40s the various individuals in Old Dominion headed to Nashville a couple of decades ago to make it as songwriters. Rosen helped write the Band Perry's ""Better Dig Two"" and Blake Shelton's ""Sangria"" while Ramsey co-penned Sam Hunt's ""Make You Miss Me"" and Kenny Chesney's ""Save It for a Rainy Day.""

One part beach one part hip-hop and one part pop with hooks galore Old Dominion's relentlessly cheery music is well-crafted modern country geared for the radio. The songs toss around some cliches (""candle in the wind"" ""jack of all trades master of none"") and an occasional cringe-worthy lyric (""happy as a ukulele"" in the new ""Hawaii"") but inevitably triumph with a catchy refrain.

The best lyric was the ballad-y ""My Heart Is a Bar"" a sobering metaphor with the punchline ""and I'm closing it down."" Other highlights were the sunny romantic road tune ""One Man Band"" the new ""Don't Forget Me"" with its dense full sound and ""I Can't"" spurred by Smith's potent Brenda Lee-like voice.

The breezy 19-song set begged for more ballads and more variety. Old D rocked out on ""Can't Get You"" with Tursi's aggressive guitar and on Chesney's spirited ""Save It for a Rainy Day"" with Ramsey truly owning it. However the beguiling casualness — from the musicians' off-the-retail-rack outfits to the relaxed beachy vibe of the music — had an undeniable appeal on a heartland Saturday night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9vbGQtZG9taW5pb24tYmxlbmRzLXRpbWUtdGVxdWlsYS0xNzA3NDA1MzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Dominion blends 'Time Tequila & Therapy' on anticipated new album,"What three ingredients fuel Old Dominion?

If the band's new album gives listeners any indication an Old Dominion cocktail consists of a pinch of time a shot of tequila and a sprinkle of therapy.

And that's why the chart-topping country-pop outfit named a new album ""Time Tequila & Therapy.""

""That title came from one of the songs 'No Hard Feelings'"" said singer Matthew Ramsey. ""That line encapsulates what we are as a band. Those three things are a big makeup of this band.""

For the latest effort the group retreated from Nashville to Asheville North Carolina for a three-week writing-recording session that yielded the 13-song release that tip-toes between the band's slick take on modern country-pop to '80s rock influence and one guest spot from a soul legend.

The band releases ""Time Tequila & Therapy"" Friday via Sony Music Nashville. The album follows a 2019 self-titled release that propelled the band to a pair of CMA Award wins and an ACM Award in 2020 for Song of the Year ""One Man Band.""

Old Dominion members Whitt Sellers Geoff Sprung Matthew Ramsey Trevor Rosen and Brad Tursi pose for a portrait Wednesday Sept. 1 2021 in Nashville Tenn.

""There's a lot of different vibes [on 'Time Tequila & Therapy]"" said multi-instrumentalist Trevor Rosen. ""A lot of the songs don't sound anything like each other but they all come cohesively into this album. I think that's what's pretty cool about it.""

In leaving Nashville Old Dominion — featuring members Rosen Ramsey guitarist Brad Tursi bassist Geoff Sprung drummer Whit Sellers — hoped to escape experiencing somewhat rushed recording sessions Ramsey said.

""The way we made this album has always been kind of a pipe dream for us or so we thought"" Ramsey said. ""We wanted to have time to actually create in the studio.""

He continued ""[We could] just live in the same spot and be creative from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed. We went in there with no songs pre-written. We would wake up every morning write a song and that afternoon record it.""

Tursi added: ""Whenever you first write a song you're pretty excited about it so you got to capitalize on that excitement and take it directly into the recording process. There was no time to think 'Is this song gonna be good forever?'""

Old Dominion hoped to return to Nashville with three to five songs said bassist Geoff Sprung. Instead they left North Carolina last fall with an album.

""Once the ball got rolling in the first couple of days we all lit up and realized this was going to be easily more than five songs"" Sprung said. ""And we ended up with a full album.""

'Time Tequila & Therapy' shows lighthearted moments from Old Dominion especially ""I Wanna Live In A House With You Forever"" a stripped-back track that teams the group's pop sensibilities with moments of whimsical Americana.

In the song Ramsey cheerfully sings ""A yard with a cat and a dog named 'Blue'/ A couple rug rats singing 'buckle my shoe'/ Don't need a window for a wonderful view/ I wanna live in a house with you forever.""

And the band created this moment of sincerity in-part out of satire Sellers said.

In a way the process sounds therapeutic — one in a handful of essential ingredients for Old Dominion.

""['Time Tequila' & Therapy'] really is a snapshot of the creative space that we were in for that amount of time"" Rosen said.

The consensus 4-star recruit touted by some recruiting services as the nation's best high school tight end prospect made his final 11 unofficial visits to State College according to the 247Sports recruiting service. His heart was with the team he grew up rooting for.



And that made it all the more difficult when Kuntz made the tough but necessary decision to transfer away from his beloved school. Penn State is at times referred to as ""Tight End U"" because the Nittany Lions recruit the best and make tight ends a huge part of their offense.



Kuntz a 6-foot-8 245-pound redshirt sophomore might end up in the NFL but he wasn't getting much playing time at Penn State.



""I love those guys"" he said of his former Penn State teammates. ""I'm texting them before a game and saying good luck and they're doing the same back to me.



""But you sometimes have to make hard decisions and I had to do what was best for me.""



The hard part was entering the transfer portal. The easy part was choosing Old Dominion as the place to finish out his career.



ODU coach Ricky Rahne helped recruit Kuntz both to Penn State and then ODU and four of the Monarchs' full-time coaches came with him from Penn State including offensive coordinator Kirk Campbell. ODU's offense is similar to what Rahne employed as offensive coordinator at Penn State and it clearly focuses on tight ends.



He also had a longstanding relationship with Dwight Galt IV director of sports performance to came to ODU from Penn State. ODU graduate assistant Michael Shuster was also his teammate at Penn State and at Camp Hill High School where they won a state championship together.



""There were coaches at other schools that I talked to"" Kuntz said. ""But honestly when I was breaking it all down Old Dominion became a no-brainer for me.



""Being familiar with the offense and with coaches here I had prior relationships with that was big. I know what kind of coaches they are.



""And listening to coach Rahne talking about the bonds you will have for the rest of your life with players and coaches I wanted those bonds to be with the people here.""



ODU tight ends coach Fontel Mines the former Virginia star who spent three seasons with the NFL's Chicago Bears said it wasn't quite as much of slam dunk as coaches had hoped. Several Power 5 schools went after Kuntz and in the end it came down to ODU and Arizona.



""I think the deciding factor for him was the relationships here"" Mines said. ""We were honest with him. We laid our plans for him but we told him he'd have to come in and earn playing time. It wasn't going to be given to him.""



It clearly wasn't. Kuntz entered fall practice at the bottom of the depth chart quite a comedown for a 4-star recruit from Penn State.



Kuntz's reaction when he saw the depth chart speaks volumes Mines said.



""He didn't blink"" Mines said. ""He didn't say anything. His body language didn't change.







""He was the same guy every single day. He comes out here every day and works hard. You're going to get out of football what you work for and he's grinded his butt off.""



The redshirt sophomore quickly moved up the depth chart and although he's only started twice he's been ODU's second-most most potent offensive weapon behind quarterback D.J. Mack Jr.



He caught a career high eight passes in last weekend's 28-21 loss at UTEP and with 24 receptions ranks fourth nationally among FBS tight ends in catches.



Because of his fame and his ability to make big plays it's taken just two home games for Kuntz to become a fan favorite. Whenever he catches a pass fans scream ""Kuuuunnntttzzz!"" in unison. And the instant connection with the fans is a big deal for a program that did not play football in 2019 and returned few players well-known among Monarch nation.



Kuntz grew up in small town Pennsylvania. Although his last name is German the largest ethnic group in Pennsylvania his father is Irish Catholic and as a child Kuntz was a Notre Dame fan.



""Sometimes when you're growing up you gravitate toward the attire your parents dress you in"" he said.



But that quickly changed when his brother Chris began playing for Penn State 12 years ago.



Kuntz grew up in a family of athletes. His father Francis played football at Maryland his mother Kathleen played basketball and ran track in high school. He has four siblings – like I said it's an Irish Catholic family. His three brothers – Francis Chris and Brandon – and sister Anna were also athletes.



The family lived in a modest home with two bathrooms – yes five kids used one bathroom – and after his sister was born the boys all bunked together in one room.



Back yard football and basketball games were of the no-call no foul variety.



""It was always competitive in our house"" he said. ""Whatever we did someone would usually end up crying from either getting hurt or getting their feelings hurt from losing.""



The four brothers jealously protected Anne against who she was dating. ""We were tough whenever she dated anyone"" Kuntz said. ""But she's married and we love the guy so that's all good.""



All five siblings are successful in life and Kuntz said that's because of his parents.



""With seven people in a little house there was always chaos"" he said. ""But I had a great home life. I didn't have a whole lot of struggles.""



Certainly not on the athletic field where he helped lead Camp Hill to two state football titles. He also lettered three times each in basketball and track and won a state title in the 110-meter hurdles which tells you all you need to know about his speed.



He's is as good in the classroom as he is in athletics. He was a National Honor Society member at Camp Hill and graduated from Penn State in three years with a degree in marketing.



Kuntz raised a few eyebrows last month when asked about the opulent facilities at Liberty University after the Monarchs lost to the Flames earlier this season.



His comments showed his blue-collar roots and mature sense of perspective.



""You can go a ton of different places throughout the country"" Kuntz said. ""You can go to Group of 5 schools Power 5 schools and everyone has nice shiny things.







""But 45 pounds is the same here as it is anywhere else.



""They've got some cool stuff here for sure. But that's all it is it looks cool. All that matters is the guys you've got in the locker room.



""You can have the nicest facilities in the country but if your coaches don't care about you how good could it really be?



""It's the people that make a football program. When you know you have coaches who love and care about you and want the absolute best for you not just in football but in life you don't want to do well just for yourself. You want to do well for your coaches.""



Which brings to mind another guy named Zack former ODU wide receiver Zach Pascal whose first name is spelled differently than Kuntz's but whose path to the NFL could be the same.



Had Pascal signed with a Power 5 school he has acknowledged he might not have played enough to develop into an NFL player. Pascal is now an integral part of the Indianapolis Colts' offense in part because he went to a school where he played early and often and in part like Kuntz because he worked hard.



That's a message Mines often delivers to recruits.



""Do you want to build a career or run out of a tunnel?"" Mines asked. ""If you want to go play in a 100000-seat stadium that's fine. But if you have an opportunity to play 60 or 70 plays a game and be a focal point of an offense why not?""



The Monarchs (1-4 0-1 Conference USA) travel to Marshall Saturday knowing their record could be far better.



""We've been beating ourselves with mistakes"" he said referring to turnovers and other mistakes that cost ODU victories against Buffalo and UTEP.



""This is a really hard-working team and we all really care. We believe in our coaches we believe in coach Rahne.



""Although we haven't had success in every game we know they've put us in the best position possible. But there are things we need to execute better as players.""



Kuntz's execution has improved with each game. Early on he had some dropped passes and struggled a bit blocking. Rahne said his blocking has consistently improved as have his hands.



In a 35-34 loss to Buffalo Kuntz leaped over two defensive backs to haul in a touchdown pass with 19 seconds left that gave the Monarchs a chance to send the game into overtime.



He followed that performance a week later by hauling in eight passes against UTEP.



Mines said he believes Kuntz will become an NFL prospect.







""He's doing everything he needs to do to put himself in that position"" Mines said. ""He has the attributes. He's big he's long and he's athletic. And he's pretty freaking strong too.



""He has things he needs to improve and he's working hard to improve on them. Having a little experience playing at that level there's no doubt in my mind that he can play at that level.""



ODU has the best group of tight ends in school history. Donta Anthony Jr. a 6-foot-6 244-pound junior is an outstanding blocker and the fact that he did not play last weekend might help explain why ODU's running game struggled at UTEP.



Isaiah Spencer is ODU's fourth-leading receiver with nine catches for 79 yards and two touchdowns. Kuntz is second on the team with 239 all-purpose yards and four of ODU's five TD passes were hauled in by tight ends.



ODU's tight ends have also stood out on special teams including AC White who returned a punt blocked by Spencer 11 yards for a touchdown against UTEP.



""Zack and Donta are both Alphas in the room and they both find different ways to lead"" Mines said. ""Zack is a little bit more vocal. He commands respect from the guys and he's earned it.



""He's a super selfless guy with no ego and just comes to work every day. Guys like Zack they're the ones you just love to coach.""

— By David Walsh

HUNTINGTON W.Va. — Marshall packed nearly all its scoring into a compressed time frame as quarterback Grant Wells threw two passes to turn a 13-6 deficit in the final minute into a 20-13 overtime win over a stunned Old Dominion team Saturday at Joan C. Edwards Stadium.

The Thundering Herd avoided its first homecoming loss since 2012 and ended a three-game losing streak when a fourth-down pass from D.J. Mack Jr. to tight end Zack Kuntz on a fade route fell incomplete. Marshall players and fans in the crowd of 24172 went crazy while the Monarchs suffered their third-straight agonizing defeat (Buffalo UTEP and Saturday).

“We got into this position as a team” first-year Herd coach Charles Huff said. “We’ve got to get out of it as a team. A lot of discipline issues. The guys kept playing. You got to see today that this team will fight. This is what Marshall’s all about. Early in the morning the Hal Greer thing. We’ve got to focus on what we need to do consistently. If we do we’ve got a chance.”

Safety Brandon Drayton who returned from injury for this game came up the middle on a rush and forced Mack to hurry his pass.

Wells’ game-winning touchdown pass went 22 yards to Shadeed Ahmed on the first series of the extra session.

Marshall (3-3 1-1) got its only touchdown in regulation when Wells hooked up with Willie Johnson for a 52-yard strike as he won in man coverage with 32 seconds left to play. Wells hit 5-of-7 passes for 97 yards on the drive (due to penalties).

Old Dominion got a break on the ensuing kickoff when the Herd’s Owen Porter got called for targeting for a first down at its 48. The Monarchs moved to the Herd 41 and Nick Price came on a for a potential game-winning field goal try from 58 yards but it fell a couple of yards shot.

“When that ball left his foot at that point to have that many mistakes play that sloppy we’re at the mercy of the gods” Huff said. “There’s ebb and flows in a season. This time we ended up on the right end.”

In the first half Old Dominion (1-5 0-2) got the only TD on a 33-yard pass from Mack to former West Virginia wideout Ali Jennings late in the first period. Price connected on a 47-yard field goal with 5:43 left in the second period for a 10-3 lead at the break. He drilled a 45-yarder with 2:37 left in the fourth to extend the lead to 13-6.

Shane Ciucci provided the Herd with six points on field goals of 42 yards in the first period and 22 yards just before the half.

On Marshall’s first possession Wells was brought down for a loss of 1 yard on fourth-and-1 from the ODU 21.

Marshall had a third-quarter drive halted at the ODU 21 on an interception by R’Tarriun Johnson. Wells had another pass picked off by Roger Cray in ODU territory. That play prompted some boos from the crowd.

Huff never thought about making a switch. He even talked about a call he had with former Herd quarterback Chad Pennington earlier in the week when Pennington recalled he had five interceptions once in a game.

“He makes mistakes I’ve got his back” Huff said of Wells who is from Charleston. “He’s our quarterback. You saw what he could do today. We’re riding with him. Great players step in in big-time moments. You can’t play a perfect game but you play the next play perfect.

“He’s here until somebody passes him something happens in practice. Tom Brady throws interceptions. Patrick Mahomes throws interceptions. Turnovers are not OK. Hopefully he knows I’ve had his back since he got here.”

At the start of the fourth period Steven Gilmore picked off a desperation pass by Mack at the 1-yard line to end the threat. There were several other possessions where the Monarchs had a short field but could get no points. The Marshall defense has given up 13 points in the last six quarters plus an overtime.

“The defense responded” Huff said. “They’re starting to play the way most people expected. We can’t keep putting them (defense) in those positions. A big stop at the end. We’re starting to see the type of defense we can be.”

ODU started its next drive near midfield but again lost yards and nearly a fumble before having to punt.

Marshall later drove into ODU territory but Ali lost 4 yards on a third-down run and the Herd went for it again. This time the Monarchs broke up a pass intended for Xavier Gaines with 7:42 left.

The drama at the end seemed to awaken the Herd crowd. There had been little to cheer about until then.

“Confidence is something’s that built” Huff said. “You’ve got to have some returns. Today I think was one.”

On the game-tying drive Wells found Ahmed for gains of 16 and 14 yards. Wells got sacked on the play before he hit Johnson.

Marshall returns to action on Friday at North Texas. Old Dominion is home Saturday to Western Kentucky when the Monarchs try again to end a four-game skid.

Wells completed 30-of-46 attempts for 299 yards. Ahmed caught 10 passes for 77 yards. Rasheen Ali netted 77 yards rushing.

Blake Watson led Old Dominion’s ground game with a career-best 168 yards on 26 carries. Mack went 9-for-22 for just 106 yards and two interceptions. Kuntz the heralded transfer from Penn State caught five passes.

On defense the Monarchs limited the Herd to 390 total yards 150 below its season average.

Marshall is now 27-9 in homecoming games including a nine-game win streak.

Marshall officials recognized the 1996 Herd team before the game and introduced players who returned. The Herd went 15-0 and won I-AA national title that year.

Greer an NBA All-Star had the dedication of the Hal Greer Memorial Plaza featuring a huge statue of Greer just outside one entrance on Third Avenue to Cam Henderson Center just before kickoff. Greer who played guard is from Huntington attended Douglass High School and was the first black athlete recruited to Marshall back in the mid-1950s. He played from 1958-73 with the Syracuse Nationals and then Philadelphia 76ers when they moved. He was voted one of the top 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996."

Industry officials have separately called for a pan-European electronics strategy but until a recent EU proposal becomes concrete legislation the long-term effects on military programs may prove difficult to gauge.

EU leaders recently announced the European Chips Act meant to support increased research design and testing capacity as well as ensure national investments are coordinated with those of the broader union.

“The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem including production that ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her Sept. 15 state of the union address in Strasbourg France. The ultimate goal is to increase Europe’s global share of semiconductor production to 20 percent by 2030 per the commission .

Digital technology is the “make-or-break issue” facing the European market today and “there is no digital without chips” she said. While the global demand for semiconductors has exploded the European share of designing and manufacturing those microchips has diminished and nations have largely become reliant on Asian-made products she noted.

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global microchip shortage that prompted other governments including the United States to introduce a domestic semiconductor strategy as the chips enable systems in virtually every sector from the military to health care and from computers to clean energy.

Nations are developing interconnected highly software-enabled platforms to operate in increasingly joint environments and “digitalization” has become a buzzword across the global defense sphere. In Europe those platforms include the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System program that would ultimately feature a next-generation fighter unmanned drones and a slew of sophisticated sensors and weaponry all interconnected with each other.

Meanwhile NATO has highlighted “ emerging and disruptive technologies” as a key focus area for the alliance. Many of the technologies it cited will rely on digitalization.

The United Kingdom Sweden and Italy are also co-researching and developing cutting-edge technologies to enable sixth-generation air combat platforms under their own initiative dubbed Tempest by the British. Industry and government officials involved in that effort were asked about domestic electronics sourcing during a panel discussion at the biennial DSEI conference in London last month which took place the same day as von der Leyen’s speech.

A conference attendee asked whether the British-led effort would rely on European-sourced and -manufactured parts rather than Chinese or American electronics. Richard Berthon director of future combat air for the British Defence Ministry said his team will access the global market for parts “where it’s cost-effective [and] where our sovereignty and security are not impaired.”

Berthon emphasized that the program office is taking security “incredibly seriously” and that the entire Tempest enterprise “is all about ensuring that for the U.K. we’ve got the technology we need the skills we need that we can secure those and we can sustain them over time.”

Another panelist Saab Deputy chief executive Anders Carp called for a “pan-European or pan-Western strategy” to help governments and their industry partners prioritize key technology research and development efforts. Saab represents Swedish industry participation in the British-led aircraft push.

The electronics sourcing conversation is broader than just one such technology initiative — or the fighter aircraft portfolio — and could encompass some other mix of trusted allies and partners Carp noted. However it’s organized “there should be some sort of strategy in place to look at how do we make sure that we don’t end up being reliant on someone ... that we don’t want to be reliant on or may not want to be reliant on in the future” he said in an interview with Defense News.

When it comes to the broader Tempest effort industry partners are discussing these issues “at a headline level” as the program’s design phase remains in the study stages Carp noted.

Multiple European industry representatives declined to comment on the European Chips Act citing the recent nature of the initiative. The EU has yet to announce when the European Chips Act might be formally unveiled or voted on.

Thierry Breton the European commissioner for internal markets laid out proposed elements of the effort in a Sept. 15 LinkedIn post  including building European-based fabrication plants and establishing a European semiconductor fund.

With 27 EU members there will be divergent opinions involved in developing the legislation and “a lot of different interests on the ground level” said Dan Darling a senior analyst for Forecast International a U.S. market intelligence firm.

The focus on domestic semiconductor sovereignty makes sense but the EU needs to move from “a declaration of vision and intent” to actual momentum he said. Europe is home to a plethora of defense electronics companies and a domestic supply of resources is sure to trickle up eventually he added.

That being said European defense contractors have established business relationships with overseas chip suppliers — such as Samsung in South Korea and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — not the existing suppliers on their own continent said Franz-Stefan Gady a cyber space and future conflict fellow at the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies.

“At the moment European advanced semiconductor manufacturers produce low-volume niche products with limited military applicability” he told Defense News. Some such niche products could make headway in Europe like those related to aerospace sensors or security chips for crypto processing and other cybersecurity technologies.

But it’s unlikely European chipmakers would supply individual European nations’ defense industries over the next two decades as the expense would be too great even with strong political will behind the effort Gady added.

“There is no real market and very little genuine demand from the European defense industry for indigenous European products en masse despite paying lip service to the concept of strategic autonomy” he said.

Von der Leyen who previously served as Germany’s defense minister acknowledged in her speech that boosting sovereign semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will be a “daunting task” but one required at this point in time to support both European competitiveness and technological sovereignty.

“Let’s put all of our focus on it” she said.

The holidays are coming and that supply-chain crisis you may have heard about is going to make shopping miserable.

Hundreds of thousands of ships full of imported goods from Asia are piled up outside of Los Angeles and other major ports. American automakers don't have enough semiconductor chips to make as many cars as people want to buy. Every other product — from toys to computers — that needs a chip will be in short supply too.

What's often overlooked is that official US government policy is oriented around making these exact chips harder for China to manufacture. US President Joe Biden is continuing a ""trade war"" with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that began under Donald Trump and he's not blinking as the supply-chain crisis endangers Christmas.

The ships-and-chips crisis is another way America and China are on the verge of ""decoupling""as the Trump-era trade war hardens into a new status quo. People hoping for an easier holiday shopping season are overlooking how long and painful this transition could be.

The US-China trade war has left the US short on electronics and cars

The US accounts for just 12% of global chip production and Asia accounts for a whopping 75%. according to a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association which projects China becoming the largest chip producer by 2030.

But Donald Trump ran on a largely anti-globalization platform in 2016 with a particular focus on how America is getting ""ripped off"" by China. Chips were an area of leverage.

China isn't just an exporter of chips it also needs a steady supply of particularly sophisticated integrated circuits from other countries including the US to fuel its consumer electronics manufacturing machine. In the past decade China has been importing more and more chips from the US because it needs to insert them into electronic products that get shipped back around the world.

China is generations behind in making the most cutting-edge chips. For instance the world's largest semiconductor firm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) is developing ultra-small chips of 3-nanometers and smaller. China's largest chip firm Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) just began making 14-nm chips in late 2019.

The US is determined to make China's manufacturing efforts difficult.

Last September the Trump White House imposed export restrictions on SMIC forcing it to source parts elsewhere and reconfiguring supply chains in the process.

Meanwhile companies buying their chips from SMIC had to go elsewhere only to find that alternative chipmakers were already at full capacity. America struggled to rely on its own production as lead US semiconductor giant Intel struggled with its own production problems. And some firms have been hoarding chips claims TSMC's CEO Mark Lui making the chip crunch even worse.

The Biden administration has been enlisting its allies to freeze China out from the technological equipment it needs making sourcing even harder for the country.

This all happened after the pandemic shut down semiconductor manufacturing operations for months in 2020 leading to spikes in the prices of new and used cars and shortages of all kinds of electronics.

Biden isn't changing course

Those hoping for the Biden administration to reject Trump's playbook have been sorely disappointed.

The president has done little to alter his predecessor's aggressive trade stance since taking office eight months ago. Katherine Tai the US trade representative confirmed the tough policy would continue in a Monday speech.

""For too long China's lack of adherence to global trading norms has undercut the prosperity of Americans and others around the world"" she said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies adding it's ""increasingly clear"" that China hasn't addressed the US's concerns.

Biden said earlier this year the key to navigating the current chip shortage crisis is to invest in the country's chip production allotting $50 billion in his infrastructure plan for domestic chip manufacturing incentives. ""The plan I propose will protect our supply chain and revitalize American manufacturing"" he said in April during a virtual summit with auto executives and other business leaders. Of course Biden was talking about ""our supply chain"" — meaning an American one — and not the globalized ""Chimerica"" supply chain of the early 2000s.

The Biden administration recently made countering China the centerpiece of its foreign policy agenda even reorganizing the CIA to make China a principal focus. The CIA described the country as a ""key rival.""

The transition to homegrown chip production will be more easily said than done. American manufacturers aren't used to expensive American labor so they'll need time to wean off foreign contract manufacturers Recode noted. Meanwhile it can take years to get new production facilities off the ground.

Americans then are set to endure a lengthy standoff. A JPMorgan note on Friday by a team led by Jahangir Aziz stated that US-China trade tensions are set to remain a ""palpable risk"" as China is in the midst of an ""economic-policy regime shift"" and ""intensified US-China tension since 2018 has entered a relative freeze.""

Speaking on Friday after a disappointing jobs report underscored the difficulties facing the economic recovery Biden advocated again for his infrastructure plan which is struggling to make its way through Congress.

He stressed the need for America to regain leadership and become more ""competitive"" and he highlighted one country outcompeting and outspending America on its infrastructure and economy: that country was China.

Taiwan's TSMC is the world's top foundry player

Samsung Electronics Co. caught its global semiconductor competitors off guard last week at the Samsung Foundry Forum 2021 with its announced plan to mass produce 2 nanometer chips from 2025. Samsung had long not unveiled a detailed roadmap for semiconductor micro-process production largely because the imprisonment of its vice chairman Jay Y. Lee had delayed major investment decisions. Meanwhile within the last year bigger foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and US tech giant Intel Corp. announced massive investment plans on the 3-nanometer process node.Samsung had been predicted to join the race for the 3-nm process but instead revealed a plan for 2mn chips that could help the company overtake TSMC sooner than expected.TSMC is the global foundry leader with an estimated market share of 53-56%. Samsung the second-largest foundry maker had until recently occupied about 17%.But the gap between the two companies has been widening recently. TSMC raised its market share to 58% in the second quarter from 55% in the first while Samsung’s shares fell to 14% from 17% during the same period according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.While the Taiwanese company was preparing aggressive measures to expand the market Samsung postponed investment plans due to the absence of its top decision-maker. Earlier this year TSMC announced it will invest $100 billion in the foundry business over the next three years. It is set to start operations of a 5 nm factory in the US state of Arizona from 2024 while considering a 28 nm chip plant for automotive semiconductors in Japan. The leader was known to be discussing a production line in Germany.

TSMC’s bold plans came as the global foundry industry is rapidly growing with more and more companies seeking self-sufficiency in semiconductors.Apple Inc. is slated to release a laptop equipped with the M1X its own system chipsets soon. In August Tesla Inc. unveiled the D1 chip for artificial intelligence (AI). Google recently launched the Tensor an application processor designed in-house for its Pixel phones. Carmakers which have been suffering from the ongoing automotive chip shortage are also seeking to develop the components by themselves.The global foundry market is forecast to grow to $130.3 billion in 2027 from $83.7 billion this year according to a tech industry researcher Omdia.The bullish outlook prompted Intel to resume the foundry business  industry sources analyzed. In July Intel unveiled plans to produce the 20A chips using circuitry measured at 2 nm in 2024 and 1.8 nm chips in 2025 although the industry was skeptical if the company will able to secure a stable yield or ratio of properly working products of 2 nm or below.Samsung’s plan for mass production of micro-process chip is likely to restructure the global foundry market. The company aims to apply its proprietary gate-all-around (GAA) transistor architecture a key technology that improves electrostatic properties that translate into increased performance reduced power and optimal chip design according to Samsung.

That is expected to help Samsung attract major clients such as Google Qualcomm and Apple that are seeking micro-process products since TSMC has yet to unveil its roadmap for 2 nm chip volume production analysts said.Samsung also said it will begin mass production of its first-generation 3 nm chips in the first half of next year compared to July 2022 when TSMC is known to be manufacturing the products in large quantities.The South Korean tech giant is predicted to expand its global foundry market share. Samsung’s share is forecast to reach up to 40% this year in the global market for chips of 10 nm or below according to Taiwan-based market researcher TrendForce.“Smartphone makers in addition to server producers are preferring micro-process chips with better performance and power efficiency” said an industry source. “Increasing demand for chips of 10 nm or below will narrow the gap between Samsung and TSMC.”Sin-Young Park at nyusos@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L3RlY2gvMjAyNC8wNC8xMjlfMzE2Nzc2Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL20ua29yZWF0aW1lcy5jby5rci9wYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlLmFtcC5hc3A_bmV3c0lkeD0zMTY3NzY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SK hynix joins China's chip cluster project,"A ceremony commemorating the completion of SK hynix's DRAM plant is held in Wuxi China April 18 2019. Courtesy of SK hynix



By Baek Byung-yeul



SK hynix will jointly invest a total of $310 million together with Chinese companies to create a semiconductor industrial complex in Wuxi Jiangsu Province where its DRAM memory chip plant is located.



According to the Hong Kong-based news outlet The South China Morning Post on Oct. 8 the local government of Wuxi began construction of the new industrial complex adding that there were no details about the facilities to be built on the site or its completion date.



SK hynix has joined the local government's project in an effort to strengthen cooperation with local companies and communities as well as improve its supply chain. The investment will be used to build semiconductor infrastructure in the complex and SK hynix elaborated that the investment will not be used to expand its existing plant there.



In Wuxi SK hynix has operated a chip-manufacturing plant since 2006. The company added another DRAM manufacturing plant there in 2019 investing 950 billion won. With the new factory called C2F SK said that it can increase its monthly-production capacity to 180000 wafers. Wafers are used in the chip-making process as a substrate for chips.



The industrial complex development plan is gaining attention as the project was announced at this time when China is focusing on attracting investments by offering various benefits including tax credits and subsidies.



The South China Morning Post said that the development project ""reflects the continued massive investment in semiconductor-related initiatives as Beijing is determined to increase the nation's self-reliance amid a fierce tech rivalry between China and the United States as well as a global chip shortage.""

Now one of the most recognizable companies in those fields is taking its headquarters elsewhere. Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California. (AP)

Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California the electric-car maker’s home since its founding 18 years ago. It joins companies including Oracle Corp. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Charles Schwab Corp. in relocating their corporate hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state in the past two years.

They all are keeping a large presence in California underscoring the importance of the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the shifts of companies born and bred in the state show how many of its intractable issues from the nation’s most expensive housing costs to high taxes and climate catastrophes pose a threat to continued economic growth if corporate departures multiply.

And losing Tesla -- a long-shot clean-energy startup that upended the auto industry and embodies much of the state’s economy -- delivers a particularly symbolic hit.

“Tesla as a brand represents not just Motor City USA it represents Silicon Valley and Hollywood” said David McCuan chairman of Sonoma State University’s political science department. “Tesla is really a California-centric thing. But Elon Musk represents something larger than life and that’s really Texas.”

Musk Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer pointed to some of California’s issues when he announced the move from Palo Alto to Austin. The company’s Fremont factory is jammed with workers and equipment with little space to build around it.

The billionaire clashed with local public officials over lockdown policies during the pandemic. He defied local orders by restarting production at the plant. Musk said that Tesla isn’t leaving California and will continue to expand there – but he made clear that he saw more opportunity for growth in Texas.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away” said Musk who last year said he was moving to Texas himself. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”

That region in particular has long been seen by companies as a difficult place to do business. Employers have had to offer ever more generous compensation so that workers can keep up with sky-high housing costs. Many workers have simply been priced out of living near their work forcing them into long commutes before the pandemic.

California’s Association of Realtors forecast this week that the state’s median single-family home price will jump to a record $834000 next year more than twice the national level. The median sale price of homes in Santa Clara County -- the heart of Silicon Valley – was $1.66 million in August an almost 11% jump from a year earlier according to the industry group.

Newsom – a Democrat who last month beat back a recall effort that was in part driven by anger about the state’s cost of living crime and homelessness -- on Friday emphasized that the state has created more than 750000 jobs since January. He said California’s policies encouraging innovation and investment in electric vehicles contributed to Tesla and Musk’s success.

“Our regulatory environment helped create that company and grow that company” Newsom said at a press briefing. “I have reverence and deep respect for that individual. But I also have deep reverence and respect for this state and what we’ve done.”

Strong Economy

Tesla’s move is more a symbolic blow than an economic one. While the tech industry is a significant part of the state’s economy California reaps the rewards of other lucrative sectors such as trade and entertainment. The state has notched a $75.7 billion surplus and revenue is again running ahead of projections -- by about 18% -- for the fiscal year that began in July. Its credit ratings are at their highest in about two decades.

Silicon Valley also remains a magnet for tech investment. In the third quarter there was a record $27.1 billion worth of venture deals struck in the region a 17% increase from the previous three months according to a recent report on venture capital from CBInsight.

“The tech sector is so big that Texas can grow and we can grow” said Stephen Levy director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. But “the exoduses do have a real concern if they’re based on the high housing prices and lack of housing.”

The state has few answers for how to fix its most pressing problems. Construction remains way below Newsom’s goals for addressing the housing shortage. Taxes are unlikely to go down. Climate change has contributed not only to record-setting wildfires but drought power outages and smoke-filled air.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise whose Silicon Valley roots go back to the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in a Palo Alto garage eight decades ago said last year that cutting real estate costs were a major factor in its decision to relocate to Houston already its largest US employment hub. The company which has maintained much of its tech and innovation workforce in the Bay Area also said the pandemic and the changing nature of work contributed to the move.

In many ways Covid proved to companies that they could effectively operate elsewhere or at least with a smaller footprint. Silicon Valley’s office vacancy rate has continued to climb reaching 15 per cent in the third quarter as more employers looked to offload space they’d previously leased according to real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

The region still remains key for the tech industry with its depth of talent and access to renowned universities said Robert Sammons senior director of research at Cushman in San Francisco.

“Certainly the business climate has room for improvement” Sammons said citing regulations and the high cost of living. “Those are all difficulties that California has and has had for years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvbmV3LXN0dWR5LWNoZWFwZXN0LW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXN0YXRlcy10by1ydW4tYS1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi0yMDIxLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9uZXctc3R1ZHktY2hlYXBlc3QtbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtc3RhdGVzLXRvLXJ1bi1hLWJ1c2luZXNzLWluLTIwMjEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These are the cheapest and most expensive states for running a business in 2021,"Running your own business is always a challenge. It might be slightly easier in the Lone Star State.

According to a new study from enterprise cloud software platform Approve.com Texas is the country's least expensive state for running a business. The study weighed factors like average annual wage top corporate income tax rate and average prices for utilities like electricity and internet. The study included the District of Columbia but omitted Alaska and Hawaii due to ""unavailable data.""

Here are the country's five least expensive states for running a business according to the study:

Texas Oklahoma Kentucky Nevada Georgia

Texas tops the list thanks to its tax policies and utilities costs. The state does tax businesses with annual revenues above $1180000 at a rate of 0.375% but its corporate tax laws are considered to be among the friendliest to businesses in the country.

Perhaps that's why Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk announced last week that his company is moving its headquarters from Palo Alto California to Austin. Tesla will join Oracle Hewlett Packard Enterprise Charles Schwab and plenty of other companies that have moved their headquarters to Texas recently.

Of course it's not always only about the money.

However high-risk groups continued to experience increased rates of severe illness after one dose.

Study: COVID-19 Hospital Admissions and Deaths After BNT162b2 And Chadox1 NCov-19 Vaccinations In 2·57 Million People In Scotland (EAVE II): A Prospective Cohort Study. Image Credit: Marc Bruxelle / Shutterstock.com

Background

The United Kingdom has accounted for over 8.1 million cases of COVID-19 out of the global total of more than 237 million. Over 138000 people have died in the U.K. despite the strict implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing mask use lockdowns hand washing and restrictions on public gatherings.

Undoubtedly these measures reduced viral transmission but at a high cost to the ordinary quality of life. Vaccination was thus perceived to be the only way back to a semblance of normal life.

COVID-19 vaccination in Scotland began in December 2020 with the deployment of the Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A month later the Oxford–AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was rolled out. Both vaccines have a two-dose prime-boost regimen.

Cases in Scotland began to peak from the start of December 2020 to a peak on January 4 2021 which was when the second vaccine was deployed. In view of vaccine shortages the U.K. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) began to offer a single dose and then a second dose after three months. The aim of the delayed second dose was to extend vaccine coverage to a greater proportion of the susceptible population.

People aged 80 years or above those in long-term care facilities health workers and care workers were prioritized in the first vaccination round followed by those deemed to be at higher risk on a clinical basis. Eligibility was then progressively extended to younger age groups.

“Although this advice differs from trial evidence and manufacturers guidance on timing between doses data from mathematical models suggest that this approach has the potential to contain the pandemic quickly achieving optimal public health benefit and could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.”

While the Pfizer vaccine prevented 95% of symptomatic COVID-19 the AstraZeneca vaccine showed a real-world efficacy of 70%. In a real-world study however the corresponding figures were 91% and 88% respectively for hospitalizations at about one month from first-dose vaccination.

Breakthrough infections are still possible and a fraction of these may become severe. It is necessary to understand how frequent breakthrough infections occur in order to shape clinical practice and public health interventions including vaccination policies.

The current study assessed COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths at 14 or more days from the first dose of either vaccine in relation to clinical and demographic factors. Otherwise known as the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform this was an open real-time and prospective observational study of a national population that utilized data on vaccination primary health care laboratory tests hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

Study findings

The researchers found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was administered to a third of the cohort with the rest receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. During the study period 27% also received the second dose with approximately 60% getting the Pfizer vaccine.

Of the over 2.5 million individuals in this cohort about 1200 were hospitalized or died 14 or more days from the first dose. More specifically 230 of these were in-hospital deaths.

The event rate of almost 5 for every 1000 person-years with one dose of the vaccine dropped to less than 1/1000 person-years after two doses. The number of events was comparable with both vaccines. The differences were mostly in the oldest age group at 80 years or more who experienced 63 events per 1000 person-years after one dose of the Pfizer as compared with 11 with the ChAdOx1 vaccine.

Risk factors for severe outcomes with COVID-19 included age a greater number of underlying illnesses history of hospitalization within the month prior to vaccination working in a place or profession with a high risk of exposure long-term care facility residence residence in a more deprived locality male sex and ex-smoker history. Those who had been previously infected with the virus were unlikely to have severe outcomes.

The highest risk for severe outcomes occurred with symptomatic infection during the 2-3 weeks after the first dose. Comorbidities including chronic renal disease asthma heart failure type 2 diabetes heart disease and dementia increased the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 following vaccination. However asthma and heart failure were not associated with worse outcomes when the Pfizer vaccine group was separately analyzed.

Implications

The results of the current study show that hospitalizations and deaths among low-risk individuals were low after one dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine at less than 0.05% overall. However high-risk groups continued to show an elevated risk compared to the whole group.

Interestingly ex-smokers were the only group with a higher risk of severe outcomes in the vaccinated population who were not represented in the unvaccinated high-risk population. The protective effect of immunity associated with a prior episode of COVID-19 was clearly observable. Earlier work corroborates this showing that one dose of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine in a previously infected person is as protective as two doses in a COVID-19-naïve individual.

The rate of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 was 4.6 events per 1000 person-years among the mostly high-risk older population. This was comparable to 8.57 events per 1000 person-years among the unvaccinated much younger and low-risk population in Scotland. The magnitude of the reduction in severe disease should be understood in this context especially with a high incidence of COVID-19 during the study period but with a lockdown in place.

The news from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech underscored a realization by scientists that the virus is changing more quickly than once thought and may well continue to develop in ways that help it elude the vaccines being deployed worldwide.

The announcements arrived even as President Biden banned travel to the United States from South Africa beginning on Saturday in hopes of stanching the spread of one variant. And Merck a leading drug company on Monday abandoned two experimental coronavirus vaccines altogether saying they did not produce a strong enough immune response against the original version of the virus.

Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech both said their vaccines were effective against new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa. But they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wOS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9ndXlhbmEtcmVjZWl2ZXMtMTAwMDAwLW1vcmUtcGZpemVyLWRvc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana receives 100000 more Pfizer doses,"Guyana on Friday received 100620 doses of the Pfizer vaccine that are intended for inoculation of pregnant women and lactating mothers.

The doses which came as a donation from the United States through the COVAX facility were received by the Minister of Health and the United States Ambassador among other officials at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport.

At a press conference held at the airport following the arrival US Ambassador Sarah-Ann Lynch stated that the donation adds to the others that have already been provided to Guyana through the facility. At this stage she noted the United States has donated over 260000 doses so far.

“For the United States… we will continue to look for opportunity to donate through COVAX. We will continue those contributions and also look for other opportunities for bilateral donations” Lynch stated.

Also present was Pan American Health Organisation/World Health Organisation (PAHO/ WHO) representative to Guyana Dr. Luis Codina who stated that the Pfizer vaccine has so far been utilized in a number of countries for the inoculation of persons from the age of 12 to 18 even as some other vaccines are currently under study for children.

Dr. Codina added that it is important for the ministry to continue its inoculation programme and as a result he commended the work that the Health Ministry has been doing as it related to inoculation thus far.

Meanwhile Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony during the press conference expressed his gratitude for the donation of the vaccines and added that Guyana’s inoculation programme against COVID-19 would not have been where it currently is without the support from other countries and other donations.

“…We would not have been where we are today so your support has been integral in the successes that we have achieved we want to thank you and thank your respective governments” he said while adding that Guyana has shared a special partnership with the United States during different stages of the pandemic.

He went on to note that the United States has also assisted in Guyana’s preparation to receive and even store Pfizer vaccines and others like it. Anthony said that while some thought that it was a long shot and that Guyana would not get the Pfizer vaccine the ministry still made preparations to be able to store all types of vaccines.

“…When we reached out to the US government and said can we work with you to get some cold storage for the Pfizer types of vaccines they said why not lets work on it and we were very happy to receive that as we prepared for the vaccines” Anthony said.

When Stabroek News asked whether the government has any intentions of expanding the administration of the United States Food and Drug Adminis-tration (FDA) approved vaccine to the general population the minister noted that they have selected sections of the population to receive the vaccine.

He mentioned that the first set of Pfizer vaccines that were received was allocated to the adolescent population and is expected to cover that cohort while the newest vaccine shipment is expected to cover those pregnant and lactating mothers.

“…This set we were anticipating it and that’s why we have now extended to pregnant women and breastfeeding women and our birth cohort in a given year is about 14000 to 15000 women” he said while adding that with that set of persons along with breast feeding women it is expected that this tranche of vaccines would cover that section of the population.

Additionally he mentioned that authorities also anticipate the emergency approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine for persons aged 5 to 11 and as a result the next tranche of vaccines will be allocated to that set of persons. He noted “With the anticipation that we will be extending to the 11 to 5 when we get the next set of vaccines that will go to that age cohort. Of course with the 11 to 5 we anticipate that the dosage would be smaller so with the same amounts of vaccines you will be able to do more children.”

Once those selected populations for those vaccines have been exhausted the minister said then the authorities will look at expanding to other sections.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS90aGFpbGFuZC9nZW5lcmFsLzIxOTQ5MjMvZ292dC1zbGFtcy1wZml6ZXItamFiLWlzLWEta2lsbGVyLWNsYWlt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Govt slams ""Pfizer jab is a killer"" claim","Govt slams 'Pfizer jab is a killer' claim

The government has condemned a claim that the Pfizer mRNA Covid-19 vaccine being offered to students aged 12-17 as part of the plan to reopen schools in November will have fatal consequences for all recipients within two years.

In a message spread via the Line app by several teenage groups campaigning against the Pfizer vaccination programme for young people it was claimed the vaccine was a tool for committing genocide against young people as they would eventually die within two years if injected with the vaccine said Dr Chawetsan Namwat director of the Emergency Health Hazard and Disease Control Division.

This claim is believed to have fuelled fears among the parents of many students who appear reluctant to give their consent to have their children vaccinated he said.

Dr Chawetsan insisted that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine supplied by the US-based Pfizer Inc and Germany-based BioNTech SE has been proven to meet the safety standards in vaccine development and production and was being used widely in these two countries.

In Thailand the first batch of 1.8 million doses of the vaccine has already been distributed to the provinces for the about 3.6 million young people who have signed up to be vaccinated he said. About 1.5 million more doses will follow next week while more supplies of the same vaccine will come later he said.

According to the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) so far just over 150000 students have received their first jab.

So far three cases of heart muscle inflammation a rare severe side effect of the mRNA vaccine have been found among these recipients and all of them have recovered after prompt treatment said Dr Sopon Iamsirithaworn deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control.

Dr Chawetsan said the vaccination of school students isn't the main criterion for allowing schools to resume onsite learning their compliance with Covid-19 control regulations is.

The regulation require nearly all school staff to be fully vaccinated students being prohibited from gathering in large groups sports competitions being banned everyone being requiring to wear a mask and maintain social distancing while in schools he said.

Office of the Basic Education Commission chief Amporn Pinasa previously said vaccination coverage must be at least 85% for schools looking to resume onsite learning."

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Why not consider working in Poland?

In recent years there have been a rising number of people moving to Poland for work. Quoting preliminary findings from a study by Statistics Poland (GUS) a government agency Notes from Poland said over two million foreigners were living in Poland making up around 5% of the country’s population at the end of 2019.

They add that Poland’s labour ministry data showed that in 2019 there was a further 35% increase in the number of work permits issued to immigrants from outside the EU. It’s worth noting that precise figures for the overall number of immigrants in the country have been hard to come by but these data suggest a somewhat positive sentiment towards Poland for work opportunities.

Meanwhile the London School of Economics notes that in 2020 Poland’s GDP contracted by “only” 3.5% significantly less than the OECD average of 5.5%. This was a stark contrast to the UK where the figure stood at 9.9%. They note that while unemployment rates have soared across Europe the official Polish figures have hardly budged and are the lowest in the EU according to the latest Eurostat figures.

The Polish economy was also performing well before the pandemic struck.

An increasing number of work permits being issued to migrants aside Poland is rich in history steeped with centuries of culture and tradition that makes the country appealing for those without Polish roots to settle in the country for job opportunities.

Coupled with the fact that the cost of living in Poland is cheaper than other countries in the EU in addition to being home to a wealth of natural beauty that makes outdoor adventures ideal for the adventurer at heart many cities have it all.

Here are three cities that make working in Poland a thing you won’t regret:

Wrocław

There are many reasons why Wrocław was awarded the title of one of the best destinations in Europe in 2018. Here architectural wonders rivers and more have dubbed it “the Venice of the North”.

There are numerous entertainment centres bars and clubs where people can let off some steam after a busy day. The city also has a well-developed network of public transport.

The city has a transportation system that connects it with the rest of Poland and neighbouring countries including Germany and the Czech Republic.

While the coronavirus pandemic which has been raging for the past two years has claimed more than 45 million lives around the world so far smoking still remains relatively fatal as it is killing more than eight million people annually.

Health authorities are still grappling to come up with appropriate policies to reduce fatalities.

In 2005 the World Health Organisation came up with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) as a response to the “tobacco epidemic”.

It currently has 168 signatories including Zimbabwe.

Scientists however claim that although the FCTC has managed to reduce the prevalence of smoking the rate of decline has recently begun to stall which essentially calls for new additional measures to deal with the scourge.

“In terms of regulation in Africa most of our governments were being informed by what comes from the WHO’s policy framework” said Dr Kgosi Letlape the current president of the Africa Medical Association (AMA) and co-founder of the Africa Harm Reduction Alliance (AHRA) at the recent 4th Scientific Summit on Harm Reduction that was held virtually.

“But what we need to note and understand is that framework convention for tobacco control was clearly focused on combustible cigarettes and the entire regime that it prescribes was to deal with combustible cigarettes. The nations that are signatories; that have adopted those mechanisms and are implementing them have seen a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in their nations.”

Difficulties

Dr Letlape however noted that the FCTC has inherent limitations since it focuses solely on combustible cigarettes and does not take into consideration the efficacy of safer alternatives that significantly reduce the harm caused by tobacco.

While the focus was on reducing the prevalence of smoking evidence suggests that there are smokers who are finding it increasingly difficult to quit tobacco. Experts therefore believe encouraging them to switch to alternative products such as e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products among other non-combustible alternatives was advisable.

“Studies have shown that some people that are diagnosed with cancer will quit for three months and more than half of them will be back to smoking if they are still alive despite being on treatment. So it is something that is difficult to quit” added Dr Letlape.

“There were no alternatives to combustible cigarettes when WHO FCTC was adopted in 2005 except nicotine-replacement therapy . . .

“But now we have many other alternatives based on technology; that are alternate supplies of nicotine without combustion. Now here is what most of us need to be aware of: Snus has been used in Sweden for more than 200 years; snuff has been in our environment for as long as I can remember but the FCTC was not even written to be appropriate to the non-combustible products that were available even prior to 2005.”

In Sweden for example the increased use of snus which is an oral smokeless tobacco product that is usually placed behind the upper lip has been linked to the decline in tobacco-related diseases.

It is one of the countries that reportedly has the lowest incidence of disease and morbidity related to tobacco use. Scientists believe

Scientists believe that policymakers especially in African countries such as Zimbabwe could be better served through interventions that focus on making harm-reducing alternatives to combustible cigarettes cheap and readily available instead of disproportionately focusing on WHO’s recommendations that emphasise on banning tobacco.

“WHO was more about prohibition” said Dr Letlape adding: “Banning does not work!”

Policies meant to ban tobacco also put countries such as Zimbabwe which is one of the major producers of tobacco in the world in an invidious position.

During this year’s marketing season cumulative tobacco sales exceeded 2109 million kilogrammes with export earnings rising to US$590 million.

Quitting

In her presentation at the 4th Scientific Summit Mrs Uta Ouali from Tunisia’s Razi Hospital La Manouba’s department of psychiatry said quitting tobacco was a difficult proposition.

The quit rate among smokers with no history of psychiatry disorder or SUD (substance use disorder) was 425 percent.

Rates are however significantly lower among people with alcohol use disorder (17 percent).

“Substance use disorders are important contributors to the high rates of tobacco addiction and smokers with these comorbidities demonstrate lower rates of quitting compared to smokers in the general population” she said.

“A unified harm reduction approach for both SUD and tobacco addiction could therefore be an effective means to reduce risks linked to both types of addiction . . .

“Harm reduction strategies have been implemented and have shown to be effective in injectable drug users and people with alcohol use disorders. Harm reduction strategies often replaced strategies for complete abstinence in certain sub-groups of users: poly drug users people with psychiatric co-morbidities socially and economically marginally groups.”

Dr Gizelle Baker from Philip Morris International indicated that “novel products have the potential to have a huge impact to public health”.

“Harms are caused by smoking and combustible cigarettes; smoking-related diseases is where the journey of tobacco industry’s transformation started from. Novel products have the potential to have a huge impact to public health moving people to less harmful alternatives and reducing the burden of smoking-related diseases” she said.

The 4th Scientific Summit on Tobacco Harm Reduction: Novel products Research & Policy was organised by SCOHRE the newly founded International Association on Smoking Control & Harm Reduction.

SCOHRE is an association of independent experts on smoking control and harm reduction scientists from all sectors such medical doctors policy experts behavioural experts academics and other professionals.

Its thrust is to help to come up with a new broader approach to smoking control policies through constructive dialogue.",,,,,,

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

[Can the market save the planet? FedEx is the latest brand-name firm to say it’s trying.]

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

The release of 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana waterway in 2018 was Marathon Petroleum’s worst spill in several years. It involved a crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

It takes a special person to serve their community as a volunteer firefighter DeQuincy Fire Chief Johnny Copeland said. DeQuincy’s 20-person fire department is entirely volunteer and finding the right individual with the right qualities is very important.

“Not everyone fights fire. Some people are scared. The thought of it freaks them out” he said. “You have people that I don’t know if they’re thrill seekers or just want to be in the middle of the action and you have people who just want to help. Most firefighters it’s that heart to help people. We’re there to help the community save the community’s property and their lives.”

A heart to serve and bravery are essential but so is mental fortitude. “You have to be smart. No one is allowed to do a certain thing unless they’ve been properly trained” Copeland said.

“I tell all of my guys ‘Everybody wants to be a hero to a point but we don’t need heroes that are getting killed. Not on my watch anyway.’”

Being a volunteer firefighter requires the same training as a career firefighter Copeland said. A perfectly trained firefighter completes 240 hours of training a year but that goal is difficult to reach for volunteers who in most cases have full-time jobs outside of the department.

“We do the best we can and we have certifications to get you to a different level. You start out as a rookie and work your way up.”

The certifications volunteer firefighters earn also have longterm value because they transfer nationwide. Copeland said the value of the training and the experience are two benefits of the job beyond the intrinsic value of helping others.

“It does look good on a resume— especially if you’ve got a few certifications” he said.

Copeland has seen the benefit of the volunteer experience in his own career at Phillips 66. “I’m an emergency response supervisor and this helped me to get me into the job I’m in right now because I was a machinist by trade. It helped me a lot because of all the certifications I’ve had.”

Likewise the medical training firefighters receive creates a well-trained well-rounded individual.

“A lot of companies are looking for safety people and with us they see you’ve got fire and we get medical training….Vehicles grass fires kids stuck under porches—you’re not just there to put out fire you’re everything except the police” Copeland said.

“Hazmat rescue firefighting community service — we’ve had to go help a funeral. It’s a wide range of stuff we do as a fire department.”

The job does require physical requirements in order to be a successful candidate Copeland added.

With bunker gear air pack boots helmet and other equipment firefighters carry an additional 50 to 60 pounds of weight. “In the middle of August and it’s 100 degrees body temperatures rise quickly. It’s like putting an overcoat on and walking outside in the summer.”

Because of this volunteer firefighters must pass an initial physical test in addition to the application and interview.

The stalemate does not seem to be coming to an end. All the residents who have been living in the tower for about one and a half years are yet to get the registry done.

On Day 1 of the protest on Saturday there was a lot of chaos. When the residents started shouting slogans the builder sent his bouncers who reportedly manhandled with the protesters. The situation got tensed. The residents were aghast over their right to protest.

As per the residents the situation has not suddenly deteriorated. They have been raising their issues for long. As per a resident almost 90 emails have been sent to the builder so far but there has not been any concrete solution.

The residents were left with no option but to protest vigorously. They have been doing their best to reach to the builder for a solution. Few days back as a mark of protest and to get the attention of builder the residents had placed banners inside the society suggesting the new buyers to refrain from buying flats in the society. The builder got angry with this and removed the banners from there. Moreover he had served legal notices to many of the residents.

The turn of events united the residents more as everyone was waiting for the registry of flat. Residents including women and senior citizens protested against the builder on Saturday. Police was also present on the spot on Day 1.

Continuing their protest on Day 2 the residents started their protest by shouting slogans and holding banners. All the protesters started shouting slogans in chorus.

So far there has been no visit from anyone from the builder side. The residents are protesting under the sun.

A resident said that they have also been getting threatening calls from the builder's men. A resident on the condition of anonymity said “We are being threatened when we ask for registry and other facilities. In this regard a written complaint was given by me in Bisrakh police station. But the police has not taken any action on it.”

Another resident on the condition of anonymity said ""Look at the attitude of the builder we are protesting under the sun and he is yet not visiting us. We are not going to budge in any kind of pressure. We want registry of our flats at the earliest. He will have to act.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9oYXdrZXMtYmF5LXRvZGF5L25ld3MvdGloZWktcHJvdWQtcm9zcy1zaGllbGQtbW9tZW50LWZvci1wYXJlbnRzLW9mLXlvdW5nZXN0LXBsYXllci81QUtDUTZEWDRKRlZENUVQUTVLRERHMlJCVS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Proud Ross Shield moment for parents of youngest player,"The Hastings West Ross Shield team.

The Ross Shield competition is one of the longest-running rugby competitions in New Zealand and is the pinnacle of primary school rugby in Hawke's Bay.

The competition started more than 120 years ago by Napier businessman and keen sports enthusiast JA Ross.

It has so much history that young players feel it an honour and a privilege to get onto a Ross Shield team. You need to have certain stamina and be a certain weight among other things to get in. The competition involves teams from Wairoa Napier Hastings East Hastings West Central Hawke's Bay and Dannevirke.

The 2021 Ross Shield Tournament was held last week from October 4 to 8 and was hosted by Hastings at the Ellwood Rd rugby fields. Teams have been outstanding in their uniforms proudly representing their teams.

All of the boys looked stunning and stood out as team leaders with potential. Among the Hastings West team is young Darrell Rutherford Reid. This particular team has defended the Ross Shield for the past three years.

""It's a pretty big deal for our boy as he is the youngest in the team. It is uncommon for a Year 6 to make a Ross Shield team as it is more known for intermediate children Year 7-8"" says mum Natalie Reid.

""We are stoked for him and his achievement. He's also the first student from Bridge Pa School to make it into the team"" Natalie said.

Darrell comes from a long line of rugby players. He follows in the footsteps of his father Everard Reid his grandfather the late Darrell Reid and his great grandfather All Black legend Sana Torium Reid.

Last weekend the Hastings West Team had photos of their team at each of the children's kura which was absolutely stunning. Darrell was also able to have a picture taken in front of Mangaroa Marae.

This is definitely a proud moment for parents of all of these children.

In a Facebook post Darrell's Natalie acknowledged her son for his determination and drive for rugby and she also acknowledged the village who helped raise their son and helped him achieve his goals thus far.

We are sure she speaks for all of the children and their parents. There are some wonderful people in our communities who make these opportunities happen for our children our future sporting achievers.",,,,,,,,,

Community Columnist

Albertus Van Raalte helped organize loans but Nathan Kenyon established Holland's first bank. The year was 1856. The bank was in the parlor of Aldred Plugger’s house at 5 E. Eighth St. — where the Warm Friend/Resthaven is today.

There Kenyon operated his “exchange” bank a place where customers could cash notes drawn on other banks across the country at rates based on the financial solvency of each issuing bank. This enabled customers to better engage in interstate and intrastate banking.

More History:Henry and Anna Post ensured Holland's economic viability

Plugger who owned and operated a shipping business a flour mill a saw mill and a grocery store might have been the bank’s biggest customer.

Kenyon’s bank and Plugger’s house were destroyed by the Great Holland Fire of 1871. Kenyon then built a three-story opera house called Kenyon Hall at 194 River Ave. on the southwest corner of River Avenue and Eighth Street — where Reader's World is today.

In 1875 Kenyon lost his wife. On her tombstone he wrote: “Died Oct. 30 1875: Aged 43 years 4 months and 11 days.”

In 1877 fire destroyed Kenyon Hall. Kenyan then partnered was Jacob Van Putten. Van Putten was born in The Netherlands in 1820.

He married Maria Hilleman and together they had six children: Tannetje (Van Putten) Ver Schure Jacob J. Van Putten III (called “Black Jake” because of his hair) Adrianus Van Putten Leendert Van Putten Maria (Van Putten) Nyland and Marinus Van Putten.

Van Putten was a lumberman. He got his start when he purchased present day Waukazoo Woods from the Odawa (Ottawa) and lumbered the trees at his mill near Maple Avenue and Eighth Street.

Kenyan and Van Putten opened their bank in 1878 at 30 W. Eighth St. — where Fris Supply Shop is today. Van Putten's son Marinus said to have been blinded by too much swimming in Black Lake served as teller and became famous for his ability to tell the denomination of coins and never be mistaken.

Cornelis Ver Schure Van Putten’s son-in-law was the bank’s first cashier.

Then Kenyon sold out to Van Putten and moved to Ionia where he opened a hardware store. The bank was renamed the Holland City Bank.

In 1889 Isaac Cappon (President) John Beardslee (Vice President) Henry Kremers Gerrit Kollen J. W. Garvelink Jerome Mokma Gerrit J. Diekema and John C. Post created First State Bank.

First State Bank was located at 54 E. Eighth St. at the southeast corner of Central Avenue and Eighth Street. It was an impressive three-story structure.

In 1890 the Holland City Bank became the Holland City State Bank. Ownership was broadened to include other members of Holland's business elite — Isaac Marsilje John C. Post Isaac Cappon Cornelius Ver Schure and Gerrit J. Diekema.

Notice that Cappon Diekema Post and Verschure now had financial interests in both of Holland’s banks.

In 1892 Holland City State Bank began construction of the landmark Tower Clock building — the clock was built by John Raven a 26-year-old jeweler so “men wouldn’t be late for work.”

Jacob Van Putten died in 1894.

In 1915 First State Bank built the impressive structure at 1 W. Eighth St. on the northwest corner of Central Avenue and Eighth Street. That building still stands.

Diekema and Kollen (and TenCate) moved their law office upstairs while F.W. Woolworth moved into the first floor and Holland Business College into the second floor in the vacated building at 54 E. Eighth Street.

In 1936 during the Great Depression both the Holland City State Bank and First State Bank lost nearly one-half of their deposits and merged. The new bank was located at 1 W. Eighth St. and called the Holland State Bank.

In 1937 Ottawa County Building and Loan formed by unrecognized citizens but later controlled by Holland's banking elite moved into the Tower Clock building.

The Holland State Bank became the First National Bank in 1946 which was purchased by First of America Bank in 1973.

First of America was then acquired by National City Bank in the late 1990s. PNC Bank acquired National City in 2008. In 2017 PNC Bank vacated the First State Bank Building at 1 W. Eighth St.

The First National Bank of Michigan moved into the building 2018.

It has been painted on the side of the P&D MLB Cincinnati Reds Youth Academy.

The mural was started in August and finished in September with the help of dozens of volunteers. It is 120 feet wide by 35 feet high and is featured prominently on the west side of the building on Joe Morgan Way.

“We are deeply honored to witness the extraordinary mural that perfectly depicts who Joe Morgan was as a human being all he represented and what he spent years fighting for"" said his widow Theresa Morgan. ""He was much more than an incredible athlete because at the core of his heart was the goal to ensure that communities benefitted from his electrifying passion tremendous talent and far-reaching dreams. Thank you to the City of Cincinnati and the Reds organization for supporting his vision. It is also with a great deal of pride and gratitude that we thank the incredible talented artist Brent Billingsley who has brought Joe Morgan’s legacy to life.”





Billingsley designed the mural in collaboration with the Cincinnati Reds and a team of five artists leading 30 volunteers which included Roselawn families members of Back2Back Ministries Cincinnati Children's Hospital workers and volunteers from HYPE Ministries.

Morgan joined the Reds Front Office in 2010 as a Senior Advisor to Baseball Operations and placed high value on bringing a MLB Youth Academy to Cincinnati. Monday October 11 marks the anniversary of his passing.

“Thank you to the entire community for embracing Joe’s dream and to the generosity of the Castellini family” said Kay Geiger PNC Bank regional president Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky. “The leadership of the Cincinnati Reds and the Reds Community Fund is why we’re here to commemorate and honor the great number 8. Joe the Reds and PNC believe that there should be equal access for all dreams and all people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vbWxiLXlvdXRoLWFjYWRlbXkvY2luY2lubmF0aS9uZXdzbGV0dGVyL29jdC0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,October 2021 Newsletter | Cincinnati Reds Youth Academy,"Joe Morgan Mural Unveiling

On Oct. 9 PNC Bank and the Reds Community Fund officially unveiled the Joe Morgan Mural that resides on the side of the P&G MLB Cincinnati Reds Youth Academy building. The mural was completed by artist Brent Billingsley and his team that led over 30 volunteers. More than 100 guests came together for this event including Joe Morgan's daughter Lisa Morgan as well as Reds Hall of Famer George Foster who was a teammate of Morgan on the Big Red Machine.

Joe Morgan was a 10-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove second basemen. He was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame in 1987 and to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. The two-time National League MVP played for the Cincinnati Reds from 1972-79 during the glory days of the Big Red Machine. He won his first MVP award in 1975 when he guided the Reds to a World Series victory over the Boston Red Sox; and then again in 1976 as the Reds swept the New York Yankees for their second straight World Series Championship title. In 1998 the Reds officially retired his No. 8 jersey.

We are so glad that we got to celebrate and cherish such a special person of Cincinnati and Reds Baseball!"

According to The NewsHawks investigations by the Journalism Development Network Inc. trading as the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) Lukashenko’s front man Viktor Sheiman was dispatched to Zimbabwe in March 2018 to negotiate trade and business deals for his government.

Indications are that Sheiman paved the way for a gold mining deal between his son Sergei Sheiman and other Belarusians with alleged offshore accounts.

Investigations by OCCRP according to NewsHawks have revealed that the mining deal was presented as a collaboration between the two countries and Sheiman said it was intended to make “profit for Belarus.”

But in fact the new joint venture Zim Goldfields reports OCCRP quoted by The NewsHawks was secretly co-owned by Sheiman’s son Sergei with no stake for the Belarusian state.

Sergei Sheiman’s partner in the gold venture was influential Belarusian businessman Alexander Zingman who has served as Zimbabwe’s honorary consul in Belarus since around early 2019 reports OCCRP.

OCCRP further reports that Zingman was detained for 12 days this March in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “A press release by his Dubai-based company Aftrade DMCC specified that the reason for the incident was arms dealing allegations which Zingman flatly denied. He was released without charge.”

According to OCCRP documents from the Pandora Papers — a massive leak to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists of nearly 12 million documents from 14 offshore corporate service providers shared with media partners around the world — show how the two Belarusians used shell companies in the Seychelles and the U.K. to mask their involvement and the conflict of interest at the heart of the deal.

OCCRP reports that 30 percent of Zim Goldfields was held by Zimbabwe’s state-owned mining company the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) but the other 70 percent was controlled by a U.K. shell company called Midlands Goldfields Limited.

“Its ownership was masked by a proxy — U.K. records name Robert Michael Friedberg as the director of the company — but leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show that Friedberg was acting on behalf of its owners as a nominee for a Seychelles entity with a similar name: Midlands Goldfields Foundation. And that entity was owned by Sergei Sheiman and Zingman who had both reportedly been part of the March 2018 mission to Harare.

“Both shell companies appear to have been created specifically to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Viktor Sheiman’s official visit to Zimbabwe: Midlands Goldfields in both the Seychelles and U.K. were incorporated just a few months before his trip and Zim Goldfields was set up shortly after.”

The NewsHawks and OCCRP report that Sergei Sheiman and Lukashenko’s administration did not respond to questions sent by OCCRP. Aftrade DMCC Zingman’s Dubai-based company denied that Zingman had any involvement with the gold venture despite his name contact details passport number and signature appearing in company records for Midlands Goldfields Limited.

Alpha Consulting which set up Midlands Goldfields in the Seychelles said it complies with all local and international regulations and runs background checks on its clients and the source of their wealth.

“Mr Zingman has no links whatsoever with either Zim Goldfields or Midland Goldfields Limited” Aftrade DMCC said in a written response. “Mr. Zingman is also not involved in any business relationships or existing companies with Mr. Sergei Sheiman” the company added in a separate statement.

Viktor Sheiman who left his position as head of the Belarus President Property Management Directorate in June 2021 with a personal message of gratitude by Lukashenko for “opening the window to Africa” did not respond to requests for comment sent through his former office.

The mining ventures along Mutare River were shutdown by the Environmental Management Agency of Zimbabwe following several citations for mining violations.

The NewsHawks and OCCRP report that itis not clear whether Zim Goldfields continues to operate. The ZMDC did not respond to questions concerning the company’s status.

Information secretary Nick Mangwana was also unreachable for comment as he was not responding to calls on his mobile phone.

New Delhi: After a hiatus of nearly two decades the government's CPSE privatisation programme started off with flying colours with Tata group buying the debt-laden national carrier Air India With the new owner shelling out Rs 18000 crore for the buyout of 'Maharaja' this would be the highest ever amount garnered through privatisation or even the cumulative sum garnered through strategic sale in 1999-00 to 2003-04.The government had garnered roughly over Rs 5000 crore during that five-year period by privatising 10 CPSEs. Besides three hotel properties of Hotel Corporation of India and 18 of ITDC were also sold off by way of slump sale.Here is a timeline of strategic sale of central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to private entities between 1999-00 to 2003-04.1999-00 - Modern Food Industries Ltd - Rs 105 cr2000-01 - BALCO  Lagan Jute Machinery Co Ltd - Rs 554 cr2001-02 - VSNL Computer Maintenance Corporation (CMC) Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd (HTL) Paradeep Phosphate Ltd (PPL) some hotel properties of HCI and ITDC - Rs 2089 crore2002-03- Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) some ITDC hotel properties - Rs 2335 cr2003-04 - HZL Jessop & Co - Rs 342 crThe government has also sold its majority stake in certain CPSEs to public sector companies operating in the similar sector.These include sale of 74 per cent government stake in Indo Burma Petroleum Co (IBP) to Indian Oil Corp (IOC) in 2001-02 for Rs 1153 crore and Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ) buying out government stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36915 crore in 2018.Besides government's 52.63 per cent stake in REC was sold to Power Finance Corp for Rs 14500 crore in 2018-19.Between 2000-01 and 2019-20 the government has sold its entire stake in nine CPSEs to other similarly placed public sector enterprises garnering cumulative Rs 53450 crore.The privatisation process witnessed stagnation post 2004 as the focus shifted to selling minority stake in CPSEs through follow on public offer (FPO) and offer for sale (OFS) and also stock exchange listing of profitable CPSEs.In the 2021-22 Budget the Government announced the PSE (public sector enterprises) privatisation policy as per which all PSUs will be privatised barring four strategic sectors of Atomic energy Space and Defence; Transport and Telecommunications; Power Petroleum Coal and other minerals; and Banking Insurance and financial services. In these strategic sectors the government will retain only a bare minimum number of PSUs.In her Budget speech Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said strategic disinvestment of BPCL  Air India Shipping Corporation of India Container Corporation of India IDBI Bank BEML Pawan Hans Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd among others and IPO of LIC would be completed in 2021-22.Besides two public sector banks and one general insurance company too would be privatised as per the privatisation agenda.The Budget for 2021-22 has set a disinvestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore higher than Rs 32000 crore estimated to be garnered in the last fiscal. Of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore Rs 1 lakh crore is to come from selling government stake in public sector banks and financial institutions. Rs 75000 crore would come as CPSE disinvestment receipts.So far Rs 9110 crore has been raised through sale of minority stake in Axis Bank NMDC Ltd Housing and Urban Development Corp (HUDCO) and Hindustan Copper",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield long known for their progressive politics were interviewed on ""Axios on HBO"" by reporter Alexi McCammond.

McCammond asked Cohen and Greenfield why despite being ""big proponents"" of abortion and voting rights the company still sells ice cream in Georgia and Texas both of which have tightened laws on those issues.

""I don’t know"" Cohen said after appearing to give the question some thought. ""I mean it’s an interesting question. I don’t know what that would accomplish.""

Pressed on the matter Cohen said it would be unreasonable to stop selling ice cream in any state or country with which they disagree.

""I’ve got issues with what’s being done in most every state and most every country"" he said.

The interview came after the company ignited a firestorm over the summer after announcing that it would no longer sell its ice cream in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

Greenfield contrasted abortion and voting rights in certain states from the policies of the Israeli government.

""What they're doing is considered illegal by international law"" Greenfield said. ""And so I think that’s a consideration.""

Cohen clarified that he and his business partner favor a two-state solution but the ""settlements"" make that harder and harder to be realized.

Cohen and Greenfield have stepped down from running the company but have retained the rights to speak on its behalf.

What happens when thousands of drug addicts are not only permitted to use heroin fentanyl and meth publicly but also enabled to do so? The results are in: hundreds of them die annually. Last year 712 people in San Francisco died from drug overdoses or poisoning and this year a similar number are on track to do so.

And cities around the country have been copying San Francisco’s approach. Partly as a result of these supposedly progressive policies 93000 people in the US died in 2021 from illicit drugs a more than five-fold increase from the 17000 people killed by illicit drugs in 2000.

Rather than arresting hard drug users when they break laws and giving them the choice of jail or drug treatment the only strategy which has proven to work the city of San Francisco provides addicts with the cash housing and drug paraphernalia they need to purchase and use deadly drugs.

Former homeless addict Tom Wolf maintained his habit for six months by surviving on the city’s cash welfare payments. “I got $581 a month in General Assistance and $192 in food stamps” he told me. San Francisco gives other addicts free hotel rooms without requiring that they stop using drugs while living in them.

While many people are able to end their addictions without external help many others require multiple interventions by family friends and if their addiction results in them breaking the law the police. Many formerly homeless drug addicts including Wolf credit being arrested with motivating them to finally overcome their addictions.

Researchers have known since 1997 that “patients who have been forced to enter a substance abuse treatment have shown during and post treatment results that are quite similar to those shown by supposedly ‘internally motivated’ patients.”

In a major 2014 study of how five large European cities shut down “open drug scenes” researchers found “Prevention harm reduction and treatment should be combined with law enforcement.”

Progressives justify their withholding of the best-available medical treatment of drug addiction in the name of reducing racial disparities in jails and prisons. But the result of the city’s hands-off policy is far worse: racial disparities in drug deaths. African American men in San Francisco were almost six times more likely to die from illicit drugs than the average city resident.

According to race theorist Ibram Kendi whose views are shared by many of San Francisco’s progressive policymakers policies that result in racial disparities are themselves racist. As a result progressives should view harm reduction-only policies including Housing First as racist.

Indeed San Francisco is engaged in an unethical refusal to mandate proven medical treatment to drug addicts that is no different from the denial of medical treatment to syphilis sufferers by US government researchers in Tuskegee Ala. between 1932 and 1972. In those infamous racist experiments US health and medical professionals denied penicillin to African American men long after it became clear in 1947 that the antibiotic saved lives.

It’s true that in Tuskegee health officials denied medical treatment in service of the experiment itself — they wanted to be able to prove scientifically that penicillin cured syphilis — while in San Francisco health officials don’t require medical treatment for addicts out of the belief that doing so is more ethically justified than jail and prison.

But the experts who oversaw the Tuskegee experiment similarly claimed it was “ethically justified” since they believed it would give the government the proof that penicillin worked and save more lives in the long run.

Progressive San Francisco officials have refused to mandate treatment to addicts and enabled addiction through Housing First policies for nearly as long as Tuskegee officials denied penicillin to syphilitics. In 2009 a team of scholars and doctors warned “One potential risk [of Housing First’s harm reduction approach] would be worsening the addiction itself.” And in 2002 the director of psychiatric services at the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic said “It is not only clinically incorrect but almost sadistic to give money on a regular basis to people who have a demonstrated inability to handle cash funds.”

In truth what San Francisco and other progressive cities are doing is worse than Tuskegee. Of the approximately 600 men enrolled in the Tuskegee experiment 128 died of syphilis. Six times more people died of drug overdoses and poisonings in San Francisco last year alone 178 of whom were black.

There is a better way. San Francisco and other progressive cities should arrest addicts who break the law offer drug treatment as an alternative to jail and prison and make cash and housing for addicts contingent upon drug treatment. A major scientific review in 2016 found that 151 studies of “abstinent-contingent” housing or 86 percent of total studies surveyed had an effect size that ranged from moderate to large a vastly superior result to addiction-enabling Housing First policies.

It is high time that San Francisco and other progressive cities started using proven strategies for saving lives and ending addiction and ended their deadly and immoral experiment on vulnerable people.

Michael Shellenberger is the author of “San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities” (Harper) out Tuesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xMC9jb3luZS_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvY295bmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coyne: Kowtowing to the left won’t save ‘woke’ corporations,"If you watch television advertising for any length of time it immediately becomes clear that corporations aren’t just selling cars phones and food — they’re also selling a woke vision of America one that is profoundly at odds with the majority of the country.

American corporations are increasingly operating under the false impression that to survive in the marketplace they must kowtow to the woke mob. Market researchers and PR executives most of whom are ensconced in major city hubs and progressive strongholds encourage this behavior reflecting their own biases.

As a result we’ve seen an explosion in so-called “corporate social responsibility” environmental social and governance investing corporate support for controversial social causes and even partisan politics. The title of one CNN article summed it up best: “Like it or not ‘woke’ Corporate America is here to stay.”

Unfortunately for PR departments that is not in fact what most American consumers want.

Just look at how such strategies have backfired for corporations from Nike to the MLB. A Morning Consult poll found Nike’s woke Colin Kaepernick ad campaign in 2018 lost them favor with every key demographic including Democrats millennials Gen Z and Black Americans. The brand’s overall favorability dropped a total of 34 points among consumers. Gillette’s controversial toxic masculinity ad in 2019 debuted on YouTube with a four-to-one-dislike-to-like ratio. And ratings for this year’s MLB All-Star Game after it was moved from Atlanta were the second-lowest in history.

Numbers don’t lie. It’s very clear that most American consumers oppose the vision of woke America being peddled by these corporations. As a business owner and staunch defender of traditional American values I can say without hesitation that I don’t like it either. But instead of complaining I decided to respond in the most American way I know — by competing. After all the way to fight a bad idea is with a good one.

Some companies like me We the People Wine unapologetically believe in American exceptionalism free markets free people free speech and limited government. And we donate a portion of our profits to conservative causes. We believe Americans are hungry (and we hope thirsty) to do business with companies that proudly promote America’s founding principles.

Banking on this has already paid off. We recently launched our wine brand with a patriotic video featuring Ronald Reagan extolling the virtues that made America great. It immediately went viral quickly racking up more than 15 million views and driving so much traffic to our homepage that it crashed.

So to those who say the only way to successfully stay in business these days is to bend to woke ideology I say think again. Our brand launch taught us that conservative and middle-Americans as much as anyone want to know their hard-earned money is going to a company that genuinely respects them and their values. A conservative influencer recently summed up the sentiment: “I’m going to buy a bottle of that wine because … I know that they support my values … I don’t care what you’re selling I want to give you my business.”

Conservatives are frankly fed up with a deck increasingly stacked against them with the mainstream media big tech Hollywood universities sports leagues the federal government and even large corporations overwhelmingly supporting the left’s anti-American agenda.

And there’s a clear opportunity for companies to fill the void in the marketplace created by companies that have cast their lot with the left. After all market research shows 52% of conservatives think brands should also take political action.

Giving in to the left-wing mob is a fool’s errand and the corporations that play this game are deluding themselves if they believe it buys them protection from the anti-business policies being pushed by the Democrats. As a Wall Street Journal story notes “The Democratic Party has moved to the left of a 79-year-old socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and a wave of like-minded younger progressives become louder and more influential pushing higher corporate taxes and in some cases the breakup of big corporations.”

Far-left woke ideology is supported by only a small fraction of the country. And it’s not doing corporations any favors. It’s not increasing profits and in many cases has driven cohorts of conservative-leaning consumers away.

It is time for corporate America to wake up from its woke nightmare. It is much better to be true to who you are and what you do than to help advance a political agenda that is detrimental to the free-market economy that not only built America but also made possible your company’s very existence.

Above all they have been forward-thinking companies and have continued to invest in new generation technology that lays down solid edifice for revenue visibility over the long-term. No wonder the incremental market value generated from these disruptors pulled the US market up with boundless energy.With presence in software to computing and communications to entertainment advertising to e-commerce these platforms are called the new “diversified industrials” of the 21st century.Investors can allocate 10-15% of their total equity into a mutual fund portfolio that invests in global equities. Such an allocation increases portfolio diversification while adding the benefits of a favourable US Dollar-Rupee rate. It must be noted that every equity market behaves differently each year.In order to capture the benefits for global asset diversification several Asset Management companies have launched global funds which are region sector or country-specific in nature. Taking exposure to international equities via an international fund provides an investor a hassle-free investing experience along with professional expertise and tax efficiency as investors do not have to face a tax impact each time the portfolio is rebalanced.Nasdaq-100 is home to some of the well-known names in technology such as Apple Microsoft Alphabet Intel Facebook etc. The index includes category-defining companies on the forefront of innovation of other key industries such as Amgen Starbucks and Tesla to name a few. The bulk of the index weight is with global technology brands and is devoid of financial companies. Being a leader in disruption research and development is a key driver ofeconomic growth for the constituents of Nasdaq -100.The companies in Nasdaq -100 on average spend about twice on R&D as compared to S&P 500. So it is of no wonder that the value of patents filed by Nasdaq -100 companies rose by 900% since May 2007 compared with 300% across all other publicly listed companies. In fact Nasdaq-100 companies now represent 10.6% of global aggregate patent value across all publicly listed companies. Interestingly 58 companies in the Nasdaq-100 (representing 84% of index weight) recently filed patents across one or more categories of 35 key areas of Disruptive Technology such as Artificial Intelligence Clean Energy or Blockchain.When it comes to performance back-tested data shows that an equally weighted bottom 50 portfolio of Nasdaq -100 has outperformed the top 50 of the S&P 500 index since 2001. Marque electronic vehicle company Tesla became a part of the Nasdaq -100 index first and only after 7.5 years did it become a part of the S&P 500 index. The early inclusion of technology behemoths resulted in the rise of the market cap ratio of Nasdaq -100 to S& P 500 from 16% in 2006 to 45% in 2020. A rising share of tech companies in Nasdaq -100 has resulted in major outperformance when compared to other US and Indian equity indices.When it comes to the return profile over the last decade Nasdaq -100 delivered a TRI (total return index) return of 31.2% CAGR while the S&P500 and Nifty 50 posted a TRI of 23.3% and 13.6% in the same period. In 2020 12 companies in the Nasdaq-100 registered full-year price returns of at least 100% and posted an average of 35% revenue growth.Nasdaq -100 provides a large exposure to the US market—which contributes 59% of the global market capitalisation. For an Indian investor there are a couple of offerings based on this index which is made available by domestic fund houses. Recently ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund launched an index fund based on the Nasdaq-100 index. This offering aims to generate returns in line with the index minus tracking error and expenses.So if you are an investor seeking global equity market exposure a potential hedge against rupee depreciation vs Dollar and your risk appetite is in line with the fund then investing in a Nasdaq -100 index-based offering can be considered as an interesting investment option.(Harshvardhan Roongta CFP is CEO of Roongta Securities.

They deserved it. The group true to Quaker theology professed non-violence and eschewed any groups perpetrating it. Quakers may have been conscientious objectors during the war but such views neither demanded political conformity nor translated into support for America’s adversaries or regimes that would employ violence against their own people. They did nothing for example to enable Nazis to better their economy or facilitate Soviet purges. “The Goodness of God Is Demonstrated in Brotherly Love” the Norwegian Nobel Committee declared when awarding the AFSC the prize citing their work helping post-war reconstruction in France assisting Jewish refugees interned Japanese-Americans and prisoners-of-war.

The award itself however marked a pivot point for the AFSC. It cast aside the careful relief operations that characterized the previous three decades of its activities and set its aspirations on the political and diplomatic. Accepting the Nobel Prize AFSC Executive Secretary Clarence Pickett announced that the organization would dedicate the associated money to further Quaker proposals to improve Soviet-American relations.

Perhaps it made sense for a group dedicated to pacifism to seek to facilitate peace between the two rival superpowers but Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had little interest in compromise. The AFSC’s post-Nobel ambitions came less than fifteen years after Soviet dictator Josef Stalin starved to death almost four million Ukrainians in “the Holodomor” and just a decade after he murdered one million more in “the Great Purge.”

Stalin had no tolerance for dissent and a Manichean view of power. Recognizing the immutability of Stalin’s position the AFSC’s project effectively demanded the United States make greater accommodations to the Soviet Union’s positions. It abandoned its political neutrality and hired a professional permanent staff only a minority of whom were Quaker. Rather than anchor themselves to Quaker principles the revamped AFSC prioritized politics while wearing the mantle of legitimacy born of a Nobel Peace Prize awarded at a time the group operated under a different value system and code of conduct.

The AFSC’s substitution of Quaker theological principles for subjective progressive politics colored subsequent activism and often put it in the bizarre position of promoting violent and even genocidal groups over their victims.

Many progressives castigate the United States for the Vietnam War but the reality of the conflict was murkier. Ho Chi Minh may have depicted himself as a nationalist but he often subordinated Vietnamese interests to those of his Russian sponsors and advisors. Nor was the United States the only aggressor: North Vietnam invaded first Laos and then their southern neighbor. South Vietnam might have been corrupt but so too was North Vietnam. Quakers might oppose U.S. policy but as Henry Bowden a Rutgers University professor of religion explained prior to the Vietnam War “The idea was to alleviate the suffering from war not to find politics in it.”

The overt decision by AFSC leadership to do otherwise led the AFSC down the path of moral perversity. During the 1970s the AFSC defended Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge even as word emerged that the group had killed one million citizens. In Peace and Revolution: The Moral Crisis of American Pacifism political scientist Guenter Lewy described how John McAuliff head of the AFSC’s Indo-China division called reports of massacres a U.S. attempt to discredit “the example of an alternative model of development.” McAuliff was the rule rather than the exception. New England Regional Director Russell Johnson dismissed the “bloodbath stories” as motivated both by “a new wave of anti-communism” and Washington’s desire to punish those countries who sought “to close their boundaries to exploitation by multinational corporations seeking raw materials markets for surplus and cheap labor.” In effect the AFSC and Quakers who embraced it talked of non-violence but provided cover for a group directly responsible for the murder of at least one million Cambodians.

The AFSC has repeated its mistakes with regard to North Korea. The group explains “AFSC’s concern for the Korean peninsula stems particularly from the suffering caused by the Korean War in which the United States was a major combatant.” While this is true—the United States led a coalition operating under United Nations auspices—China and the Soviet Union were also combatants though the AFSC’s one-sided narrative does not acknowledge this. Nor does the AFSC mention that the war began with North Korea’s surprise invasion of its southern neighbor.

While the AFSC operates projects to bolster collective farm productivity in the North it conducts no parallel projects in South Korea. Nor does its literature acknowledge that its collective farms are effectively slave-labor camps. The AFSC might claim the moral high ground but their actions are akin to a foreign NGO helping modern-day China making child labor more productive.

Next consider Iraq. The AFSC was in good company in its opposition to the 2003 Iraq War but it went beyond mere opposition when it made common cause with Saddam Hussein’s regime: It actively bolstered Iraqi propaganda accepting and promoting the calumny that U.S.-supported sanctions killed 500000 Iraqi children. Neither the AFSC nor its allies mentioned that Saddam’s regime provided those numbers nor did the AFSC correct the record when that claim proved false. The AFSC was silent however to the victims of Saddam’s regime who suffered his chemical attacks or ended up in mass graves. As Barham Salih then a leading Iraqi Kurdish opponent of Saddam and now Iraq’s president told a January 2003 meeting of the Socialist International “To those who say ‘No War’ I say of course ‘Yes’ but we can only have ‘No War’ if there is ‘No Dictatorship’ and ‘No Genocide.’”

The AFSC is especially active today in the Israel-Palestine conflict not as a neutral party seeking to alleviate suffering or further dialogue but rather as a partisan force. Asaf Romirowsky and Alexander H. Joffe discuss AFSC activities in detail in their book Religion Politics and the Origins of Palestine Refugee Relief. The two scholars document how the Quaker group worked with the Palestine Liberation Organization at the height of its terror campaign against Israel and worldwide Jewry and instructed workshop participants to ignore anti-Semitic remarks. Such policy has led the AFSC down a curious moral path. In 2008 for example the AFSC co-hosted a gala dinner for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Iran’s Holocaust-denying president. AFSC Spokesman Mark Graham defended the AFSC’s dalliance with Ahmadinejad. “There are many points where we disagree with Iranian policy [but] we believe dialogue is the way to understanding and moving past tensions rather than threats and standoffish behavior” he said. Such an explanation though only heightens the hypocrisy of the AFSC’s calls to boycott the Jewish state.

The AFSC continues to cite its Nobel Laureate status to bolster its moral authority but those days are gone. The AFSC has soiled its moral legacy as much as Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi and Ethiopian dictator Abiy Ahmed have. In its letters and pronouncements it makes common cause with radical groups like Code Pink and the National Iranian American Council a group whose founder Trita Parsi once defended Female Genital Mutilation. It has become a group that remains silent on the incarceration of Chinese Uighurs dines with Holocaust deniers and works with Hamas terrorists who openly call for the murder of homosexuals.

Most Quakers have no idea how the group which acts in their name has eschewed the values for which they stand. That is a failure of oversight and the result of many permanent AFSC employees prioritizing political agendas above theological principles. The tragedy here is not simply that the Society of Friends is increasingly associating itself with those who ridicule its principles but that the roles that an organization like the pre-1947 AFSC once upheld increasingly go unfilled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL0Fpci1JbmRpYS1mbGllcy1iYWNrLXRvLVRhdGEtR3JvdXAtYWZ0ZXItNy1kZWNhZGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air India flies back to Tata Group after 7 decades,"NEW DELHI -- Tata Sons the holding company of India's largest conglomerate Tata Group has won the bid for Air India the government announced on Friday bringing the drawn-out process to a close.

A capital-gains tax break sold as a way to induce the wealthy to invest in poor neighborhoods opportunity zones appear to be providing more opportunity for the wealthy to cut their tax bills than to the people who live in designated zones. It’s a case study on how very hard it is to tweak the tax code to direct money to places and activities that Congress favors without creating windfalls for the rich.

Opportunity zones were partly conceived by the entrepreneur and philanthropist Sean Parker made famous by his role in the rise of Napster and Facebook. He was sure he had a better way to reduce poverty than policy wonks or bureaucrats did. So he funded a start-up think tank and hired a couple of sharp Washington insiders who skillfully maneuvered opportunity zones into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — with a big assist from Senator Tim Scott Republican of South Carolina. All this with little public scrutiny of details.

And therein lies the problem. Architects of opportunity zones believed that previous attempts to use the tax code to push money to capital-starved neighborhoods flopped because they had too many rules and required investors to navigate maddeningly complex bureaucratic mazes. So their disruptive version of place-based policy had few rules and little government oversight. Once governors designated opportunity zones from a list of census tracts that the law made eligible almost any investment in a property or business in a zone qualified. One doesn’t need to even assert that an investment will help the people who live in the zone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NlbGYtc3RvcmFnZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1wbGFubmVkLWZvci12YWNhbnQtYmlnLWJveC1zcGFjZS1vZi1mb3JtZXItc2hvcGtvLW9uLTUybmQtc3RyZWV0L2FydGljbGVfNGIyNzkxM2UtODFkYy01NDQyLTgxNTItODhiMzE3MTJlMWZkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Self-storage facility planned for vacant big box space of former Shopko on 52nd Street,"In the near future 52nd Street — once a major thoroughfare dotted with an array of big box department stores — may host a proliferation of storage facilities.

The city Plan Commission on Thursday heard the latest pitch aimed at breathing new life into a dormant building on what still is one of Kenosha’s more highly trafficked corridors.

Representatives with Miami-based Larkspur Acquisitions went before city officials with plans of repurposing the existing Shopko building 5300 52nd St. into a 98195-square-foot indoor self-storage facility.

The proposed business has been referred to as Kenosha Self Storage in documents submitted to city officials but the naming could change.

“The facility will most likely be branded by a nationally recognized self-storage operator ensuring ‘best in class’ management and operation” Larkspur representatives wrote in a business plan.

Larkspur’s plans for the Shopko site come on the heels of the forthcoming conversion of the former Kmart 4100 52nd St. into a similar business operated by Devon Self Storage which was first announced this summer. Two years ago Uhaul took over the entire building that housed the original Walmart at 4404 52nd St.

Shopko which closed all of its department stores amid bankruptcy and spun off its optical businesses shuttered in 2019. Kmart which has been struggling for years but still maintains a small footprint elsewhere in the U.S. closed its Kenosha store last year.

The number of planed self-storage and trucking facilities in such a short proximity was not lost on city officials as the latest Shopko proposal was discussed in depth at Thursday’s meeting.

“My concern is 52nd Street is going to become ‘self-storage road’” said Ald. Jan Michalski who sits on the Plan Commission. “This is a major thoroughfare into the city.”

In particular Michalski and others had expressed hope a grocery store which is lacking in the area would assume one of the empty big box spaces.

Other city officials however pointed to the market realities and said they were happy to see businesses willing to freshen up abandoned buildings and reducing blight.

“I’ve been waiting for a grocery store to come in. But guess what? They’re not coming” said Ald. Dominic Ruffalo who represents the area surrounding the Shopko site. “I’m all for it. I don’t want any vacant buildings in the 16th District.”

Larkspur’s pitch to city officials for the Shopko site was preliminary and will be coming back to the Plan Commission in a month.

Preliminary details submitted in the company’s operations plan call for 600 to 650 storage units spread across 67000 to 70000 square feet of rentable space. Tentatively the business would operate from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily with customers accessing the interior with key-fobs.

Earlier in the meeting the commission gave final approval to Devon Self Storage’s plans for the Kmart site. Commissioners have the final say in the issuance of a conditional-use permit for the 120893-square-foot building.

Devon which is expected to begin the conversion in the near future will house 848 storage units within a climate-controlled facility. The company plans a drive-through feature for customers looking to load or unload items at different access points on the property.

Lake City FL 32025 City Counsel district 14 Application I’ve written many documents in my life everything from a simple note to complex reports and briefs to be decided by the Courts of Florida. This letter for an application to be considered by this Council for review has proven to be the most difficult. I considered many many things before making a commitment to communicate what I can bring to this board. First let’s talk about why I decided to come to this council. I really had no desire to be up here in front of this council or get involved. I came purely out of social pressure. My friends in the community inspired me to come see what my counterpart was doing. Upon arrival and seeing our chief of police present a power point presentation of what she was doing and her approach to crime I became emotionally charged. It brought to the forefront of my mind all of the crime in my neighborhood and our community that has not been resolved. I was motivated to tell a story that was hard for me to tell. The visions in my mind while telling the story of the brutal attack of my pet were gruesome and shocking at least. I tried to give a recollection of the violence witnessed by my neighbors and the insouciance of our police department. I was dismayed by the acquiescence of this council. This lack of concern from this council of this type of violent crime coupled with the outlandish lack of communication demonstrated by our police department caused great concerns. These actions I witnessed have spawned me to get involved. Had a proper Police response and follow up to my call for help been conducted this assailant would have been arrested. Possibly this persons mental status could have been identified and addressed. However because of the lack of communication this did not happen and this assailant committed more violent acts. These new crimes unfortunately were involving our citizens. This behavior of our leadership must be put in check! We must have action! Let’s talk about what I learned Learning of the open position for my district was a big concern. Why did our former Councilman quit? Why all the conflict Downtown? Why were people quitting? I needed answers to this question and went on a fact finding mission. I started asking questions. Who what when why and how? I needed to see body language as well as the words used. I hit the streets. I poke and prodded all involved. I went behind the scenes and I talked to everyone. I was shut out by a few so I turned up the game and bridged that communication gap. This is what I do. I’m a salesman at heart. Solving problems is what I’ve always been good at. Time was of the essence in this endeavor. Sometimes it takes a little nonsense to bridge a communication gap. The things I learned are why you are reading this report/application today. My conclusion is that this council is as divided as our community. We need a catalyst to start a positive reaction. Now we come to what I can bring to this Council I’ve worn many shirts in my life and worked every type of job you can imagine. My talents and knowledge of tools are extensive. I know my way around an office as well as a construction project. It’s always been easy for me to rise to the top of any field I endeavored. Mainly because I love to learn and I love people. The people of this city have watched me come and go. They have seen me at my worst and at my best. They watched me go to prison. Many thought I got a bad deal and tried to help me. They have seen me fall down and watched me get up brush myself off and get back at it. They watched me put on my painters clothes on and paint shopping centers. They have seen me sit down at the drawing board and design buildings and homes that stand in our community today. They have seen me in the law office helping our Veterans. Many have known me as their landlord. They all know me as a man with a conviction of doing the next right thing. I owe my community a huge debt for making me the man I am today! I believe I possess the ability to bring good common communication back to our community. I believe I have the ability to look beyond the words a man uses and hear what he is really trying to say. I know I have the ability to communicate with every walk of life. My understanding and knowledge of building trades mechanics engineering math men and the law will be an asset to this Council and our Community. My undying devotion to problem solving will be noticed by all. Let’s not overlook the education I received from the FDOC. This experience with the criminal element will definitely bring knowledge and workable solutions to the violence we are seeing in our streets today. To sum up my desire to serve this community I will say that it is my life experiences that will be the most valuable asset that I can bring to this counsel. Thank you for your consideration!

Kenneth (Butch) Bochette --------------------------- Abbie Chasteen Honorable Mayor Witt and City Council: My name is Abbie Chasteen and I am honored to submit my name as a candidate for the District 14 City Council seat. I am a native and lifelong resident of Columbia County and have resided in District 14 since 2008. I am community minded and strongly believe that in order for Lake City to remain a functional municipality it is going to take unity and inclusion to move forward. I have a track record of being fair trustworthy and having a voice of reason. I believe one of my greatest attributes is the love that I have for Lake City and my desire to do all that I can to help make it a great place to live work and play. I am a graduate of Columbia High School Lake City Community College and Saint Leo University where I earned my Bachelors degree in Elementary Education. My family has owned and operated a restaurant business in Lake City my entire life which has provided me with the opportunity to build and foster relationships as well as establish and maintain a strong work ethic drive and sense of community. I was employed with the Columbia County School System from 2006-2012 where I taught 1st grade at Westside Elementary. As an educator my desire for continuous improvement thrived and it is where I learned to be an excellent listener and problem solver. During my time as a teacher I served on various committees within the school planned school wide events and served as team leader for my grade level. In July 2012 I was hired as the Marketing Director for The Lake City - Columbia County Chamber of Commerce and the coordinator for The Ichetucknee Partnership. During my time at the Chamber I worked alongside many leaders in our community and helped to promote our city our county our local businesses and our Chamber. As Marketing Director I was involved in all aspects of the Chamber. My duties included planning community events alongside the City of Lake City such as Trunk or Treat Snow Day and 4th of July Fireworks creating sponsorship opportunities for additional revenue organizing volunteer opportunities working closely with business owners to promote their companies through networking opportunities and assisting with programs such as Dale Carnegie and Leadership Lake City (both of which I completed). While at the Chamber I was fortunate to fill the Chamber seat on the CRA board which much like I expect of the City Council required me to work closely with diverse individuals with a common goal of making Lake City a better place. The Chamber allowed me to learn grow and have a new appreciation for the place that I always called home while developing many of the skills that I believe would serve me well on the Council including planning for growth and the future educating myself and becoming knowledgeable on issues that were previously unfamiliar to me and familiarity with parliamentary procedure. Currently I serve as the Marketing and Public Relations director for a local law firm. My duties include working with our attorneys and staff to develop ideas to generate new business opportunities build and foster relationships with clients maintain a positive brand reputation and support the overall growth and success of the firm. Our firm was founded by Lake City natives and we strive to maintain a strong connection to our community in all that we do. My experiences of being raised in the restaurant business teaching school and marketing for the Chamber and law firm have all afforded me with a variety of opportunities that I feel would benefit me in this position. I have built lasting relationships with all types of people taught the future leaders of our great city and worked with and learned from the sharpest business minds in our community. I am not a lifelong politician or someone who is looking to add to my resume. I am a concerned citizen who feels she can make a difference in the lives and businesses in Lake City Florida. Admittedly I do not know everything there is to know about City government but I am willing to work hard and learn while listening to my constituents to also act in the best interest of the City and its residents. I can’t promise I will be able to fix all of the problems that we are experiencing. What I will promise is that I will give it 100%. I am confident that I have the ability temperament and desire to serve the City of Lake City with excellence. I am excited about the possibility to serve my community. Whoever is selected for this role has the chance to make a difference in the future of Lake City that will be felt for years to come. I look forward to speaking with the Council about this opportunity to serve our great city. Sincerely

Abbie E. Chasteen --------------------------- Befaithful (Bea) Coker 636 SE Baya Drive

My responsibilities at Georgia-Pacific included managing $3 billion in contracts as the sole paralegal for the packaging division. I managed this task while completing a college degree giving birth to Victoria and being very active in the community. The knowledge and experience I gained is shared in my local community through my small business consultancy the community engagements of my charitable organization and while raising my pretty active children in this place called home. Working in our Community Helping in other communities refreshed memories created right here in Lake City and fueled my strong desire to return and share with our local community. I have learned it isn’t the quantity but the quality of the effort we exert as individuals that make a difference. It isn't a “Hollywood "" dreamer that we necessarily need in Lake City but an unselfish desire to be part of the solution. I am proud to raise my children in Lake City beside many of you. I am passionate about maintaining safety preserving their childhood and protecting their future. Our efforts have been great yet there is much house cleaning needed and more growth to come.

We need direction and demonstrated commitment to the future of our city through proven efforts and appreciation for all citizens. Working together requires understanding experience and outlook. I strive to help others and help this community. I have no problem maintaining decorum while making the tough decisions and upholding accountability.

I am the best person for this seat because I want the best for all of us recognizing and appreciating the significance of our laws and rules. I fully understand improvement is necessary; however I also believe pursuing needed change must occur in decency and order and requires the efforts of us all to accomplish that goal.

But critics are crying foul.

The Peconic River Sportsman’s Club which had previously been granted a lease by the county in 1998 has enjoyed use of the property for decades. Signs on county-owned land enclosed in a fence around the property warn visitors that ""trespassing for any purpose is strictly forbidden"" but the county asserts the group doesn't have ""exclusive"" use of the facility because ""the group provides many opportunities for the public to participate in programs at the site"" including shooting ""matches and competitions fishing events charity events.""

Leg. Al Krupski (D-Southold) who co-sponsored the measure with Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said the group had approached him to expedite the lease approval four years before it expired so that it could continue to plan longer-term events.

Suffolk has owned the property since 1963 according to the board resolution and later ""assigned"" it to the former Babylon Rod and Gun Club which renamed itself the Peconic River Sportsman’s Club in 1977. The approved legislation says it ""shall be maintained operated and managed by the Club as open or green space and a buffer area.""

""It’s really a neat place"" Krupski said Wednesday. The resolution touts the property’s use for hunting fishing nature photography canoeing hiking and nature study. But unless they are expressly invited ordinary county residents wouldn’t know the land was county-owned park land much less have access to it said John Turner a conservationist at the Seatuck Environmental Association.

""I don’t know of anything like this [lease arrangement] anywhere"" Turner said.

During a recent visit to the land he said he pointed out the no-trespassing signs at the fenced boundary of the property warning would-be visitors to keep out. ""That sign is clearly misleading"" he said. ""The land is owned by you and me.""

State Assemb. Steve Englebright (D-Seatauket) questioned the legality of the county entering into the exclusive contract as well as the fenced access to a more than one-mile stretch of the Peconic River inside the preserve.

""In each instance it appears to me there is a violation of the public trust and possibly the law as it relates to the alienation of park land and the rights of the public to access public water and land"" he said.

Dick Amper executive director for the Long Island Pine Barrens Society a preservation group said the county lease ""never should have been. It excludes the public benefit of the value of this property. This should not be in the hands of a private club.""

Turner recently wrote to County Parks Commissioner Jason Smagin to urge him to ""look out for the interests"" of county taxpayers by including a provision in the final lease that ""ensures the general public with meaningful and regular access to the property so they may be able to enjoy the property they collectively own."" He noted that by the time the new lease expires Suffolk residents will have been locked out of access to the parkland for ""86 straight years.""

Emily Lauri director of community relations for the Parks Department said the Peconic River Sportsman's Club pays the county an annual fee of $9301.48 with a yearly 3% increase for use of the land. The agreement precludes the club from making ""alterations"" without the department's OK. The club must also conduct lead remediation every five years or less and maintain fire lanes and fencing. Turner noting that six-foot high fencing essentially encloses the park said that's problematic for the free movement of wildlife.

Krupski argued that the sportsmen’s arrangement is no different from other county concessions such as the Indian Island golf course in which an outside vendor manages and operates the property on behalf of the county. Hikers he noted can’t simply walk onto the golf course.

But visitors can’t access the Peconic River Sportsman’s Club without an invitation. The facility has key-card locked gates on Connecticut Avenue and on River Road across from the former Grumman site in Calverton. The group’s website while touting its use by federal and local law enforcement for arms training and charitable events doesn’t provide any information for how county residents can access the area or join the group which collects $628000 a year in dues according to Guidestar.org. It’s annual revenues in 2020 were just under $1 million with assets valued at just under $3.2 million. Lauri said the group doesn't charge outside groups for use of the site and said no Bellone or county officials are members.

A club member who answered the facility’s phone Wednesday declined to comment and calls to the club weren't returned.

Turner said he was able to speak to Smagin this week to request that the county carve out an agreement in the new lease that would make the county portion of the land accessible to the public at times it’s not being used for shooting events.

The property features a man-made pond created decades ago by a dam on the Peconic River which runs through the property.

Turner said a last-minute proposal under consideration by the Parks Department would let the sportsman’s club determine when access is granted to nonmembers a plan that he called ""not appropriate.""

Krupski said he had asked during the legislative session whether the public was seeking access to the property. Smagin he said ""hadn’t heard of any demand of its use.""

Turner said that is likely because no one knows about the property much less that they collectively own it.

""I don’t know of any other analogous situation to this anywhere on or off Long Island"" he said. ""This seems to me to be a unique set of circumstances. It’s very troubling. Why would the public want to support spending money"" on the land purchase if they can’t visit the property?

Lauri indicated county residents have ample alternatives to the sportsman's club.

""The county owns thousands of acres in the surrounding area to this property which allows for regular use by the public but if this agreement didn’t exist there would be a tremendous amount of additional financial and staff resources needed to provide these recreational opportunities to the public"" she wrote. ""This organization and agreement allows for activities and maintenance of the property that the county does not and would be unable to provide.""",,,

Taiwan's TSMC is the world's top foundry player

Samsung Electronics Co. caught its global semiconductor competitors off guard last week at the Samsung Foundry Forum 2021 with its announced plan to mass produce 2 nanometer chips from 2025. Samsung had long not unveiled a detailed roadmap for semiconductor micro-process production largely because the imprisonment of its vice chairman Jay Y. Lee had delayed major investment decisions. Meanwhile within the last year bigger foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and US tech giant Intel Corp. announced massive investment plans on the 3-nanometer process node.Samsung had been predicted to join the race for the 3-nm process but instead revealed a plan for 2mn chips that could help the company overtake TSMC sooner than expected.TSMC is the global foundry leader with an estimated market share of 53-56%. Samsung the second-largest foundry maker had until recently occupied about 17%.But the gap between the two companies has been widening recently. TSMC raised its market share to 58% in the second quarter from 55% in the first while Samsung’s shares fell to 14% from 17% during the same period according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.While the Taiwanese company was preparing aggressive measures to expand the market Samsung postponed investment plans due to the absence of its top decision-maker. Earlier this year TSMC announced it will invest $100 billion in the foundry business over the next three years. It is set to start operations of a 5 nm factory in the US state of Arizona from 2024 while considering a 28 nm chip plant for automotive semiconductors in Japan. The leader was known to be discussing a production line in Germany.

TSMC’s bold plans came as the global foundry industry is rapidly growing with more and more companies seeking self-sufficiency in semiconductors.Apple Inc. is slated to release a laptop equipped with the M1X its own system chipsets soon. In August Tesla Inc. unveiled the D1 chip for artificial intelligence (AI). Google recently launched the Tensor an application processor designed in-house for its Pixel phones. Carmakers which have been suffering from the ongoing automotive chip shortage are also seeking to develop the components by themselves.The global foundry market is forecast to grow to $130.3 billion in 2027 from $83.7 billion this year according to a tech industry researcher Omdia.The bullish outlook prompted Intel to resume the foundry business  industry sources analyzed. In July Intel unveiled plans to produce the 20A chips using circuitry measured at 2 nm in 2024 and 1.8 nm chips in 2025 although the industry was skeptical if the company will able to secure a stable yield or ratio of properly working products of 2 nm or below.Samsung’s plan for mass production of micro-process chip is likely to restructure the global foundry market. The company aims to apply its proprietary gate-all-around (GAA) transistor architecture a key technology that improves electrostatic properties that translate into increased performance reduced power and optimal chip design according to Samsung.

That is expected to help Samsung attract major clients such as Google Qualcomm and Apple that are seeking micro-process products since TSMC has yet to unveil its roadmap for 2 nm chip volume production analysts said.Samsung also said it will begin mass production of its first-generation 3 nm chips in the first half of next year compared to July 2022 when TSMC is known to be manufacturing the products in large quantities.The South Korean tech giant is predicted to expand its global foundry market share. Samsung’s share is forecast to reach up to 40% this year in the global market for chips of 10 nm or below according to Taiwan-based market researcher TrendForce.“Smartphone makers in addition to server producers are preferring micro-process chips with better performance and power efficiency” said an industry source. “Increasing demand for chips of 10 nm or below will narrow the gap between Samsung and TSMC.”Sin-Young Park at nyusos@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tb2JpbGUtdGFicy9pcGhvbmUtc2UtMy10by1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LW9mZmVyLWFwcGxlcy1hMTUtY2hpcC1hbmQtc3VwcG9ydC1mb3ItNWctZGVzaWduLWRldGFpbHMtNzU2MTc1My_SAZgBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW9iaWxlLXRhYnMvaXBob25lLXNlLTMtdG8tcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1vZmZlci1hcHBsZXMtYTE1LWNoaXAtYW5kLXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLTVnLWRlc2lnbi1kZXRhaWxzLTc1NjE3NTMvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone SE 3 to reportedly offer Apple’s A15 chip and support for 5G,"Apple is expected to launch the successor to the iPhone SE (2020) in 2022 as per various reports.

The camera processor and overall design make it a steal for Visible customers but for a little more cash you can find phones with better software support and a little more overall polish.

It’s easy to get drowned out when you go up against mid-range names like the Google Pixel 5a and the Galaxy A52 5G. Yet ZTE may have found a way to cut through some of the noise with its 5G-ready Blade X1. With four cameras on the back a headphone jack on the bottom and a Snapdragon processor at its heart the perfect price to undercut the competition seems to be the icing on top. But is it the complete package? Find out more in Android Authority‘s ZTE Blade X1 review.

What you need to know about the ZTE Blade X1

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

ZTE Blade X1 (6GB/128GB): $384 (Visible exclusive) The Blade X1 slots right into the center of ZTE’s lineup — not quite up to the Axon 30 family yet easily the most powerful member of the Blade lineup. It comes in a single configuration with just one color option but 128GB of expandable storage is plenty for a mid-ranger. The ZTE Blade X1 we tested arrived with Android 10 on board as well as the October 1 2020 security patch — an Android 11 update was not available at the time of writing. It’s also restricted as a Visible-exclusive device in the United States but you can unlock it for use on other networks after 60 days.

ZTE entrusted Qualcomm’s 5G-ready Snapdragon 765G processor with keeping everything running at top speeds which is the same processor that powered the Google Pixel 5a and OnePlus Nord. It’s paired with 6GB of RAM and a 4000mAh battery. The large 6.5-inch Full HD+ LCD display with a capped 60Hz refresh rate ties everything together complete with a punch hole selfie camera in the top left corner. See also: The best ZTE phones you can buy

The ZTE Blade X1 comes with a USB-A to USB-C charger in the box and a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3 block for good measure. It’s available in a single Dark Blue finish that really shines in the right light.

The ZTE’s mid-ranger fits into a similar price category as the Google Pixel 5a OnePlus Nord N200 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and even the iPhone SE. Though the Blade’s rivals may hold an edge in certain specs it manages to undercut the Pixel and the iPhone in terms of pricing at just $384.

What’s good?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

Budget phones can be a mess for Android skins and pre-installed bloatware but the ZTE Blade X1 is a breath of fresh air. The device is fast and smooth straight out of the box with no extra apps of any kind. In fact the simplicity feels almost like using a Pixel device. Even the AccuWeather-powered weather app — the one non-Google addition — doesn’t look out of place.

The Blade X1’s 6.5-inch display is the perfect size for everything from streaming to gaming. The punch hole camera is small enough to be easy to ignore and the Full HD+ resolution is crisp enough considering the price. Filling out the media experience is a mono down-firing speaker that’s more than loud enough to blast your favorite songs. It does fall victim to some distortion as you get louder but it’s better than many mono speakers at the price. However you’ll need to plug in a pair of wired headphones via the very welcome 3.5mm headphone jack to take advantage of the FM Radio app.

ZTE's Android skin is nearly perfect — there are no ads or bloatware to be found.

Even the shape of the Blade X1 is just right for long-term usage. It’s slightly wider at the back with a gentle taper towards the screen. You’ll also notice a shallow dent at the top and bottom which is just about perfect for resting your thumbs.

As far as security options go ZTE is happy to let you choose. The Blade X1 offers a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner or face unlock though the latter relies on software so will be less secure. Check out: The best budget camera phones you can buy

Some OEMs cut major corners regarding budget-friendly camera options but not the ZTE Blade X1. Its primary 48MP sensor is sharp and works well in decent-to-great lighting. The camera app is straightforward to navigate too. ZTE’s peripheral camera modes aren’t quite as impressive but the ultra-wide shooter can lead to some fun results. You can even tap into several portrait effects and try a monochrome mode with red green or blue color-saving options. ZTE’s Bokeh mode also lets you choose your level of background blur (f/1.0 up to f/8.0) for customizable portrait shots.

I also found the battery life to be more than enough for a full day of use and I often got close to two days on a single charge. The 4000mAh cell isn’t massive for a 5G-ready device but I didn’t notice any passive drain. Of course 18W charging helped get me back on my feet any time the Blade X1 hit zero jumping to 45% in 30 minutes and picking up a full charge in about 80 minutes.

What’s not so good?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

Android 11 has been out for a year now having launched in September 2020. Yet the ZTE Blade X1 launched with Android 10 on board in January 2021 and has stayed there. It hasn’t had so much as an Android security patch beyond October 1 2020 which is just not acceptable at this point. Especially considering rivals devices from Samsung Google and Apple offer comprehensive long-term support even on mid-range smartphones.

We reached out to ZTE about the software concerns and were told that the second security update rolled out in September. However the Blade X1 we tested has yet to receive the update we were also informed that support is slated to continue for two years from the launch date though no guarantees were given regarding platform upgrades.

The lack of Android 11 is only the start of the Blade X1's update issues.

Mentioning advantages from rival devices the LCD display and lack of a defined refresh rate come up short. It’s not too hard to find an OLED panel in this price bracket — take the Pixel 5a or Galaxy A52 5G for example. Additionally both the OnePlus Nord N200 and the Galaxy A52 5G offer 90Hz and 120Hz panels respectively but you’re stuck at 60Hz here. ZTE also skipped any form of Gorilla Glass so it may be worth investing in a screen protector as well.

I’m also not entirely sold on the Blade X1’s glossy plastic construction. The Dark Blue finish looks great in the right lighting but only if you manage to keep the phone free of fingerprints. However it’s nearly impossible to do so and it just doesn’t look the same covered in smudges. You could always add a clear case on top but it’s tough to add too much more bulk without making it feel a little unwieldy. ZTE also skipped an IP rating on the Blade X1 a feature that has slowly been making its way into the affordable realm. While not common historically it would have been nice to see some basic water resistance on a near-$400 device.

The Blade X1’s Snapdragon 765G processor was an impressive jump for mid-range silicon back in 2020. However it’s not the fastest or most powerful option out there these days. It’s still serviceable and will be fine for everyday tasks and light gaming but it may start to show its age in a year or so. Related: The best 5G phones you can buy right now

Although the Blade X1 has a solid set of cameras you’ll probably only use the regular and ultra-wide cameras with any regularity. The 2MP macro camera isn’t sharp enough for much more than to show off occasionally even if it produces acceptable results in good lighting.

I also noticed that the Blade X1 has trouble with portraits on occasion especially with identifying edges. You can choose from some interesting effects like Studio Light and Window Blinds but they tend to highlight the areas where the camera comes up short.

Unfortunately as I was testing the phone the Blade X1’s cameras simply stopped working at one point. I could no longer flip between the selfie and main cameras and there were no software updates to save me from my struggles. In the end I ended up falling back on the old factory reset which brought the camera back to life.

ZTE Blade X1 review: Should I buy it?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

If you’re on a budget and itching to try Verizon’s Visible service this is the way to do it. However there’s no good way to get your hands on a ZTE Blade X1 with any other carrier in the US. That’s a shame because the ZTE Blade X1 is more than competitive when it comes to the camera processor and RAM with many phones in its price tier.

Where the Blade X1 comes up well short is the software. It’s not good enough to have a device running on an outdated security patch for more than a year and the lack of a long-term promise for platform upgrades is far behind rivals from Samsung and Google. See also: The best budget phones you can buy

We’ve already mentioned the closest alternatives to the Blade X1 in the Pixel 5a ($449) Galaxy A52 5G ($499) and OnePlus Nord N200 ($239). The former two hold more value and power for your money while the Nord N200 is a cheaper entry into 5G albeit with a similarly questionable software situation.

ZTE Blade X1 ZTE's sneaky excellent mid-ranger offers some of the best value for your money. An excellent main camera a light and fast Android skin and ample storage and RAM give the Blade X1 an impressive edge. See price at Visible

In the higher mid-range segment their MediaTek Dimensity 1200 Dimensity 1100 and Dimensity 1000 had done exceptionally well. However their chipsets aren’t up to level with Qualcomm’s premium Snapdragon chipsets. However the next MediaTek flagship chipset may silence many saying this.

The MediaTek Dimensity 2000 5G chipset is predicted to perform comparably to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 898 5G processor which has yet to be announced. It is predicted to perform admirably in gaming and heavy multitasking because of the ARM Cortex flagship main CPU.

MediaTek Dimensity 2000 vs Qualcomm Snapdragon 898

The MediaTek Dimensity 2000 chipset’s official release date and specifications are unknown. However rumors and leaks have circulated about the chipset’s specifications on the internet.

Process

According to a new claim the MediaTek Dimensity 2000 chipset would be 25% more energy-efficient than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 898 chipset. Remember that it’s 25%; for an OEM like MediaTek it is a considerable leap. It will use TSMC’s 4nm technology rather than Samsung’s which could be the main cause for the lower energy consumption. The 898 Chipset on the other hand will be manufactured at Samsung’s 4nm process (named 4LPE).

CPU

The Dimensity 2000 is expected to flaunt a Cortex X2 primary CPU followed by three Cortex A710 and four Cortex A510 CPUs. On the other hand the Snapdragon 898 will also feature a three-cluster architecture design i.e. 1x Cortex-X2 at 3.0GHz + 3x Cortex-A710 at 2.5GHz + 4x Cortex-A510 at 1.8GHz.

GPU

ARM Mali G79 will handle the gaming part on Dimensity 2000. There is no hint on the performance of this GPU. So we must wait for the official release to check its Gaming performance. On the other hand Snapdragon 898 will use an in-house Adreno 730 GPU instead of Arm’s GPU. It is expected that Dimensity 2000 will outperform Exynos 2200 in CPU Performance while the gaming performance remains untested.

The outcome: a welcome 107000 square-foot boost for the downtown office market.



The four-year-old firm was working out of a 25000-square-foot Knotel flex-space until Knotel went bankrupt early this year.

Orchard relocated temporarily to a WeWork location on West 14th Street but needed much more elbow room for its growing staff.



Now it’s signed a lease on three floors at L&L Holding Company’s 195 Broadway the landmarked “wedding-cake” tower between Fulton and Dey streets.

Ironically part of Orchard’s new space was originally built out for Knotel which never took possession.



Orchard achieved unicorn status earlier this month when it announced that it had raised $100 million in Series D funding lifting its total valuation to over $1 billion.

It had major growth plans even before that and was urgently looking for a proper home. Cushman & Wakefield’s Peter Trivelas who represented Orchard with Cushman’s Gary Ceder said “We started out looking at short-term subleases around Manhattan.” But when they checked out 195 Broadway L&L “got creative” and made them a better offer for a direct lease that dovetailed with Orchard’s swift growth needs Trivelas said.

Orchard’s leasing deal for three floors at the downtown tower includes some “free rent.” Alan Schindler

Orchard will have the entire 25th and 26th floors and part of the 24th. As is typical of today’s market the 10-year lease includes “significant free rent” for a time Trivelas said.

“They won’t pay for the full 107000 square feet for several years.” The firm won’t move in all at once but rather in stages over the next year. The deal includes expansion options in the building.

Trivelas said it has the option of terminating the lease if L&L is unable to provide the additional space but that’s unlikely as the timing of several lease expirations at 195 Broadway coincides with the firm’s expansion plans. The asking rent was in the mid-$50s per square foot.

Most of Orchard’s 200 employees have worked from home but will move into their new digs in January Trivelas said. They’ll enjoy river and skyline views abundant light through large windows and proximity to fabled restaurant Nobu on the ground floor.

L&L leasing director Andrew Wiener said that 195 Broadway was fully leased pre-pandemic and only has three floors available now.

“The beauty of this [Orchard] transaction is” Wiener said “that we have a lease expiring at the end of 2022 which provided the additional space they needed” starting in September of next year.

Wiener confirmed the free-rent portion of the lease which he described as “market.”

Other tenants at 195 Broadway include Gucci (for its US headquarters) Omnicom and HarperCollins.

Midtown’s restaurant-reopening express barrels on. Ralph Lauren’s Polo Bar a favorite of the high-end real estate crowd will greet customers to its main dining room on Oct. 12 for the first time since the great lockdown of March 2020.



Although the Polo was recently used for private events in its ground-floor lounge Midtown movers and shakers yearned to return to its plush see-and-be-seen underground dining room where “Ralph’s famous” corned beef sandwich was a top seller.

The Polo’s power crowd included elected officials top lawyers media titans and show business stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Kanye West. We once saw pre-presidential Donald Trump order a well-done steak and true to form bolt after only a few bites.



A previously announced new lease for accounting firm BDO USA vindicated Tishman Speyer’s major redesign of the lobby and other public areas of 200 Park Ave. the former MetLife building.

The 145000-square-foot lease represents a consolidation of BDO’s three Manhattan offices into a single location in the 3.1-million-square-foot tower which Tishman Speyer has owned with Irvine Company since 2005.



As we reported earlier improvements to the massive avenue-straddling tower include a restoration of the original lobby a new visitor reception lounge and a streamlined pedestrian connection to Grand Central Terminal.



The Orchard Technologies and BDO USA deals came on the heels of a robust third-quarter Manhattan leasing season.

CBRE reports that leasing surged over the second quarter and was the strongest performance since the pandemic’s onset.



Third-quarter leasing of 5.88 million square feet was up 70 percent from the second quarter — although not surprisingly 5 percent below the five-year quarterly average of 6.16 million square feet.



Net absorption for the third quarter was up by 465000 square feet — “helping to chip away at historically high availability rates” said CBRE senior director of research and analysis Nicole LaRusso.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And if he can remain steady on this newfound path full of gratitude and appreciation Brown could help Brady and the Buccaneers repeat as Super Bowl champions in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idWNzbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEwLzIyNzE3OTcxL3RhbXBhLWJheS1idWNjYW5lZXJzLXZzLW1pYW1pLWRvbHBoaW5zLXJlY2FwLW5mbC13ZWVrLTUtdG9tLWJyYWR5LWFudG9uaW8tYnJvd24tbWlrZS1ldmFuc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucs vs. Dolphins recap: Brady throws for five touchdowns in 45-17 win,"Fresh off of what was an emotional 19-17 win over the Patriots in Foxborough last Sunday night the Buccaneers returned to Raymond James Stadium on Sunday afternoon for a Week 5 matchup against the Miami Dolphins.

Tampa Bay came into Sunday’s game without Rob Gronkowski (ribs) Antoine Winfield Jr. (concussion) Sean Murphy-Bunting (elbow) Carlton Davis (quad) and Patrick O’Connor (calf). Not to mention Giovani Bernard (knee) Jamel Dean (knee) and Jason Pierre-Paul (shoulder) all entered the day with the “questionable” designation. Simply put the Bucs were banged-up heading into this one but they showed in Week 4 that they could overcome. They were looking to do so again in front of the home fans on Sunday before having to hit the road again on a short week with a Thursday Night Football matchup in Philadelphia awaiting in Week 6.

Miami which came into Sunday at 1-3 on the year has been dealing with its own significant absences. Starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was placed on injured reserve two weeks ago with an injury to his ribs so this week’s game against the Bucs marked the third consecutive start for former New England Patriot and Indianapolis Colt Jacoby Brissett. To make matters worse the receiving corps would be without Will Fuller (who is also on injured reserve) and DeVante Parker. The Dolphins were looking to snap a three-game losing streak in this one as they followed their season-opening win over New England with a 35-0 loss to the Bills a 31-28 overtime defeat against the Raiders and a 27-17 loss to the Colts last week.

Even with the injury situation they find themselves in the Bucs were understandably heavy favorites coming into their first 1:00 p.m. contest of the season. They were 11-point favorites with ESPN’s FPI Matchup Predictor giving them a 75% chance to improve to 4-1 on the year.

The Bucs started fast on offense and slow on defense but recovered well enough to take a 24-10 lead into the locker room. They clung to a 24-17 lead after three quarters before steamrolling the Dolphins the rest of the way scoring 21 fourth-quarter points to win 45-17 and improve to 4-1 on the season ahead of a Week 6 trip to Philadelphia.

Game Recap

The Buccaneers won the coin toss and elected to defer to the second half so after Bradley Pinion delivered a touchback Jacoby Brissett and the Miami offense opened up their first drive at the 25-yard line. Jaylen Waddle got two yards around the right end on first down then Brissett found Preston Williams for a 21-yard gain near the sideline on second down after avoiding a Joe Tryon-Shoyinka sack. The Bucs challenged the completed catch but the call stood after the review. Jason Pierre-Paul was then called for offsides on the next play getting the Dolphins across midfield.

From there it didn’t take long for Miami to threaten. After a short throw to Myles Gaskin Brissett found Williams again this time for a gain of 34 yards to the Bucs’ 9. The defense stood tall from there stopping Gaskin twice before an incomplete pass on third down forced a Miami field goal try. Jason Sanders’ attempt from 23 yards out was successful giving the Dolphins an early 3-0 lead after an eight-play 70-yard drive that lasted 3:43.

After an illegal formation penalty on the kickoff the Buccaneer offense started its first drive at the 20-yard line. Leonard Fournette picked up one yard on first down then Tom Brady got the chains moving with a nine-yard pass to O.J. Howard. The Bucs got across midfield on the very next play with Mike Evans doing well to come back to a Brady pass for a pickup of 26 yards. Fournette then broke free for a gain of 17 to the Miami 27-yard line which set up a 13-yard pass from Brady to Chris Godwin off of play-action. And after struggling in the red zone last week the Tampa Bay offense cashed in on its first trip inside the 20 this week. After a four-yard run by Fournette and an incomplete pass Brady hung in the pocket on third down and found Giovani Bernard for a 10-yard touchdown. With Ryan Succop’s PAT the Bucs had a 7-3 lead with 7:04 to go in the first quarter.

Brissett and the Miami offense began their second drive—like their first one—from the 25 after a Pinion touchback. Tampa Bay’s defensive front continued to get solid pressure on the quarterback to open the drive but Brissett continued to avoid it and find open receivers. After finding Gaskin for nine and 12 yards—with a three-yard run by Gaskin mixed in—the Dolphins were near midfield. A 10-yard completion to Mack Hollins followed by a pass interference penalty on Ross Cockrell got Miami to the 29 then two plays later Gaskin beat Pierre-Paul in coverage for a 24-yard touchdown catch from Brissett. With Sanders’ PAT it was a 10-7 Miami lead at the 3:16 mark in the first quarter.

Starting drive No. 2 from the 25-yard line the Buccaneer offense picked up where it left off. First Brady linked up with Antonio Brown for a 10-yard pickup. That marked Brown’s 900th career reception making him the fastest player in NFL history to reach the 900-catch mark.

Fournette then picked up eight before Brady and Godwin connected for an 18-yard gain across midfield. After an incomplete pass and a six-yard pass to Fournette the Bucs converted a 3rd & 4 thanks to a 15-yard pass from Brady to Evans. Ronald Jones II then got his first carry and picked up four yards to the 14-yard line to bring us to the end of the first quarter. After 15 minutes it was Miami leading 10-7 though the Bucs were threatening to retake the lead.

After an incomplete pass to open the second quarter Brady was sacked by Jerome Baker for a loss of 10. That brought Succop out for a 42-yard field goal attempt which he nailed to tie the game at 10 apiece.

Brissett who had been announced as questionable to return with a hamstring injury minutes prior remained in the game to start Miami’s third drive. A short pass to Gaskin and a one-yard run by Salvon Ahmed set up a 3rd & 4 which resulted in an incomplete pass. That led to the game’s first punt which was a 39-yarder by Michael Palardy. That set the Bucs up at their own 30 with another chance to regain the lead.

Jones stayed in the game at running back for the Bucs to start the next possession getting seven yards on two carries to set up a 3rd & 3. Not only did the offense convert on the next play—they went right ahead and scored. Brady hung in the pocket and delivered a beautiful throw to Brown who pulled away from Miami defenders and took it the rest of the way for a 62-yard touchdown. With that—plus Succop’s extra point—it was a 17-10 lead for the Bucs.

Brissett and Isaiah Ford connected for three yards to open the Dolphins’ next drive with Richard Sherman coming up for the stop. An incomplete pass on second down forced a 3rd & 7 but Miami kept the Tampa Bay defense on the field as Brissett and Mike Gesicki linked up for the first time on the afternoon getting 12 yards and a first down. A couple of short completions then forced another third down and this time on 3rd & 3 Cockrell came flying across Jaylen Waddle to break up Brissett’s pass. Miami lined up to go for it on 4th & 3—even after the Bucs called a timeout—before eventually taking a delay of game after failing to draw the Bucs offsides. Palardy’s punt was downed at the 23 which was where the Buccaneer offense would take over in an attempt to go up by two scores.

Fournette picked up a hard-fought six yards to open Tampa Bay’s next series then Brady and Brown connected again for a first down to the 35. After an incomplete pass deep to Evans Brady found Howard for a first down for the second time on the day. Another miss deep to Brown preceded a completion over the middle to Fournette who ran over a defender on his way to another first down across midfield. The Bucs continued to look for the deep ball from there but Brady’s pass was incomplete once again as Godwin fell down during his route. But Tampa Bay got some help from an encroachment penalty with a free five yards moving the ball to a 2nd & 5 at the 40.

The Bucs kept it moving from the 40 with an 11-yard pass to Fournette and a 12-yarder to Brate getting the ball inside the red zone again. Two plays later the offense faced a 3rd & 3 at the 10. The two-minute warning hit so the third-down try would have to come after the break.

Out of the two-minute warning Brown drew a pass interference call just shy of the goal line giving the Bucs a first down at the 3-yard line. After Fournette was stopped for no gain on first down Tampa Bay found the end zone on second. Brady found Brown for a four-yard score and after Succop’s PAT the Bucs had a 24-10 lead with 1:48 to go in the first half. The touchdown capped a 13-play 77-yard drive that took 6:19 off the clock.

To avoid giving the Bucs a chance to go up by three scores to start the second half the Dolphins needed to get moving and score some points on their next drive. Brissett found Waddle for 21 yards to open the possession then Gaskin caught a six-yard pass before a Tampa Bay injury timeout as Lavonte David was shaken up. Out of the timeout Miami kept it moving with pickups of 10 and eight yards to the Tampa Bay 30-yard line. But it was then that the Buccaneer defense came up with a huge turnover as Shaquil Barrett forced a Brissett fumble that Ndamukong Suh recovered at the 34-yard line. With that it was Buccaneer ball with 34 seconds left before halftime.

An incomplete pass and an 11-yard pass from Brady to Evans led to a spike to stop the clock with 12 seconds left then Brady took off on the next play for a 13-yard run. That set up a 60-yard field goal attempt by Bradley Pinion—yes Bradley Pinion—that was unsuccessful. With that the Bucs took a 24-10 lead into the locker room.

After a touchback on the opening kickoff of the second half the Tampa Bay offense went right back to work. Fournette ran for 13 yards on first down and another three on the next play before Brady and Evans connected for five yards to the 46 bringing up a 3rd & 2. Brady missed on third down though leading to a punt from Pinion. After a 41-yarder was caught at the 13 by Waddle the Miami offense went back to work down by 14.

The Buccaneer defense took the field without Lavonte David to open the second half as he was officially ruled out for the remainder of the game with an ankle injury. The Dolphins got moving to start their first possession of the second half with Gaskin continuing to be the primary threat. He caught a four-yard pass to start the drive before running for a 13-yard gain then Preston Williams caught a seven-yard pass to the 37-yard line. Gesicki managed to get wide open on the next play catching a 23-yard pass from Brissett to get the ball down to Tampa Bay’s 40.

An incomplete pass and a four-yard run by Ahmed then brought up a 3rd & 6 that the Dolphins converted as Brissett once again avoided pressure and hit Waddle for a 10-yard pickup. Two plays later the Bucs had Brissett wrapped up but he somehow still managed to get the throw off and complete it for seven yards to Gaskin. On the next play Richard Sherman was called for pass interference in the end zone setting the Dolphins up with a 1st & Goal at the 1-yard line. It took just two plays from there for Miami to get back within one possession as Brissett found—who else—Gaskin for a one-yard touchdown. After Sanders’ PAT the Bucs’ lead was down to 24-17 with 6:56 left in the third quarter.

The Bucs opened up their next drive with back-to-back incompletions from Brady but the 44-year-old converted on 3rd & 10 with a 12-yard pass to Brown. Fournette followed with a six-yard run then Godwin took a short pass six more yards for another first down. Brady was sacked for a loss of five on the next play but the Bucs got those yards—and more—back as he found Godwin for a gain of 14 to bring up a 3rd & 1 at the Miami 42. A well-executed play-action led to another 12-yard gain with Brady hitting Godwin again this time to the 30-yard line. Two plays later Brady threw to Fournette who forged his way forward for 16 yards to the Miami 13. Jones picked up four yards on the next play and Godwin got four more on the next play setting up a 3rd & 2 to open the fourth quarter. After three the Bucs had a 24-17 lead with a chance to add to it early in the fourth.

The Bucs opened the fourth quarter by finding the end zone with Fournette getting into the end zone from five yards out. After the PAT from Succop Tampa Bay’s lead was back to two scores at 31-17. The touchdown finished off a 13-play 75-yard drive that lasted 6:59. It was quite the answer for the Buccaneer offense after Miami had closed the gap with what was almost a six-minute drive of its own.

Gesicki caught a pass for no gain on the opening play of the Dolphins’ next possession then Brissett threw incomplete for Waddle to bring up a quick 3rd & 10. A deep ball intended for Williams fell incomplete on the next play getting the Tampa Bay defense right off the field and giving the offense a chance to go up by three scores and put the game away.

Palardy’s punt went for 36 yards to the Bucs’ 39 which was where Brady and the offense took over with 13:59 left. On first down Brady found Jones out of the backfield for a 15-yard gain before Jones picked up another five on the next play. A seven-yard screen pass to Brown kept the chains moving with the Bucs getting a first down at the Miami 34. On the next play Tampa Bay went for the kill with Brady dropping a dime to Evans for a 34-yard touchdown. The PAT from Succop made it 38-17 with 11:49 to go.

A couple of decent gains by Ahmed quickly went to waste on the next Miami drive as Brissett had a pass go off of Waddle’s hands and fall into the arms of Jamel Dean for an interception. That gave the ball right back to Tampa Bay at the 41-yard line.

Brady and Tyler Johnson linked up on back-to-back plays to start the next series with the second-year receiver getting 19 yards and nine to set up a 2nd & 1 at the 12. False starts on Donovan Smith and Antonio Brown backed the offense up to a 2nd & 11 at the 22 but it didn’t matter. On the next play Brady threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Evans. The greatest of all time’s fifth touchdown pass of the day and Succop’s sixth PAT of the day put the Bucs in front by a score of 45-17 with 8:57 to go.

The Dolphins got the ball near midfield quickly on their next drive thanks to a 21-yard pass from Brissett to Durham Smythe but the drive stalled there. On 3rd & 5 the Buccaneer front finally got to Brissett with Shaquil Barrett and Vita Vea splitting a sack. That forced a punt which gave the ball back to the Buccaneer offense at its 13.

As it was announced that Tom Brady had set a new franchise record for consecutive passes without an interception (200) Blaine Gabbert took over under center. Codey McElroy caught a pass for no gain to open the drive but a late hit gave the Bucs a free 15 yards. Bernard then ran for 17 and caught a four-yard pass to get the ball near midfield with just over five minutes to go. A Miami penalty and a 14-yard pass to Tyler Johnson set the Bucs up with a 1st & Goal at the 5 on the other side of the two-minute warning.

Rather than go for the 50-burger after the break Tampa Bay decided to run out the clock. After three straight kneel-downs by Gabbert the Bucs had officially put the finishing touches on a 45-17 win that got them to 4-1 on the season.

Quick Notes & Stats

Last week’s win over New England marked Tampa Bay’s 10th 3-1 start in franchise history and with its win over Miami on Sunday the 2021 squad became the first Buccaneer team since 2002 to get to 4-1 after a 3-1 start. Of course that 2002 team went on to win the franchise’s first Super Bowl.

Tom Brady had a phenomenal day completing 30 of his 41 passes for 411 yards and five touchdowns. He also set a new franchise record for consecutive passes without throwing an interception breaking his record of 199 that he set in 2020.

Antonio Brown’s first catch of the day made him the fastest player in NFL history to reach the 900-reception mark surpassing Marvin Harrison for the record. He went on to have a monster day of his own catching seven passes for 124 yards and two touchdowns.

With his second touchdown of the day Brown tied Reggie Wayne Anquan Boldin and Jimmy Graham for the 25th-most in NFL history.

Mike Evans had himself a massive day as well bringing in six passes for 114 yards and two scores of his own.

Leonard Fournette continued to be a key cog in Tampa Bay’s offense this week rushing for 67 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries while catching four passes for 43 yards to put him over 100 total yards for the second straight week.

Shaquil Barrett was the star of the day for Tampa Bay’s defense picking up 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble.

In his return to action Jamel Dean came up with his fourth career interception and his first of the 2021 season.

The Bucs dominated the Dolphins in total plays (72-51) total yards (558-301) first downs (33-17) and time of possession (37:07-22:53).

Tampa Bay was flagged six times for 47 yards in the game while Miami was penalized five times for 37 yards.

Miami Dolphins third-year defensive lineman Christian Wilkins will go up against Tom Brady at 1 p.m. ET Sunday when the Dolphins face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

“Watching the tape you see why many consider Tom Brady to be the GOAT” Wilkins said to the media this week. “So there’s so many things he does throughout the course of the game that are different than what a lot of people do. But we’re excited for the challenge.”

Wilkins added that the matchup with Brady is one “you tell your grandkids about” then cracked a joke about the seemingly ageless future Hall of Famer.

“This is a game you tell your grandkids about – not necessarily the game but playing someone of Tom Brady’s stature and things like that. Well shoot at this rate he might play my grandkids” Wilkins said with a smile.

“So he’s definitely a special talent and we’re excited for the matchup.”

Wilkins has a lot of respect for the 44-year-old Brady and doesn’t think there’s been a noticeable decline in the performance of the 14-time Pro Bowler and seven-time Super Bowl champion.

“People have been saying he’s slowing down for five years” said Wilkins a first-round pick of the Dolphins in the 2019 NFL Draft. “But I don’t really see it much. He just keeps winning and keeps doing great things. He continues to be the player he’s always been.”

Several years ago Charlie Moore founder of AHFP began working to spread awareness of Old Time music a genre that predates country rock and other more modern music. At today's show ""there's going to be three different performances there. The headliner is going to be Roy Book Binder"" Moore said.

Binder is a professional touring musician who has worked with both BB King and Ray Charles Moore said noting his coming to town is due to COVID-19.

""He's a touring professional he's won various awards for Blues and for Old Time traditional guitar and he had a gig ... he had a performance scheduled for (today) in St. Louis"" Moore said.

""The St. Louis venue canceled because of the COVID scare. It was an indoor event and he has a student that lives here in Hot Springs and he called him and asked if he could come down and do some kind of little performance"" he said.

""He called me and asked if we could do a house concert or something and I said 'Well let's do better than that'"" Moore said ""St. Louis' loss is our gain. He's quite a performer and a storyteller and he really is an entertainer.""

Binder's student is local musician Ken Tillery who will also perform along with a group Moore plays in the Arkansas Highlands Stringband.

Moore with his bandmates Tom Sartain Jenny Sartain and Judy Warner will open the show at 3 p.m. Binder will have two performances at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and Tillery will close the show at 6 p.m.

The concert has three sponsors: 420 Eats Food Truck Court at 420 Malvern the Garland County Library and Beckie Comstock of Raymond James Financial Services Moore said.

This will be the fourth time the Stringband has performed live since they formed earlier this year. They previously performed at Crystal Ridge Distillery in April and at the Arkansas Heritage Festival in Hot Springs Village in August and Timberfest in Sheridan earlier this month.

""It's a fun thing to do and we've had very good response from our audiences"" Moore said.

Asked if the band has any upcoming performances planned Moore said ""We don't we're probably going to take a break through the end of the year then decide what to do next.""

He said they have no ""definite schedule yet"" but will continue with their goal of promoting the Old Time traditions.

In addition to concerts the Folk Project has also spent the past few years trying to educate the public about the music.

Moore said he has partnered with the Garland County Library to hold several virtual presentations with Paul Kagebein the library's adult services programmer noting they are working on holding another one of these programs.

""I just returned from a trip through Kentucky and West Virginia and North Carolina and Virginia and Tennessee visiting with Old Time musicians and it was a real treat visiting with the real deal in the mountains of those particular states"" Moore said.

""And I did get some good interview recordings of a few of those and Paul and I are working on preparing a program for the library that will showcase some of the folks that I got to talk to on that trip"" he said."

Believe it or not there are still people waiting for RTX 3080 orders fulfillment after ordering one right after they came out… in September 2020. One of such clients has requested a bakery to make a special cake for this occasion a cake that would be sent to the company where the card was ordered.

The bakery has shared the news on social media describing the unusual request for a special cake which said ‘One Year Together’ with the order number. The client contacted the bakery afterward with the good news that the cake was so tasty that the retailer finally found the missing card and fulfilled the outstanding order.

Neither the customers nor the retailer’s names were shared by the bakery but we believe it was Polish X-kom which has a matching postal code from the original cake order. This company had appeared on our site before where almost the exact opposite situation has been described. The retailer had canceled a 10-month order for a different client.

Far Cry 6 is the latest entry in Ubisoft's open world first person shooter franchise and like past games in the series it's a stunning-looking game especially on PC.

Of course that means that we couldn't wait to fire it up on our 8K test rig and see just how good it looks – and how well it performs – at 7680 × 4320. For these tests. we're using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 currently the most powerful consumer graphics card in the world.

We've been doing these 8K tests for a while now and we've seen an exciting increase in visually-impressive games managing to hit that magic 60 frames per second such as Cyberpunk 2077 and even Red Dead Redemption 2 thanks to a recent patch.

This is thanks to Nvidia's DLSS technology which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to upscale games running at lower resolutions so that they appear to be running at higher resolutions with minimal impact to image quality.

It's impressive stuff and it's allowed games that support DLSS to hit 8K at playable frame rates on compatible hardware while games that don't support it barely run at such high resolutions.

No DLSS here

What's interesting is that Far Cry 6 doesn't support Nvidia DLSS. Instead it comes with AMD's similar FidelityFX technology.

While it doesn't use AI or machine learning like DLSS AMD FidelityFX also takes games running at lower resolutions and cleverly upscales them so they appear to be running at higher resolutions and there's a similar uptick in performance as well.

In our tests it allowed us to play the visually-demanding Far Cry 6 at 8K and at 60 frames per second (fps) which is very impressive indeed. Best of all unlike DLSS which is exclusive to Nvidia's RTX range of graphics cards AMD FidelityFX can run on AMD or Nvidia GPUs which is why our 8K rig with the RTX 3090 could benefit from it.

Far Cry 6 8K performance

To begin with we set the Far Cry 6 resolution to 8K but put all the settings on 'Low'. According to the game this takes up 8.57GB of VRAM – less than half of the 24GB available on the RTX 3090.

We kept AMD FidelityFX off and in our tests we hit 33fps on average. That's not bad as we consider 30fps as the minimum for an acceptable playing experience.

However despite it being 8K the game looked pretty basic with the 'Low' settings and there was quite a bit of pop-in especially around the grass.

So we upped the graphics settings to 'Medium' which requires 9.77GB of VRAM and our machine averaged 30fps. It looked better but still not good enough and that 30fps frame rate isn't that impressive when you've paid $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030) for the RTX 3090 on its own.

So we decided to put the pressure on a bit more and turned the graphics settings on 'High'. This requires 10.28GB of VRAM so even the mighty RTX 3080 wouldn't be able to handle it.

That being said it doesn't seem like the RTX 3090 can either as we ran the game to benchmark it... and it promptly crashed.

AMD FidelityFX to the rescue

We tried it a few more times and Far Cry 6 just wouldn't load up. So we finally relented and turned AMD FidelityFX on with the setting on 'Ultra Quality'. This setting means that the impact to visuals should be minimal but also the performance gains won't be as high.

The good news however was that it allowed the game to load and it hit a very respectable 41fps.

It also looked a lot better with 'High' settings and AMD FidelityFX on than at 'Medium' settings with AMD FidelityFX off - and it performed better. That's certainly a win in our books.

Next we turned HD Textures to 'on'. This is an optional download that adds higher resolution textures to the game. This bumped up the VRAM use to 11.3GB but in our tests it didn't impact performance hitting 41fps again. The impact to how the game looked however was definitely noticeable.

Next we changed AMD FidelityFX's setting from 'Ultra Quality' to 'Balanced'. As the name suggests this means AMD FidelityFX tries to strike a balance between performance and image quality so it runs the game at a lower native resolution but it should hopefully still look pretty good at 8K.

It certainly did the trick as our test PC hit 62fps on average passing that golden 60fps milestone. The game looked fantastic as well though there is a noticeable shimmering around some moving objects. It's a small thing and not immersion-breaking but it's an example of the compromises you have to make when using an implementation like AMD FidelityFX or DLSS (we saw something similar with Red Dead Redemption 2) rather than running the game at a native resolution.

We upped the graphics settings to 'Ultra' and put AMD FidelityFX back to 'Ultra Quality' and the VRAM usage was 11.80GB. Performance took an expected drop to 35fps. Not awful but by turning AMD FidelityFX to 'Balanced' we got it up to a respectable 55fps.

Finally we turned on DXR Reflections and DXR Shadows which uses ray tracing for more realistic effects. These are demanding settings and it cut our frame rate to 45fps which upping VRAM usage to 12.4GB - meaning only the most powerful and expensive GPUs could run this. With a bit of tweaking we'd be able to get a nice mix of graphical effects and hit 60fps at 8K with Far Cry 6. Very impressive indeed.

However just to see how demanding 8K was we kept those settings but dropped the resolution down to 4K. This saw our framerate leap to 73fps and there was little if any noticeable difference in image quality.

This is because while you can play Far Cry 6 at 8K Ubisoft has understandably concentrated on 4K performance as 8K-capable hardware is still so niche. That means textures and effects have been made for 4K displays so increasing the resolution to 8K doesn't change a whole lot - especially considering the performance impact it brings.

A great showing for both Far Cry 6 and AMD FidelityFX

Overall these results are a real testament to the Far Cry 6 developers and art team who have created a gorgeous world that looks fantastic and runs well on the hardware we tested it on.

Of course the Nvidia RTX 3090 should also take a bow. It's one of the only GPUs that could even dream of running Far Cry 6 at 8K resolution and the fact that it manages to proves that it remains your best means of playing games at 8K.

AMD FidelityFX has also proved to be an excellent tool for getting games to run at higher resolutions and effects without hitting performance too much. It enabled us to breeze past that 60fps milestone at 8K on an incredibly good looking game and the results were on the whole very good.

The fact that it runs on both AMD and Nvidia hardware (as well as older GPUs) is commendable so we have to give AMD props for going that route.

And while gaming at 8K still isn't quite worth it this all bodes well for how AMD FidelityFX can help people with older less powerful graphics cards run modern games like Far Cry 6 in almost all their glory. With GPUs still hard to get this is the real revolution we need.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXZzLWFtZC1yYXktdHJhY2luZy1zdXBwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia vs. AMD: Which GPUs Support Ray Tracing?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXZzLWFtZC1yYXktdHJhY2luZy1zdXBwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9mYXItY3J5LTYvYmVzdC1zZXR0aW5ncy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1iZW5jaG1hcmtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best Far Cry 6 settings for performance on PC,"While our Far Cry 6 review finds the game far from revolutionary it’s distinctly Far Cry for better or worse. This means a lush open world to wander plenty of enemies to bring to an untimely end and makeshift gadgets that guarantee your gaming monitor will almost always be lit up with gunfire. With so much happening on screen it’s time to head into Far Cry 6’s settings to make sure you don’t put too much stress on your system and instead squeeze every last frame out of your gaming PC.

Far Cry 6 doesn’t mess with its well-established formula but it does up the ante with new features under the hood. It’s the first in the series to officially include ray tracing – at least on PC sorry console folks – and also packs AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology to lower the performance overhead.

It’s not quite as well-optimised at launch as we’d hoped however with some CPU threading issues and an astonishingly high 11GB VRAM asking price for the HD texture pack. Don’t lose hope though as there are a few key settings to look out for that can help improve performance.

Far Cry 6 asks for a little more than previous entries but Ubisoft outlines exactly what your rig needs to attain your preferred resolution and frame rate. So before we get into what you can do to boost fps here’s a reminder of the Far Cry 6 system requirements:

Far Cry 6 presets

Sticking with conventional names Far Cry 6 lets you choose between four graphics presets including Low Medium High and Ultra.

Much the same as New World’s settings all options follow suit when you select a preset rather than giving you an intuitive mix of lows mediums and highs. Simply put if you choose to stick with the Medium preset water shadows and all other graphics will also be on medium and it’ll be down to you to fine tune this to your liking. More on this later.

Choosing the right preset will entirely depend on what your gaming PC is capable of but we recommend starting with High at your preferred resolution and then scaling your settings accordingly. This presents the Cuban-inspired land of Yara in all its glory with beautiful greenery and detailed textures without taking up too many resources as it nets a 16% performance increase compared to Ultra.

Alongside the biggest frame tax Ultra is also one of the most inconsistent presets with a larger gap between the minimum and maximum frame rates. This means you’re more likely to see frame drops occur especially during the intense explosive moments that are fairly frequent throughout the world.

Opting for Medium provides another 10% increase compared to High while Low boosts performance 22% compared to our preferred preset. The latter muddies the detail too much for our liking and we wouldn’t consider it worth the trade-off. However it could be useful if dropping to a double digit frame rate is a deal breaker or you’re skirting below the minimum.

Best Far Cry 6 settings

Far Cry 6 has a fair few options to navigate but you can find these under Video across the Quality and Advanced Settings tabs:

Texture filtering : ultra

: ultra Shadows : medium

: medium Geometry and vegetation : medium

: medium Environment : ultra

: ultra Water : high

: high Terrain : medium

: medium Volumetric fog : ultra

: ultra HD textures : optional

: optional Anti-aliasing : TAA

: TAA DXR reflections : off

: off DXR shadows : off

: off FidelityFX CAS : on

: on FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 : on

: on FSR Mode: ultra quality

We determined the best Far Cry 6 settings using the built-in benchmark tool which isn’t quite as demanding as the game itself but it gives a good baseline of what to juggle. As a result we ended up with a healthy blend of mediums highs and ultras that strike a balance between fidelity and frame rate. If you want to tweak things further however these are the settings that affect your performance the most:

Geometry and vegetation seems to have the biggest impact on your game because it’s behind much of the greenery – and facing facts there are a lot of trees and leaves in Far Cry 6. We suggest setting it to medium because you’ll see a double digit frame loss if you push it up but the benefits might be worth the toll if your hardware can afford it.

Terrain is responsible for much of the world’s detail but it’s also the next setting you should probably adjust. It does a good job of adding depth to the game’s finer features like dirt and blades of grass but weighing up the price for performance it’s worth the extra 4-5% going from ultra to medium.

Shadows only saves you an average of 3% performance on medium compared to ultra. But when you consider that everything stacks up and it isn’t a big loss if shadows aren’t quite as sharp as they otherwise would be it’s a no-brainer taking the hit here.

Water naturally surrounds the island and you’ll see a lot of it throughout your journey. If you turn this down to low it loses the natural ripples and tides which leaves the world feeling increasingly lifeless. Much like shadows switching to medium adds another 3% you can benefit from without too much of a sacrifice.

Texture filtering volumetric fog and environment settings all give negligible performance increases when lowered from ultra but tank the visuals in the process. If you’re keen to churn as many frames out of your system as possible switching environment to medium is your best bet for just over a 2% jump but we’d recommend keeping all on high or ultra.

HD textures are an optional 35GB package you can download on top of the 60GB base game. It’s difficult to recommend with a sky-high 11GB VRAM requirement that even Nvidia’s flagship RTX 3080 doesn’t quite meet but it’s worth a shot to see how it runs on your gaming PC. Just stick to 1080p or 1440p as textures sometimes fail to load in 4K resolution in the current patch. This is something Ubisoft might hotfix later down the line.

DXR reflections and DXR shadows make their first ever appearance in the Far Cry series here but to little fanfare. For the former Ubisoft opts for hybrid reflections which combines screen space reflections with ray tracing and surfaces aren’t always as sleek as a result. The latter doesn’t really do much to improve on the default shadow mapping either.

Sadly even though these techniques set the barrier to entry a bit lower than the full shebang the performance hit you take is a bit too much for us but you should try for yourself to see if it ticks the right boxes for you.

FidelityFX CAS and FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 are absolutely worth switching on regardless of what graphics card you run as they work on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs. CAS stands for contrast adaptive sharpening and aids your anti-aliasing by cleaning up blurry and shimmering outlines. FSR does a similar job to Nvidia DLSS in that it renders Far Cry 6 at a lower resolution before upscaling it to your chosen native resolution. While it works at 1080p you’ll benefit most at 1440p and 4K resolution where it can be considered free performance since it doesn’t seem to have artifacts and distortions that often come with upscaling. And if you need to pump out any more performance you can swap ultra quality out for balanced – just be prepared for a small visual downgrade if you do.

If you have any trouble with frames then your first port of call is to make sure V-Sync is switched off and you instead rely on an AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync display if you own one. V-Sync can be helpful to prevent screen tearing if you have no other option but is often the source of many other issues including stuttering. You can also lock your frame rate if it’s proving problematic which is off by default. And lastly adaptive resolution makes an appearance which you can set so that your resolution automatically adjusts if your frame rate dips below a certain marker. This is a bit of a nuclear option as textures end up suffering but having the option at your disposal is never bad.

Far Cry 6 accessibility settings

Far Cry 6 puts accessibility front and centre allowing you to activate menu narration immediately after the James Bond-like introduction. You can toggle this on and off by pressing L on your gaming keyboard. This is followed by several accessibility presets that give you context as to how they help you play the game but are initially a little vague in what settings they alter. You get more granular control of these when you reach the main menu and dive into the options of your own accord. These are:

Vision preset : automatically enables menu narration increases the scale of UI and fonts turns on enemy outlines pickup outlines large subtitles bold reticles aim assist for PC controllers and gets rid of reticle sway and most camera shakes.

: intended to combat motion sickness this turns off reticle sway motion blur poisoned and drunk effects and minimises camera shakes. Colourblind mode: automatically switches the colours of enemy outlines lasers reticles subtitles and more – all of which you can adjust manually if you choose.

You can also alter most elements of the HUD to declutter your screen or provide as much information as you need to make your experience the best it can be. For a more in-depth breakdown read our Far Cry 6 accessibility settings review.

Far Cry 6 issues

Far Cry 6 isn’t a perfect release with a few launch issues to watch out for.

Running the HD texture pack at 4K resolution is strangely problematic even on some graphics cards that meet the steep 11GB video memory requirement. It can result in textures not loading or a mixture of high definition and low definition textures that’s a little jarring. The best solution to this is to avoid 4K resolution and stick with 1440p or switch the pack off in the options menu.

Far Cry 6 has a CPU bottleneck that can hinder your performance. Fortunately there are two workarounds you can consider. Switching HyperThreading off in your BIOS can add another 10fps onto your frame counter and if you’re running the game through Ubisoft’s platform disabling Ubisoft Connect’s overlay goes a long way to increasing fps too.

There are plenty of people complaining about crashes on PC which is something we experienced several times during testing. We were particularly affected when tinkering with ultra settings despite running an Nvidia RTX 3080 and Intel Core 10850K on our test bench but there’s little rhyme or reason we can see just yet. Ubisoft Support suggests Windows 11 is partially responsible for hiccups for those running the new operating system but we didn’t fare much better on Windows 10 with this particular issue.

Co-op is a problem for some who are continually served an error message that the ‘Far Cry service is not available’. It’s not clear whether this affects Ubisoft Connect players exclusively or those that own the game on the Epic Games Store but we should have a clearer idea soon.

Alongside the settings that are tied to frame rate and accessibility Far Cry 6 goes above and beyond to give you more options than ever. On top of the default 16:9 aspect ratio the game lets you adjust the HUD for 21:9 ultrawide displays so elements aren’t locked to the centre of your screen. Perhaps even better the ‘fit to monitor’ option lets you keep your HUD on your main screen while extending your peripheral vision to a second one – it looks a little wonky compared to one monitor either side of your primary but you can use your full setup how you choose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0RlbGwtUHJlY2lzaW9uLTU1NTAtdnMtUHJlY2lzaW9uLTU1NjAtV2hhdC1zLXRoZS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLjU3MTEyNy4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell Precision 5550 vs. Precision 5560: What's the difference? - NotebookCheck.net News,"If the Precision 5560 looks familiar then that's because it is essentially the same mobile workstation as the Precision 5550. It's the GPU and PCIe4 storage options available that set the two apart.

4 Reviews

The jump from the Precision 5540 to the Precision 5550 was significant because the latter would adopt the new XPS 15 9500 design over the older XPS 15 9570. Moving up from the Precision 5550 to the Precision 5560 is relatively more minor from a visual perspective but the internal updates shouldn't be ignored.

The Precision 5560 utilizes newer Nvidia Ampere Quadro GPUs to succeed last year's Turing GPUs for a raw graphics boost of 40 to 50 percent to be the single biggest update from the Precision 5550. Power envelope is just slightly higher in comparison for overall higher performance-per-watt.

Storage has also been upgraded to support PCIe4 NVMe SSDs instead of only PCIe3. Transfer rates can now reach over 7000 MB/s instead of just 3400 MB/s as shown by our loop test results below.

Power consumption appears to be higher on the Precision 5560 when running lower loads like web browsing. Consequently battery life is shorter by two to three hours on the newer model when compared to the older one based on our real-world WLAN tests at 150 nit brightness.

The fan noise ceiling may have been lowered on the Precision 5560 when compared to the 5550 in our experience (50 dB(A) vs. 40 dB(A)). The newer model can therefore be quieter when running extreme loads like Prime95 albeit at the cost of higher core temperatures by up to 15 C from our observations.

Other than the GPU and SSD upgrades however everything else remains the same. Very few people will likely benefit from the more marginal boosts to CPU power and Thunderbolt 4 support over Thunderbolt 3. It's too bad that Dell didn't upgrade the substandard 720p webcam to 1080p or integrate a privacy shutter.

During FY21 the World Bank approved 7 new disaster risk management (DRM) projects for Sub-Saharan Africa resulting in an additional $1.2 billion in support for 6 countries (the Democratic Republic of Congo Rwanda Kenya Mozambique Senegal and South Sudan). In that same fiscal year GFDRR provided a total of $6.6 million in financing for DRM efforts in the region across four priority areas: 1) risk-informed decision making 2) reducing risk and mainstreaming DRM 3) financial preparedness to manage disaster and climate shocks and 4) disaster preparedness and resilient recovery. This intensified engagement has resulted in comprehensive disaster risk reduction interventions that will contribute to resiliencebuilding including in the context of COVID-19.

Below are a few project highlights from World Bank and GFDRR DRM engagements in Africa in FY21.

Democratic Republic of Congo

An investment of $500 million for the Kinshasa Multisector Development and Urban Resilience Project has been approved by the World Bank. This project aims to finance institutional capacity strengthening for urban management access to infrastructure and services and socio-economic opportunities in Kinshasa. Intending cross-sectoral resilience interventions more than 70 percent of the investment will address citywide basic services needs and neighborhood upgrading activities in targeted communities.

Senegal

Projects in Senegal are helping strengthen local capacity build essential infrastructure and expand access to services like storm drainage and solid waste management. For example under the first phase of the World Bank’s Stormwater Management and Climate Change Adaptation Project – PROGEP physical investments in Pikine and Guédiawaye such as the construction of nearly 30 kilometers of primary canals over 20 kilometers of secondary canals and 150000 square meters of drained paving roads reduced flood exposure by allowing both rain and ground water to be drained permanently throughout the year. The World Bank recently approved a second phase of the Stormwater Management and Climate Change Adaptation Project - PROGEP valued at $155 million. The rapid preparation of this project in less than 6 months was possible due to the successful implementation of the first phase.

Mozambique

In Mozambique comprehensive urban resilience interventions have strengthened the country’s institutional physical and social resilience. FY21 saw the approval of two new projects: the Maputo Urban Transformation Project and the Northern Crisis Recovery Project (NCRP) representing a combined total investment of $200 million. Both efforts build on the achievements of the recently completed Mozambique Cities and Climate Change Project which paid dividends in bolstering the country’s response to the flooding impacts of Tropical Storm Chalane as well as cyclones Eloise Idai and Kenneth. In Beira alone the project improved the lives of over 230000 people by rehabilitating stormwater drainage canals and flood control systems in part through the use of nature-based solutions.

Somalia

Under the second phase of the Somalia Urban Resilience Project (SURP) a World Bank technical team is conducting an urban flood risk assessment for Kismayo the country’s third largest city which will inform the preparation of a city-level storm water drainage plan and enhance flood-resilient urban development. The second phase of SURP will also enable a scale-up in resilient infrastructure investments in cities where the first phase was operational including Mogadishu Garowe Kismayo and Baidoa while laying the groundwork for expansion to cities in the States of Galmudug and Hirshabelle.

Meanwhile less than 12 months into implementation the $137.5 million Somalia Crisis Recovery Project (SCRP) has already provided livelihood support to around 7000 households through its locust control component. The project has been designed to be responsive to multiple crises including flooding locust infestations the COVID-19 pandemic and drought. For example the project is providing support to the health sector to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through prevention and treatment activities nationally.

Tanzania

The $150.0 million Boosting Inclusive Growth for Zanzibar – Integrated Development Project (BIG-Z) was approved by the World Bank on June 10 2021. It is expected that the project will directly benefit 220000 residents and indirectly benefit the whole island. The project applies an integrated area-based approach to ensure that investments are concentrated in high priority areas for maximum outcome. The project will straddle four core areas: resilience mobility tourism and cultural heritage preservation and governance.

Regional

Supported by the World Bank and GFDRR the City Coastal Resilience Africa (CityCORE) initiative was completed in FY21 leaving behind a record of achievement in fostering policy dialogue and investments for urban resilience in coastal cities. Activities supported by the initiative included flood risk assessment and mapping the development of investment strategies for urban resilience community engagements around flood risk reduction and risk identification and awareness. Building on the achievements of CityCORE a World Bank technical team in partnership with the City Resilience Program (CRP) is leading the development of a tool that will allow Bank teams to rapidly identify investment needs in flood-prone areas. CRP is a partnership between the World Bank and GFDRR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb3YucGwvd2ViL2x1eGVtYm91cmcvdGhlLWp1ZGdlbWVudC1vZi10aGUtY29uc3RpdHV0aW9uYWwtdHJpYnVuYWwtb2YtdGhlLXJlcHVibGljLW9mLXBvbGFuZC1vZi03LW9jdG9iZXItcmVhZmZpcm1lZC10aGUtaGllcmFyY2h5LW9mLXRoZS1zb3VyY2VzLW9mLWxhdy1iaW5kaW5nLWluLXBvbGFuZC1hbmQtaW4tdGhlLWV1cm9wZWFuLXVuaW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The judgement of the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland of 7 October reaffirmed the hierarchy of the ...,"This principle does not raise any doubts in the case law of the courts and constitutional courts of many EU member states. These courts have repeatedly held that certain acts of the EU institutions in particular of the Court of Justice of the EU may be considered ultra vires i.e. to exceed the powers granted to these institutions by the treaties. Such rulings were made inter alia in France Denmark Italy the Czech Republic Spain or Romania. The strongest line of jurisprudence in this respect has been established since the 1970s by the German Federal Constitutional Court.

The Polish Constitutional Tribunal has also issued similar rulings in the past – while being composed of judges elected by the Polish Parliament in all political configurations since Poland's accession to the EU. In 2005 Constitutional Tribunal presided over by Judge Marek Safjan established the principle that ""the Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Poland in relation to all international agreements binding it including agreements on the transfer of competence in certain matters. The Constitution enjoys the primacy of validity and application within the territory of Poland"" (judgment of 11 May 2005 case K 18/04). This principle was reaffirmed in subsequent judgements of the Constitutional Tribunal i.a. in the ruling of 19 December 2006 (P 37/05) declaring that ""the Constitutional Tribunal is obliged to understand its position in such a way that it retains the position of »court of last resort« with respect to the Polish Constitution"" as well as in the judgment of 24 November 2010 (K 32/09) stating that ""the transfer of competencies to the EU may not infringe the principle of supremacy of the Constitution and may not violate any provisions of the Constitution"".

The judgment of 7 October confirms this long-standing line of jurisprudence. The Constitutional Tribunal did not question the provisions of the Treaty on European Union per se. Nevertheless it pointed out that their interpretation leading to a factual supremacy of the norms of international law over the national law of constitutional rank would be incompatible with the hierarchy of the sources of law established in the Polish Constitution. Interpretation of the EU law resulting from the recent jurisprudence of the CJEU and challenged by the Constitutional Tribunal would lead to a situation where Polish judges would be forced (by the EU law i.e. a legal norm of a lower rank) to disregard the provisions of the Polish Constitution (a legal norm of a higher rank).

Moreover such an interpretation would establish a lower standard of judicial protection for Polish citizens than they are entitled to under the Constitution. In accordance with the Constitution judges appointed by the President of the Republic of Poland are irremovable independent and within the exercise of their office they are subject only to the Constitution and statutes. The interpretation of EU law questioned by the Constitutional Tribunal was intended to undermine this principle allowing the validity of judicial sentences to be questioned and in fact depriving judges of their judicial power. As a consequence it would also deprive the citizens of legal certainty and trust in the judiciary. Accepting this interpretation would therefore lower the standard of legal protection below the level guaranteed in the Polish Constitution. Hence it could not be recognized by the Constitutional Tribunal as compliant with the Polish Constitution.

Republic of Poland respects the binding international law pursuant to art. 9 of the Constitution. All obligations arising from both primary and secondary European Union law remain in force and thus will be continue to be fully respected by Poland. The provisions of the Treaty of the European Union indicated in the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of 7 October remain in force. What cannot be accepted are only the forms of their interpretation or application that violate the Constitution of the Republic of Poland.",,,,,,

An offer for Jets fans For the best local North Jersey news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to NorthJersey.com. $1 for 6 months

“We gotta start faster” Saleh said Sunday after the game. “I’m putting that on me to try to figure this out over the next week.”

The Jets have tallied just 13 points in the first half this season compared to 51 second-half points. It’s a major reason why they’re 1-4 too. New York has lost two of its four games by a touchdown (Week 1 vs. the Panthers and Week 5 vs. the Falcons) and needed a fourth-quarter comeback to beat the Titans in Week 4.

Gang Green’s early struggles are in a league of their own. They’re the first team since the 2015 49ers to score seven or fewer points in the first half of the first five games of their season. The 2007 Bengals accomplished this feat as well.

Zach Wilson is one of the biggest reasons for the Jets’ failure to launch. He’s completed 30-63 passing attempts for 330 yards no touchdowns and six interceptions in the first half. In the second half Wilson’s gone 64-101 for 740 yards four touchdowns and three interceptions. While he orchestrated the Jets’ two second-half scoring drives he did not throw a single touchdown.

“We gotta figure it out over this bye week how to fix that” Wilson said postgame. I gotta play better at the start as well.”

Wilson refused to blame it on preparation talent or coaching either. The Jets’ second-half stats reflect the talent and coaching concerns for sure but Wilson wants the Jets to shake the comeback mentality and focus on playing better for an entire 60 minute-game.

“It’s interesting in the second half every single game we’ve looked really good” he added. “We know what we’re capable of and we’re able to show it there at the end but I think we just got to get a good rhythm going some flow – something. Starting three-and-out isn’t the way to do it.”

The Jets will have a long flight home and a week off to fix their issues but it may not be as simple as Saleh and Wilson hope. It’s likely not one problem that requires a resolution like preparation or execution or game scripts. A combination of everything needs to be reworked if the Jets are to succeed early in games.

Whatever the Jets do though they need to solve their first-half woes to be competitive this season.

“We can’t keep trying to come from behind” Wilson said. “The NFL is too hard to always come from behind.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2h1ZC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL3ZhcnNpdHktaW5zaWRlci8yMDIxLzEwLzA5L2Zvb3RiYWxsLWRvYmJzLWZlcnJ5LXN1cmdlcy1wYXN0LXR1Y2thaG9lLTM0LTIwLXdpbi82MDI2MzAwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Football: Dobbs Ferry surges past Tuckahoe in 34-20 win,"TUCKAHOE - In a game that featured two teams with perfect records Dobbs Ferry was upset that its first half performance didn't meet the Eagles' near-perfect standards.

""We definitely needed to turn it up"" Dobbs Ferry senior Jabari Marsland said. ""Coach said 'They want it more than us.' We took that to heart and we had to show that we wanted it more and try to win this game.""

After a closely contested first half where Dobbs Ferry entered the break trailing by one point the Eagles stormed ahead and took control of the remainder of the game to defeat Tuckahoe 34-20.

""We took a big punch to the gut late in the first half and we had to deal with some adversity"" Dobbs Ferry coach Joe Cox said. ""We just kind of challenged them to see how we were going to respond and whatnot. I just thought they came out ready to go and it really was a monster third quarter for us. Details got taken care of and I'm just really proud of the way they responded.""

Tuckahoe quarterback Michael Annunziata scrambled for a 61-yard gain to give the Tigers' a first-and-goal with under a minute to go in the second quarter. Three plays later he found John Benke on a four-yard touchdown pass to give the Tigers a 13-12 halftime lead.

The Eagles responded well in second half scoring 22 unanswered points to take a 34-13 lead. Brian Dann topped off the scoring surge with a 12-yard touchdown with 8:50 left in the fourth quarter.

""They were a very good high school football team"" Tuckahoe coach John D'Arco Jr. said of the Eagles. ""I was happy that we were able to rock and roll with them. First half was great but I think they just wore us out in the second half. ... We had chances to capitalize some other times and it just didn't work out. They just controlled the second half.""

Tuckahoe didn't go away quietly and put together one last scoring drive in the fourth quarter. The Tigers will look to regroup after their first loss of the year.

""Big picture-wise this will hopefully help us to play deep into November"" D'Arco said. ""We haven't been undefeated here since 1974. We made it to the Carrier Dome four times and every time we haven't lost. That's still our goal to get there at the end of the season. A game like this is going to help us achieve that goal hopefully win a sectional title and then go on after that.""

For Dobbs Ferry it remains undefeated and with a win over Tuckahoe who previously defeated Class C contender Valhalla it offers some validation for the Eagles but they're trying to remain focused.

""Winning the first five is nice but come Monday morning it'll be about getting back to work and putting a new game plan in"" Cox said. ""5-0 won't matter come next week it'll just be about next Saturday afternoon.""

Turning point

Midway through the third quarter the Tigers were able to sack the Eagles forcing them to punt on fourth down. Tuckahoe muffed the punt and Dobbs Ferry was able to recover the ball deep into Tiger territory. The Eagles scored three plays later to take a 27-13 lead with 1:12 remaining in the third.

Player of the game

Javonni Williams Dobbs Ferry: The Eagles' quarterback mustered two crucial rushing touchdowns on third down. He also had 117 passing yards including a 45-yard touchdown pass in the closing minutes of the first half.

""In practice every week he just gets better and better"" Cox said of Williams. ""He showcased a little more tonight than he had. We let him a little looser tonight and he ran the ball pretty well and took those couple scores in that was a big deal for us.""

By the numbers

Dobbs Ferry (5-0) — Brian Dann had 25 carries for 150 yards and a touchdown. Jabari Marsland had 68 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. Jhonatan Almaras caught the 45-yard touchdown pass.

Tuckahoe (4-1) — Michael Annunziata completed 10 of 17 passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns. The Tuckahoe quarterback also rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. John Benke caught both touchdown passes and finished with eight receptions and 81 yards.

Quotable

""Love the way these guys have come together"" Cox said of his team. ""There's freshmen seniors and everybody in between but it's becoming a tight-knit group. I'm proud of them for coming in and coming together the way they have.""

Up next

Both teams return to action on Saturday Oct. 16. Dobbs Ferry will travel to Croton-Harmon for a 1:30 p.m. game. Tuckahoe will stay at home to host Rye Neck at 2:30 p.m.

I really did.

But four days into my first sailing on Scarlet Lady the hot new cruise ship for adults from start-up line Virgin Voyages I am finding that I am not hating it all. In fact I'm sort of loving it.

It turns out that this flashy new brand which initially filled its marketing messages with so many images of the young and the hip that some people thought it was just for millennials might be the perfect cruise line for someone like me: A somewhat balding 52-year-old father of three who is starting to look back wistfully at the fun of his younger more carefree days.

I'm not sure what that says about Virgin Voyages' prospects. It may not be what they want to hear. If too many people like me start booking Scarlet Lady the line's chances of drawing twentysomethings and thirtysomethings may be lost forever.

But maybe this is all part of the plan. People my age do have more money to spend than the youngsters.

The allure of Scarlet Lady

Designed as a no-kids zone Scarlet Lady is filled with stylish adult-oriented nightspots and bars promising a hopping scene late into the night as well as such hipster venues as a tattoo parlor and a colorful karaoke lounge. There's onboard entertainment that is innovative and sometimes edgy in a way that you don't normally see on cruise ships. There's staff that are there in part to encourage you to let loose a little -- or a lot.

In short it feels like the sort of cruise ship that young people would want to sail on even if in the end it doesn't draw as many young people as some might have expected (early word is the average booker is in her or his 50s). And that may be what makes it the perfect ship for somewhat older people like me who miss the wilder and crazier days of their youth.

If we can't be young again at least we can pretend for a few days right?

I expected to hate Scarlet Lady in part because of the way it was initially marketed as a place for the young and the hip and the beautiful. That clearly isn't me.

I also was put off a bit by Virgin Voyages' ""we know better"" attitude toward cruising. It has been a cruise company that has talked itself up at times in the lead-up to Scarlet Lady's launch by pooh-poohing the things that other cruise companies do. This seemed suspect to me given how incredibly successful these other cruise companies have been.

RELATED: Why you've got it all wrong if you think Scarlet Lady is just for millennials

Could Virgin Voyages and its backers at Richard Branson's Virgin Group really know better?

Now that I have been on board Scarlet Lady for a few days I am starting to think that maybe in a few areas at least they do.

Here some of my first impressions of the vessel which is on its maiden voyage out of Miami (I will post more of my initial thoughts on the experience in the coming days):

It's a ship for adults like no other

It's taken me a few days to fully appreciate what a difference it makes that this is an adults-only cruise vessel -- one where nobody under the age of 18 is allowed on board.

The fact that there are no kids on board means Virgin Voyages can offer a far more adult array of entertainment from one end of Scarlet Lady to the other than you'll find on the ships of Royal Caribbean Norwegian Cruise Line and other big cruise brands even during the daytime and even in public areas such as around the pool. The line even can be a little naughty.

A couple of days ago during an impromptu wedding event at the base of the swirling staircase in the center of the ship an emcee loudly quizzed one of the two women getting married about their favorite sexual positions much to the delight of the crowd of passengers looking on. You probably wouldn't see that on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas.

Naughty sex talk also was the theme of a one-woman cabaret show called Never Sleep Alone that took place last night in the ship's The Manor nightclub (transformed into a cabaret lounge). Raunchy and heavy on audience participation it involved ""resident sexologist"" Alex Schiller who claimed to have slept with more than 4000 people offering up tips on how to make sure you're never lacking for a partner in bed at night.

In a playful hint at what we were supposed to do with the information there were condoms on every table in the room for us to take away. And just to sexy it up a little more Schiller (who some may know from her sex-focused podcast also called Never Sleep Alone) stripped down to her bustier and stockings at the end of the show.

The kicker here is that I was watching this performance at 8 p.m. before I even had gone to dinner (there was another showing at 10:30 p.m.). This is a time when pretty much every other big ship at sea is running PG-rated entertainment in its showrooms to cater to a family crowd.

Virgin Voyages isn't the first cruise line to tout adult-focused ships where no kids are allowed. A handful of other lines such as Viking and the U.K.'s Saga Cruises have similar no-kids policies. But those lines offer a more traditional cruise experience aimed at older travelers. They are lines for sixtysomething and seventysomething retirees looking for late-in-life ""enrichment"" in the form of onboard lectures and educational touring in ports.

As you can see from the image above Virgin Voyages is offering a whole new type of adult cruise.

The entertainment sets a new bar

Virgin Voyages promised to shake things up when it comes to cruise ship entertainment and -- in my opinion at least -- it has delivered. Big time. The entertainment that you'll see on Scarlet Lady is edgy and experimental and really pushes the boundaries of what entertainment at sea can be -- and not just because it includes a sex-themed show with a ""resident sexologist.""

For starters the line has done away with the traditional Broadway-style theater with rows of fixed seats that you'll find on most big cruise vessels as well as the traditional Broadway-style shows and Las Vegas-style musical reviews that you'll typically find playing in them. In its place is a soaring box-like entertainment space called the Red Room that can transform into all sorts of configurations to allow for different types of unusual performances.

The Red Room notably is home to what is surely the most avant-garde ""show"" ever on a cruise ship -- an energetic dance party-meets-performance extravaganza called UNTITLED DANCESHOWPARTYTHING. Created by the well-known choreographers Sam Pinkleton and Ani Taj it takes place in the Red Room configured as a flat dance floor with a rolling stage in the middle and several other platforms on which dancers perform and interact as showgoers stand on the dance floor around them. The music is blasting and the walls are lined with video screens projecting an ever-changing kaleidoscope of often incongruous images including a giant cat head that exclaims ""don't be an a**hole"" to the crowd as assistants push the stage around the room ushering showgoers out of the way. At times the dancers encourage the crowd to join in with the dancing and many do.

The line has described the show as ""a hype music video disguised as an absurdist style dance party"" and that pretty much sums it up. I absolutely loved it.

Reconfigured to have two rows of stadium seating with a performance area in the middle the Red Room hosts another wowzer of a show called Duel Reality that is a modern take on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" told through highly choreographed music-infused acrobatics.

Other entertainment on board is more subtle but no less avante-garde. Throughout this sailing small groups of performers have appeared as if out of nowhere in lounges and bars to perform short ""micro plays"" lasting just a few minutes before disappearing. I was sitting in Sip the ship's Champagne bar a few nights ago with my TPG colleague Madison Blancaflor (stay tuned for her take on Scarlet Lady in the next few days) when a seemingly crazed man wearing a poncho and carrying an umbrella began asking me if I had ""seen her."" He then launched into a tale that I think was about some sort of rogue sailing ship of old.

Madison and I were both so stunned by this odd intrusion into our otherwise quiet conversation that neither of us really caught what he was talking about. But in retrospect it was kind of delightful (at least for me. Madison seems to still be a bit traumatized by the whole experience).

The entertainment on Scarlet Lady also includes a lot of party-like events such as the everyone-wear-red-and-be-prepared-to-dance Scarlet Night Pool Party that happens on the second night of this itinerary. There are performers dancing on the pool deck and part-way through the event they encourage passengers to jump into the water with them.

There also is nightly dancing in the ship's two-story-high nightclub The Manor.

In general it's a ship where there's always a party going on somewhere at night and there's always music playing in almost every venue even in places where it probably shouldn't be (often at a sound level several twists of the speaker dial too high -- at least for a 52-year-old like me; by the time you get to my age you like to actually be able to hear the people with whom you're talking in bars and restaurants).

The dining sets a new bar too

The days of cruise ships having one big main dining room where everybody on board eats in fixed seatings is long gone. These days you'll find a wide choice of restaurants on most big cruise vessels and even smaller vessels offer at least a few choices.

But the idea of a main dining room hasn't completely disappeared from the cruise world. On many ships even when there are a lot of restaurant choices there still is one or more ""main"" restaurants that is notably bigger than all the rest and where you will eat the bulk of your meals.

Often these big main dining rooms are included in the fare whereas the smaller ""specialty"" restaurants which typically offer a more intimate and upscale experience come with an extra charge.

Virgin Voyages has done away with this sort of main vs. specialty restaurant arrangement completely on Scarlet Lady. There really is no main dining room on the ship. There is no default place where you will eat on most nights. Like a resort on land Scarlet Lady is home to an array of eateries none notably bigger than another and there is no differentiation between ""included eateries"" and extra-charge venues.

The cost of going to any of the restaurants on Scarlet Lady is the same: nothing.

My take on this is one word: finally. Longtime cruisers are accustomed to the idea of the main dining rooms vs. specialty restaurants split on cruise ships. But to anyone who isn't a regular cruiser it can just feel weird -- and outdated. I suspect it's a major hurdle for many non-cruisers (still the majority of Americans) to give cruising a try.

Virgin Voyages hypes the fact that it has more than 20 eateries on Scarlet Lady. But the reality is there are just six restaurants. The line gets to the higher number in part by counting all of the many separate food stations at Scarlet Lady's buffet-like food court. There are about a dozen of these stations depending on how you count them.

But six restaurants for a ship the size of Scarlet Lady still is impressive (at 110000 tons Scarlet Lady isn't nearly as big as the biggest ships from some other lines).

I've tried four of the six eateries so far and I've enjoyed them all even if I quibbled a bit about the quality of a 'secret' off-menu steak that is available at one of them.

I particularly loved Gunbae a Korean barbecue eatery with circular tables built around specially engineered flameless grills where servers cook Korean-style seafood and meat in front of you. These same servers also lead you in Korean drinking games (the first round of shots of Korean soju is on them).

I also was impressed with the pasta dishes at Extra Virgin the ship's Italian eatery. I ordered a side of carbonara to accompany my main course a porcini-rubbed New York Strip steak just to test it. I was pleasantly surprised to see the dish was made with bucatini the long narrow tube-like pasta that is considered proper for carbonara but often isn't used at Italian restaurants.

The pasta notably is hand-made on site.

It's inclusive in a wonderful way

The fact that none of the restaurants mentioned above come with a charge is a big deal.

There are $2000-a-night luxury ships such as Crystal Cruises' new Crystal Endeavor that include the cost of dining in all of their restaurants in their fares. But you don't see this sort of thing on the bigger ships operated by the likes of Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line.

And it's not just the restaurants that are included in the fare on Scarlet Lady. So are gratuities for the ship's staff a line item that can cost $15 a day per person or more on many lines and onboard Wi-Fi (for a basic Wi-Fi connection that is relatively slow; a faster connection on this sailing came with a $40 per person per cruise upcharge ).

In addition a wide array of wellness classes including spin classes and yoga classes are included in the fare. That's not something you see on many lines.

A common complaint about Virgin Voyages that I have heard from cruising regulars over the past year as it has prepared to debut is that its pricing is too high. And indeed it's not an inexpensive line. The starting rate for four-night Scarlet Lady sailings out of Miami over the coming months is $650 per person. That's more than four times as much as the $151 per person starting rate you'll find for some four-night sailings out of Miami on what many cruisers consider the port city's best short-haul ship: Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas.

But you'll pay a lot more in ""extras"" if sailing on Freedom of the Seas where specialty restaurants gratuities and Wi-Fi are not included in the fare.

Bottom line

I'm not blown away by everything that I am encountering on Scarlet Lady. While much of the ship is well-designed with stylish contemporary spaces there are a few areas that are so minimalist as to appear almost unfinished. The elevator hallways in particular are so plain unadorned and brightly lit that they give off the air of a hospital ward. There also is a noticeable lack of signage around the ship to the point that it took me two days to discover one tucked-away bar called The Loose Cannon. Virgin Voyages' app isn't much help when it comes to getting you around either (nor is it particularly intuitive).

But for the most part I am impressed by what I am seeing on Scarlet Lady -- and that's coming from someone who has sailed on more than 150 different ships during 20-plus years of writing about cruising. Virgin Voyages clearly has spent a lot of time rethinking what a cruise can be and it has come up with some wonderful new ways of doing things.

That doesn't mean that I'm sure Virgin Voyages is going to be a success. It's possible that despite the line's best efforts the ship is still not cool enough for the young and the hip crowd that some have thought would be its natural market. Maybe no cruise ship can be. It also may be too pricey for a younger crowd. At the same time Scarlet Lady may turn out to be just a tad too cool for many people in my generation even for those of us looking to have some fun.

It's a fine line that Virgin Voyages is trying to walk. Whether it's a hit with the younger generations older generations both groups of people or none at all remains to be seen.

The competition ran for eight weeks and pitted the 29-year-old Kenyan against seven other chefs from South Africa Rwanda Ghana Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo.

Les as he likes to refer himself as got a random DM (direct message) on Instagram (IG) from a lady who said she was working with Media 24 a South African network company. She informed him that they were shortlisting for a competition to be held in South Africa.

She had come across his profile on the platform and felt that he would be a good fit for it and gave him a list of the criteria he needed to meet. He submitted a video about himself and he was called up a few weeks and informed he was shortlisted to represent Kenya in House of Chefs.

“This show is like Big Brother and Master Chef combined. It’s a recording of how chefs who know nothing about each other are put in a house together. The first half of the day is a group challenge. Two groups and you have to interpret the theme of the day. You are judged based on your ability to work in a group. Everyone from the losing team is put up on the list for possible elimination. You can be exempt from elimination if you win the solo challenge afterwards. The contestants are the ones deciding who leaves by voting on the WhatsApp group during dinner” says Les.

Les never came up for elimination. He was beaten to the competition’s $5 000 (Sh552 500) prize money by Ghanaian Joseph Odoom. The winner of the competition was decided by South African celebrity chef Siba Mtongana the show’s judge.

Les just showed up to perform. He did not see the need for alliances. His strong character and no-nonsense stance saw him not received well by the other contestants.

“I’ve gotten here by having to work harder than a lot of people. Some people got a lot points because of being in groups. Whenever I came up for elimination it was because of my group members. There is no need for me to pamper anyone because I see no grey areas. Therefore I had to work hard on the solo challenges” says Les stating they would shoot from 7am to 1:45am.

Chef Les believes he couldn’t have lost to a better chef than Odoom but he has been humbled by the overwhelming support he had from different parts of the continent and also with what he was capable of creating in under an hour; especially with Odoom having the advantage of picking the ingredients for the starters and 15-minute time advantage on the dessert preparations during the finale.

However he feels that the show would benefit from having at least three judges who would bring in varied opinions. Though he says he picked up the judge’s extreme humility despite being celebrated all over the continent.

“She’ll be in a room but you’ll notice that this isn’t your average Jill. She’s been able to establish her restaurant in a spot where she’s the only Black owner while in a male-dominated industry” he says of Siba.

This isn’t Chef Les’ first time in front of the camera. He has been involved in TV commercials the latest of which included ads for KCB and ICEA Lion always playing as a chef. He has also been hosted on local and international shows for his prowess in the kitchen. Chef Les also looks every bit showbiz besides being very good at his profession: his high top but fresh haircut his styled beard tatted up arms and a fit physique.

“I grew up watching cooking shows and always wanted to be on the other side of the screen. I used to watch “Mke Nyumbani” and being recorded while cooking looked very cool” says Les.

Watching Gordon Ramsey’s “Hell’s Kitchen” Friday nights on NTV showed a completely different side from the normal subtle cooking shows he had watched with Martha Stewart and “Let’s Cook” with Susan Kamau.

But it took hard work for Les’ dream to come true. In his tenth year in the industry his passion almost didn’t take off. After clearing high school his parents were unable to afford fees for him to join Utalii College in 2011.

Les decided to do supermarket runs queue in line to pay bills wash cars for friends and family at a fee. He also got a small internship at an eatery at Village Market called Pomodoro. The owner’s children were being taught by Chef Les’ sister and he asked if he expressed to him his desire to be a chef.

For three months he would gain his first kitchen experience while earning Sh1 500 per month. Hardly enough for the fare from Bahati Nairobi he says the experience gained was invaluable.

From the sums he managed to collect as payment from his efforts and with a loan from a friend he went back to try the hospitality training institution. This time he found some “redtape” keeping him out.

“It wasn’t easy to get into the main programmes that would take two years back then without knowing someone there. I did a short course on cake making and decoration. The month-long learning programme cost Sh30000” remembers Les.

After seeing his drive his sister and brother sponsored Les to do a full chef’s course at Top Chef in Westlands. It involved a year of training and another year of interning both done in six-month intervals. The course was intense and a contract with the school disallowed students from being in employment.

Les’ first internship was at Fairmont The Norfolk. They retained him as a casual chef after the internship. Les who was also baking at night to earn his pocket money would go to school from 8am to 3:30pm then go on shift till midnight. He then had to start another internship at The Tribe where he was also taken up as a casual.

In 2014 having finished his internship at The Tribe but still on casual employment after having graduated he was poached by Sankara to be a full time chef. A chef’s job demands a lot. Even though contracts say shifts are eight hours chefs have to be in earlier than anyone else in order to have meals ready by the time guests walk in.

Usually Les finds himself putting in 12-hour shifts. The rigours also require one to be in good shape and help you value real social ties. If you have to work six days a week you would need to have someone who is mature enough to understand the environment you are in.

“You’ll need someone who is as busy as or even busier than you are. For me fitness was one of the things I had to turn to. If you’re not equipped to walk run and stand while carrying loads it’s going to be difficult for you” says Chef Les.

Les has also worked on a cruise ship Celebrity Cruises under Royal Caribbean Company for a year. This was one of the toughest jobs. The limitation on space means that one is on shift almost for the entirety of the time save for when the ship docks at different country.

Being in the middle of nowhere and sometimes facing harsh elements gave him more connection with his spirituality. He encountered a lot of dishes he had never made before but how fast you see and replicate preparations of meals is what defines a good chef. This experience was exactly why Chef Les joined the industry.

Then in 2015 he joined Nyama Mama. He quit the job 5 months ago to pursue his own ventures. Aiming to be Africa’s Gordon Ramsey Chef Les is currently freelancing to promote Kenyan food culture through different productions and creating online content working with various brands like Hop House.

He is also creating food experiences by hosting dinners and cooking privately for individuals as well as being a guest chef at different establishments. Two weeks ago he was a guest chef at a spot in Kampala Uganda and will be moving there at the end of the month. He’s also a consultant for kitchen design layout and equipment acquisitions for restaurants.

Chef Les remembers Chef Zachary the executive sous chef at Fairmont who later became his boss at Nyama Mama Luca Molteni the executive chef at The Tribe John Murray and Stefan who had a very big impact on his growth.

One of the biggest and most defining moments of his life was when he cooked for the late Anthony Bourdain and they had a sit-down conversing on life and the industry. He’s cooked and met other celebrities and high profile people like Chronixx W Kamau Bell 2 Chianz Neyo US politician John Kerry and Air force pilots who were part of Obama’s delegation in 2015.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlZmV2ZXIubmV0L2NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1iZWdpbnMtb24tbXNjLWdyb3Vwcy0ybmQtbmV3LWx1eHVyeS1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Construction Begins on MSC Group's 2nd New Luxury Cruise Ship,"Explora Journeys the MSC Group’s newly launched premium cruise line celebrated another major milestone in its coming-to-market phase today in Italy with the steel cutting of its second ship EXPLORA II.



Our free cruise newsletter offers the latest cruise news and deals: Sign Up

The second vessel in Explora Journeys’ fleet of luxury ships began construction and is expected to welcome its first passengers in Spring 2024.

This comes just three months after the Explora Journeys brand was launched and the construction of its first ship the EXPLORA I is set to commence in May 2023.

In 2025 and 2026 two more new ships will join the fleet demonstrating MSC Group’s commitment to establishing the Explora Journeys brand which is designed for the next generation of discerning luxury travelers.

Pierfrancesco Vago Executive Chairman of MSC Group’s Cruise Division said “The start of Explora Journeys’ second ship signals our firm commitment to our tourism partners for the coming-to-market of our new luxury brand with a significant financial investment in a fleet of innovative elegant ships that will bring together our vision and purpose to create an ocean state of mind like no other.

Given our belief in this brand to create a new category in luxury lifestyle travel we will continue to invest in its expansion to attract the growing number and aspirations of the next generation of discerning luxury travelers.”

All four Explora Journeys ships will be built in Italy and the first steel for the second vessel was cut at Fincantieri’s Castellammare di Stabia yard near Naples in a typical nautical ritual.

Pierfrancesco Vago CEO of Explora Journeys and Luigi Matarazzo General Manager of Fincantieri’s Merchant Ships Division were among those who attended the occasion.

Explora Journeys has also been given ‘preferred’ status by a number of leading travel agency groups an honor not usually bestowed on a brand prior to its launch demonstrating an unprecedented level of recognition from the luxury travel industry and reinforcing our commitment to and confidence in our robust B2B2C strategy.

EXPLORA II will be built in the same revolutionary style as EXPLORA I with 461 balcony suites with some of the largest lead-in categories private terraces and ample outdoor space.

The cruise ships will be equipped with the most cutting-edge environmental technologies as well as the ability to adapt to alternative energy solutions as they become available. The design includes battery storage to enable future hybrid power generation as well as the most up-to-date selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology which reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 90%.

Built with ship-to-shore power to reduce CO2 emissions while at berth and fueled by marine gas oil this is in keeping with MSC Group’s Cruise Division’s recent goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its cruise maritime operations by 2050.

Explora Journeys created an industry-first ‘By Appointment’ service one of many bold initiatives that allows travel advisors to schedule an appointment with a customer experience representative to discuss and place a waitlist on a specific suite for one or more of the eight inaugural journeys during EXPLORA I’s first year including the vessel’s maiden voyage.

This supports Explora Journeys’ guest-centric approach by allowing travel advisors to book an appointment to discuss and create a waitlist reservation for their valued customers which can then be converted to a deposited reservation at a later date. EXPLORA II will have waitlist possibilities via the ‘By Appointment’ service starting in Spring 2022.",,,,,,

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

Sarasota - In Loving Memory of George Paul Prozzo. He passed in peace Friday late afternoon August 6th at the age of 89 in Sarasota Florida with family at his side. Born in Worcester Massachusetts George was the eldest son to George and Evelyn (Tully) Prozzo and grandson of family hailing from Italy Canada and Sweden in late 1800's. Sadly he was predeceased by his dear siblings Jeffrey T. Prozzo (2019) and sister Patricia (Prozzo) Frodigh (2018). George also joins his devoted wife of 60 years Joann (Peterson) Prozzo of Royalston Massachusetts (2015) with their precious son Eric John Prozzo (1966).With so many reunited we can be sure that that there is laughter song cheese and crackers and probably a good game of cribbage happening somewhere beyond.

George grew up in Worcester during the Depression and as a teen he helped his family by delivering newspapers and selling shoes at the downtown Florsheim store. His favorite courses at Worcester Classical High School were math and physics where he was also known for his humour and flashy ties. George matriculated to Worcester Polytechnic Institute specializing in electrical engineering earning him the nickname ""Double E"". Music was always a part of his family; George played piano and sang bass in his choir at Trinity Lutheran Church where he met his future wife Joann. They married in 1955 and honey-mooned in Salzburg Austria (courtesy of the US Army). After his military service George worked in the emerging world of transistors and semiconductors with the Sangamo Weston Company raising his family mostly in Springfield and Rochester IL eventually moving to Sarasota in 1978 when George joined Fairchild Weston Schlumberger Data Systems Division. George was very active at St. Paul Holy Cross and Faith Lutheran Churches devoting much time as a choir member councilperson and sometimes assistant gardener with his wife. He was a member of the Cory B. Fish Masonic Lodge in Sarasota and of course a lifelong Red Sox fan.

George is mourned by his dedicated children: son David (Susan) and daughters Lisa Kristina and Rebecca. He also leaves his cherished grandsons Jonathan (Kalia) Jeremy step granddaughter Atalie and nieces and nephews: Deborah Roland Sue Aimee Nathan and Anya.

George was a force of nature with a generous heart who touched many lives behind the scenes. His family meant everything to him and he was deeply proud of them all. We will always be thankful for the gift of his life.

""May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest"" Dad. We love you.

Many high-growth tech stocks doubled in value in 2020. That's not normal. It usually takes a bit more time for a stock to rise that much even for an especially fast-growing business with an in-demand product or service. 2021 has been a different story. Many of these outperforming stocks of 2020 have taken a breather some of them even declining by double-digit percentages.

Nevertheless that doesn't mean growth investing is dead. On the contrary many of them still offer compelling reasons to invest today. Three that could double over the next four years or so are Skyworks Solutions (SWKS -0.05%) Micron Technology (MU 2.91%) and T-Mobile US (TMUS -0.29%). Here's how three Fool.com contributors think it could play out.

An ever expanding need for high-quality mobile connectivity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Skyworks Solutions): The last couple of years have been busy ones for mobile connectivity chip designer Skyworks Solutions. The initial 5G mobile network rollout from telecoms translated into booming sales of new smartphones with a 5G connection-enabling chip in them. Sales at Skyworks are fast on the rise as a result up 41% over the last two-year stretch -- impressive considering sales briefly hit the skids last spring.

5G phones will no doubt continue to provide some upward momentum for Skyworks in the next three years as more of the next-gen mobile network becomes available to the masses. But Skyworks is much more than a smartphone component supplier. It also plays a hand in the design of infrastructure equipment used to build telecommunications systems as well as the design of other devices that contain connectivity semiconductors: things like smart home devices audio equipment internet modems and routers fitness equipment and security systems.

The market for chips for products outside of smartphones -- which Skyworks calls its ""broad markets"" business -- has been steadily growing for years and makes up about one-third of revenue. But it will get a big boost in this department from the acquisition of Silicon Laboratories' (SLAB -2.63%) automotive and network infrastructure segment. The acquisition will add about $400 million a year in sales at the most recent annualized run rate and yield Skyworks exposure to some massive new markets specifically the growing connected and electric auto movement.

With its own core business still growing at a fast double-digit percentage clip adding a new breed of chip designs into the mix should help Skyworks sustain its momentum. Granted as is the case with semiconductor stocks I don't expect this advance to move up in a straight line. Chip industry sales are cyclical and can ebb and flow from year to year. But over the next few years 5G will continue to proliferate and dozens of more technologically advanced vehicle models will hit the road. I see plenty of room for this chip company to grow -- it could be double the size it is now in another four years' time.

Micron shares trade at an oversize discount today

Anders Bylund (Micron Technology): Memory chip maker Micron Technology has seen some hard times lately. Let me clarify that. Micron's stock is in dire straits at the moment. The business is as healthy as ever.

Micron generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow and $12.6 billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the last four quarters. These generous profits were generated from $27.7 billion of top-line revenue. All of these important metrics have surged higher in the last two years:

Micron set many operating records in the recently completed fiscal year 2021. Mobile memory sales reached new highs. Automotive and industrial memory chips also topped their old record sales by significant margins. Even the consumer-facing business landed record sales this year.

All of these records were achieved in the midst of a sector-wide manufacturing crisis. Micron runs its own chip-making plants which helps the company dodge the logjam in the leading contract manufacturing specialists' production pipelines. Production technology upgrades are generally on time and within Micron's generous infrastructure budgets.

So Micron's operations are humming right along while most of the semiconductor industry suffers production-level restrictions. Market makers must be impressed right?

Well no. Micron's stock has retreated nearly 30% from April's multi-year highs and trades at a mere 7.9 times forward earnings. In other words Micron's shares are hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin despite the company's impressive business results. The company will set the record straight over time and I will be amazed if share prices haven't at least doubled from this rock-bottom level in the next three years.

This 5G leader should have little trouble doubling in the years ahead

Billy Duberstein (T-Mobile): When you think of large telecom stocks you don't normally think of big-time gains. Yet that's exactly what investors should see if T-Mobile hits its long-term financial targets as a result of its leadership in 5G.

T-Mobile's stock has fallen recently following an unfortunate data breach and the stock is currently down about 16.5% from recent highs. But as the news around the data breach falls further into the past it sets T-Mobile stock up to potentially double in the next four years.

In fact it wouldn't even take a herculean effort for the stock to double by 2025. At its March analyst day management raised its long-term forecasts having grown even more bullish on both revenue and cost synergies stemming from the 2020 acquisition of Sprint.

That integration takes some upfront investment so T-Mobile's profits and free cash flow are muted at the moment; however management now sees $13 billion to $14 billion in free cash flow by 2023 to 2024 and over $18 billion in free cash flow by 2026.

Assuming $18 billion in free cash flow -- the low end of T-Mobile's target -- and just a 15 P/E ratio in 2025 one could see T-Mobile trading at a market cap of $270 billion up about 75% from today's share price. However T-Mobile also plans to return $60 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases by 2025. That's nearly 40% of T-Mobile's market capitalization today.

Of course T-Mobile's share price will likely go up as repurchases are made and the share count declines; however even if T-Mobile retires only 20% of its shares outstanding compounded with a 75% increase in market cap its share price would appreciate about 118%.

Skeptics would point out that T-Mobile's rivals Verizon Communications and AT&T have forward P/E ratios of just 10 and 8.5 respectively. However those bargain-basement valuations could reflect the fact that T-Mobile has taken the lead in 5G capabilities and appears set to gain market share from each in the years ahead. Both Verizon and AT&T also pay out dividends instead of repurchasing stock and both companies also have more sizable debt loads by comparison.

With the overall market's forward P/E multiple around 21.5 today it's not unreasonable to use 15 for an industry leader like T-Mobile. And given that T-Mobile has a history of beating its own forecasts a doubling in its share price by 2025 is not only possible but I think likely.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Operations and accounting coordinator at Skratch Labs LLC. Assistant parks landscape technician at the city of Boulder. Software engineer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Housekeeper at the Hotel Boulderado.

These are but a handful of the thousands of current job openings at companies in Boulder the surrounding areas and the rest of the state. According to Connecting Colorado the state’s job board there were more than 96000 open jobs as of Thursday morning. Of the 87000-plus job openings that were posted on the board in the past month more than 50000 are still open.

If those numbers seem large it’s because they are. The labor shortage that reached crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic has not abated even as Coloradans return to the workforce. According to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment jobs data from August the most recent month for which data is available the state’s unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time since March 2020. The number of employed individuals in Colorado climbed by nearly 5000 in August to top 3 million overall. Yet still across various industries and sectors in the Boulder Valley companies are struggling to find hire train and retain qualified employees.

“Across the board our member companies are all experiencing a challenge on the workforce front” said John Tayer president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber.

However the labor shortage is not at all slowing down the drive for major companies in the Boulder area to expand and grow — businesses such as the data company Splunk which recently moved into 42000 square feet in the new S’park building in Boulder. According to its website Splunk is looking to add hundreds of employees. So is the J.M. Smucker Co. which is building a 240000-square-foot expansion to its Longmont plant. It has nearly 200 job openings for that facility. Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. which is also building a 200000-plus-square-foot expansion to its Boulder campus likewise lists more than 100 job openings for that location.

And as these giants look to greatly expand their Boulder-area workforces local businesses that have for decades been staples of the community are struggling to simply find enough employees to function.

Kevin Daly owner of the Mountain Sun Pub and Brewery said understaffing and the amount of time it takes to train new workers has kept two of his restaurants closed.

“It’s all lack of staff and getting people trained” Daly said.

Cindy Scurry human resources manager for McGuckin Hardware said the store badly needs front-end employees. She said McGuckin is about 15% short of its normal staffing levels with about five times as many open positions as usual.

“We are understaffed especially in cashiering” Scurry said. “I’m cross-trained so even I will cashier for half an hour or an hour or two or four hours a day if necessary. We’re all cross-trained so we can help each other out.”

The end last month of the extra unemployment benefits provided through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan has thus far brought little relief to companies that are struggling to fill positions.

Those programs provided enhanced unemployment benefits through three major programs: Pandemic Unemployment Compensation which provided an extra $300 per week in benefits to supplement what people already received; Pandemic Unemployment Assistance which gave benefits to gig workers freelancers and self-employed workers who normally do not receive unemployment benefits; and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation which extended the time period people could receive benefits past the standard 26 weeks.

When those programs ended Sept. 6 nearly 11 million Americans either lost their unemployment benefits entirely or lost the extra $300 a month.

However this has yet to translate into any tangible improvement to the labor shortage crisis. Curtis Grave is a managing attorney for labor relations at the Employers Council an organization that provides professional employment services to companies. He said that may partly be because it’s too soon to tell what if any impact the end of the extra unemployment benefits will eventually have on the workforce. It also Graves said reflects the fact that the labor shortage is a multifaceted issue that no magic bullet will solve.

“It’s not going to get fixed overnight” Graves said. “This will require creative solutions.”

Indeed the Boulder employers spoken to for this story did not blame the extra unemployment benefits for their staffing difficulties. Scurry said that none of the job applicants she’s seen at McGuckin recently were people receiving those benefits; rather they’re University of Colorado Boulder students and retirees who want part-time work to fill their time. Daly also disagreed with the notion that the extra benefits were keeping people from working.

“I don’t think (the end of the extra unemployment benefits) has any impact” Daly said. “I don’t think it was a disincentive. I personally don’t know anyone who milked the system. I can’t believe how many people buy into that idea. We have this program that actually saved lives that worked and we pulled people out of poverty with it. I don’t think it was keeping people from coming back to work.”

The reality Tayer said is that the labor shortage is the result of a number of factors and will only be solved through a holistic approach.

“The workforce challenge is a confluence of a number of different influences and what is permanent is not absolutely clear” Tayer said. “People are retiring early. People continue to sit on the sidelines because they have concerns about entering the workforce either because of COVID or childcare access or something else. Workers are reconsidering their current employment and evaluating potentially changing careers. All of those factors seem to be combining to create a very difficult circumstance.”

Graves said that even before the pandemic the United States was dealing with the triple whammy of an aging population declining birth rate and declining immigration. All of those factors were already shrinking the country’s labor pool.

“There was a perfect storm when COVID hit” Graves said.

Daly said that the influence of the coronavirus also cannot be discounted especially in the restaurant and retail industries where employees have to interact with customers on a daily basis.

“It’s a dangerous industry because there’s a pandemic” Daly said. “The virus is still there.”

Local employers are thus faced with two parallel problems: the immediate problem of trying to attract workers now to fill the positions they have open; and the long-term problem of the various societal factors that contribute to the labor shortage.

To address the former Tayer said the chamber is working with member businesses on workforce development programs such as expanded access to apprenticeships helping businesses connect with high schools community colleges and universities to set up a better workforce pipeline and helping businesses learn to identify talented potential employees who may be flying under the radar or lack the traditional credentials for the position.

At the Employers Council Graves said the organization is encouraging businesses to look at a number of potential solutions such as increasing pay providing hiring and retention bonuses offering student loan forgiveness plans and providing child and elder care.

Scurry said that McGuckin has dramatically increased the amount of recruiting it does on social media; it’s been using TikTok Instagram and Facebook in addition to traditional job postings online and offering walk-in interviews.

“In the past that would have been more than we needed” Scurry said.

The return of students to CU has also helped provide a small salve but the cyclical nature of student employment is still a barrier.

And these solutions won’t be enough to address the underlying societal issues that are contributing to the labor shortage. Doing so will take time money and effort from the Boulder-area business communities as well as local and state governments.

Housing is still too expensive and undersupplied. Getting to work is still an issue. Many employers still pay wages too low to live on in Boulder.

“What’s keeping us in Boulder County from finding employees is housing and the lack of livable wages” Daly said (he added that his servers and cooks at Mountain Sun make between $25 and $30 per hour). “We need to make it so people want these jobs.”

At the chamber those have always been priorities. During the pandemic the need to address them evolved into the Boulder Together program which is attempting to help fix the issues of workforce development housing affordability and community infrastructure to make Boulder a more affordable livable workable place.

“All of that is even more urgent today” Tayer said.

For the Boulder area to continue to be a hub for creative innovative businesses solving those problems will be a prerequisite.

“People want to work” Daly said. “They want to have purpose. If people don’t want to go back to work then there is something wrong with the system.”

That’s what the Ashland High football team wants to model itself after this season.

“‘Be a wolf’ has been a motto and it basically means lead by example” Ashland senior captain Dylan Drozeck said. “A group of sheep go through the motions but a pack of wolves do whatever they can to eat.”

On Friday night the wolf pack from Ashland feasted. They just had to wait a little longer to do so.

Tied at 14 apiece in double overtime in a game against Holliston Ashland quarterback Luke Herter received a snap on first-and-goal from the 10-yard line. The senior captain took a few steps back planted his right foot and lofted a ball into the corner of the end zone.

The pass found the outstretched arms of teammate Max Palin for a game-winning touchdown. But with a flag thrown near the line of scrimmage initial indications seemed like the TD would be called back.

Not so fast.

Following a brief discussion between two officials the penalty was waved off and Ashland walked away with a 20-14 win over Holliston at Kamitian Field.

“That whole game was like a roller-coaster ride” Ashland head coach Andrew MacKay said. “… We usually end on the other side of them.”

“I was so happy and then it was like ‘oh that is coming back’” Palin said of the score. “Then it was waved off and it was awesome and we won the game.”

With the game tied 14-14 with one second left in regulation Ashland (5-0) lined up to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick missed wide left however to set up an overtime period with Tri-Valley League Large foe Holliston (1-4).

In OT Ashland received the ball first on offense from the 10-yard line but was stuffed by the Panthers at the goal line on fourth down. Needing just a field goal to win a 30-yard kick from Holliston on fourth-and-13 sailed wide left to force a second overtime.

“You’re going to play games like that that are close and sometimes it happens and you have to (toughen) up and make the plays” Ashland senior captain Matt Gillis said.

The Clockers had to then play defense again with Holliston getting the first crack on offense in the second extra period. Ashland didn’t back down though and stuffed a Holliston run attempt on fourth-and-2 to take the ball over on offense.

“You’re down and out at that point and you have to make a play” MacKay said. “They come they run a counter and our kids snuffed it out.”

The defensive stop set the stage for Herter and the Ashland offense to win it – and he didn’t waste any time when he lofted the 10-yard TD pass on first down to secure the victory.

“It was a perfect throw by Herter” Palin said.

“He’s a great athlete and I knew he would come down with it” Herter said.

Following a brief team-wide celebration on the field and a handshake line with Holliston MacKay delivered a short-but-sweet message to his team postgame.

“We’re still here” he said. “It’s our TVL.”

Ashland has taken home the Tri-Valley League Large title each of the past two seasons. Winning a TVL crown this year is a goal for the Clockers.

It’s a feat no other Ashland team has accomplished in program history.

“That’s been our goal since Day 1” Herter said.

Ashland senior captain Andrew Meleski opened the scoring on Friday with a 72-yard TD run in the first quarter before Holliston junior Cooper Olson rushed it 67 yards for a score to cut the deficit to 7-6. The score remained the same at halftime prior to Herter jamming in a 1-yard TD run to make it 14-6 in the third.

A 54-yard TD pass from Holliston junior quarterback TJ Kiley to classmate Brady Sweeney – and a successful 2-point conversion run – late in the third quarter set up the late-game heroics and double-overtime finish.

“We just made one more play” MacKay said.

So did the wolves eat on Friday night?

“Absolutely” Drozeck said.

The wolf pack maxim certainly fit the Ashland High football team in its win over Holliston.

“Wolves travel in packs and they’re stronger together” MacKay said. “That’s kind of been our little mantra here and they certainly stuck together tonight.”

Oklahoma is undefeated this season but four of their five games have been decided by seven points or less. Since a humbling loss at Arkansas Texas (4-1) has won three straight games by a combined score of 160-62.

Texas owns a 62-49-5 lead in the all-time series but Oklahoma is 15-7 since 2000. The Longhorns and Sooners first played in 1900.

This will be Steve Sarkisian's introduction to this storied rivalry. Dating back to Darrell Royal in 1957 Texas' head coaches are 3-4 in their first games against Oklahoma. Mack Brown John Mackovic and Fred Akers were victorious in their inaugural showdowns with the Sooners. Tom Herman Charlie Strong David McWilliams and Royal were all beaten the first times they met Oklahoma in Dallas.

Oklahoma beats Texas on a late touchdown run

A 33-yard touchdown run with three seconds left by Kennedy Brooks has stunned Texas at the Cotton Bowl. The touchdown lifted the Sooners to a 55-48 victory over their Red River rivals.

With Oklahoma seemingly setting up for a long field goal to win the game Brooks took the direct snap on a play from the Texas 33. He faked a pitch to quarterback Caleb Williams and then took off. He scooted mostly unbothered into the end zone.

Oklahoma remained undefeated despite trailing by as many as 21 points in the game. With 2:45 left in the third quarter Oklahoma faced a 41-23 deficit. The 6-0 Sooners are now 3-0 in Big 12 play. After the game Oklahoma fans stormed the field to celebrate alongside the football players.

The loss snapped a three-game winning streak for Texas. The Longhorns are 4-2 overall and 2-1 in their conference games.

Dating back to 2014 each of the Oklahoma-Texas games at the Cotton Bowl have been decided by seven points or less. Texas is 2-6 in those contests.

Worthy of a great finish at the Cotton Bowl (4th 1:23)

Casey Thompson's 31-yard touchdown pass to Xavier Worthy has helped Texas tie Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl. With 1:23 left both the Longhorns and Sooners have put 48 points up on their sides of the scoreboard.

Worthy helped his cause with a 14-yard catch on the six-play scoring drive. The freshman now has 261 receiving yards over nine catches against Oklahoma's secondary. That is the second-most receiving yards ever recorded by a Texas receiver. Jordan Shipley's 273 yards against Central Florida in 2009 is the school standard at Texas.

Texas up against a wall at the Cotton Bowl (4th 4:39)

Texas failed to convert a 4th-and-11 from the Oklahoma 24 with 4:39 remaining. Casey Thompson was looking for Bijan Robinson in the end zone but he overthrew his star running back. Two Sooners were defending Robinson on the play.

Texas had struggled to move the football for much of the second half but a 48-yard catch by Xavier Worthy put the Longhorns in business. After Worthy gave UT a first down at the Oklahoma 24 UT lost a yard over two rushes and Thompson threw two incomplete passes.

Oklahoma leads 48-41. Texas which led by as many as 21 points in the first half has two timeouts left.

— Danny Davis

Sooners storm back to take the lead in Dallas (7:10 4th)

A catastrophic mistake by Xavier Worthy has led to Oklahoma taking its first lead of the day. Oklahoma running back Kennedy Brooks' 18-yard touchdown run has put the Sooners up 48-41. There is 7:10 left in the game.

After Oklahoma tied the game at 41 Worthy elected to take the ensuing kickoff out of the Texas end zone. On his first return of the day the freshman fumbled and Oklahoma recovered. On the next play Brooks scored.

— Danny Davis

Oklahoma rallies to tie Texas (4th 7:25)

An acrobatic 52-yard touchdown catch by Marvin Mims and a two-point conversion by Drake Stoops has tied this game. With 7:25 left in regulation Texas and Oklahoma both have 41 points.

Oklahoma punted on its first possession of the second half. The Sooners have scored on four straight drives since then.

The last seven Red River Showdowns have been decided by seven points or less. Last year Texas and Oklahoma played four overtime sessions.

— Danny Davis

Here come the Sooners (4th 11:44)

A 26-yard field goal by Gabe Brkic has pulled Oklahoma within eight points of Texas at the Cotton Bowl. With 11:44 left Texas is nursing a 41-33 lead. Texas has led by as many as 21 points in this game.

Oklahoma missed out on an opportunity to score a touchdown at the end of its nine-play drive. But Caleb Williams sailed a third-down pass to Jadon Haselwood who had gotten open in the back of the end zone.

— Danny Davis

Texas leads by 11 points at the end of the third quarter

A 41-30 advantage is in the Longhorns' favor as the Red River Showdown reaches its final frame. A 41-yard field goal with 2:45 left in the third quarter gave Texas its first points of the second half.

Oklahoma dodged two big bullets at the end of the third quarter. With 2:18 left Sooner running back Kennedy Brooks ripped off a 65-yard run to the Texas 13. Brooks was run down by D'Shawn Jamison who forced a fumble that was recovered by a Texas teammate. After a review however it was ruled that Brooks was down before he fumbled.

Three plays later Caleb Williams threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Mims. Williams was unable to handle a bad snap on the play but the freshman seamlessly picked up the loose football and found Mims in the end zone.

— Danny Davis

Gabe Brkic's leg makes it a two-score game at the Cotton Bowl (3rd 6:22)

Both Oklahoma and Texas punted on their first post-halftime possessions on Saturday. The Sooners then used Gabe Brkic's 29-yard field goal to cut into Texas' lead. The Longhorns are now up by a score of 38-23.

The field goal was Brkic's third of the day.

— Danny Davis

Longhorns take a 38-20 lead into halftime

At halftime on the fairgrounds Texas holds a 35-20 lead over Oklahoma. The Longhorns got a 38-yard field goal from Cameron Dicker at the buzzer.

UT quarterback Casey Thompson has thrown for 244 yards and four touchdowns while completing 10 of his 16 passes. Bijan Robinson paced the Texas rushing attack with 102 yards on 11 carries. With 141 receiving yards UT freshman Xavier Worthy nearly bested the 143 receiving yards compiled by the six Sooners who caught a pass.

Oklahoma seemingly benched starting quarterback Spencer Rattler near the end of the first half. Rattler who was benched for part of last year's Red River Showdown had two turnovers that Texas turned into two touchdown drives. Caleb Williams directed the Sooners' last drive of the first half.

More:Has Bijan Robinson officially entered the Heisman race?

This is UT's largest halftime lead in the Red River Showdown since 2005. Sixteen years ago Texas also held an 18-point halftime lead in a game it eventually won 45-12.

Fumble shifts the momentum at the Cotton Bowl (2nd 6:41)

After Oklahoma cut into the Texas lead with a 40-yard field goal the Sooners were poised to make this an even closer game. But Oklahoma quarterback Spencer Rattler fumbled while running around at the Texas 45. DeMarvion Overshown pounced on the football and Texas preserved its 28-17 lead.

Texas quickly turned that mistake into points. Bijan Robinson drove the Longhorns down to the Oklahoma 2 with a beautiful 50-yard run. That set up Casey Thompson's touchdown toss to tight end Jared Wiley.

Fourth-down gamble pays off for Oklahoma (2nd 14:45)

After Texas scored on the first play of the first quarter Oklahoma did the same on the second quarter's first snap. The Sooners faced a 4th-and-1 at their 34-yard-line at the end of the first quarter and Lincoln Riley elected to keep his offense on the field following the intermission and a Texas timeout.

Oklahoma backup quarterback Caleb Williams took the snap on the 4th-and-1 play. After running up the middle Williams broke free and was able to win a foot race to the end zone. The 66-yard touchdown pulled Oklahoma within 28-14.

— Danny Davis

Moore points for Texas (1st 1:02)

Texas quickly responded to Oklahoma's first scoring drive with a three-play possession. The drive was capped by Casey Thompson's 10-yard touchdown pass to Joshua Moore. That was the first touchdown scored this season by Moore who led Texas last year in receptions and receiving yards.

Moore returned to the end zone nearly four minutes later. His 48-yard touchdown catch gave Texas a 28-7 lead over the Sooners.

— Danny Davis

Spencer Rattlers gets Oklahoma on the scoreboard (1st 9:14)

Oklahoma was last shutout by Texas in 1965 and that kind of history won't be repeated today. A two-yard touchdown run by Sooner quarterback Spencer Rattler has made this a 14-7 game.

The most-notable moment on the 10-play drive was a 29-yard catch by Mike Woods that gave Oklahoma a first down on a 3rd-and-10. Woods appeared to have run out of bounds before his catch. After a review the play was upheld.

— Danny Davis

Agent 0 leads Texas to 7 points (1st 13:07)

Texas took a 14-0 lead with 13:07 left in the first quarter on a 2-yard touchdown run by Bijan Robinson. Over its first three snaps at the Cotton Bowl Texas has scored twice.

UT's second scoring drive began at the Oklahoma 2 after the Longhorns recovered a punt blocked by DeMarvion Overshown. Oklahoma had been forced to punt after Overshown sacked Sooner quarterback Spencer Rattler on a 3rd-and-7 attempt.

— Danny Davis

Texas takes the ball and an early lead (1st 14:46)

Texas won the coin toss and elected to receive the football. On the game's first snap Casey Thompson threw a short pass to freshman Xavier Worthy. With fellow receiver Marcus Washington blocking ahead of him Worthy broke two tackles and sprinted into the end zone with a 75-yard touchdown.

This marks the third time in the last 30 years that either the Longhorns or Sooners have scored within the first minute of the Red River Showdown. Back in 2003 Oklahoma's Renaldo Works scored on a 6-yard run with 14:26 left in the first quarter. Four years earlier Oklahoma struck 29 seconds into the game on Josh Heupel's 44-yard touchdown pass.

In late September the Ford Motor Company revealed its plans to build a battery plant and a truck assembly plant in the West Tennessee community of Stanton outside of Memphis at the Memphis Regional Megasite development. Ford and SK Innovation will invest $5.6 billion to build a 3600-acre mega campus called Blue Oval City in Haywood County where production of the next generation of all-electric F-Series trucks will begin in 2025.

The move adds to the state's already blossoming manufacturing industry stretching from Columbia to Memphis. The region can look to Maury County to catch a glimpse of how such an industry presence can shape a city and its surrounding area.

“This is a watershed moment for Tennesseans as we lead the future of the automotive industry and advanced manufacturing” Gov Bill Lee said recently about Ford's announcement.

Maury County has already experienced its share of watershed moments this year — as the fastest growing county in Tennessee according to the 2020 U.S Census and ranking No. 1 in incoming investments in the state by think-tank SmartAsset.

County leaders weigh-in on local prosperity

In Maury County Ryder System Inc. which supports GM’s operations at the Spring Hill plant is the county's second largest employer following GM. The presence of GM has also shined light on the need for supply companies close by.

The company is a transportation logistics and supply chain solutions operation that employs more than 1000 union workers contributing to GM’s team of more than 3200 workers.

“As a leading third-party logistics provider for the automotive industry Ryder manages the operations of some of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers” Steve Sensing president of global supply chain solutions for Ryder told The Daily Herald.

""As part of that we regularly recruit and train people on behalf of our customers. With the automotive industry’s roots in Tennessee going back to the 1980s we’re fortunate to have access to a workforce that has four decades of experience and is more than three times the size of the national average.""

Ryder continues to invest in the area by recruiting workers and providing training programs for the next generation.

""And as vehicle manufacturers continue to invest in the area Ryder continues to invest in training and retention programs to ensure we have the best possible workforce in place for our customers” Sensing said.

Already established as an automotive giant Maury County is also making its mark in the manufacturing industry as a whole which is a major factor in shaping its future.

Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles who says he's focused on building business and industry in Maury County praises the most recent $4.3 billion expansions at the GM plant.

“We are a low-tax state and a rights-to-work state” Ogles said.

He explained workers in the state are gaining a good reputation building credibility with some of the world’s largest corporations.

“Tennesseans are known for their work ethic” Ogles said. “We are a friendly people and all of those factors are important if you are a General Motors or a Ford.”

News about previous success is starting to spread.

“The fact that you can operate at lower costs and will have hard workers if you are investing millions of dollars you have to make sure there is a return on that investment"" Ogles said. ""And Tennessee has been proven to be one of the best states in the country to do that.”

Sen. Joey Hensley R-Hohenwald said the state's emphasis on savings also serves as a point of interest for large businesses.

“Tennessee in generally is a fiscally responsible state” Hensley said. “It is a right-to-work state people like to live here and companies like to deal with us here. We have low taxes. When you look at other states like California the cost of business is astronomical. They can do business here a lot cheaper and get good workers.”

Hensley's statement proves true with the May relocation of the JC Ford company headquarters from California to Columbia investing $30 million and bringing 210 new jobs. The tortilla machine-maker which has contributed to the production of products like Doritos chose Columbia as its next home because of lower taxes.

Connie Ruhe 88 matriarch of the JC Ford Company family said she told her son Scott Ruhe company president ""you ought to jump on it"" in purchasing a manufacturing facility in Maury County.

""It's about the low taxes people and schools that brought us here"" Ruhe said.

Hensley said the absence of a state income tax also allures companies.

“That is a bigger deal than most people realize” Hensley said. “They can get help from the state and counties and cities are willing to help them. We want businesses to come here.”

A buzzing manufacturing hub

Maury County has attracted 37 economic projects bringing more than 6400 jobs and $5.5 billion in capital investments since 2014.

Of those projects almost $4.3 billion has been generated in just the past 18 months following the two GM announcements in creating the luxury electric SUV the Lyriq ($2 billion) and the construction of the 2.8-million-square-foot Ultium battery facility ($2.3 billion) on Nashville Highway at the plant's site.

More:'Secret's out': How Maury County became the fastest growing county in Tennessee

In the last five years Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development has supported nearly 20 economic development projects in Maury County accounting for approximately 4000 job commitments and more than $3 billion in capital investment.

Projects have included the 2015 announcement of Landmark Ceramics’ $80 million project constructing a now fully-operational 600000-square-foot facility on 96 acres in Maury County bringing 180 new jobs.

In 2019 Mersen which works with businesses in the energy electronics transportation chemical pharmaceuticals and process industries opened an operation. The company announced it would invest up to $65 million and hire 100 local employees reawakening part of a vacant Union Carbide facility that previously employed generations of workers in Columbia.

The facility is the global manufacturer’s 10th U.S. location.

During the same time the $60.9 million dollar manufacturing facility of the Japanese auto parts maker Fuel Total Systems opened in the Cherry Glen Industrial Park in Mt. Pleasant bringing 150 new jobs to the region.

The plant remains the largest addition to the Maury County-owned industrial complex which broke ground on its first 50000-square foot facility in August of 2016.

An established workforce

Maury County Chamber and Economic Alliance President Wil Evans spends much of his time facilitating deals that bring major businesses to the region and the lucrative jobs that come with them.

“There are a lot of factors at play” Evans said. “Tennessee is a very business-friendly state. Looking over the past 10 years Nashville has really grown and come into its own and so has the greater region. We still are an affordable option in the region while also offering a high quality of life and a low tax burden.”

He said the quality of the region’s workforce has also been a major contributing factor in bringing enterprise to the region keeping them and attracting more industry giants.

“We have been very advantageous in the workforce that we have here while still being able to draw on the Nashville market as well” Evans said.

Bob Rolfe commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic Development said the recent announcement of Ford just adds to the state's booming automotive industry which will be felt across the state.

“The ripple effect resulting from these projects will be transformational for our state especially West Tennessee and we are most grateful for this enormous investment and the addition of two top global brands"" Rolfe said.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — Three little-known businesses inside a nondescript office on Carmel Road in south Charlotte collected more than $14 million in federal pandemic aid according to Small Business Administration records.

That money awarded through the SBA's Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) is supposed to provide emergency assistance for eligible venues affected by COVID-19. Record show those Charlotte businesses could use the money to support some of the country's largest country music festivals.

Federal data lists the LLCs at 6300 Carmel Road Suite 110 as BCMF CCMF and WWCF. The records show BCMF better known as Barefoot Country Music Fest in New Jersey received the maximum award of $10 million. CCMF the Carolina Country Music Fest in Myrtle Beach collected $4 million and West Virginia's Wild and Wonderful Country Fest (WWCF) qualified for $344000.

The SVOG is a federal program aimed at helping live venue operators and promoters that were in operations as of Feb. 29 2020. Those that qualified could receive grants equal to 45% of their gross earned revenue. Any money awarded by the SBA can be used to help with payroll rent utilities and more.

Joe Kuhlmann founder and co-owner of the Evening Muse can't help but wonder about the identities of the key players behind these ventures.

""It just really doesn't look like a business that's generating that kind of money"" Kuhlmann said. ""I know a lot of the movers and shakers in this town and I'm just like 'Who are you? Who are these people?'""

The Evening Muse a NoDa mainstay received a grant from the same federal program for almost $240000 according to SBA records.

""It's needed to keep the business going"" Kuhlmann said of the grant he received. ""It's like a safety net but we don't take it for granted.""

A WCNC Charlotte analysis of federal data shows the three Carmel Road businesses received the equivalent of roughly 7% of all SVOG money awarded to festivals across the country.

""That's a lot of money"" Kuhlmann said. ""That doesn't really add up to me.""

A WCNC Charlotte review shows Carolina Country Music Fest and Barefoot Country Music Fest were revived in 2021 after the pandemic shut them down in 2020. Each brought in an estimated 30000 country music fans to listen to the likes of Luke Combs Eric Church Darius Rucker Dan + Shay Zac Brown Band and Carrie Underwood. Wild and Wonderful Country Fest's website continues to promise ""2021 info coming soon.""

Festival websites show entertainment entrepreneur Bob Durkin is linked to each one.

After multiple phone calls and emails went unreturned WCNC Charlotte stopped by the festivals' office building twice and left contact information with two different women. During the most recent visit a woman said they were in the process of moving. When asked where she replied ""No.""

North Carolina Secretary of State filings show Durkin then a manager for Southern Entertainment LLC created a separate LLC CCtryMC in North Carolina in July 2019. Carolina Country Music Cruise's website shows that venture is also linked to Durkin and lists 6300 Carmel Road as its address too.

WCNC Charlotte is always asking ""where's the money?"" If you need help reach out to the Defenders team by emailing money@wcnc.com.

According to one of the festival websites Southern Entertainment ""is a full-service event and production company"" specializing in planning marketing and executing ""a wide range of concerts festivals and other live music events."" In addition to being listed as the official production company for CCMF the LLC touts its role in helping produce hundreds of events including Kissmas Gravedigger's Ball and more. State records show the registered agent for the cruise business is Charlotte attorney Tim Gavigan. Gavigan is also listed as the authorized person for the formation of BCMF CCMF WWCF and CCtryMC in Delaware within the last decade according to filings with the Delaware Secretary of State's Office. When contacted Gavigan said he would share WCNC Charlotte's information with this client.

A fourth business with 6300 Carmel Road Suite 110 listed as its address and R. Durkin listed as its registered agent received $1.1 million from the SBA's SVOG program according to federal data. Secretary of State filings list Pavilion LLC's address as 210 E. Trade Street which is the Epicentre. In that filing Durkin lists himself as the manager of ROOFNC LLC a ""nightclub.""

Records show 51 Charlotte businesses qualified for these SBA grants but Tim Stretton an oversight director for the Congressional Oversight Initiative said most will never see the government step in and check their receipts. Stretton said the SBA has pledged to audit every company that received a maximum $10 million award. Of the 51 local businesses only Barefoot Country Music Fest is among that group.

""That means the vast majority of the $9.5 billion expended in this program is not going to be audited and that's a huge red flag"" he told WCNC Charlotte. “That just opens the door for waste fraud and abuse.”

While Kuhlmann has questions he said he's mostly trying to figure out how the local music scene can build relationships with these companies.

""I'm not accusing these people of doing something wrong"" he said. ""I would just like to know.""

Kuhlmann says with that much cash flowing through Charlotte there's an opportunity for others to benefit especially in an industry still struggling to recover.

""We need to make sure that money is spent and staying here"" Kuhlmann said. ""If there are people in town that are doing that kind of festival work all of the venue operators should know these people we should be working in tandem to help lift all of these venues all the music and art that's going on.""

Paycheck Protection Program data show Pavilion LLC received a forgivable SBA loan of $151146. Meanwhile CCMF also received a PPP loan of $119500 according to the data.

Carolina Country Music Fest's website lists the festival as ""A Charlotte Jaycee Event."" The Charlotte Junior Chamber did not respond to WCNC Charlotte's request for comment.

State records show Durkin is also affiliated with Bar Management Group LLC. The company's most recent annual report filed in North Carolina listed its address as 6300 Carmel Road Suite 110.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bGVhZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL25vLTEtbWFyeS1rYXktc2FsZXMtcmVwLW5hbWVkLWNvLWxpbnMtYWx1bW5hLW9mLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 1 Mary Kay sales rep named Co-Lin's Alumna of Year - Daily Leader,"No. 1 Mary Kay sales rep named Co-Lin’s Alumna of Year Published 6:00 pm Sunday October 10 2021

LOS ANGELES - Nearly a week after a mass oil spill off the coast of US Southern California the authorities have not reached a conclusion on the amount of oil leaked from a ruptured underwater pipeline but some officials hint that it may be smaller than originally projected.

Initial estimates in the days after the spill were that at least 126000 gallons of oil had leaked into the ocean and the number was raised on Monday to potentially 144000 gallons the local ABC 7 news channel reported Friday adding officials are now saying a lower number is within the range of possibilities even though the analysis would continue.

Authorities said their current estimates range from a minimum of about 25000 gallons to a worst-case scenario of more than 131000 gallons the report said.

Capt. Rebecca Ore commander of the US Coast Guard's Los Angeles-Long Beach sector was quoted as saying that after further assessments officials determined that a minimum of about 24696 gallons or 588 barrels and a maximum of 131000 gallons or 3134 barrels of oil was released from the pipeline.

The 131000-gallon estimate was a ""maximum worst-case discharge that is a planning scenario based on a volume in a pipeline"" Ore said.

She disclosed that five federal and state agencies assessed pipeline data but those numbers had not not been confirmed.

This move appeared to confuse some experts who said the amount should be easy to calculate.

David Pettit a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council who worked on the response to the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico told ABC 7 that the amount of oil spilled into the ocean should be easily and quickly known to Amplify the company who runs the pipeline.

""If they know what the flow rate was in the pipeline and how much the pressure dropped and for how long you could calculate that in a matter of minutes"" Pettit said. ""This is money to them.""

""They know how much they lost I am certain of that"" he noted.

""Officials were unable to narrow that estimate leaving another unanswered question as the mystery surrounding how the leak occurred continues to unfold."" the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.

""We're nearly a week into this and while our cleanup and our emergency response is well underway we still don't know answers to how this happened why it happened and who is ultimately responsible"" Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY4Mzk5Ny90aGUtcm9vdHMtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1yYWNpc20tZGF0ZS1iYWNrLXRvLTE5dGgtY2VudHVyeS1yYWlscm9hZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The roots of digital racism date back to 19th-century railroads,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90683997/the-roots-of-digital-racism-date-back-to-19th-century-railroads on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDY4Mzk5Ny90aGUtcm9vdHMtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1yYWNpc20tZGF0ZS1iYWNrLXRvLTE5dGgtY2VudHVyeS1yYWlscm9hZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The headaches for Southwest which is widely credited for pioneering the low-fare airline business model began on Monday night when a problem with a weather data supplier prevented the airline from safely flying planes. The issue was resolved within hours but on Tuesday the airline suffered its own technological problems resulting in half of its flights that day being delayed and many being canceled according to FlightAware a flight tracking service.

Spillover from that episode caused Wednesday’s problems the airline said. About 10 percent of Southwest’s flights were canceled and another 19 percent were delayed by midafternoon according to FlightAware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY2FuY2Vscy1kZWxheXMtZmxpZ2h0cy1hZnRlci1waWxvdC11bmlvbi1hc2tzLXRvLWJsb2NrLXZhY2NpbmUtbWFuZGF0ZdIBeWh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbHMtZGVsYXlzLWZsaWdodHMtYWZ0ZXItcGlsb3QtdW5pb24tYXNrcy10by1ibG9jay12YWNjaW5lLW1hbmRhdGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines cancels delays flights after pilot union asks to block vaccine mandate,"Southwest Airlines' pilot union asked a court on Friday to temporarily block the airline's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

On Sunday the airline canceled over 1000 of its flights blaming cancellations and delays on bad weather and air traffic control issues.

Either way it's costing Southwest passengers big time. Customer Tracey Carrigan was returning home to Salt Lake City from Oakland California when her flight was canceled.

“I'm out the $400 for booking another flight” she explained after Southwest booking staff told her they could possibly compensate her for it but couldn’t guarantee it. Her story is similar to countless other passengers traveling this weekend.

""They had just delayed my flight an hour so I was like 'alright I will just put some earphones in and wait my hour'” Carrigan said.

RELATED:

One hour turned into many hours and ultimately a cancelled trip. She said the Southwest staff initially told everyone on board her flight that they were dealing with technical difficulties.

“They got on and said the flight was now cancelled because the pilot had to clock out and that he was over his hours. Then we had no pilot"" Carrigan explained.

Traveler Craig Griffin said he was supposed to fly back to California from Salt Lake City Saturday night.

“It’s a mess"" he said. ""I need to get back to work. I've got a lot to do down there so I'm just trying to be patient.""

Like Carrigan his original Southwest flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled.

The buzz online is that Southwest isn't dealing with weather or traffic control difficulties like the airline claims but instead employees are not showing up for work because of vaccine mandates.

“It wasn’t until the last five minutes when we were supposed to take off that all the sudden the pilot ran out of hours. But then I’m looking online while all of this is going on and I find out that the pilots are on strike” Carrigan said reflecting on her experience.

It’s something passengers loyal to the airline want to get to the bottom of.

The Federal Aviation Administration said no staffing shortages have been reported since Friday leaving the ""why"" to the situation still unclear.

""I know this is incredibly difficult for all of you and our Customers are not happy"" Alan Kasher executive vice president of daily flight operations told staff in a note on Sunday which was seen by CNBC.

The airline said initial problems on bad weather and an ""FAA-imposed air traffic management program"" were to blame.

""Although we were staffed for the weekend we could not anticipate the significant disruption that was created from unexpected ATC issues and bad weather across our Florida stations"" said Kasher.

Other airlines canceled relatively few flights. Southwest did not comment on the disparity.

The Federal Aviation Administration said there were a ""few hours"" of flight delays on Friday afternoon because of severe weather and staffing issues at Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center which controls airspace in five parts of Alabama Georgia Florida North Carolina and South Carolina.

""No FAA air traffic staffing shortages have been reported since Friday"" the FAA said. ""Some airlines continue to experience scheduling challenges due to aircraft and crews being out of place. Please contact the airlines for details about current flight schedules.""

Southwest's major destinations of Denver Baltimore Dallas Love Field and Chicago Midway were among the hardest hit by the cancellations on Sunday.

Southwest apologized to travelers for long customer service waits. The airline said in a statement it expected to get close to normal operations by Sunday but disruptions worsened.

Southwest's Kasher acknowledged to employees in his note Sunday that some crew members didn't have hotel rooms last night and said disruptions can quickly snowball as flight crews hit contractual and federal working limits.

""Right now our [network operations center] Teams are working to protect our Crew network and prevent misconnects — both for our Crews and Customers — that would cause an even greater impact"" he said. ""And Teams are working to determine the best course of action to most quickly reset our network.""

The Dallas-based airline canceled 1019 flights on Sunday 28% of its schedule after canceling 808 flights on Saturday according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. American Airlines  which operates a large hub in Miami in comparison canceled 66 mainline flights or 2% of its operation on Saturday and Fort Lauderdale Florida-based Spirit Airlines canceled 32 flights 4% of its schedule.

Staffing shortages fueled hundreds of cancellations and delays at Southwest over the summer. The airline trimmed its schedule after the summer to avoid further disruptions. Other airlines also faced a shortage of workers after encouraging thousands to take leave or buyouts at the height of the pandemic only for travel demand to return faster than expected this summer.

""Although we've made schedule adjustments leading into the fall our route system has not fully recovered — that will take time"" Kasher said. He said the airline has fewer frequencies between major airports to reroute or rebook travelers. Southwest doesn't have so-called interline agreements that large airlines like Delta and American have to book travelers on other carriers.

Southwest had 3614 flights scheduled on Sunday the most since April 2020 and down 8% from the same day in 2019 before the pandemic according to aviation consulting firm Cirium.

The airline has struggled to hire new employees in the tight labor market. Incoming CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC last month that the carrier is prepared to cut flights over spring break season if it doesn't have enough staff to support the operation.

The disparity between Southwest's operation and other airlines fueled speculation on social media that employees were calling out sick with some suggesting it was in protest of a Covid vaccine mandate. Southwest said that was not the cause of the mass flight cancellations.

""It's inaccurate"" a Southwest spokeswoman said by email. ""There's a lot of unfounded rumor and speculation circulating.""

The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association Southwest pilots' labor union said that ""we can say with confidence that our Pilots are not participating in any official or unofficial job actions.""

""Our Pilots will continue to overcome SWA management's poor planning as well as any external operational challenges and remain the most productive Pilots in the world"" it said.

Earlier on Saturday the union said that the company's announcement last week that it will join other airlines in complying with the Biden administration's requirement that federal contractors must mandate Covid vaccinations is contributing to distractions for aviators.

""Make no mistake about it – due to months of staffing issues and inefficient scheduling practices we have been operating at a higher than normal operational risk"" the union's safety committee told members in a post on Saturday.

It said reports of fatigue which require pilots not to fly are triple historic norms.

""All of these challenges have led to an added distraction in the cockpit"" it said. ""This week's COVID-19 vaccine mandate announcement by the Company only exacerbates the situation.""

On Friday the labor union asked a federal court in Dallas to temporarily block the implementation of the vaccine mandate and other Covid-19 policies arguing the company took unilateral decisions that require negotiations with the union.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLXdpbnMtcHJlbGltaW5hcnktaW5qdW5jdGlvbi1raXdpLWZsaWdodC13ZWJzaXRlLWNoZWFwLXRpY2tldHMtMjAyMS0xMNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLXdpbnMtcHJlbGltaW5hcnktaW5qdW5jdGlvbi1raXdpLWZsaWdodC13ZWJzaXRlLWNoZWFwLXRpY2tldHMtMjAyMS0xMD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest wins preliminary injunction to stop Kiwi from posting fares,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

As the days begin to get colder in Japan customers at Starbucks are now looking for warming beverages and this autumn the chain is mixing things up with a brand new offering featuring rooibos tea.

The new release was a siren call for our Starbucks-obsessed reporter K. Masami who headed out to her nearest branch as soon as the limited-edition beverage went on sale on 6 October. And when she got there she discovered there was another new “Autumn Tea” on the menu — a Hojicha & Classic Tea Latte.

Masami wasted no time in ordering the hot versions of both new drinks and as soon as she laid eyes on the Caramel Apple Rooibos Tea it was love at first sight.

The beautifully rippled surface and peachy pink hues of the drink warmed the cockles of her soul and when she lifted it to her mouth she was rewarded with the sweet scent of cinnamon.

The mellow rooibos tea was a beautiful partner for the fruity taste of apple which made itself known in the form of plump juicy pulp pieces. A good hit of cinnamon helped to add a spicy contrast while the sweet caramel sauce brought everything together creating an irresistible blend of warming soothing flavours.

▼ It was tart yet aromatic spicy yet sweet and totally delicious.

Thoroughly satisfied with the surprising flavour of the caffeine-free rooibos tea Masami moved on to try the Hojicha & Classic Tea Latte.

There were no real surprises here but that’s exactly what you want with a “classic” offering. The deep toasty flavours of hojicha roasted green tea helped to complement the black tea component while the frothed milk was embellished with mocha syrup to create a creamy warming beverage that’s just perfect for chilly autumn days.

Because hojicha is low in caffeine and rooibos is caffeine-free both these beverages can be enjoyed at any time of day even during the long autumn evenings. If you do want caffeine though and lots of it Starbucks also has you covered in that department with the eye-opening Triple Espresso Latte.

Yonhap



By Jun Ji-hye



Starbucks Korea baristas and other employees who have been protesting against the coffee chain over excessive workload have drawn a line between themselves and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) making it clear that they do not want intervention from one of the two major umbrella labor groups.



A staff member who identified himself as a leader of the protest organized by Starbucks Korea's employees wrote on the Blind app ""This is our official response. We do not want the KCTU to intervene in our protest. We do not need your help. We are not a union.""



Blind is an online community forum app that enables employees of a company or people working in the same industry to upload instant messages and communicate anonymously.



The staff member also asked the KCTU not to attempt to use Starbucks Korea employees' protest as a means to benefit itself.



Starbucks Korea employees mobilized two trucks to express their complaints over the excessive workload during their protest which took place in Seoul on Thursday and Friday.



The protesters called on the company to improve their working conditions complaining about too frequent marketing events and the lack of manpower.



The first-ever protest organized by Starbucks employees in Korea came after a recent promotional event that drew many customers to line up for hours.



After learning of Starbucks Korea employees' plan to organize their first collective action ever the KCTU issued a statement Oct. 5 saying ""We recommend that Starbucks employees form a labor union. We can support you at any time.""

Messy baby Rottweiler tries first ever Starbucks puppuccino - and it's adorable

An impossibly cute video of a Rottweiler pup trying a Starbucks Puppuccino for the first time has been melting hearts online.

Kiko the tiny Rottweiler certainly enjoyed his first taste of the doggy drink in this amusing video which shows him devouring the sweet snack.

This cute clip which comes from TikTok account @kikotherottweiler begins with the puppy being presented the creamy treat which he readily approaches and begins to work his way through.

Beautiful little Kiko isn’t afraid to get stuck in quickly lapping up the whipped cream and making a real mess of his snout in the process.

By the end of the clip the adorable Rottweiler has cream all over his mouth and nose continuing to lick at himself even after all of his Puppuccino is gone.

The video was a huge hit on the app with almost 100000 views and over 8500 likes.

Viewers fell in love with the cute puppy with one user commenting: “Sweet messy puppy face! The best!”

Another commenter wrote: “Kiko had not finished lol cute.”

A third added: “Aww absolute cutie.”

A Puppucino doesn’t contain anything harmful to dogs and is actually simply a cup of whipped cream which dogs around the world apparently adore.

The canine cuppa is available for free at Starbucks and is a much healthier alternative to letting your dog have a lick of your own caffeinated drink."

Community Columnist

Albertus Van Raalte helped organize loans but Nathan Kenyon established Holland's first bank. The year was 1856. The bank was in the parlor of Aldred Plugger’s house at 5 E. Eighth St. — where the Warm Friend/Resthaven is today.

There Kenyon operated his “exchange” bank a place where customers could cash notes drawn on other banks across the country at rates based on the financial solvency of each issuing bank. This enabled customers to better engage in interstate and intrastate banking.

More History:Henry and Anna Post ensured Holland's economic viability

Plugger who owned and operated a shipping business a flour mill a saw mill and a grocery store might have been the bank’s biggest customer.

Kenyon’s bank and Plugger’s house were destroyed by the Great Holland Fire of 1871. Kenyon then built a three-story opera house called Kenyon Hall at 194 River Ave. on the southwest corner of River Avenue and Eighth Street — where Reader's World is today.

In 1875 Kenyon lost his wife. On her tombstone he wrote: “Died Oct. 30 1875: Aged 43 years 4 months and 11 days.”

In 1877 fire destroyed Kenyon Hall. Kenyan then partnered was Jacob Van Putten. Van Putten was born in The Netherlands in 1820.

He married Maria Hilleman and together they had six children: Tannetje (Van Putten) Ver Schure Jacob J. Van Putten III (called “Black Jake” because of his hair) Adrianus Van Putten Leendert Van Putten Maria (Van Putten) Nyland and Marinus Van Putten.

Van Putten was a lumberman. He got his start when he purchased present day Waukazoo Woods from the Odawa (Ottawa) and lumbered the trees at his mill near Maple Avenue and Eighth Street.

Kenyan and Van Putten opened their bank in 1878 at 30 W. Eighth St. — where Fris Supply Shop is today. Van Putten's son Marinus said to have been blinded by too much swimming in Black Lake served as teller and became famous for his ability to tell the denomination of coins and never be mistaken.

Cornelis Ver Schure Van Putten’s son-in-law was the bank’s first cashier.

Then Kenyon sold out to Van Putten and moved to Ionia where he opened a hardware store. The bank was renamed the Holland City Bank.

In 1889 Isaac Cappon (President) John Beardslee (Vice President) Henry Kremers Gerrit Kollen J. W. Garvelink Jerome Mokma Gerrit J. Diekema and John C. Post created First State Bank.

First State Bank was located at 54 E. Eighth St. at the southeast corner of Central Avenue and Eighth Street. It was an impressive three-story structure.

In 1890 the Holland City Bank became the Holland City State Bank. Ownership was broadened to include other members of Holland's business elite — Isaac Marsilje John C. Post Isaac Cappon Cornelius Ver Schure and Gerrit J. Diekema.

Notice that Cappon Diekema Post and Verschure now had financial interests in both of Holland’s banks.

In 1892 Holland City State Bank began construction of the landmark Tower Clock building — the clock was built by John Raven a 26-year-old jeweler so “men wouldn’t be late for work.”

Jacob Van Putten died in 1894.

In 1915 First State Bank built the impressive structure at 1 W. Eighth St. on the northwest corner of Central Avenue and Eighth Street. That building still stands.

Diekema and Kollen (and TenCate) moved their law office upstairs while F.W. Woolworth moved into the first floor and Holland Business College into the second floor in the vacated building at 54 E. Eighth Street.

In 1936 during the Great Depression both the Holland City State Bank and First State Bank lost nearly one-half of their deposits and merged. The new bank was located at 1 W. Eighth St. and called the Holland State Bank.

In 1937 Ottawa County Building and Loan formed by unrecognized citizens but later controlled by Holland's banking elite moved into the Tower Clock building.

The Holland State Bank became the First National Bank in 1946 which was purchased by First of America Bank in 1973.

First of America was then acquired by National City Bank in the late 1990s. PNC Bank acquired National City in 2008. In 2017 PNC Bank vacated the First State Bank Building at 1 W. Eighth St.

The First National Bank of Michigan moved into the building 2018.

The Green Knights No. 11 in the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey Top 25 overpowered No. 3 St. Peter’s 21-14 on Saturday in the Super Football Conference.

Coach Dan Marangi handed the game ball to his offensive line after the Green Knights mashed their way to 220 of their 298 yards on the ground against a St. Peter’s defense that made them fight for every yard.

“St. Joe’s football we’re going to run the ball” Marangi said. “It set the tone for the game and we let our physicality take over.”

Junior quarterback Luke Henrich capped a 14-play 79-yard drive by tossing a 12-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver Brendan Errity for the 21-14 lead with 3:53 left in the third quarter.

St. Joseph (4-2) tied the score 7-7 in the first quarter when Henrich threw a 21-yard TD pass to sophomore Kenyon Massey.

The Green Knights took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter on their longest gain a 28-yard TD run by sophomore running back Yasin Willis.

St. Peter’s defense scored the first TD for a 7-0 lead. On the first possession of the game junior Jayden Bonsu returned an interception 28 yards for a score.

St. Peter’s (5-2) tied the score 14-14 with 2:16 left in the second quarter on a 7-yard run by senior running back Paul Lefkowitz.

What it means

St. Joseph likely will leapfrog past St. Peter’s in the next state rankings released Tuesday. It’s a big confidence booster heading into next Saturday’s matchup at top-ranked Bergen Catholic (6-0).

“Everybody still had questions about us after we beat Pope John and Montclair” Marangi said “and the jury was still out so I think it helps our confidence big-time that you can beat a program like St. Peter’s Prep.”

“I think this is big” senior Jack Smiechowski said. “It’s got our momentum up and hopefully we’ve got to keep this same energy going into our next few games because we’ve definitely got some big players.”

Key drive

St. Joseph’s 14-play 79-yard drive came on its first possession of the third quarter and illustrated its commitment to power running with a few short passes mixed in. The Green Knights did not pick up more than 12 yards on a play.

Willis (149 yards rushing) carried five times for 20 hard-earned yards. Junior running back Luke Tucci in the middle of the drive contributed 15 yards on four carries. Henrich completed all three of his passes for 33 yards his 12-yard TD pass to Errity coming on a second-and-10.

“We were moving the chains and moving the chains which is great” Marangi said.

Game ball

St. Joseph’s offensive line absolutely merited the game ball: junior left tackle Connor McAllen senior left guard Yann Silva senior center John Ohnegian senior right guard Mike Kudlacik senior right tackle Kevin Loughlin and versatile junior Jonathan Parkes.

“They are this team” said Henrich who secured the win with a 9-yard run on a third-and-8 at the 32-yard line. “They move we move. We can’t do anything. We walk on the field this is their house. They run our offense they run our team they got this win like they always do.”

By the numbers

St. Joseph's defense was outstanding and held St. Peter's to 160 yards. The Marauders' longest gain came on a 28-yard pass from junior quarterback Robert Long to sophomore Hassan Moore which helped set up their lone offensive TD.

They said it

“I’m happy with the way our kids persevered through everything. They faced it day in day out from the summer” Marangi said. “First drive we throw an interception for a touchdown so before we know it we’re down 7-0 but the way we battled back with energy is just awesome.”

One person died and at least 14 others were injured after gunfire broke out early Sunday in a bar along West Seventh Street in St. Paul leaving what authorities described as a ""hellish"" scene with victims inside the building and out on the street.

The St. Paul Police Department reported just before noon Sunday that three men — ages 29 32 and 33 — had been arrested in connection with the shooting and were among those being treated for injuries.

St. Paul police spokesperson Steve Linders said earlier Sunday that officers encountered a chaotic scene just after midnight when they arrived at the Seventh Street Truck Park bar and food hall just west of the Xcel Energy Center.

“There were gunshot wound victims lying in the street outside the bar there were gunshot wound victims lying on the sidewalk outside the bar and there were gunshot wound victims lying on the floor inside the bar” he said during a news conference several hours after the shooting.

A woman in her 20s died at the scene Linders said.

""One minute she's having a good time the next minute she's lying in her friends' arms who are trying to save her life. And she didn't make it. I can't think of anything worse” he said.

Fourteen people were transported to area hospitals and are expected to survive their injuries Linders said. That includes the three suspects arrested later Sunday.

“They're in custody and in the hospital being treated for injuries suffered during the incident” police reported at midday Sunday. “Once they're discharged all three will be booked into the Ramsey (County) Jail and await a charging decision.”

There were so many people hurt by the gunfire Linders said that more than a half-dozen of them had to be taken to Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis in addition to the victims taken to hospitals in St. Paul. Linders said other agencies — including Metro Transit police the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office and Maplewood police — handled some 911 calls in the city because so many St. Paul officers had to respond to the shooting.

The name of the woman who died has not been released.

“This is nothing short of a tragedy” Linders said. “We had people in the city of St. Paul out on a Saturday night having a good time. And we had other people who decided to pull guns with reckless disregard for human life and pull the trigger over and over and over and over again. And it ended in tragedy. Our hearts break for the young woman who died and for her loved ones. And for everybody who was in that bar.”

In the aftermath of the shooting police investigators could be seen standing at the doorway of the Seventh Street Truck Park and apparently examining vehicles outside for bullet damage or other evidence. At least one vehicle was towed from in front of the business.

Police officers were posted outside the emergency department entrances at both Regions and United hospitals with multiple police vehicles lined up at the sidewalks outside of each facility.

Speaking later in the day St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter thanked those who helped the victims of the shooting and he lauded the quick work by police.

""We are of course heartened to see arrests made in the case. But we know our entire city is going to be listening closely as we demand many many more answers for what occurred last night for the heartbreak and trauma that played out across our community.""

Carter said the city had recently dedicated $1 million in federal money to police overtime — with a focus on the West Seventh area. But he said an increase in gun violence requires wider-ranging solutions including community-based responders and intervenors.

""We know that we have more work to do. We know that our officers cannot do it alone"" he said. ""I'm blessed to live in and serve a city where people look out for one another we have to continue to do that work on the street level on the neighborhood level ensuring that if you see something say something.""

Response from city and state leaders

St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell posted on Twitter that ""hearts are broken — victims families community and officers. I spoke with the homicide victim’s family this morning and they are absolutely devastated. I am incredibly proud of the exhausted women and men of the SPPD. We WILL bring justice to the victims.""

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum also issued a statement Sunday writing that ""the epidemic of gun violence plaguing the Twin Cities has hit us in St. Paul with a mass shooting event that can only be described as a horror. I know our St. Paul community will come together to support the victims and their families during this time of pain and grief. My prayers are with the victims. I also want to pledge my full support to the St. Paul Police and all our law enforcement officials as they pursue the perpetrators of this horrendous crime. I am committed to keeping St. Paul safe and that means working with all community leaders to get guns off our streets and out of the hands of criminals. We must never allow this kind of criminal act to happen again.”

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted that ""what happened last night in St. Paul was an appalling tragedy. A life lost and 14 people injured because of senseless gun violence. Our hearts are with the family and friends of the victims and the St. Paul community. This must be a call to action.""

And Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted: “Horrific. Minnesota is keeping in our hearts the family of the young woman killed and the 14 others injured and the St. Paul neighborhood reeling from this senseless gun violence. We’re working in close coordination with local law enforcement as they apprehend those responsible.”"

WMed students responded to 12 medical emergencies at Waldo Stadium on Oct. 9.

“With large gatherings of people really anything is possible” said Jared Spallina first year medical student at WMed.

Spallina is on-track to become a doctor. He said he is two months into medical school.

“It’s nice to really get the ball rolling and dealing with patients right off the bat” he said.



COVID-19 Vaccine:

Spallina an experienced EMT worked for Kalamazoo’s Life EMS and knew first-hand the impact his contribution is having on strained area paramedics.

“It really takes the burden off the 911 system in terms of staffing and call volume” said Spallina.

Samantha Mazurek also a first-year medical student said communicating quickly and effectively and working in teams is key.

“We can rely on each other in case you’re missing something you can’t do it alone” said Mazurek.

Students were trained to respond to minor injuries and life-threatening emergencies. Also alcohol intoxication cases heat strokes people falling or getting cut on broken glass.

It’s all as part of an initiative with Life EMS WMed and WMU.

“By being able to augment with our medical students we can keep more paramedics and EMTs out on the streets and still provide a high level of care to the people here” said William Fales professor of emergency medicine at WMed.

Six students were spread out and worked in teams of two.

“It’s an opportunity for students to really work at a level where they can be pretty independent as medical first responders” said Fales.

Students said it’s also a chance to strengthen their training and help the community.

“I can can actually serve my community right now from the get go instead of having to wait years before I actually have those patient experiences” said Mazurek.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcnRjbGludG9ubmV3c2hlcmFsZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzA5L2FyZXMtaW5jLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtNTAteWVhcnMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi13ZWFwb25zLXRlY2gvNjAzMjQ2MjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ARES Inc. celebrates 50 years of weapons tech innovation,"PORT CLINTON — ARES Inc. a company started in the home garage of a renowned firearms engineer is celebrating its 50th anniversary of creating innovative weaponry.

Headquartered at Lake Erie Business Park along Ohio 2 just west of Port Clinton ARES Inc. has been designing testing and manufacturing cutting-edge weapon systems here since its founding in 1971.

Eugene Stoner the original designer of what would develop into one of the most emblematic firearms ever created the M16 rifle started the company in his garage on Catawba Island along with ARES co-founder Robert Bihun.

The M16 as well as other closely related models such as the M4 and civilian AR-15 are among the most recognizable and widely used rifle design concepts in the world today.

Stoner and Bihun launched the company following the closure of another company TRW Ordnance Development Center in 1970.

As ARES quickly outgrew Stoner’s garage they moved the company into the same buildings previously used by TRW and hired many of their former employees.

Eventually Stoner and Bihun sold the company to Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation in 1987. Within three years Chamberlain announced plans to close ARES but would stay open with a skeleton crew to finish contracts.

In 1993 management at ARES ultimately bought the company back from Chamberlain Manufacturing and they still own the Port Clinton company today.

“It’s incredible that a small company like ARES in northwest Ohio has been able to remain such an important player in the military defense market for all these years” said Ann Yamrick vice president of ARES.

While some may have not heard the name ARES Inc. before if they have lived in the area for any significant amount of time they would likely have heard the company working.

As part of its engineering process ARES tests its weapon system designs at its strategically located facility that allows it to fire what are often massive rounds into specially designated areas of Lake Erie.

One of the company’s “proudest and greatest achievements” is having designed the autoloader and recoil mechanism for the U.S. Army Stryker 105mm Mobile Gun System which was deployed overseas during Operation Iraqi Freedom according to Yamrick.

The incredibly loud “bang” reaches ears even miles away when the Stryker 105mm MGS is fired.

ARES is also very proud to have produced hundreds of the recoil mechanisms for the U.S. military and still remains the sole source provider for its refurbishment and upgrade services Yamrick said.

Yamrick added telescoped ammunition electromagnetic guns and experimental barrel manufacturing as other areas of weapons technology where ARES has been innovating over the years.

With around 50 working at its Port Clinton facility the weapon systems manufacturer is also a major employer for the area.

But as of recently like so many other employers nationwide ARES has been feeling the impact of the labor shortage and is looking to hire skilled-trades machinists technicians and a business development manager.

“We offer good benefits really interesting work and a great place to have a career” Yamrick said.

The System delivers 360-degree rotational delivery for the whole body and CT-based daily IGRT treatment with Iterative reconstruction.

In a virtual training for medical and journalists across the globe the combined technologies enable the delivery of radiation using a variety of methods from image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to treat almost any tumor including those that move with breathing precision accuracy and unprecedented flexibility.

Dr. Vadhiraja B M Head of Department and a Consultant Radiotherapy Manipal Hospitals said: “Manipal Hospitals has always emphasized on providing the patients with the best universally available treatment and care. The synchrony technology is expected to revolutionise cancer treatment by significantly lowering the discomfort undergone by cancer patients.

Synchrony for the Radixact System will provide clinicians with the technology they need to effectively and efficiently treat cancer patients requiring radiation therapy in whom the tumor moves while breathing.”

He said the Radiation Oncology team at Manipal hospitals have treated the first patient in India using Accuray’s Radixact System with Synchrony motion tracking and correction technology. The patient is a 51-year-old lady with a single metastatic lung tumour from renal cell carcinoma.

Dr Vadhiraja mentioned that the synchrony technology on Radixact 9 system was able to track the tumour in the lung in real-time which moves with the patient’s natural breathing and automatically adjusts the radiation beam precisely targeting the moving tumor.

“This technology helps in minimising the extra margin given around the tumour thereby reducing the radiation dose to the surrounding normal lung and finally delivering the highest tolerated dose required to destroy the cancer cells” he added.

Some of the advantatges of synchrony technology on Radixact 9 Dr Vadhiraja mentioned it tracked and treated the tumours moving with respiration like cancer in lung (primary or metastatic) liver pancreas prostate.

It also reduces the overall treatment time compared to the current radiation treatment technologies available for treating cancers that move with breathing as well as provides comfort and convenience of natural breathing by the patient while the cancer that moves with breathing is treated with radiation.

Mrs Linda Asante-Agyei Vice-President  Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) commended Manipal Hospitals for their continuous education on journalists around the world on health and medical issues which she said will build on the knowledge base of the journalists and enrich their reportage.

“I want to express my sincere gratitude to Manipal Hospitals for adopting the latest Radixact System technology to ensure precise treatment of cancer patients. This technology will be used to drive innovation and improve the lives of the patients.

Radixact System technology is the first of its kind in India and it will give patients and their families hope when combined with the talent and clinical expertise of doctors at Manipal Hospitals.”

She appealed to Manipal Hospitals to partner with other health facilities in Africa to have such a facility to save the lives of patients on the Continent.",,,,,,,,,

T-Mobile 5G is rolling out now across the US and is taking advantage of different versions of 5G technology to help it improve coverage and capacity.

Similar to AT&T T-Mobile has also rolled out a lot of low-band 5G which isn't great for speeds. That so-called 5G Extended Range network was started in 2019 and is essentially 4G with a few enhancements to make it quicker. T-Mobile rightly calls it a ""foundational layer of its 5G network"" and while that's true it's not really full 5G.

It does have the benefit of huge coverage though cover more than 200 million people and more than 1 million square miles across the US - over 8000 cities.

One thing's for sure - T-Mobile is gaining customers at some speed. Figures from the fourth quarter of 2019 point towards a million 'postpaid' customers; people who pay a monthly bill. 77000 pay-as-you-go or prepaid customers were also added over the period.

T-Mobile remains the third biggest network in the US despite it having absorbed the Sprint network in a protracted deal that closed during early 2020. After the acquisition it has just over 100 million subscribers across the US.

According to the network it has added 53 million users since 2013. Not surprising when you have had 27 successive quarters with over a million new users added.

Among the 5G test projects that T-Mobile has carried out the network has been using 5G-embedded cameras to virtually put fans on the baseball field in order to catch the action from the players’ point of view and go behind the scenes. They're mounted on players hats and catchers masks - T-Mobile says this is the first time that 5G embeddable cameras have been integrated into a professional sports league event. Each camera features a real-time HD stream.

T-Mobile has also worked with Major League Baseball to create an augmented reality app for fans with bonus stat views for T-Mobile 5G customers.

In a measure of how T-Mobile sees itself CEO Mike Sievert will deliver the keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2022.

Gary Shapiro president and CEO CTA: ""The pace of innovation has accelerated over the last 18 months and the rapid roll-out of 5G will only increase the momentum. There’s so much excitement in this space and for the first time we welcome Mike Sievert to our keynote stage to share more about T-Mobile’s vision for fuelling 5G innovation.""



Speed and reliability

In May 2021 RootMetrics released its first-ever 5G Scorecard which shows the race between the US’s 5G networks. Although AT&T was best for Everyday 5G download speeds T-Mobile offers the broadest Everyday 5G availability of any carrier according to the tests. RootMetrics tested the 125 most populated metropolitan markets in the US.

T-Mobile holds a significant lead in the race for Everyday 5G availability according to RootMetrics recording the highest Everyday 5G availability in 44 out of 65 total cities tested to date.

T-Mobile was also recently been hailed as the most reliable 5G network in the US according to consultancy Umlaut. The network had the best overall score of the US networks with an overall 707 points out of a maximum of 1000. The tests were carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.

In a clear ranking of how the network rollout is panning out Verizon scored second overall with 632 points with AT&T bringing up the rear with 599 points.

In terms of reliability T-Mobile also achieved the highest score with 664 out of a maximum of 800 points. In contrast Verizon ranked second with 560 points and again AT&T was third with 520 points.

""umlaut’s report is just the latest to prove customers and businesses alike can count on T-Mobile 5G to deliver a fast and reliable 5G connection in more places than anyone else"" said T-Mobile's Neville Ray.

""While the other networks play catch up we’ll keep adding more 5G coverage and capacity to bring a transformative experience to customers across the country.""

Ookla also recently rated the network as the fastest 5G network in the US. The testing - carried out during the first quarter of 2021 - saw the network clock 82.35Mbps download speeds followed by AT&T at 76.6Mbps and Verizon with 67.24Mbps. Ookla’s study also found that T-Mobile customers spent more time connected to a 5G network than customers on rival 5G networks.

T-Mobile 5G cities

The 5G Extended Range network covers 8300 US towns and cities. It is still be able to get to speeds of around 450Mbps if conditions are at their best although expect significantly slower speeds than that generally. Essentially it is like a quicker form of 4G LTE.

T-Mobile's Ultra Capacity network is different. It's a millimeter wave (mmWave) network similar to that which we've seen from the other US providers - but not providers in Europe. It provides the fastest speeds but has poor range. T-Mobile says it is upgrading 1000 cell towers a month for this covering 100 million Americans. However it is really only in some areas of the very largest cities at present.

T-Mobile 5G phones

T-Mobile originally offered the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and the OnePlus 5G before launching the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren on an exclusive in the US.

Like most other networks offering 5G globally T-Mobile has now added the Samsung Galaxy S20 S21 and iPhone 12 to its roster in 2020/21.

Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini

The whole iPhone 12 range comes with the latest A14 Bionic platform so there's no performance limitation for going for one of these 6.1-inch or 5.4-inch handsets (the Pro has more RAM though). Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are available in Black White Red Green Blue.

The standard iPhone 12 is our pick of the iPhone 12 range.

Apple iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max

The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the same-sized iPhone 12.

However the Pro Max certainly does with its huge 6.7-inch display and sheer desirability. The cameras are among the best we've seen especially in low light. It's eye-wateringly expensive though.

Google Pixel 4a 5G

Today's best Google Pixel 4a 5G deals $279.99 View

While Google's best 5G phone is the Pixel 5 (not currently available on T-Mobile) the Pixel 4a 5G is certainly much more affordable. Not to be confused with the standard Pixel 4a the 5G version is based around the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset and features a large 6.2-inch OLED display. There's a dual-camera setup with 12.2 megapixel wide and 16 megapixel ultrawide camera sensors and you'll get 128GB of storage and 6GB of memory too. And naturally being a Google phone you're guaranteed of the latest Android updates.

Samsung Galaxy S21 5G

Samsung's latest S Series phone is a hugely impressive 6.2-inch handset. It may longer be the only tech king in town but it's still using bran new tech inside with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 platform at its core. We like the triple cameras which are much better - particularly with low light - than earlier models. It also has decent battery life too.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra

At over half an inch bigger than the standard model the 6.8-inch S21 Ultra is a luxury phone. The camera system just about makes it worth it if you want the best with a five-camera setup that includes a 10x optical zoom. Like the standard S21 it runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. There's even support for the S Pen stylus too should you want that.

Samsung Galaxy S20 5G

Today's best Samsung Galaxy S20 5G deals $1385 View

Capable of 8K video recording and with a large 6.2-inch AMOLED display the standard S20 is no slouch powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 platform for the US market. Like the others in the range it has super-fast charging too.

Available in cloud pink cloud blue and cosmic grey it's only around in a 128GB version only.

There's a triple camera (not quad like the other S20s) and it has a 64 megapixel main sensor. It's also got a 30x digital zoom too.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S20+

The 6.7-inch S20+ is available in three colours - cloud blue cosmic black and cosmic grey - and adds an extra storage size to the standard S20 in the form of 512GB in addition to 128GB.

Again it offers a 64 megapixel telephoto lens and 12MP ultra-wide camera setup but the S20+ (and Ultra) offer quad-camera arrangements.

The price premium for the S20+ is not extensive over the standard S20 and as such is worth considering.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra

Slightly bigger - by 0.2-inches than the S20+ - the S20 Ultra clocks in at 6.9-inches and features an upgraded camera.

Storage capacities are the same as the S20+ at 128 and 512GB. However the Ultra is only available in cosmic black or cosmic grey.

So what's better about the camera? Firstly there's the zoom - the S20 Ultra is capable of 100x (rather than 30x) while there's an extremely large 108 megapixel camera sensor to go alongside a 48 megapixel telephoto lens.

You won't find the 100x zoom that practical but using it is fun.

T-Mobile 5G coverage

For its 5G Ultra Capacity network T-Mobile is using 28 Ghz mmWave (millimetre wave) just as Verizon is. That means excellent download speeds but a more difficult blanket rollout. That's because the shorter wavelength signals don't travel so far and are easily blocked in urban areas or by external walls - so you need loads of 5G nodes.

You only need to look at T-Mobile's current coverage maps to show the issues around mmWave deployment - it's extremely patchy.

So as we mentioned T-Mobile has also opted to use low-band 600Mhz spectrum. The low-band spectrum can also carry 5G signals inside.

Before the T-Mobile launch of low-band 5G Sprint was leading the way with low-band and it's one of the reasons that Sprint and T-Mobile felt they would be a good fit by merging which they duly did.

T-Mobile 5G deals

In terms of SIM-only T-Mobile 5G offers service plans at $15 for 2GB (not enough in our opinion) and $25 for 5GB. The plans also offer 100GB of free monthly home internet to 10 million American families. And if that wasn’t enough the company also gives free wireless service to every first responder in America.

Currently Samsung Galaxy S20 5G is available on T-Mobile from $31.25 a month on a 24-month deal providing you put $349.99 down plus tax. You can also buy it outright from the network for $1099.

Magenta Max is a new plan specifically made for a 5G world - it won't slow down based on how much data you use. T-Mobile says that nearly 50% of Magenta MAX customers use a 5G smartphone and they use noticably more data – 43% more music 48% more video and 26% more social media.

The network says that ""on average these customers on average have each listened to the equivalent of 360 more songs watched 576 more minutes of video and made 1512 more posts on social media than our other customers.""

T-Mobile 5G business and home internet

T-Mobile Business has announced three new plans as of early 2021. The three plans are: ‘Enterprise Unlimited’ plans a set of business mobile tariffs to offer 5G with “unprecedented value”; ‘Home Office Internet’ providing a dedicated connection for business use; and ‘Collaborate’ which is a suite of mobile-first cloud-based apps.

""Today we’re unveiling a comprehensive set of T-Mobile for Business solution unlocked by our 5G network to solve real problems and empower business to do business whenever and wherever they need to and we’re calling it T-Mobile WFX and it includes three key solutions to help businesses work from anywhere says T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert.

T-Mobile Home Office Internet covers more than 60 million households at launch close to half of all homes in America with plans to cover more than 90 million households by 2025. And T-Mobile’s new Collaborate service will be available as part of ‘Enterprise Unlimited’ or on a standalone basis.

Pricing for T-Mobile Home Office Internet starts at $90 per line per month and Enterprise Unlimited with T-Mobile Collaborate together start at $37 per line per month; with T-Mobile available as a standalone product from $12 per month.

T-Mobile's Home Internet covers 30 million homes at present for $60 a month. ""I’m proud to announce that we're launching T-Mobile Home Internet"" said Mike Sievert T-Mobile CEO at the launch of the service in April 2021.

""More than 30 million homes are now eligible. That's almost one in five American households available today. And that makes T-Mobile one of America's largest ISPs by service area - Verizon says they won't even reach that many homes in their fixed 5G wireless for nearly two more years.”

T-Mobile 5G for business

Like the other big US networks T-Mobile sees big opportunities for businesses willing to invest in 5G especially around the internet of things and remote connectivity.

In May 2021 T-Mobile for Business announced new small business rate plans and fixed wireless internet for small businesses. These plans feature unlimited talk text and data plus high-speed mobile hotspot data with every plan more Premium Data and an option for unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi. Some plans also include Microsoft 365 subscriptions too.

Like other networks T-Mobile has its fair share of test bed tech. The latest is a driverless car service in Las Vegas powered by T-Mobile 5G. Yep no driver - Halo began driving on Las Vegas public highways earlier this year - you simply summon a vehicle using a mobile the app.

The car picks you up drops you off and carries on to its next destination. However while it is driverless it is not fully autonomous; the vehicles use proprietary RemotePilot tech where drivers remotely operate the vehicle over the 5G network. The car will come to a safe stop if a hazard is detected while the vehicles are learning using AI in order to work towards eventual Level 3 autonomy.

According to an early 2021 report by Accenture the pandemic has changed the way people work and socialize with 79% of respondents wanting to work from a “third space” – a location other than their home or workplace.

T-Mobile also collaborates with universities and standards bodies to support 5G technology research and development operating the T-Mobile Accelerator T-Mobile Ventures investment fund. It's also a co-founder of the 5G Open Innovation Lab.

Meanwhile 87% of enterprises expect their employees to work from home three or more days per week - tomorrow's office is pretty much anywhere.

Many high-growth tech stocks doubled in value in 2020. That's not normal. It usually takes a bit more time for a stock to rise that much even for an especially fast-growing business with an in-demand product or service. 2021 has been a different story. Many of these outperforming stocks of 2020 have taken a breather some of them even declining by double-digit percentages.

Nevertheless that doesn't mean growth investing is dead. On the contrary many of them still offer compelling reasons to invest today. Three that could double over the next four years or so are Skyworks Solutions (SWKS -0.05%) Micron Technology (MU 2.91%) and T-Mobile US (TMUS -0.29%). Here's how three Fool.com contributors think it could play out.

An ever expanding need for high-quality mobile connectivity

Nicholas Rossolillo (Skyworks Solutions): The last couple of years have been busy ones for mobile connectivity chip designer Skyworks Solutions. The initial 5G mobile network rollout from telecoms translated into booming sales of new smartphones with a 5G connection-enabling chip in them. Sales at Skyworks are fast on the rise as a result up 41% over the last two-year stretch -- impressive considering sales briefly hit the skids last spring.

5G phones will no doubt continue to provide some upward momentum for Skyworks in the next three years as more of the next-gen mobile network becomes available to the masses. But Skyworks is much more than a smartphone component supplier. It also plays a hand in the design of infrastructure equipment used to build telecommunications systems as well as the design of other devices that contain connectivity semiconductors: things like smart home devices audio equipment internet modems and routers fitness equipment and security systems.

The market for chips for products outside of smartphones -- which Skyworks calls its ""broad markets"" business -- has been steadily growing for years and makes up about one-third of revenue. But it will get a big boost in this department from the acquisition of Silicon Laboratories' (SLAB -2.63%) automotive and network infrastructure segment. The acquisition will add about $400 million a year in sales at the most recent annualized run rate and yield Skyworks exposure to some massive new markets specifically the growing connected and electric auto movement.

With its own core business still growing at a fast double-digit percentage clip adding a new breed of chip designs into the mix should help Skyworks sustain its momentum. Granted as is the case with semiconductor stocks I don't expect this advance to move up in a straight line. Chip industry sales are cyclical and can ebb and flow from year to year. But over the next few years 5G will continue to proliferate and dozens of more technologically advanced vehicle models will hit the road. I see plenty of room for this chip company to grow -- it could be double the size it is now in another four years' time.

Micron shares trade at an oversize discount today

Anders Bylund (Micron Technology): Memory chip maker Micron Technology has seen some hard times lately. Let me clarify that. Micron's stock is in dire straits at the moment. The business is as healthy as ever.

Micron generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow and $12.6 billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the last four quarters. These generous profits were generated from $27.7 billion of top-line revenue. All of these important metrics have surged higher in the last two years:

Micron set many operating records in the recently completed fiscal year 2021. Mobile memory sales reached new highs. Automotive and industrial memory chips also topped their old record sales by significant margins. Even the consumer-facing business landed record sales this year.

All of these records were achieved in the midst of a sector-wide manufacturing crisis. Micron runs its own chip-making plants which helps the company dodge the logjam in the leading contract manufacturing specialists' production pipelines. Production technology upgrades are generally on time and within Micron's generous infrastructure budgets.

So Micron's operations are humming right along while most of the semiconductor industry suffers production-level restrictions. Market makers must be impressed right?

Well no. Micron's stock has retreated nearly 30% from April's multi-year highs and trades at a mere 7.9 times forward earnings. In other words Micron's shares are hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin despite the company's impressive business results. The company will set the record straight over time and I will be amazed if share prices haven't at least doubled from this rock-bottom level in the next three years.

This 5G leader should have little trouble doubling in the years ahead

Billy Duberstein (T-Mobile): When you think of large telecom stocks you don't normally think of big-time gains. Yet that's exactly what investors should see if T-Mobile hits its long-term financial targets as a result of its leadership in 5G.

T-Mobile's stock has fallen recently following an unfortunate data breach and the stock is currently down about 16.5% from recent highs. But as the news around the data breach falls further into the past it sets T-Mobile stock up to potentially double in the next four years.

In fact it wouldn't even take a herculean effort for the stock to double by 2025. At its March analyst day management raised its long-term forecasts having grown even more bullish on both revenue and cost synergies stemming from the 2020 acquisition of Sprint.

That integration takes some upfront investment so T-Mobile's profits and free cash flow are muted at the moment; however management now sees $13 billion to $14 billion in free cash flow by 2023 to 2024 and over $18 billion in free cash flow by 2026.

Assuming $18 billion in free cash flow -- the low end of T-Mobile's target -- and just a 15 P/E ratio in 2025 one could see T-Mobile trading at a market cap of $270 billion up about 75% from today's share price. However T-Mobile also plans to return $60 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases by 2025. That's nearly 40% of T-Mobile's market capitalization today.

Of course T-Mobile's share price will likely go up as repurchases are made and the share count declines; however even if T-Mobile retires only 20% of its shares outstanding compounded with a 75% increase in market cap its share price would appreciate about 118%.

Skeptics would point out that T-Mobile's rivals Verizon Communications and AT&T have forward P/E ratios of just 10 and 8.5 respectively. However those bargain-basement valuations could reflect the fact that T-Mobile has taken the lead in 5G capabilities and appears set to gain market share from each in the years ahead. Both Verizon and AT&T also pay out dividends instead of repurchasing stock and both companies also have more sizable debt loads by comparison.

With the overall market's forward P/E multiple around 21.5 today it's not unreasonable to use 15 for an industry leader like T-Mobile. And given that T-Mobile has a history of beating its own forecasts a doubling in its share price by 2025 is not only possible but I think likely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9kb250LWltcG9ydC1waG9uZXMtdG8tdGhlLXVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What you need to know before you import a phone to the U.S.,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9kb250LWltcG9ydC1waG9uZXMtdG8tdGhlLXVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1c2NhbG9vc2FuZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMTAvMTAvdHlzb24tZnVyeS1kZW9udGF5LXdpbGRlci1paWktZmlnaHQtcGhvdG9zLzYwNzgyMjgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder III fight in photos,"SPORTS

Stephen William Boesel Jr.

Sarasota - Stephen William Boesel Jr. of Sarasota Florida passed peacefully at home on September 23 2021 after a very brief illness.

Born in Niles Ohio he was preceded in death by his parents Dr. Stephen Boesel and Sarah Wallace Boesel sister Susan Boesel King and first wife Jacquelyn Fynes Boesel.

He is survived by his wife Sherry (Tillett); two daughters Sally Wilson (Jeff) Stephanie Kintgen (Dave) grandchildren Isabelle Penelope Katherine & Colin; step-daughter Ashleigh Brodsky step-son Matthew Tillett; niece Jennifer Palmer and nephew John King.

Steve majored in economics at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea OH graduating in 1968. He then served in combat as an artillery sergeant in the Vietnam War from 1968-1970 earning an Army Commendation Air Medal and Bronze Star. After his Army career Steve earned his MBA at the University of Colorado. Steve began his successful investment career at National City Bank in Cleveland Ohio. In 1973 Steve accepted a job at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore where he worked as a Portfolio Manager for 33 years. He managed many private accounts as well as becoming president and chairman of the investment committees for T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund. He also served on the board of the T. Rowe Price Foundation.

In 2012 he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Baldwin Wallace University. Throughout his life he was active in the Baltimore community through the Maryland Institute College of Art and Community Concerts at Second Presbyterian Church. He also served in many capacities at his alma mater Baldwin Wallace in Berea OH including as a member of the Board of Trustees chair of the university investment committee and generous benefactor. Steve's philanthropic contributions supported many organizations and institutions.

A private military interment will take place at the Sarasota National Cemetery. There will be a memorial service at Second Presbyterian Church on Sunday November 14th at 3 p.m. The address is 4200 St. Paul St. Baltimore MD 21218. A reception will immediately follow at L'Hirondelle Club.

It was September 2019. His secret weapon tucked deep into a chart-heavy presentation was a bug-eyed cargo truck built by a startup few people had heard of.

“I am incredibly excited to announce that we have just placed an order for 100000 electric delivery vans” Bezos then chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc. told the stunned crowd. ""They will be built by a company called Rivian.”

Amazon would be carbon neutral by 2040 he pledged — a game-changing moment for Bezos and the millions of Prime customers. But this was an even more defining moment for Rivian. The order immediately separated the auto rookie from the parade of promising electric startups providing backing a big book of business and legitimacy. It also would soon start to draw in additional investment from major players including Ford T. Rowe Price D1 Capital Partners and Fidelity.

For Rivian’s founder R.J. Scaringe the Bezos endorsement opened doors that were inaccessible to his rival Elon Musk in the early days of Tesla. While most of Rivian’s marketing focuses on its sleek and powerful consumer models — and Scaringe's vision for creating the Patagonia of pickups — the company is driven by the business Amazon is providing. Without it say people familiar with the company's financials there would be no hope of the $80 billion valuation Rivian is aiming for in its upcoming initial public offering.

Amazon's primacy as a customer is underscored now as production gets underway at Rivian's Illinois factory. Scaringe has prioritized building hundreds of delivery vans this year while production of the highly anticipated new electric pickup runs at a trickle according to people familiar with the plan.

On Friday Rivian shared new details of the Amazon deal in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealing how closely its fate is tied to one of its biggest benefactors. The e-commerce giant will have exclusive rights to Rivian’s delivery vehicles for four years after receiving its first one and it gets right of first refusal to buy the vans for two years after that.

Rivian’s official debut came about a year before the Bezos announcement at the 2018 Los Angeles auto show. Scaringe a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ph.D. used the annual event to formally unveil his company which had been operating in stealth mode until then. He’d been working on a premium electric pickup and an SUV.

Rihanna was among the guests at the launch party the night before the event. The singer posed for pictures with Scaringe in front of the sleek pickup offering a thumbs up. She was there with her then-boyfriend Hassan Jameel whose family conglomerate Abdul Latif Jameel had already invested millions in the startup.

In a 22-minute pitch at the car show Scaringe explained that every detail of the R1T pickup and its close SUV cousin the R1S was developed in-house: the headlamps storage battery management system and quad motor system. The trucks would be built at the company’s recently acquired factory in Normal Illinois. A team outside of Detroit was refining the engineering. And in Irvine California workers were designing the core battery and propulsion technology.

Scaringe it turns out was steering his venture into an entirely empty slot in the industry’s fastest lane. Americans were rapidly ditching their sensible sedans and indulging in the bigger is better ethos. As gasoline prices plummeted SUVs became the modern family wagon and pickups were snapped up by suburban cowboys whose heaviest load was hauling mulch for the garden. By 2015 trucks and SUVs were outselling traditional cars in the U.S. Today they account for three-quarters of the market prompting automakers like Ford to get out of the sedan business entirely.

“When Rivian showcased its electric trucks and SUVs it gave the EV market hope in the sense that electric vehicles could evolve to meet more mainstream preferences” says Jessica Caldwell executive director of insights at auto-market researcher Edmunds.

Rivian started to take pre-orders for the consumer vehicles at the L.A. show. Potential customers have put down a refundable $1000 deposit to buy 48390 R1T and R1S models. By comparison Ford already has surpassed 150000 non-binding reservations for its F-150 Lightning.

The most-hyped Rivian consumer today is Bezos who has never said publicly how the startup landed on his radar. There are several connections between the two companies that offer some clues. In mid-2018 Rivian worked with a production company owned by director Peter Berg who knows Bezos to film material that would later be used at Rivian’s L.A. auto show reveal people familiar with the matter said. Some of the impressive aerial photography was shot by Black Ops Aviation a company owned by Bezos’ now-girlfriend Lauren Sanchez the people said. Through the companies’ interactions with Rivian word eventually got back to Bezos about a startup with an intriguing electric truck that was worth a look.

Due diligence by Amazon followed and in the late fall of 2018 Bezos flew to Rivian’s engineering facility in Plymouth Michigan and met with Scaringe. The Rivian founder presented a detailed document: his vision for an electric future. Throughout Amazon’s search for an electrified fleet a particular sticking point was just how expensive it would prove to mass-produce the electric vans according to a person familiar with the matter. Until that point Bezos and Amazon had found no company that could build a battery-powered van at scale. Now he had.

“We weren’t super excited about the products that were available” Ross Rachey Amazon’s director of fleet and product said in an interview in August 2020. “It was a combination of established manufacturers who were maybe a year or two farther out than we wanted. And it was a host of startups some compelling some non-compelling.”

In February 2019 Amazon led a $440 million investment round in Rivian just days before it stood up a target of reaching net zero carbon for half of all shipments by 2030. Six months later Bezos was in Washington with more big green goals: a plan to get all of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to become entirely carbon neutral by 2040. While Amazon Rivian and Berg declined to comment for this story after it was published Bezos tweeted that the EV maker's team has a lot to prove but is ``world class.'' The billionaire praised Scaringe as ``one of the greatest entrepreneurs I've ever met'' and quipped: ""Now RJ where are our vans?""

Black Ops Aviation did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comment.

Scaringe had built two lines of business: one reliant on a just-in-time delivery empire and the other on environmentally conscious consumers. The vans for Amazon would deliver steady revenue while the SUVs and trucks try to keep their momentum in a fickle retail market far more sensitive to economic conditions.

There’s a clear recognition inside Rivian and with its investors that the van for Amazon is a priority and the pickup a sideshow until production can be ramped up to meaningful volumes. The deal gives Rivian visibility and guaranteed revenue along with a deadline. An all-hands-on-deck edict has been issued to get the project up to speed — for now the R1T is taking a back seat.

Rivian’s most immediate goal is to deliver 300 vans to Amazon by year-end according to people familiar with the deal. The first 10000 units are due by the end of 2022. The full order of 100000 vans is due by the end of the decade. The vans in different configurations are principally for last-mile delivery. Each will have a range of up to 150 miles on a charge.

Over the summer Scaringe fast-tracked testing on the R1T pickup to clear the decks for accelerated van production in the fall. In September the company’s efforts refocused on building what is known internally as the Rivian Prime Van. The pickup is being produced in steady but modest numbers according to people familiar with the plan.

The pickup has also faced multiple delays since the global coronavirus pandemic hit most recently attributed to a global computer chip shortage. Rivian has promised each buyer a human point of contact dubbed an “ambassador” to set expectations before the vehicle is delivered. But to date that PR army has had little positive news to report.

Ross Gale a car collector and business owner in New Jersey ordered a launch green R1T pickup last November. Lately he says despite his excitement when he first placed the order he’s been frustrated by the lack of communication from the company on when he can expect to receive his vehicle.

Once delivered he plans to use the truck as his daily driver and to haul cars from his collection to auto shows. ""I 100% believe in the product having never seen one having never touched one” Gale says. “But I am annoyed with the failure to meet promises. I mean just be honest. Tell us what you're doing.""

Meanwhile Rivian’s contractual requirements for Amazon may simply be an opening bid. Bezos as he looks toward future orders has set up a kind of bake-off (as he is known to do). In addition to Rivian Amazon currently buys vans from Ford Stellantis and Daimler all companies that are quickly flipping the switch on electric models.

“You can safely assume 100000 vans is not really the objective” one source familiar with the deal says. “If Amazon really wants to change over their fleet — because how else are they going to become carbon neutral — then you can imagine the size of the order and how big it will be.”

The deal between the two companies is stacked in Amazon’s favor. Rivian's Oct. 1 filing details that Amazon’s logistics unit is not bound to buy any electric delivery vehicles from Rivian — and that it can still work with any other potential automotive partners it chooses.

Quantifying how much of a boost the Amazon deal will be to Rivian is tricky as the specifics have never been disclosed. The unknown price of each van is just one part of the equation. The agreement between the two companies also includes provisions for recurring revenue for fleet management such as software updates and running diagnostics people familiar with the matter said.

PitchBook analysts forecast the total Amazon order could bring more than $4.5 billion to Rivian and more importantly additional commercial customers. “These orders are a validating signal for investors and set Rivian up well to supply electric delivery vans to other logistics companies” said Asad Hussain Pitchbook’s senior mobility analyst. “In the same way investors look to Tesla for the future of automotive many investors look to Amazon for the future of logistics.”

Rivian will try to simultaneously launch three all-new electric vehicles. “Moving into the production on multiple fronts is a challenge for any automaker let alone one that has never scaled up a single model before” says BloombergNEF analyst Corey Cantor.

Sometime in the next few weeks Rivian’s first customer will get a truck the ambassadors will start booking delivery dates and Instagram will fill up with the 5000-pound version of an iPhone unboxing video. Still the wait for most customers will be long. Scaringe told Bloomberg in November that it would take two years to catch up on its order book.

Amazon currently is testing a handful of pre-production vans in cities across the U.S. And Bezos is no longer at the helm. He stepped down from the CEO’s perch in July and has been devoting time to his rocket company Blue Origin. Mere minutes before blasting himself into space in July with much of the world watching Bezos drove to the launch pad in a Rivian SUV. After touching back down to earth his capsule was swarmed by vehicles — all Rivian pickups and SUVs each of them shiny and dusty.",,,,,,,,,

Then I checked GTA III’s case and it too had the same thing. Then I looked at other GTA video game cases and realized that placing a heli in the top left-hand corner is indeed a thing.

Grand Theft Auto 6 Comments: A Dramatic Reading CC Share Subtitles Off

English view video Grand Theft Auto 6 Comments: A Dramatic Reading

This all started back on the cover for GTA III. In the top left hand of the collage of images that make up the cover art you can see a police helicopter. Then another police heli appears in the same spot on Vice City’s iconic PS2 cover. And then after that nearly every GTA cover includes a helicopter in that same spot.

The only exceptions to this rule are mostly weird ports lik e GTA Advance and the weird international covers GTA III sported back in the day. The one real oddball is GTA Chinatown Wars which uses the same cover design as all the main GTA games but doesn’t include a helicopter for some reason.

Another trend that Rockstar doesn’t follow as much as the heli is the placement of a motorcycle in the top right corner of many GTA covers. This is a cooler lesser-known trend that only us GTA hipsters know about. And now all of you I guess too...



I’m not the first person to notice this. But as the classic Grand Theft Auto games are currently trending thanks to the recent remaster news I started talking about random bits of trivia and lore with folks I know. It was then that I learned that a lot of folks didn’t know about the odd helicopter Easter egg Rockstar loves including on each GTA cover. Of course once I pointed it out people would ask me why and I don’t have a good answer for that.

Perhaps it’s one of those things that started out by accident. You know someone put a heli in the same spot twice in a row and someone decided to keep it up for the next one. And then an accident became a tradition. A weird tradition but one which probably doesn’t have any nefarious conspiracies about it online.

It bundles Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas with a big bow and ""across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements for all three titles while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals.""

While we don't know when the remastered collection is launching we are aware that the developer is stopping sales of the digital versions of the original trio of titles. Which is sort of sad but established practice for companies that are rolling out revamped editions of its past portfolio.

So Rockstar Games will be deleting all old versions and bundles of Grand Theft Auto III Vice City and San Andreas from digital PC and console retailers as soon as ""the week of October 11 2021"" stated by the company on its support page. If you own these games in your library already don't panic. They won't be affected by the takedown so this is really to notify anyone who hasn't picked up the classic games in their original forms.

At the time of writing Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is still available on Steam and so are the individual listings for Grand Theft Auto III Vice City and San Andreas. No specificities have been offered by the developer on why these games will be delisted but I imagine it has something to do with the vibrant modding communities that they possess.

Ahead of the announcement several popular Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and San Andreas mods were struck with a DMCA notice from Rockstar Games' Parent company Take-Two Interactive. ""If the economy is threatened or if there's bad behavior and we know how to define that then we would issue or would take to notice"" explained CEO Strauss Zelnick.

As these mods likely did just the job that the upcoming remasters are doing to the originals it checks out why these creations might ""threaten the economy."" So one last reminder - pick up Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy before midnight on Monday!

Rockstar has yet to announce pricing for the game however sources say the collection should release next month so we should get an updated soon.

The developer promises the definitive edition will add improvements across GTA III Vice City and San Andreas with ""across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements for all three titles while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals.""

Based on previous pricing cues from Take-Two Interactive we have predicted the new Grand Theft Auto V re-release could summarily be priced at $69.99 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Take-Two Interactive's 2K Games label were among the first to establish the new $10 price hike and company CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented in favor of the new premium cost model."

What You Need To Know The television and digital ads begun this past week to highlight AT&T’s contributions to Texas Republican lawmakers.



Pressuring corporations to pull support and business from states that pass controversial laws has some record of success. North Carolina lost $3.76 billion in business after passing a law blocking transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their identity in 2016



There are plans to expand the campaign to Florida where a similar abortion proposal has been introduced



Some companies including the customer-management firm Salesforce dating app Bumble and ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft pushed back against the Texas abortion law after it went into effect a month ago

The television and digital ads begun this past week by the groups Corporate Accountability Action and American Bridge 21st Century the Democratic Party’s opposition research arm highlight AT&T’s contributions to Texas Republican lawmakers. There are plans to expand the campaign to Florida where a similar abortion proposal has been introduced.

Abortion rights supporters in Texas are confronting the nation’s strictest abortion law in one of the most populous states as well as a conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court and a wave of GOP lawmakers who want their states to be next. Democrats and their allies on this issue are looking for new ways to harness frustration into leverage.

“This is a moment in our country where there is no middle ground. You really can’t be on the sidelines” said Cecile Richards past president of Planned Parenthood and current co-chair of American Bridge 21st Century.

The Texas law greatly slowed the number of abortions forcing clinics to turn away hundreds of women and leading patients to seek the procedure in other states which has created growing backlogs.

Texas had roughly two dozen abortion clinics before the law took effect Sept. 1. At least six clinics resumed performing abortions after six weeks of pregnancy after a federal judge blocked the law on Wednesday according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. But late Friday an appeals court allowed the restrictions to resume pending further arguments. The Biden administration which had sued has until Tuesday to respond.

The ads in Texas aim at AT&T which Corporate Accountability Action found donated more than $645000 over the past two years to nearly 22 lawmakers who sponsored the measure. The Dallas-based telecom company also donated thousands to Democratic lawmakers.

In Florida the group is criticizing corporations such as Walt Disney for its $262000 in donations to among the more than two dozen lawmakers who sponsored proposed abortion restrictions over the past two years. NBC Universal gave $83500 to those legislators and some $88000 in Texas CAA found.

AT&T said it a statement it does not take a position on the issue of abortion or endorse the law known as Senate Bill 8 and gave money to legislators on both sides.

Representatives for NBC and Walt Disney which have also donated to Democrats at other times did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment.

The two groups eventually plan to expand the campaign to the dozen states where legislators have said they want to model their own laws based on the Texas measure.

The Texas ban prohibits abortions once cardiac activity is detected usually around six weeks which is before many women know they are pregnant. The law’s unusual enforcement mechanism kept it from being blocked by the Supreme Court: Private citizens not the state have the power to enforce the law through civil suits that can net them $10000.

Pressuring corporations to pull support and business from states that pass controversial laws has some record of success. North Carolina lost $3.76 billion in business after passing a law blocking transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their identity in 2016. That pressure led to a repeal.

This year the effect was more muted on GOP-backed election-overhaul bills that critics called attempts to suppress Democratic votes. Republicans such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp stuck by the measure there even after Major League Baseball’s decision to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta.

Some companies including the customer-management firm Salesforce dating app Bumble and ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft pushed back against the Texas abortion law after it went into effect a month ago.

But that didn’t deter Tesla CEO Elon Musk from announcing Thursday he would move the electric carmaker’s headquarters from the San Francisco Bay area to Austin a tech hub and the capital of Texas.

The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday but on Sept. 2 Musk tweeted that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

The anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life pointed out that companies making donations might not support everything for which candidates stand. “We hope that people in Texas and companies in Texas will not bow down to ‘cancel culture’” spokeswoman Kimberlyn Schwartz said.

Abortion rights advocates say the companies they are calling out are backing politicians whose positions contradict the public messages the corporation use to lure consumers.

“You can’t on the one hand say ‘empower women’ and on the other hand your political funds going to people who are actually literally disempowering women” Richard said. “That kind of accountability is frankly long overdue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zY2hhZmVyLW90dG8tYnJlbWVyLXRydXN0ZWVzLXJpcHBlZC1vdXQtdGhlLWJyYWtlcy1oaXQtdGhlLWdhcy1hbmQtY3Jhc2hlZC82MDAxMDUwODMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schafer: Otto Bremer trustees ripped out the brakes hit the gas and crashed,"Ignore the debate between Bremer Financial Corp. and the Otto Bremer Trust over whether the bank could be sold. That's a sideshow.

There are hedge funds involved in the fight. While rarely a good thing in any business story they are a distraction too.

By themselves many of the details arising at the hearing in St. Paul on the state of Minnesota's push to remove the Otto Bremer Trust's trustees mean little.

And while the whole battle looks simply like a bunch of rich people fighting over money it's about more than money or status or even the future of a big bank.

There's a principle at stake. A bedrock we-need-to-care-about-this principle.

Excellence requires oversight.

Seven years ago the three trustees now fighting to keep their jobs started chipping away at the oversight that produced excellence at the Otto Bremer Trust.

They booted the executive director. They started calling themselves co-CEO. That means while they might still call themselves trustees too there's no more line that divides the responsibilities — and necessary tension — between manager and overseer.

They'd chosen to be the managers of the foundation not the overseers. There's no oversight now. There's no one to hold them accountable.

It's bad governance of breathtaking proportions.

Documents in the current litigation show the Bremer trustees and staff from the Attorney General's Office had a back-and-forth about governance during the past couple of years. The foundation is permitted by the original trust instrument to form a nonprofit corporation with a traditional board of directors providing oversight. The Bremer trustees it appears simply don't want one.

Around the Twin Cities executives at big companies and nonprofits volunteers on the boards of nonprofits and foundation leaders have been muttering for years about the audacity of the transformation at the Bremer foundation and opinion turned sharply against these trustees. The dispute over the ownership of Bremer Financial that erupted two years ago finally lit the powder keg.

That's got people thinking about what could happen if Bremer Financial — which supplies the money the trust gives away — did get sold. These three people at the foundation accountable to no one but themselves would no longer have the bank's pesky board getting in their way. They could potentially have a lot more financial weight to throw around the region too.

The state's attorney general Keith Ellison isn't playing politics or catering to elite consensus by asking a judge to toss these trustees. Looking out for the public's interest at the Bremer foundation is part of the job.

Whether the state proves its case is up to the judge. Yet it's hard to imagine how the Otto Bremer Trust could've landed in court at all without the trustees first deciding it was just fine to be a co-CEO investment manager and trustee.

The Otto Bremer Trust was well known before all this legal drama having granted hundreds of millions of dollars in the Upper Midwest over the decades.

A spokesman for the Otto Bremer Trust as far back as 2014 argued to the Star Tribune that the trustees get paid so much because it's really a bank holding company given its ownership stake in Bremer Financial Corp.

That's technically true. It's also absurd.

The Otto Bremer Trust is not a private corporation and it files the Form 990-PF tax return of a private foundation. The immigrant entrepreneur Otto Bremer created the foundation calling it the Otto Bremer Foundation in the 1940s.

For years the foundation and the banking company were almost the same organization but the laws changed in the 1960s and so did the structure. Today the foundation owns by far the most shares in what's now called Bremer Financial Corp. Yet federal laws require that it doesn't control the company.

Last year the nicely profitable Bremer Financial paid $73.4 million in dividends to the foundation. The foundation in turn gave away more than $71 million in grants and program-related investments nearly $60 million of that in Minnesota.

The current trustees Charlotte Johnson Daniel Reardon and Brian Lipschultz all got their positions from their dads. Lipschultz was the last of the current trustees to join the board succeeding his father in 2012.

The first tax return to list the three of them as co-CEO was 2014's after executive director Randi Roth was pushed out. In 2015 Lipschultz and Reardon were each making about $500000 and had added ""investment manager"" to their positions listed in the tax return while Johnson made more than $312000.

There was nothing hidden about any of this happening at the foundation. A five-word internet search takes anyone to the foundation's 2015 tax return.

Imagine the board of directors of Target Corp. naming themselves co-CEOs and deciding to pay themselves $50 million a year. Of course had this happened the shareholders would see to it that Target promptly had a new board of directors.

A large foundation like Bremer has no shareholders. The Attorney General's Office plays that role — and is doing so in court now.

A few years ago the then-president of the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis Kate Wolford wrote to the Bremer trustees. Like others in her profession she wrote she believed the Bremer trustees must respond to mounting concerns about booting the foundation's executive and jacking up their own pay.

Otherwise she added ""public trust and confidence in the entire sector is diminished.""

The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy also fired off a letter this one to then Attorney General Lori Swanson complaining that trustee compensation had increased more than 1000% in a decade and these three had violated ""many principles of good governance.""

Whether it's a for-profit or nonprofit entity those charged with oversight simply need to keep a watch on people looking after the money — and they must know to never put personal gain ahead of the organization's interest. That's governance.

One little episode out of court last week illustrates how screwed up the governance of the Bremer foundation has become. It came from the testimony of Sara Dziuk CEO of Junior Achievement North a nonprofit financially supported by the foundation.

She described ""very difficult very hostile"" conversations with Lipschultz about among other things Junior Achievement deciding to celebrate the career of an executive who happens to serve on the Bremer Financial board. Ultimately Junior Achievement took the extraordinary step of returning its most recent Bremer grant — $1.2 million.

News accounts of this episode accurately described Lipschultz as a trustee. But remember it was really the foundation's co-CEO badgering that nonprofit executive.

There's no real board at the Otto Bremer Trust to look into this. There's no one to sigh express disappointment and then tell the co-CEO that his letter of resignation is expected by the end of the day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY4MzY1OTIxMDA0NjM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Co-delivery of bufalin and nintedanib via albumin sub-microspheres for synergistic cancer therapy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365921004636 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY4MzY1OTIxMDA0NjM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company will roll out the latest beta version of its “full self-driving” software to 1000 owners this weekend.

Yet there aren’t actually any self-driving cars for sale today according to autonomous vehicle experts and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which regulates cars. Tesla’s “full self-driving” is more like an enhanced cruise control they say.

Videos posted on the internet by people who already have the feature unlocked show that it might stop for traffic lights and turn smoothly at intersections but it also might veer toward pedestrians or confuse the moon for a traffic signal.

Tesla says that a human driver needs to be watching and ready to take over at any moment and the company is only allowing initial access to the system to the people it considers the safest drivers.

Despite those limits Tesla is free to call its technology “full self-driving.” Tesla owners who download the “full self-driving” beta must check a box confirming that they understand they are responsible for remaining alert with their hands on the wheel and must be prepared to take action at any time. “Full self-driving” does not make their car autonomous it says.

A person buying a Tesla vehicle on its website sees the technology described in big bold letters as “full self-driving” but the fine print below that says the technology is a driver-assist technology. Driver-assist technologies are intended to help a human drive more safely with features such as forward collision warning blind spot warning and lane departure warning systems.

“The problem is that Tesla has one foot on both sides” said Bryan Reimer a scientist at the MIT AGELab whose research has looked at driver attention with Tesla’s features.

The US government has no performance standards for automated driver-assist technologies Reimer said. Tesla or any automaker can essentially do whatever they want when it comes to these technologies.

“We’re at mercy of the auto manufacturers to put in safe systems. We are reliant on drivers wanting to be risk adverse” Cathy Chase president of the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety told CNN Business. “The combination of those two is a perfect storm for future disasters.”

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.

There are signs that the NHTSA is moving toward regulating driver-assist technologies but how fast that might happen remains to be seen. It can take years to complete a rulemaking process and sometimes an administration may halt a process a previous administration started. NHTSA’s agenda earlier this year called for proposing a rule that would set performance standards for automatic emergency braking as well as specifying a test to determine if automakers comply.

NHTSA launched an investigation this summer into Teslas rear-ending emergency vehicles while using Autopilot. Chase said she’s concerned that the Tesla technology may play a role in other types of crashes we aren’t yet aware of.

Autonomous driving experts have long cautioned that Tesla’s description of “full self-driving” and its more rudimentary predecessor Autopilot may lead to drivers putting too much trust in the technology. Tesla drivers have already died in high-profile crashes using Autopilot drawing rebukes from the National Transportation Safety Board.

US Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla and take enforcement action because Tesla’s marketing overstates its vehicles’ abilities they say.

“When drivers’ expectations exceed their vehicle’s capabilities serious and fatal accidents can and do result” they wrote.

The Federal Trade Commission which is tasked with protecting consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices declined to tell CNN Business why it has not taken any action against Tesla. The FTC also said it does not comment on whether it has any open investigations a spokesperson said.

Picking the wrong technology

NHTSA and Congress which can push the agency to regulate specific things missed an opportunity to focus on driver-assist technologies in recent years according to autonomous driving and law experts.

Rather than regulate driver-assist they focused on self-driving vehicles the types of cars that wouldn’t need steering wheels or pedals. The US House of Representatives passed a law related to self-driving cars in 2017. NHTSA has released several versions of guidance for fully autonomous vehicles.

“It’s jumping ahead many many steps while we’re not addressing what could be saving lives right now” Chase said.

The decision to focus on the revolutionary technology followed years of hype from self-driving companies. Some of the biggest names in the industry said the technology was only years way. But self-driving software has proven incredibly difficult and companies have failed to hit predictions. Only Waymo offers a self-driving robotaxi service and it’s in a limited portion of the greater Phoenix area. On rainy days Waymo’s vehicles require a human behind the wheel.

Bryant Walker Smith a professor at the University of South Carolina law school said that European regulators are far ahead of the United States on regulating driver-assist technologies. Smith said that technologies like pedestrian detection and automatic braking are sensible to mandate on new cars and there should be performance standards for them.

“There’s low-hanging fruit” Smith said. “We could save lives far earlier than we have self-driving cars.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy90ZXNsYS1zZWNvbmQtcm93LXBldC1saW5lci1pcy1wbHVzaC4yNDMwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Second Row Pet Liner is plush!,"You can install our site as a web app on your iOS device by utilizing the Add to Home Screen feature in Safari.

Or follow us on Google News

You probably don’t think a Tesla Model 3 sedan is good for much besides transporting one to five people plus luggage even if it is extremely smooth and efficient at doing that.

Everyone knows that a real man has to have a full-size pickup with a 6-seat 4-door extended cab to haul whoever and whatever crosses his mind. There must be a lot of real men in the US because full-size pickups outsell every other vehicle model by a huge margin. Although I have noticed that you also see a lot of women driving full-size pickups in the Walmart parking lot.

We all know that those pickup trucks are used 99% of the time to transport one person from point A to point B. But a real man definitely needs a full-size pickup truck to go to Home Depot to pick up a 12 oz box of finishing nails.

For 99% of the miles driven by our Tesla Model 3 it is also carrying one or two passengers and often our small dog from point A to point B. Everyone knows that if you want a trailer/receiver hitch on a Tesla you have to buy a Model Y or Model X. Not true — you can have a very robust receiver installed by a third party such as U-Haul on a Model 3. Then add a tray-type bike carrier such as Küwat or Saris and you can carry up to two big e-bikes weighing a total of 120 lb. For 20% of the miles we travel with our Tesla Model 3 mostly on long trips we are also carrying one or two e-bikes.

We have traveled the 1081 miles from Three Lakes in Northern Wisconsin through Illinois Indiana Kentucky and Tennessee to Charlotte North Carolina to visit our daughter and her family. We then drove the 2081 miles cross-country through Tennessee Kentucky Illinois Missouri Kansas and Colorado back to our winter home in Lindon Utah carrying a big e-bike.

In two weeks we will be headed Westward Ho for the 1196 mile drive from Three Lakes Wisconsin to our winter home in Lindon Utah carrying my heavy Bulls and Fantic full suspension mid-drive e-bikes along the way.

For the other 1% of the miles driven by our Tesla Model 3 we perform many of the tasks you might think would require a pickup truck. Add a tow bar with a 6” drop turned upside down and you are ready to pull utility trailers boat trailers and popup trailers. Without the 6” rise it is difficult to attach a trailer because the receiver is so low.

Now we need a utility trailer that can carry an electric golf cart dining room table load of kayaks 4’x8’ sheets of plywood/wallboard even professional 4’x12’ sheets of wallboard or most anything else you can imagine.

Next you to back up to the trailer to attach it. Voila! The Model 3 backup camera and gorgeous touchscreen make pinpoint backing to the trailer and coupling a piece of cake.

What about a muscular task like pulling my 2900 lb. ski boat out of water. Can the Little Engine That Could pull our big ski boat? Well it turns out that the towing limit on the Model Y is 3500 lb. That leaves a 600 lb margin for the trailer. With a maximum tongue weight of 320 lb we are probably reasonably under the limits especially since my trailer has its own brakes. In that case I don’t see why the Model Y towing specs shouldn’t apply to the Model 3.

I hook up the boat trailer using the backup camera for pinpoint coupling. I drive to the boat ramp and back the trailer into the water. I drive the boat onto the trailer attach the hook from the trailer to the boat move forward slowly until the whole boat rests on the trailer and then press on the accelerator and the car leaps up the ramp. The twin motors have so much power and torque that I can hardly feel the 3000 lb boat and trailer behind me. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised since from adding the front and rear motors together the dual-motor Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a total of 450 hp.

I only need to tow the boat about 1.4 miles from the boat ramp to my garage so I don’t need to consider the impact of trailering for longer distances. However in case you want to do long-distance boat trailering with a Model 3 I did a power use check at 60 mph where I got 600Wh/mile which compares with 200Wh/mile without the trailer.

I tow the boat from the boat ramp to my driveway where I change the oil winterize the motor and shoehorn the boat into the garage for the winter. Since the Model 3 pulling the 3000 lb ski boat and trailer at 60 mph uses about 600 Wh/mile if the battery size on the Model 3 is 72 kWh the full range pulling the boat would be about 120 miles. There are some factors that would improve efficiency pulling the boat. The boat would be more aerodynamic with a cover and the pressure of the trailer tires were low when I was doing the test and should be pumped up for maximum range. One tire was very low and neither tire was near the recommended 55 PSI. Bottom line: it may be possible to get from one Supercharger to the next on a cross-country trip pulling a 2900 lb ski boat but not at a safe 70 mph on an interstate highway.

It may also be possible to tow a small pop-up travel trailer cross-country. Since you trail a pop-up in the stowed mode as shown below that would reduce the aerodynamic drag. Unfortunately I was not able to do a power use test with a popup trailer. I’m guessing that the power use trailing a popup trailer would be greater than for the ski boat. Again it might be possible to get from one Supercharger to the next but not at a safe 70 mph.

Nonetheless note that Jayco popup trailers start at the dry weight of 1835 lb with a hitch weight of 140 lb. This should be well within the capability of the Model 3 for short trips.

UPDATE: On Oct. 8 the Registry real-estate news site reported that Tesla has agreed to lease 325000 square feet of a site that formerly housed HP’s headquarters at 1501 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto. This space will not be used as Tesla’s HQ however.

Tesla Inc. the electric vehicle and energy storage company is moving its Palo Alto-based headquarters to Austin Texas the company’s CEO Elon Musk said Thursday afternoon.

The announcement came during an annual shareholder meeting hosted from inside one of Tesla’s Gigafactories also located in Austin.

Musk gave vague explanations for the move but cited high housing costs and long commute for workers as well as growth limitations imposed by being in the Bay Area.

“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away. … There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area” he said.

But this is not the end for Tesla’s story in California. Musk added that the company will “increase output” from its Fremont and Nevada factories by 50%.

“This is not a matter of Tesla sort of leaving California” he said.

Propping up the benefits of the new location Musk said the new headquarters will be five minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from downtown. And while the company will continue to grow in California Tesla will expand “even more so” in Texas.

Tesla a company that has grown exponentially since it was founded in 2003 and set the standard for electric vehicles first arrived to Palo Alto in 2009 moving from San Carlos into a 350000-square-foot building in Stanford Research Park.

The company’s former chief technical officer and co-founder J.B. Straubel said one large incentive to come to Palo Alto was the city’s proximity to Stanford University. (Straubel is also a Stanford alumnus.)

Palo Alto City Manager Ed Shikada expressed disappointment in the news noting “Tesla has been a member of the Palo Alto community for over a decade.”

But he said in an email to this news organization “This change reflects the innovative cycle and nature of Silicon Valley where we are seeing highly mobile companies in our region evolve. We look forward to continuing to adapt to the economic forces at play.”

Musk recently became an increasingly vocal critic against the golden state and Silicon Valley. In an interview during The Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO Council summit the Tesla CEO revealed that he moved out of California as it had become “complacent” in its leading economic status. He also suggested that Silicon Valley had become increasingly irrelevant.

“I think we’ll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley” he said in the interview.

Tesla is not the first company to make an exit out of Palo Alto during the pandemic.

In August Palantir Technologies quietly moved out of its Palo Alto headquarters at 100 Hamilton Ave. to Denver Colorado. The company’s CEO Alex Karp previously expressed frustrations with Silicon Valley’s “increasing intolerance and monoculture.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise also announced in December that it will move from Palo Alto to Houston. HP Inc. Hewlett Packard’s consumer product arm remains headquartered in the city."

The past few weeks have seen at least two both coincidentally in the video surveillance field.Bengaluru-based Uncanny Vision has been acquired by Eagle Eye Networks a US company founded by Dean Drako who had previously founded storage company Barracuda Networks. EnCloudEn another Bengaluru company has been acquired by Nasdaq-listed storage company Quantum Corporation.Ranjith Parakkal who founded Uncanny Vision together with Navaneethan Sundaramoorthy in 2013 said the partnership with Eagle Eye would enable them to scale fast. Eagle Eye Networks is one of the world’s largest cloud video surveillance companies.In a conversation with TOI Drako said Uncanny “brings brilliance and their incredible AI software to the Eagle Eye platform.” He said Uncanny “might even be the strongest AI provider in the video surveillance business.” “Uncanny has been very good in the parking street tolling roadway market with their highly accurate license plate recognition technology. They are also very strong in object identification and classification systems. We will be implementing this across all Eagle Eye cameras so that our customers can do searches” he said.Parakkal who was in Texas Instruments for 11 years before starting Uncanny said they were initially in multiple verticals including automotive cameras toys with cameras surveillance cameras. “In 2016-17 we realised we needed to focus on a segment to be really good. And we chose surveillance. And that was a really good decision because the surveillance market soon started booming and we were an early entrant” he said. It has numerous customers who use them in applications like smart parking retail analytics gate security toll automation smart cities ATM monitoring. Uncanny’s 57 employees will join the 350 of Eagle Eye’s.The second company acquired EnCloudEn was founded in 2016 by Abinash Saikia Satya Kishore  and Vishwa Vijoyendra Narayan . Saikia and Kishore had studied together at IIT Madras and subsequently Saikia and Narayan had studied together at IIM Bangalore. “We started in the private cloud space in HCI (hyperconverged infrastructure) VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure). We competed with the likes of Nutanix” Saikia said.Quantum based in San Jose was attracted by the specific HCI use case in video surveillance that EnCloudEn had built. “It’s very user friendly easy to deploy manage. Typical video surveillance systems require IT guys to manage it but ours don’t users can quickly learn how to do it” he said. The company has a number of customers in the Indian private and the public sectors. EnCloudEn’s 30-strong team will join Quantum.EnCloudEn will strengthen Quantum's recent acquisition of the surveillance business assets of Pivot3 an early pioneer of HCI for video surveillance workloads. Jamie Lerner chairman & CEO of Quantum said in a release that “the addition of EnCloudEn technology brings an open and flexible HCI software stack that strengthens our position in the video surveillance and physical security market.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcGliLmdvdi5pbi9QcmVzc1JlbGVhc2VJZnJhbWVQYWdlLmFzcHg_UFJJRD0xNzYyNzY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union Health Minister Shri Mansukh Mandaviya Presides over the 25th Convocation of NIMHANS,"Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Pressure is starting to build on Bombardier Inc. to ramp up development spending on new jets as rivals continue to unveil plans for competing aircraft.Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press

Pressure is starting to build on Bombardier Inc. to ramp up development spending on new jets as rivals continue to unveil plans for competing aircraft a situation that raises questions about the Canadian company’s financial targets as it fights to recapture investor interest.

U.S.-based Gulfstream announced last week it would bring two new jets to market – including one the G400 that aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia said would deliver an instant “knockout punch” against Bombardier’s Challenger 650. That follows disclosure by France’s Dassault Aviation SA that it is planning two new large-cabin jets. Competition is only poised to heat up over time with more new products from other manufacturers including Brazil’s Embraer SA and U.S. giant Textron Aviation  according to Scotiabank equity analyst Konark Gupta.

Bombardier shares have fallen in four of the last five trading sessions since the Gulfstream announcement losing eight per cent overall. They closed Friday at $2.03 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

“We believe [Bombardier] is now more likely to roll out new models derivatives or refreshes rather than staying quiet in order to remain competitive with Gulfstream Dassault and potentially others” Mr. Gupta said in a recent research note. The Montreal-based jet maker “could be at risk of losing market share and facing revenue or margin headwinds if it doesn’t invest in new products” he said.

That means Bombardier’s stated plans to limit capital expenditure at about US$200-million a year over the next several years might not be workable which in turn would affect its goals for free cash flow according to the analyst. The company is forecasting that it will turn cash flow positive next year on its way to generating more than US$500-million of free cash by 2025 a target that hinges on limiting spending.

Bombardier chief executive Éric Martel and chief financial officer Bart Demosky are trying to stage a recovery for the Canadian industrial giant that hinges on a slimmed-down business model focused solely on selling and servicing private jets. The company has a lineup of popular planes such as the all-new Global 7500 that are generating orders but its still-weak financial position means it does not have the same capacity as some competitors to update older models or develop all-new designs.

“The challenge Bombardier has is they don’t have access to capital at affordable rates” said aerospace consultant Rolland Vincent a former Bombardier executive. “But they have a few years. I don’t think they have to do anything right now.”

Bombardier spokeswoman Anna Cristofaro declined to comment when asked whether management sees the capital expenditure forecast as a hard ceiling or if it could be increased as needed. “We’re very proud of our current aircraft offerings and we’ll continue to bring new and innovative products to the market” she said via e-mail adding executives will be able to provide more colour when the company reports third-quarter results later this month.

Over the past three years Montreal-based Bombardier has announced plans to refresh four separate jet models. The large-cabin Global 5500 and 6500 aircraft were updated to bring them closer in quality and performance to the company’s flagship Global 7500 a US$75-million plane designed from scratch that entered service in late 2018.

A stripped-down version of the Learjet 75 was announced in 2019 although Bombardier has since decided to cease production of its entire Learjet line. Last month the company said it would bring to market an improved version of its Challenger 350 aircraft to be called the Challenger 3500.

Bombardier spent more than US$1-billion to develop the Global 7500 but much less on the other planes which are not clean-sheet designs but revamped versions of existing aircraft. The company’s methods for refreshing jets (for example transposing its patented “Nuage” seat technology first introduced on the 7500 into the other Globals and into the Challenger 3500) has given it a “proven track record to build on for achieving meaningful upgrades at a low cost with less development risk” Mr. Demosky told industry analysts last March.

Analysts say the Bombardier jet in most urgent need of a replacement is the Challenger 650 a popular but old jet with a basic airframe design that has not changed since before Bombardier took over the Challenger program with its purchase of Canadair Ltd. from the federal government in 1986. They say that need is even more obvious now that Gulfstream has announced the new G400 which will come to market in 2025.

“The G400 is a major challenge that will require them to think about raising the money” to develop a new competing plane Mr. Aboulafia said in an interview. “It has to be an all-new plane. You don’t do refreshes of 40-year-old models. … They’re going to lose their market position unless they can do something.”

Henrietta Lacks was an African American patient at Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Doctors kept her tissue samples without her consent for experimental studies while treating her for cervical cancer in 1951.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.

The family of Henrietta Lacks the African American cancer patient whose cells were taken by Johns Hopkins University Hospital without her consent in 1951 is suing the pharmaceutical company Thermo Fisher Scientific and demanding reparations and the intellectual property of those cells.

Henrietta Lacks was a young Black mother in segregated Baltimore who suffered from metastatic cervical cancer. Doctors took tissue samples from her womb unknowingly that went on to become one of the most productive cell lines leading to groundbreaking research that became a cornerstone of modern medicine from cancer care and HIV/AIDS treatment to helping scientists produce remedies for several diseases including the first polio vaccine and even COVID-19 vaccines. Her cells were just known as ""HeLa"" cells — H-E-L-A — the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks's first and last name. But even her family had no clue about her legacy until more than 20 years after her death.

The new lawsuit denounces a racist medical system and accuses Thermo Fisher of using the HeLa cell line without their consent while making billions of dollars in profit. The family announced the lawsuit on Monday 70 years to the day after Henrietta Lacks's death. This is her granddaughter Kimberly Lacks.

KIMBERLY LACKS: I think about my grandmother as I said before laying in that hospital room and how they came in there when she had radiation going through her body in horrific pain but all they were concerned about was taking cell tissues from her body. That's terrible.



BENJAMIN CRUMP: Terrible.



KIMBERLY LACKS: And then on top of that no one in the family had any idea. They acted like she was alone. They didn't reach out to her husband her aunt her cousins — anyone — to let them know what was taking place. That's disgraceful. And that definitely is racism in my opinion. We was treated — the family was treated she was treated horribly.



My father one thing I can say about him is he's a sweet man. And he always said that ""Who wouldn't want a pocket full of money? Anybody everybody wants money. But it's a bigger picture."" But he did say to me — and he's sickly but he was very happy and excited to know that we're finally going to get justice finally going to get justice for Henrietta Lacks for his mother.



AMY GOODMAN: For more we go to Baltimore to speak to Ron Lacks one of the grandsons of Henrietta Lacks author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story. We are also joined by one of the family's attorneys the leading civil rights lawyer Ben Crump.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Ben let's start with you. Talk about why you're suing this particular pharmaceutical company and more about what happened to Henrietta Lacks.

BENJAMIN CRUMP: Surely Amy. Thank you for having Ron and I to talk about this landmark lawsuit that is based on the principle of not just simple justice not just social justice but this lawsuit is based largely in part on this notion of genetic justice — the belief that justice should flow from one generation to the next.

We have sued Thermo Fisher Scientific and there will be others who have derived benefit from the immortal cells of Henrietta Lacks 'til this day. And we believe unjust enrichment is the legal theory that is well established that allows the estate of Henrietta Lacks to make this claim that taking her cells was wrong. And the law says if you are unjustly enriched from the wrongdoing then you should not be allowed to continue to benefit at the peril of the victim which is Henrietta Lacks.

And that's why her family her linear descendants are saying ""Why is it that Henry Ford's family can define his legacy and benefit from his legacy and pass it on to generations of his legacy and unborn children who have yet to come into the world?"" But their grandmother this Black woman her great contributions to medicine her story is being told by everybody else. They are saying ""We get the right to define her legacy."" Everybody else is benefiting. Pharmaceutical companies are making billions upon billions of dollars from Henrietta Lacks' miraculous [inaudible] — and their family hasn't received —

AMY GOODMAN: Ben Crump let me ask you — you're freezing a little bit on Skype. But the company Thermo Fisher why just one company then?

BENJAMIN CRUMP: Well we believe there will be others. There were many corporations in the aftermath of George Floyd who made a commitment to social justice because they watched George Floyd suffer for nine minutes and 29 seconds. I submit that what Henrietta Lacks went through was equal if not far worse than what George Floyd suffered. So for all those pharmaceutical companies who have made billions who made the commitment to social justice in the aftermath of George Floyd well you can prove that commitment by doing right by Henrietta Lacks finally do right by her say her name because her life mattered and Black lives matter. You acknowledge that she was you know miraculous. Her cells are the cornerstone of modern medicine with having medical vaccines created from her cells or developed with polio with cancer research. They did in vitro advancements COVID-19 vaccination —

AMY GOODMAN: What were so special about Henrietta Lacks's cells?

BENJAMIN CRUMP: Well you know that's a great question. Everybody should know the name of Henrietta Lacks I mean not just people in America but all over the globe because her cells for the first time in the history of the world survived outside of her body. They did this medical experiment in Johns Hopkins which was tantamount to medical racism because they used her as a lab rat as they used many other Black people in that era. But they took the cells. They were trying to see if a cell could survive outside of the body. And nobody to that point could but Henrietta Lacks' miraculous cells not only survived but they regenerated every 24 hours and kept regenerating every time they would [inaudible]. The cell would continue to regenerate from another cell. And so this was a medical marvel for scientists to be able to use research of actual cells.

And so her cells have saved millions and millions of lives. And so that's why as her grandson Ron Lacks says his grandmother is up in heaven and she's looking down and saying ""How tremendous it is that my cells are doing all these good things"" and she sees all these companies making all this money — I mean billions of dollars — and she says ""Well what about my children? What about my family?""

And that's why we're bringing this landmark case not only based in these principles of civil rights but also in the theory of unjust enrichment because equity would demand justice would demand that Henrietta Lacks' estate is allowed to benefit from the use of her cells. Thermo Fisher does not have intellectual property rights over her cells superior to her flesh and blood.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to go to Ron in one second but Ben Crump I watched your news conference carefully on Monday. That was 70 years to the day that Henrietta Lacks died and you made a reference to her suffering at the end of her life. Yes she was a cervical cancer patient but you talked about radioactive rods being put inside her — can you explain? — that weren't actually — this procedure wasn't done to help her?

BENJAMIN CRUMP: Absolutely. They were not trying to help her with her cancer. They were experimenting with her using her as a lab rat as with the time in the 1950s with Black people. We must remember this was the era when they did the Tuskegee experiment. They did the Alabama appendectomy where people like Fannie Lou Hamer Black women went to hospitals and were lied to. They said they were treating them and they actually sterilized them where they could have no children. And you had Black soldiers during this time in World War II being put in gas chambers with faulty gas masks so they could study the effects of the gas chambers on the human body. And when those Black soldiers complained Amy they were court-martialed and put in prison.

AMY GOODMAN: And as a result of the medical experimentation on the African American community like Tuskegee you have the situation where African Americans today are concerned about the COVID-19 vaccine asking ""Is there experimentation being done right here?""

But I want to go right now to Ron Lacks the grandson of Henrietta Lacks and the author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story.

Ron thanks so much for joining us. Your grandmother has led to so many medical breakthroughs because of her line her cell line the HeLa cells. I was just talking to a science student who said he was told it was based on a Helen Lane. And of course it's the first two letters of both of her names Henrietta Lacks. When did you learn how that cell line was being used? And talk about the significance of this lawsuit.

RON LACKS: Through my mother Bobbette Lacks. She uncovered it when she was having lunch with a neighbor. And she was introduced as Bobbette Lacks. And a professor said ""We're working with someone's cells named Henrietta Lacks."" And then my mother told him ""That's my mother-in-law."" And that's when we first found out in 1973.

AMY GOODMAN: So talk about growing up as the grandson of Henrietta Lacks and what you understood and how you actually learned about what happened with your grandmother and what caused you to write your book Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story.

RON LACKS: Well when they started doing interviews with my family that's when more information about what was going on at the time. So I was young. I was a teenager. So I didn't understand it too much until later years when I found out all what her cells has been doing. And my father I watched him try to get lawyers with no success. So he was — my parents was trying to find out what was going on with the cells and who was doing what. And we found out that pharmaceuticals was enriching themselves. So my father like I said unsuccessfully tried. And coming up it took a strain on him because he watched his mother when he was a teenager. The radiation bars that was inserted in her took its toll on his mother and he watched that. And he's disturbed from that right to this day.

So when this hit the media they took a different approach to the family. Where my father was trying to explain what was going on with him trying to get control of Henrietta's legacy they turned their back on him even at a meeting with NIH and Johns Hopkins and my dad was there with his attorney. And they had Rebecca Skloot on the line mainly listening to what she had to say instead of my dad and his attorney.

So I've seen the total disrespect to my father. And I had to get what he experienced from his mother to what we was going through. And the world should know what was done to this family. They tried to divide us. They tried to keep us in the dark about things. And I had to tell the story. It's a very interesting story what we went through. And I think no family should ever go through this.

AMY GOODMAN: And then talk about your attempts to bring lawsuits to challenge reshape the narrative of your grandmother and then going on your book tour one place and making the final connection in this latest lawsuit.

RON LACKS: Well like I said they tried for years to get attorneys to take this case up. This is Johns Hopkins' backyard so we wasn't getting nowhere. Only allies that we had was University of Maryland and Danny Glover you know the only ones that would respect the Lacks family. So when I went to Texas on my first booking sign in they embraced me and I talked to the congregation there and I met a young man and he introduced me to Ben Crump. And that's when the light got shined on this situation. And I'm so happy. God is good.

AMY GOODMAN: So can you talk about how your family was defamed the stories told about your family that were untrue to discredit you to try not to seek some kind of reparations for what happened to your grandmother?

RON LACKS: Well OK for one thing Rebecca Skloot has embarrassed Henrietta's children all four of them. She called my dad Sonny and Abdul greedy because they're only in this for the money. But my father and them was in this ever since 1973 just trying to get the rights to his grandmother's legacy. And Henrietta Lacks signed her name with an X —

AMY GOODMAN: Rebecca Skloot of course is the author of another book on Henrietta Lacks that has been a multiyear best-seller The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Go ahead Ron.

RON LACKS: Exactly. And she had in there that my grandmother signed her name with an X. That's why I put in the back of my book with a poem my grandmother's John Hancock right in the back. She had beautiful penmanship. And illiterate — trying to say that my grandmother was illiterate. She wasn't. She was a beautiful Black intelligent woman that loved her family and loved her neighbors. So my grandmother would feed the neighborhood. And now you're asking her not to feed her children? That don't sound right to me. She was a wonderful woman.

AMY GOODMAN: What does it mean as you move forward your family standing together at this lawsuit the grandchildren speaking up for your parents the children of Henrietta Lacks?

RON LACKS: For a next generation that's what I'm saying that the Lacks family needs to take back control of Henrietta's legacy so we can pass down to the next generation of Lackses so they won't have to go through this fight that my grandfather and my dad went through. So that's why I had to speak out and tell my story.

AMY GOODMAN: Ron Lacks I want to thank you for being with us grandson of Henrietta Lacks author of Henrietta Lacks: The Untold Story speaking to us from Baltimore and Ben Crump civil rights attorney speaking to us from Houston.

To explore the potential roles for p53 function during this process we created mice harbouring liver-specific deletion of Trp53 (p53) (Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice) confirmed that recombination of the p53 floxed allele was highly efficient in the liver (Fig. S1A/B) and proceeded to characterise the acute response to CCl 4 -mediated liver toxicity using this model (Figs. 1A/B and S1 C–H). Importantly mice of either p53 genotype developed normally and were histologically indistinguishable prior to treatment (Fig. S1 C/D). Within the first 24 h following treatment with CCl 4  Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (p53 WT) mice exhibited evident liver damage including vacuolisation neutrophil infiltration and destruction of Glutamine Synthetase (GS)-positive peri-central vein hepatocytes (Figs. 1A/B and S1C–H). Damage progressed outward from the central vein over the first 48–72 hours after treatment before resolving within the remainder of the 168-h time-course (Figs. 1A/B and S1 C/D). In Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice although GS-positive hepatocyte destruction and damage-associated neutrophil infiltration were similar to p53 WT mice (Fig. S1E–H) liver damage progressed outward from the peri-central vein region more rapidly coalescing into larger regions of injury at 24 h after CCl 4 treatment (Figs. 1A/B and S1 C/D). Even so the liver damage in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice also resolved within 168 h.

To confirm our histological assessment of liver damage we examined the presence of alanine and aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST) activity in blood plasma two markers of liver damage. In agreement with the liver histology we noted extended elevation of plasma ALT and AST activity in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 1C/D) suggesting elevated liver damage in these mice. Even so as observed in liver histology plasma ALT and AST levels ultimately normalised by 168 h after treatment in mice of both genotypes suggesting potentially significant but transient effects of p53 during CCl 4 -mediated liver regeneration. These findings are consistent with previous reports of p53 acting to limit liver damage after acetaminophen overdose [18 19] where p53 exerted short-lived protective effects.

One of the features of damage-mediated liver regeneration is the dramatic but transient microvesicular steatosis that occurs prior to initiation of the proliferative phase of the regenerative response [282930]. The resulting accumulation of lipids can be visualised as red puncta in oil-red O-stained liver sections. In contrast to our liver damage assessments we observed a similar peak accumulation of oil-red-O staining at 24 h after CCl 4 treatment in the livers of Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT and Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 1E/F). However while lipid levels rapidly normalised by 48 h after treatment in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice elevated oil-red-O staining persisted in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice for an additional 2 days (Fig. 1E/F).

The initial reductive dehalogenation of CCl 4 generates short-lived but highly reactive intermediates that potently oxidise lipids and cause DNA damage [31 32]. Peroxidized lipids can impede mitochondrial function including fatty acid oxidation and impair lipid export—potentially contributing to lipid accumulation during CCl 4 detoxification [333435]. Considering the established role for p53 supporting the redox response [36] we investigated whether the disrupted lipid clearance in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice was a consequence of decreased ROS detoxification. Indeed levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) a marker of lipid peroxidation were elevated to a greater extent and for an additional two days in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice compared with Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (Fig. 1G/H).

To investigate the contribution of ROS stress to deficiencies in liver regeneration in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice we compared CCl 4 -mediated regeneration between Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice given normal drinking water to those provided with N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)-supplemented drinking water. NAC treatment is an established antidote to liver toxicity that results from acetaminophen overdose in humans and functions by maintaining liver glutathione levels during the detoxification process [37]. As expected NAC treatment significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 1I/J). NAC treatment also promoted significantly more rapid clearance of lipid droplets (Fig. 1K/L) suggesting that redox management is an important feature of the p53-mediated response to hepatic CCl 4 toxicity.

Liver p53 engages Cyp2a5/CYP2A6 to support redox control during CCl 4 -mediated liver regeneration

Given the differences in redox control between Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT and Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice at 24 h after CCl 4 treatment we focused on the early response to toxicity. At 8 h after CCl 4 treatment we observed similar oil-red-O staining to baseline and comparable lipid peroxidation between livers taken from Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT and Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 2A/B) suggesting that bifurcation of the regenerative response had not yet occurred. Bulk RNA-seq analysis at this time point identified 13 significant differentially regulated genes between Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT and Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL livers 8 h after CCl 4 treatment (Fig. S2A). Clustering analysis stratified these genes into three groups one of which contained p53 itself and four established p53 targets: Ccng1/Cyclin G1 Eda2r Zmat3/Wig-1 and Abcb1a/Mdr1 [38394041] (Fig. 2C). Our attention was drawn to the remaining member of this cluster Cyp2a5 encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is induced by NFE2L2 (NRF2) to aid in the murine redox response during ethanol detoxification [42 43]. CYP2A6 the human orthologue of Cyp2a5 [44] has been shown to be a transcriptional target of p53 [45] suggesting potential p53-directed functions for Cyp2a5 in the mouse as well.

Consistent with our RNA-seq data we confirmed that expression of Cyp2a5 was induced in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice within the first 8–24 h after CCl 4 treatment with later induction observed in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice alongside increased levels of the NRF2 target gene Nqo1 (Fig. S2B/C). Through IHC staining we confirmed higher levels of CYP2A5 protein in livers of Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT compared to Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice within 24 h after CCl 4 treatment as well (Fig. 2D/E). CYP2A5 levels remained significantly elevated in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT livers at 48 and 72 h after treatment with a delayed increase evident in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL livers at 48–72 h after CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 2D/E).

Interestingly although we observed potent early induction of the p53 target gene Cdkn1a/p21 in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice this was matched by similar induction in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice a finding that we confirmed by IHC staining for p21 at 8 h after CCl 4 treatment (Fig. S2D/E). These findings suggest that early expression of p21 after CCl 4 treatment is p53-independent (Fig. S2D/E) in contrast to its p53-dependent induction later in the regenerative process (Fig. S2D). These results also explain why Cdkn1a was not differentially expressed in our RNA-seq analysis. Expression of CYP2A5 in contrast was elevated in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice but significantly lower in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL livers at this time point consistent with our RNA-seq data (Fig. S2F). Bbc3/Puma a pro-apoptotic p53 target gene that has been shown to play a role in modulating liver metabolism in human HCC [46] was not differentially expressed between Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT and Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice during CCl 4 -mediated regeneration (Fig. S2G) reinforcing the idea that not all aspects of p53 activity are engaged during liver regeneration.

In the Mdm2Ex5/6Δ mouse model excision of Mdm2 exons 5 and 6 (Mdm2Ex5/6Δ) comprising the p53-binding domain of MDM2 leads to rapid stabilisation of p53 robust expression of p53 target genes and ultimately in p53-dependent lethality within 4–5 days [24 47]. RNA-seq analysis of mice sampled at two days after treatment with liver-specific AAV8-TBG-Cre [48] to induce expression of Mdm2Ex5/6Δ a time point before widespread liver attrition confirmed significant induction of Cyp2a5. Indeed we identified all of the genes in our CCl 4 RNA-seq analysis alongside classical p53 targets such as p21 and Puma in this alternative model (Fig. S2H). As in the CCl 4 liver regeneration model we validated the induction of p21 and CYP2A5 as well as stabilisation of p53 via IHC (Fig. S2I–K). Combined these findings confirm that activation of p53 engages CYP2A5 in the liver.

To explore the role of CYP2A5/CYP2A6 in damaged hepatocytes more fully in vitro we turned to HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells human HCC cell lines that maintain wild type p53 [46] (Fig. 2F/G). Treatment of these cells with Nutlin a direct activator of p53 [49] induced expression of CDKN1A/p21 as expected as well as CYP2A6. Treatment of both HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells with CCl 4 also induced p21 and CYP2A6 expression (Fig. 2F/G). This response was abrogated following siRNA-mediated depletion of TP53 confirming the role of p53 in the upregulation of p21 and CYP2A6 expression in response to CCl 4 in vitro (Fig. 2F/G).

Functionally both HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells treated with CCl 4 exhibited increased ROS levels and this was exacerbated in CYP2A6-depleted cells (Fig. 2H/I). Treatment of HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells with cumene hydroperoxide (CH) a stable organic oxidising agent [50] similarly engaged CYP2A6 and CDKN1A/p21 (Fig. S2 L/M) and CYP2A6-depletion also increased cellular ROS levels after CH treatment (Fig. 2J/K)—suggesting that downstream ROS rather than CCl 4 directly promotes activation of CYP2A6 to aid in ROS detoxification. Interestingly although induction of CYP2A6 was p53-dependent in response to CCl 4 treatment CYP2A6 increased independently of p53 after CH treatment (Fig. S2L/M). Since hydroperoxides have been shown to activate NRF2 in HepG2 cells [51] this finding is consistent with an established role for NRF2-induced Cyp2a5 supporting the redox response during ethanol detoxification in mice [42 43]. Based on these findings we concluded that the p53-dependent activation of CYP2A5 in response to CCl 4 treatment in vivo contributed to the enhanced detoxification of lipid ROS in support of rapid regeneration in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice.

Hepatocyte p53 protects liver function and limits tumourigenesis following CCl 4 -mediated chronic regeneration

A close relationship has been described between chronic regeneration and cancer—with tumourigenesis sometimes conceptualised as ‘a wound that does not heal’ [52]. While we detected clear defects in redox control and liver function during one round of CCl 4 treatment and regeneration in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice compared to Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice these differences were transient and resolved within one week (Fig. 1). In contrast to acute damage repeated regeneration resulting from regular CCl 4 treatment causes lasting fibrotic liver damage leading to cirrhosis and HCC [53 54]. This progression is exacerbated by systemic DNA damage chronic inflammation and ROS stress [55 56]. With these findings in mind we investigated the effects of lack of liver p53 on fibrosis and HCC development in the well-established CCl 4 chronic liver regeneration model [5] (Fig. S3A).

One week after the conclusion of the 10-week chronic regeneration regime we observed striking generalised hepatocyte hypertrophy [57] throughout the livers of Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice that was absent in similarly treated Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (Fig. 3A/B). In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) p53 has been shown to limit fibrosis after chronic regeneration in the liver [5]. However we found that hepatocyte-specific p53 loss did not lead to differences in activated HSC content as evaluated by IHC staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) or to increased fibrosis as assessed by picrosirius red staining (PSR) (Fig. 3B–D). In fact we observed a modest decrease in fibrosis in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 3B/D) consistent with a previous report showing that hepatocyte p53 can enhance fibrosis during CCl 4 -mediated chronic regeneration in rats [27]. Although murine hepatocyte p53 does not appear to limit fibrosis after chronic regeneration either we nevertheless detected higher levels of unresolved DNA damage measured by IHC staining for phospho-histone H2A.X (gH2AX) increased lipid peroxidation (measured by MDA) and—as expected—decreased levels of CYP2A5 in livers from Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 3E/F). Functionally we also found that plasma levels of ALT and AST enzyme activity were both elevated in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice after chronic regeneration consistent with compromised liver function in these mice (Fig. 3G).

In wild-type mice it can take up to 2 years for HCC to arise from chronic CCl 4 treatment [58]. Consistent with this few Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (3/14) reached clinical endpoint within 550 days after initial CCl 4 treatment in our experimental cohorts (Fig. 4A). In contrast Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice exhibited accelerated and highly penetrant development of liver tumours in this timeframe (9/9 mice median survival 380 days after first CCl 4 treatment) (Fig. 4A). Most mice of both genotypes (2/3 Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice and 5/9 Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice) reaching clinical endpoint exhibited large tumour lesions but also retained non-tumour (normal-like) tissue (Fig. S3B). These regions were sampled as ‘tumour’ and ‘non-tumour’ tissue for subsequent analyses. At the experiment endpoint (550 days after initial treatment) most CCl 4 -treated Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (11/14) all untreated Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (10/10) and most untreated Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (13/14) remained alive.

Non-tumour liver tissue from Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice retained the molecular features observed at the conclusion of the CCl 4 treatment regime including prominent hypertrophy in remaining normal hepatocytes (Fig. 4B) and significantly reduced CYP2A5 expression (Fig. 4B E). Analysis of tumours from Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (2 from mice at clinical endpoint and 2 small focal tumours identified at experiment endpoint) revealed that expression of CYP2A5 was elevated and MDA staining was low compared to tumours arising in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. 4C–E and Fig. S3C). These results confirmed that the disparate features of regeneration in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice—namely elevated ROS persistent liver damage and decreased CYP2A5 expression—continued during tumourigenesis.

The p53-mediated expression of BBC3/PUMA has been shown to promote a pro-cancer metabolic switch in human HCC correlating with poor prognosis in patients [46]. However we did not observe differential expression of murine Bbc3 in endpoint HCC tumours arising in Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice after chronic CCl 4 treatment compared with those in Albumin-Cre; p53FL/FL mice (Fig. S3D). Expression of Cdkn1a/p21 in contrast was elevated in the tumours of Albumin-Cre; p53WT/WT mice (Fig. S3D). These findings suggest that in murine HCC arising from chronic CCl 4 treatment the p53-PUMA mediated metabolic switch [46] is not a defining feature of p53 WT HCC.

CYP2A6 expression is prognostically favourable and clusters with a subset of p53-induced genes that correlate with increased survival in human HCC

Given the strength of the association between increased survival retention of p53 and expression of CYP2A5 in the murine CCl 4 chronic regeneration model we examined whether high expression of CYP2A6 correlated with increased survival in human HCC patients. Utilising the HCC dataset available through the cancer-genome atlas (TCGA-LIHC dataset [59]) we confirmed that high expression of CYP2A6 was associated with significantly greater median survival in HCC (Fig. 4F). In addition by stratifying the TCGA dataset between patients with disrupted TP53 (mutation or loss) and those with WT TP53 we further determined that high expression of CYP2A6 and retention of WT TP53 coincided with increased survival compared with all other combinations of tumours harbouring low expression of CYP2A6 and/or loss of WT TP53 (Fig. 4G).

Previous work utilising TCGA data has focused on the genomic determinants of human HCC [14]. In these analyses the authors’ identified a ‘p53-induced gene target expression signature’ as part of an aim to improve the clustering of HCC based on molecular and biological attributes [14]. Using the TCGA-LIHC dataset we examined the relationship between these 20 identified p53-induced genes and CYP2A6 expression and found that CYP2A6 expression clustered with a subset of the p53-induced genes including GADD45B ALDH4A1 GADD45A ESR1 PANK1 and ACAD11 (Fig. 4H). Interestingly although high expression of the full p53-induced gene target expression signature correlated with significantly reduced median survival in the TCGA-LIHC dataset (Fig. 4I) we found that high expression of the CYP2A6-associated gene cluster instead correlated with improved median survival (Fig. 4J). Taken together these observations are consistent with a role for p53 and CYP2A6 in limiting liver cancer.",,,,,,

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) stock recently plummeted after the company reported a sharp decline in sales. It illustrates the fact that some brick-and-mortar stores continue to struggle in a new digital era even as in-person shopping starts to make a comeback. But some traditional retailers are thriving. In this segment from ""The 5"" on Motley Fool Live that aired Sept. 30 Fool.com contributors Brian Withers Toby Bordelon and Nicholas Rossolillo pitch three retail stocks that are thriving right now.

10 stocks we like better than Bed Bath & Beyond

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Bed Bath & Beyond wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Brian Withers: Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a shocker. Shares are diving after sales declines for Bed Bath and Beyond. Stuff for the home brick-and-mortar retailer. I'm shocked. Net sales fell 26 percent. I imagine a combination of just increased competition as well as the coronavirus and the company lowered its sales and adjusted profit expectations for the year as it anticipates further supply chain challenges. Brick-and-mortar retailers selling commodity products during a pandemic what could go wrong? Let's do the opposite. What's the opposite of Bed Bath and Beyond? Is there a brick-and-mortar retailer that is set up to compete with the ongoing on-slot wave of e-commerce? What is it that they are doing right? Nick?

Nicholas Rossolillo: Super boring Target (TGT -0.72%). I guess they're kind of boring. All brick-and-mortar is going to have some built-in boring-ness to the story. But I like Target specifically because I think there was an acquisition they made a few years ago really went largely unnoticed when they acquired Shipt. They've now fully integrated Shipt into their operations as a type of last-mile delivery service. I think that's absolutely huge for Target to have that in-house like Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) has its own in-house last-mile delivery operation. Not just from a business standpoint or an operational standpoint but also just the fact that it aligns the delivery service with Target and with Target customers. I think that's the problem that a lot of consumer reviews have exposed like with the Instacarts out there in the last year. You just have like another party with its own interests involved now versus having this nice well-rounded business that's all on the same page. I think Shipt is a real differentiator there.

Then pair that with the fact Target led the way reimagining the way brick-and-mortar stores turning the existing store base into a type of a distribution center. The total percentage of orders being fulfilled by an actual Target store versus a distribution center somewhere is huge. It's like 95 percent of all orders at Target fulfilled from an actual store. That's also huge like. They have just completely repurposed the big-box store concept and I think it's going to continue to be a real game changer for them in the years ahead.

Withers: Yes I've been super-impressed with Target over the last several years. I've used their buy online pick-up-in-store service. They have Starbucks in the store. Most of them have groceries so there's that buy anything you need run. Just been impressed as a customer to see what they can do and not only the pick-up-in-store you can have it delivered. You can park in the parking lot and not even get out of the car. That's pretty neat. Toby what about you?

Toby Bordelon: I'm going to go with Home Depot (HD -0.29%). I think that's probably a fairly obvious one. But I have found myself going out to grab something that I need there because I don't want to wait overnight from Amazon if I want to get the job done. So I want to grab what I need now. I need to know what we think about supply chain issues and things taking a little bit longer. That's even more true now because it's not just waiting overnight you might be waiting two or three days. I just don't want to do that and you you can't do that.

The other thing I like about Home Depot there's one thing they got going forward is the employees I found they know what they're doing and they are a great resource for quick questions and advice especially if like which of these products that can be better for this particular application? They tend to have some pretty good suggestions as to which way you should go. It's useful in that it gets your stuff quickly. But you can also get that maybe suggestion or advice looking forward to you if you don't quite know exactly what you need.

Withers: Yeah. Not like when you ask us questions about which stock you should buy and we say we can't give you advice. [laughs]. Well those are two great ones and I was last to the notes outline and those were two that I was going to go to. But one company that we've covered before Toby and I we did a deep dive with Vicki was Tractor Supply Company (TSCO 0.64%) pretty darn impressive company.

It's got a new CEO recently who came in just before the coronavirus and was just very impressed with the leadership that he put forward. He immediately said we're hiring 6000 people we're investing in our stores and the health of our other teams we're providing masks for our employees did a ton of things to make sure their employees were well taken care of and the fact that it's a farming and feed store it was essential during the coronavirus they were open through the whole time and they added a ton of customers through the coronavirus and these customers have chosen to come back again and again because of the service that they get and the products that are available there. You may not be a customer of the out there store but if you ever have a chance to go go in one they're a pretty impressively run company. They also have an online presence as well but their store basis is their bread and butter.",,,,,,,,,

OAKLAND Calif. (KGO) -- There was chaos and confusion at airports across the country this weekend with Southwest Airlines cancelling more than 1800 flights over the past few days.

Some of those affected were here in the Bay Area.

""Didn't think our flight was going to be canceled. We arrived flight was canceled so we had to spend the evening here in San Francisco"" said Southwest passenger Chris Vahle.

Southwest says the issues stem from bad weather and air traffic control issues.

RELATED: Southwest cancels over 1000 flights Sunday says issues in Florida triggered nationwide disruptions

They tell ABC7 News in a statement ""We experienced weather challenges in our Florida airports at the beginning of the weekend challenges that were compounded by unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region triggering delays and prompting significant cancellations for us beginning Friday evening.""

But the FAA has denied any current issues saying there have been no major air traffic control issues since Friday.

Despite the crazy weekend for many Southwest passengers other airlines haven't experienced issues to the same extent.

On Sunday alone Southwest canceled over a quarter of all their scheduled flights. That compares to less than 2% by competitor American Airlines.

In a separate statement issued Sunday the union representing Southwest pilots denied the issues were caused by the company's recent vaccine mandate- rumors of which have been circulating online.

They said ""There are false claims of job actions by Southwest pilots currently gaining traction on social media and making their way into mainstream news. I can say with certainty that there are no work slowdowns or sickouts either related to the recent mandatory vaccine mandate or otherwise.""

Following a morning of issues as of Sunday evening Southwest flights flying out of Oakland airport were operating almost as normal.

And the airline says it's working diligently to address remaining problems.

But that's still little comfort for some travelers like Demitri Samaha.

""It'd be nice if they answered the phone or at least you know try to get you another flight"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vd2hhdC10cmF2ZWwtY29tcGFuaWVzLXVzZS1wYXltZW50LXBsYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Airlines Allow Travelers To Pay Gradually So You Can Escape Now And Pay Later,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRyYXZlbC5jb20vd2hhdC10cmF2ZWwtY29tcGFuaWVzLXVzZS1wYXltZW50LXBsYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnRvbnJlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL2Frcm9uLWNhbnRvbi1haXJwb3J0LW1hcmtzLTc1LXllYXJzLWV5ZS10b3dhcmQtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWdyb3d0aC82MDEwODI2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akron-Canton Airport marks 75 years with eye toward passenger growth,"GREEN – The number of people flying commercial airlines in the United States has increased over the past year but still trails pre-pandemic levels according to statistics collected by the Transportation Security Administration.

In recent months more than twice as many people have passed through TSA checkpoints around the country each day than during the pandemic in 2020. But this year's figures still fall below traveler numbers reported in 2019.

Officials at Akron-Canton Airport expect it will be April or May before passenger numbers at the local airport recover from the hit taken because of coronavirus pandemic.

Before the pandemic 60% of the travelers passing through Akron-Canton Airport were taking business trips said Ren Camacho president and chief executive officer. These days business travelers account for less than 10% of the passengers.

""We're trying to get business travel back"" Camacho said.

Businesses aren't ready however to put employees into airplane seats he added.

Marking 75 years

But there is hope as Akron-Canton prepares to mark its 75th anniversary this coming week.

Breeze Airways launched service at Akron-Canton during the summer while American and United have plans to add flights in the coming months.

On Wednesday travelers will be greeted by airport employees as part of a thank-you event. Complimentary refreshments prizes and swag will be offered.

The day marks 75 years since the federal government turned the Akron-Canton Airport over to local officials in Stark and Summit counties.

The Civil Aeronautics Authority selected farmland bordering the two counties as a spot for a modern airport. The federal agency invested $2 million to buy land and build three 5600-foot runways then gave the property to the commissioners of Stark and Summit counties.

""War seldom produces many community benefits but a brainchild born during the last conflict was 'adopted' by grateful citizens ..."" Ardent Cullison wrote in The Canton Repository the day after the airport's dedication Oct. 13 1946.

The new airport didn't have a terminal. A permanent terminal was built in 1955 and expanded in 1962. The expanded terminal and tower built in the early 1960s has been renovated several times but still is used today.

Airlines moved to Akron-Canton in 1948. United and American were among the first and both still serve the airport with daily flights. Spirit and start-up Breeze Airways also provide flights.

Passenger service at Akron-Canton reached its height in 2012 when more than 1.8 million people used commercial service. But that was before airlines began merging eventually dropping to only four major carriers.

The big blow for Akron-Canton was Southwest Airline's acquisition of AirTran which has been the primary carrier offering low-cost service to Boston Milwaukee and other cities visited for business travel.

Slow recovery from pandemic

Passenger numbers were showing signs of rebounding in early 2020 before the pandemic.

Camacho said businesses remain hesitant to travel in part because of travel restrictions between some countries. While Akron-Canton doesn't have international service it connects with major airports that do.

A regional air service task force that includes large businesses and other organizations has been created in a bid to gauge when air travel might resume Camacho said. Along with discussing general travel plans the task force is monitoring sporting events and concerts to see if people are ready to visit large crowded venues.

Working with the task force has led to projections that business travel will accelerate next spring Camacho said. Airlines are paying attention to the trend.

American Airlines will resume service to Philadelphia in November. United Airlines has plans to resume service to Houston in April thanks to an $850000 federal Small Community Air Service Development grant.

Still targeted by Akron-Canton is the resumption of service to Atlanta by Delta Airlines.

A commercial air service restoration program started by JobsOhio will help fund efforts to bring new service. Camacho worked with local governments businesses and private organizations to generate more than $1 million as matching funds for the state program.

Editor's note: This story was updated on Oct. 11 to correct the amount of local funds pledged to the JobsOhio program.

JobsOhio played a role in bringing Breeze Airways to Akron-Canton and Columbus. Breeze currently serves three markets from Akron-Canton but Camacho hopes the new airline will be adding destinations as it grows.

""Slowly but surely we're getting service back"" Camacho said.

Modernizing for the future

Although passenger numbers have declined the airport has worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to modernize operations over the past 15 years.

A new string of gates opened in 2006. In 2008 the airport launched a 10-year program that included expansion of the TSA screening area additional parking and expanded entrance roads and improvements in the ticket wing.

Behind the scenes it extended the north-to-south runway added U.S. Customs and Border Patrol facilities and replaced the aircraft rescue and firefighting maintenance facility.

The final piece was the extension of the gates built in 2006 and demolition of gates dating to the 1960s. Work on the gates was completed during the pandemic.

Smaller projects have included adding charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking area.

A charging station also has been installed for electric aircraft. Camacho said the airport is part of a project testing electric aircraft. Meanwhile airlines have been investing in development of electric aircraft anticipating future use of the equipment.

Aside from being a center for travel Akron-Canton is home to industrial parks a museum dozens of businesses and even a candy factory. The facility supports hundreds of jobs and has potential for creating more.

The airport is a huge asset for the region said Ray Hexamer president and CEO of the Stark Economic Development Board. Companies that consider locating in the region always ask about transportation including air travel.

""Having that 10 minutes up the road is an advantage when we are working to bring a business to Stark County"" Hexamer said of the airport.

Existing companies also take advantage of the facility. Timken Co. FirstEnergy J.M. Smucker Co. and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. have company aircraft and hangars at the airport Camacho said.

There also are fixed-base operators — Avflight and McKinley Air — at the airport that service privately owned airplanes. Castle Aviation provides freight and charter service from facilities at Akron-Canton.

The industrial parks on the southern and western sides of the airport are home to hundreds of jobs. Hexamer said having the property available provides an opportunity to draw more companies and jobs to the area.

Camacho said revenue generated through non-aeronautical operations such as the industrial parks help to keep make the airport more affordable for commercial airlines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnM4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGh3ZXN0LWZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWFmZmVjdGluZy10cmF2ZWxlcnMtaW4tc2FuLWRpZWdvLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC1rc2FuLXNkaWEvNTA5LWFiMmJlYThiLTczMzgtNDU0MS1iZjZmLTMzZGZlOWEyMjM3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest flight cancellations affect travelers in San Diego,"On Saturday the airline canceled a total of 808 flights across the United States; as of Sunday afternoon they had canceled over 1000 more.

SAN DIEGO — Southwest Airlines customers at San Diego International Airport and across the country experienced a large number of cancellations this weekend.

The airline said in a Facebook post that due to air traffic control issues and disruptive weather that a large number of flights would be canceled across the U.S.

Customers who were affected by cancelations were asked to rebook their flights by visiting Southwest's website.

The Whitsett family of San Diego booked a Southwest flight from San Diego to Kentucky with a layover in Chicago for this weekend. The trip was planned around attending a soccer game on Sunday.

“[It was a ] perfect flight all the way to Chicago"" said Carson Whitsett.

However it was a different story when the family arrived in Chicago and boarded their second flight.

""One of the Southwest employees came on and announced the flight was canceled"" said Whitsett in a Zoom interview. ""You know how Southwest kind of jokes around sometimes? So we were like 'ha ha' but no. They were serious.”

The family decided to book a rental car but when those were unavailable as well they got creative and booked an eight-hour Greyhound bus ride to Kentucky.

“Lots of Greyhound memories"" said Whitsett.

According to Flightaware the Southwest Airline issues are primarily impacting the Denver and Dallas airports. However it disrupted Tori Steib's vacation. Steib had a tripped booked from Atlanta to San Diego for Sunday.

""It’s my fall break from school"" said Steib. ""I’m a high school teacher so I was looking forward to getting away [and] having a relaxing trip. I received a text message from Southwest saying my flight had been canceled.”

Steib said she was on hold with Southwest's customer service phone line for eight hours on Sunday to ask about requesting a refund.

The airline issued an updated statement Sunday that read



""We experienced weather challenges in our Florida airports at the beginning of the weekend challenges that were compounded by unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region triggering delays and prompting significant cancellations for us beginning Friday evening. We’ve continued diligent work throughout the weekend to reset our operation with a focus on getting aircraft and Crews repositioned to take care of our Customers.

With fewer frequencies between cities in our current schedule recovering during operational challenges is more difficult and prolonged.

We’re working diligently to accommodate our Customers as quickly as possible and we are grateful for their patience. We’re offering Customers added flexibility to explore self-service rebooking options on Southwest.com where they can get updates on the status of their travel. We know the frustration flight cancellations are creating for our Customers and Employees and we apologize and we again thank everyone for patience as we work first to be safe and second to be as quick as possible in solving disrupted plans.""

USA TODAY reported Sunday that the FAA responded earlier in the day to the claims saying the weather and air traffic control issues were limited to Friday afternoon. The FAA did not name Southwest specifically in its response.

“Some airlines continue to experience scheduling challenges due to aircraft and crews being out of place” the FAA statement read according to USA TODAY. “Please contact the airlines for details about current flight schedules.”

SDIA reported at least 47 Southwest flights were canceled there over the weekend including 27 flights on Sunday according to Flight Aware.

""Why isn’t it other airlines?” said Steib when she responded to the statement.

Air Traffic Control (ATC) issues and disruptive weather have resulted in a high volume of cancellations throughout the... Posted by Southwest Airlines on Saturday October 9 2021

On Saturday the airline canceled a total of 808 flights across the United States; as of Sunday afternoon they had canceled over 1000 more.

The canceled flights accounted for 28% of Southwest's schedule which was the highest rate by far of the major U.S. airlines. Next in line were Allegiant and Spirit which had respectively canceled 5% and 4% of their flights on Sunday according to the flight tracker. American Airlines canceled 2% of its flights.

The union representing Southwest pilots said in a Saturday statement that its members were not participating in ""any official or unofficial job actions"" and placed at least part of the blame on the airline.

""Our Pilots will continue to overcome SWA management’s poor planning as well as any external operational challenges and remain the most productive Pilots in the world"" the statement read. ""They will continue to be focused on their highest priority — safety. SWAPA Pilots are true professionals and will always maintain the highest level of responsibility to their crews their passengers and our airline.""

The nationwide cancellations came after the airline announced this week that the company will now require employees to get the COVID-19 vaccinated by Dec. 8. It was unclear whether this impacted the high volume of cancellations across the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vZHJpdmUvbW9iaWxpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS13aGF0LWRvLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdXNhZ2UtYmFzZWQtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWZvci15b3VyLXZlaGljbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What do you need to know about usage-based insurance for your vehicle?,"I’ve been hearing about usage-based insurance plans that track how you drive and give you discounts if you’re a decent driver. Can you also end up getting higher rates if you’re a bad driver? I thought it was only an American thing but do we have it here? – Jan Markham Ont.

Usage-based insurance is a little like having your insurance company in the car with you.

It tracks nearly everything you’re doing on the road including how hard you brake how fast you accelerate and whether you break the speed limit and even whether you use your phone.

It’s been in Canada since 2013. Up until this year insurance companies could use telematics apps on your phone or devices that plug into your car to reward good drivers by lowering rates.

But until this year they couldn’t punish bad drivers by raising rates.

“It’s been around for a while but until this year most companies did not do it…they didn’t like it” said Adam Mitchell a broker with Mitchell & Whale in Whitby Ont. “Only really great slow self-conscious drivers would opt into it.”

But the rules have changed in Ontario and Alberta to allow companies to raise rates if for instance you regularly speed. Now more companies now offer usage-based plans.

At least eight companies including Desjardins Intact Travelers and TD offer programs that score how you drive said Matt Hands director of insurance at Ratehub a financial comparison site.

While the plans reward you for good driving – with discounts as high as 30 per cent depending on the company – only two impose a surcharge for bad driving Hands said.

“Just Travelers and Desjardins are doing that” Hands said. “But it’s only a matter of time before other companies adopt that model.”

Why many auto shops won’t install customer-supplied parts

Can I get a ticket if someone else is using my phone while I’m driving?

Bad drivers pay more?

With those penalties you could end up paying more for insurance than you do under your current plan.

How much could your rates go up if the app says you’re a lousy driver?

With Travelers’ IntelliDrive they could go up 10 per cent over what you’re paying now. With Desjardins’ Adjusto they could go up 20 per cent.

Several companies will give you an initial 10 per cent discount for joining Hands said.

Then the apps will typically use your phone’s GPS and motion sensor to watch your driving for a set amount of time to determine a driver score.

With the companies that could potentially penalize you you could get a bigger discount lose that ten per cent discount or pay more depending on your score.

Desjardins for example sets your score after six months and at least 1000 km of driving. Then it keeps watching your driving and adjusts your score every year.

With Desjardins for instance if you’re paying $2500 a year now you could save up to $625 – 25 per cent – for good driving.

Or you could end up paying $500 a year more – 20 per cent – than you’re paying now.

But it’s not just how well you drive – the apps can also look at when and how often you drive.

For instance if you’re driving at times where there’s a greater risk of accidents – at night for instance you could see an increase.

Insurance companies also see shorter trips as less risky than longer ones.

Opting out?

So what happens if you change your mind and decide that you don’t want your insurer to be a backseat driver?

You’ll lose the discounts. But you could keep any penalties.

On its website Desjardins says if you opt out of the program before six months have passed and you’ve driven more than 1000 km they can use any score “below 60″ to set your rates in the future.

If it’s been more than six months and you’ve already been given a penalty it will stick with you.

“At any time you are encouraged to enrol again in the program and start a new trip analysis period to once again attempt to improve your driving” the site said.

But that score shouldn’t follow you to another insurance company Hands said.

“The only thing that carries with you from one provider to another provider is accident history as far as I know” Hands said.

Right now there are limits on how long at-fault crashes or traffic tickets can affect your insurance rates.

“Through regulations your insurance company is not allowed to know about your conviction four years ago” Mitchell said. “They can track it for three years but any longer they have to bleach their systems.”

But Mitchell said it’s still not clear how long companies can keep your driving information from telematics apps – and how long they can use it to set your rates.

“It’s still the Wild West” Mitchell said. “It’s kind of like the people who grew up making bad decisions on Facebook that stuck with them – they have a permanent record of how you drive.”

Despite the uncertainty usage-based insurance might appeal to newer drivers who would normally have to wait years for their rates to go down.

“You can get way ahead” Mitchell said. “If you’re a new driver with a less than great record you could advance yourself a year or two in discounts.”

The stock gained 6.68% for the week after laying out plans to double revenue by 2030 while expanding profit margins on its quest to become the world’s top electric vehicle maker at the company's Investor Day.

GM'S BARRA TO BECOME FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE

""The vehicle is really becoming a software platform"" Barra told FOX Business’ Grady Trimble in a one-on-one interview. ""We think we have some of the most beautiful vehicles that we've had on the road in my career but then also being able to have a complete software and services business on top of that opens up tremendous growth with a very different margin structure.""

The company plans to rapidly scale EV manufacturing with more than 50% of North America and China plants capable of EV production by 2030. Among the new fully electric offerings will be trucks from Chevrolet GMC and HUMMER Buick crossovers as well as the Cadillac LYRIQ and CELESTIQ. Electric versions of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox are also in the works. The Equinox will be priced around $30000 much more affordable than previously announced EVs from General Motors.

GM has announced a goal of going all-electric by 2035. Right now however EVs make up only about 3% of GM’s new vehicle sales. It is also taking on Tesla and Ford.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the stock to $65 from $59 and Credit Suisse maintained its $75 target while issuing positive commentary on the plan.

The stock has gained over 40% this year.

When asked whether the company is moving too quickly to manufacture vehicles consumers aren’t sold on Barra said ""We have done tremendous research with the customer and they tell us if the vehicle's beautiful if it meets the functionality… that there is the right range over 300 miles and that there’s a robust charging infrastructure they’re in on electric vehicles.""

These vehicles will be equipped with new software and services including its new hands-free driving technology Ultra Cruise which will be offered starting in 2023 and be able to handle 95% of driving scenarios.

GM is also focused on growing its electric delivery vehicle company BrightDrop and its autonomous vehicle company Cruise.

Two shorter-term issues impacting General Motors are infrastructure talks in Washington DC and the computer chip shortage which has been plaguing automakers for months.

General Motors new vehicle sales dropped 33% year-over-year in the third quarter largely because of the chip supply chain problems. Barra said she expects chip supply to begin stabilizing in the fourth quarter and continue to do so in 2022.

""We were hit may be harder than most because some of the specific facilities in Malaysia were heavily impacted by COVID"" Barra explained. ""We had a team of people there. We shared our safety protocols to enable them to safely get people back to work and that's why we have confidence as we move forward we're going to start to see more and more recoveries.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYWdhemluZS5jb20vaG9tZS1nYXJkZW4vMjAyMS8xMC93YW50LXRvLWxvdmUtd2hlcmUteW91LWxpdmUtb3VyLTIwMjEtYmVzdC1kZXNpZ25lcnMtaW4tZGFsbGFzLWNhbi1oZWxwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to Love Where You Live?

“There’s not going to be those first time nerves because I did go through it last year and got that experience” Anderson said. “So I think it’s going to be channeling that energy from the crowd and not getting too over-hyped and just sticking to my game.”

The Braves fell to the Los Angeles Dodgers that night in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series but Anderson gained extraordinary experience starting a big game. The 23-year-old says he carried it with him into this season.

Ian Anderson took the mound in the Atlanta Braves’ biggest game last October.

The Braves won three of the four playoff games Anderson started in 2020 but last year’s games were played at neutral sites because of the pandemic. On Monday the right-hander from New York pitches in front of a home crowd at Truist Park in Game 3 of this year’s division series with the Milwaukee Brewers. The Braves and Brewers split the first two games in the best-of-five game series with Atlanta winning Saturday night.

Anderson had a strong September after missing half of July and most of August with a shoulder injury.

“I feel like I’m in a good spot repertoire-wise and delivery-wise so I feel good going into it” Anderson said.

Braves’ manager Brian Snitker continues to have confidence in Anderson.

“The kid has so much upside and the make-up and how he handles things and the confidence in himself and just the realistic outlook he has on everything” said Snitker. “I think he’ll use the emotion and energy that’s out there [Monday] to his advantage.”

Monday will be the Braves’ first home playoff game since 2019. The team finished second in the league in attendance this year averaging 29000 fans per game.

“It’ll be loud here and a lot of energy” said Snitker. “It’s what these guys signed up to do. They appreciated all year long. The support we’ve had here at home has been really really good.”

Game 3 Monday begins at 1:07 p.m. Game 4 of the series is on Tuesday also in Atlanta.

But the Milwaukee Brewers hitting coach is not convinced this is all there is to see.

""I'll say it until the last pitch is thrown. I want 'Yeli' up there"" Haines said Sunday after the Brewers held a brief workout at Truist Park in preparation for Game 3 of the National League Division Series against Atlanta on Monday afternoon.

""He's got another gear man he does. I don't know how to prove it but we all know it. 'Braunie' (Ryan Braun) had it. 'Yeli' has it. 'Lo Cain' (Lorenzo Cain) has it. I always say they get paid all that money for a reason. It means they've done it a lot. There's just another gear in there and he has it.""

Since missing five weeks early in the season with a lower back issue Yelich has been unable to find that gear however. Specifically his power has all but disappeared particularly of late.

More:Freddy Peralta dreamed about playing in the playoffs as a youngster. Now he's starting Game 3 of the NLDS vs. the Atlanta Braves.

More:With offense doing so little the Brewers are fortunate to be tied at one game apiece in the NLDS

In 117 games this season Yelich batted .248 with nine home runs 51 runs batted in a .373 slugging percentage and .736 OPS with the latter two figures career lows. He appeared to be making progress in August (.829 OPS) but slipped badly in September batting .221 with one homer 10 RBI and a .620 OPS.

Over his last 36 games Yelich hit just one homer on Sept. 24 against the New York Mets. Before that he had not homered since hitting two in one game against Washington on Aug. 21.

In the first two games of the NLDS which were split by the Brewers and Braves Yelich was 1 for 6 with two walks and three strikeouts. With Yelich no longer a driving force in Milwaukee's lineup other players need to step up and do some damage and Haines believes they will.

""Our guys have done that this season; they've stepped up"" Haines said. ""Whether it's Avi (Avasaíl García) Willy (Adames) Kolten (Wong) 'Lo' Cain. Don't go to sleep on 'Lo' Cain. He's hitting down in the order. This guy watch him when he walks up to the (batter's) box. It's different.""

Asked if Adames has been the same since returning from a quadriceps injury in late September Haines said ""Not as consistent. It's been there in flashes but it's not been consistent. He hit an impressive opposite-field home run (in Los Angeles) and an opposite-field double (in Game 2 against Atlanta). Those are good signs for him.

""Our lineup has done it. We haven't relied on one guy all year. So for me it's not going to be any different in the postseason. With 'Yeli' and 'Lo' Cain I'm telling you it's in there.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvYnJhdmVzLXR1cm4taWFuLWFuZGVyc29uLWNydWNpYWwtZ2FtZS0zLXZzLWJyZXdlcnMtMjAyMS0xMC0xMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braves turn to Ian Anderson in crucial Game 3 vs. Brewers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/braves-turn-ian-anderson-crucial-game-3-vs-brewers-2021-10-10/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvYnJhdmVzLXR1cm4taWFuLWFuZGVyc29uLWNydWNpYWwtZ2FtZS0zLXZzLWJyZXdlcnMtMjAyMS0xMC0xMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdG9tYWhhd2t0YWtlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzEwL2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLW1heC1mcmllZC1leHRlbnNpb24tY2FuZGlkYXRlLW9mZnNlYXNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves: Is Max Fried an Extension Candidate this Offseason?,

The freshman quarterback entered Saturday night’s game at Virginia Tech (3-1) after three drives by starting quarterback Jack Coan ended with three punts.

The 6-foot-1 215-pound Buchner flipped a 10-0 deficit for No. 14 Notre Dame (4-1) into a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. The Hokies added a 52-yard field goal by John Parker Romo as time expired in the first half to cut the Irish lead to 14-13.

► Secret starter:Jack Coan remains Notre Dame's starting QB against Virginia Tech

Buchner a four-star recruit out of San Diego connected with senior wide receiver Kevin Austin Jr. for a 46-yard pass on his fourth snap leading the Irish offense against the Hokies. Buchner finished his first drive with a three-yard touchdown run the first of his career.

After a three-and-out on his second drive Buchner led a nine-play 80-yard touchdown drive in just 59 seconds. His eight-yard touchdown pass to running back Kyren Williams gave Notre Dame a 14-10 lead with 32 seconds left in the second quarter.

Buchner finished the first half 5-of-8 passing for 101 yards and one touchdown with five carries for 26 yards and one touchdown.

Notre Dame’s offense managed just 17 total yards with Coan in the game. He was replaced by Buchner after completing two of his three passes for 15 yards and being sacked twice.

Buchner played in three of Notre Dame’s first five games mostly as a change-of-pace quarterback with a run-first intent. He was also slowed by a hamstring issue suffered in the Purdue game.

In his first three games Buchner rushed 14 times for 100 yards and completed three of his six pass attempts for 78 yards including a 55-yard touchdown to running back Chris Tyree.

Coan entered Saturday’s game with 1100 yards nine touchdowns and three interceptions on 91-of-150 passing (60.7%).

The Irish won a thrilling game 32-29 over the Hokies — and it was wild.

Brian Kelly started with Jack Coan at quarterback but after one quarter of ineffectiveness Tyler Buchner was brought in for the rest of the game.

While Jack Coan struggled in his first three drives with three 3 and outs and a grand total of 16 yards Virginia Tech slowly built up a 10 point lead. On their second drive the Hokies put together an 8 play 80 yard drive that ended with a 7 yard Raheem Blackshear rushing touchdown. The next drive for the Hokies garnered 59 yards and ended with a 19 yard field goal.

Tyler Buchner’s insertion into the game gave life to the Irish and they drove the ball down the field 75 yards in 7 plays. Tyler Buchner got a 3 yard rushing touchdown but it was a big 46 yard pass play to Kevin Austin that set everything up.

With less than two minutes to go in the half Notre Dame went 80 yards in under a minute for another touchdown — an 8 yard receiving score from Buchner to Kyren Williams.

The Notre Dame defense collapsed at the end of the first half and the Hokies put together a short drive to knock in a 52 yard field goal to end the half with Notre Dame up 14-13.

The Hokies went down the field on their first possession of the second half but the Irish defense was able to hold on third down and Virginia Tech kicked another field goal to go up 16-14.

Notre Dame and Tyler Buchner went three and out on their first 2nd half drive but when the ND defense came back on the field TaRiq Bracy stepped in front of a Burmeister pass for an interception. The Irish scored on a short field (29 yards) with a 10 yard rushing touchdown from Kyren Williams that saw him bounce off several would be tacklers.

After stopping the next Hokie drive short the Irish got the ball back deep in their own territory. That’s when Tyler Buchner threw an interception to Waller that he took back for a touchdown. A failed 2 point attempt made the game 22-21 Virginia Tech.

The turnovers kept happening and Virginia Tech picked off another Tyler Buchner pass late in the 4th quarter. On third down Burmeister ran it in for a 19 yard touchdown to put VT up 29-21 with less than 5 minutes to go.

Tyler Buchner was hurt on the interception play so Jack Coan returned to the field for the next drive. Calmly and smoothly Coan found Avery Davis several times and ultimately for a touchdown to make it 29-27 VT. Notre Dame went for two to try and tie it up and after a mad scramble by Jack Coan Kevin Austin streaked all the way across the other side of the field to pull down a prayer from the running quarterback to tie it up at 29.

Notre Dame forced the Hokies to punt the ball after 8 yards on three plays and they got the ball back at 25 with 1:56 left in the game. Notre Dame drove it down to the 30 yard line and Jonathan Doerer came in for a 48 yard field goal — which he drained with 17 seconds left in the game.

Tech did nothing with little time. Game over.

Wisconsin graduate transfer Jack Coan will remain No. 14 Notre Dame’s starting quarterback for the sixth consecutive game. Head coach Brian Kelly refused to announce a starting quarterback ahead of the game at Virginia Tech (3-1) but Coan took the majority of the warmup reps with the starting offense in Lane Stadium prior to kickoff.

Notre Dame (4-1) used three quarterbacks the previous week in a 24-13 loss to Cincinnati. Coan started freshman Tyler Buchner played in parts of three drives and sophomore Drew Pyne played all but one snap in the second half.

► Noie:One loss by Notre Dame football and the whole world just gets weird

Kelly said Tuesday he wasn’t hiding the quarterback decision for a competitive advantage.

“I’m more interested in what we do more than I’m trying to hide something from Virginia Tech” Kelly said. “They’ve seen all three play. They’re pretty smart. They can figure it out.”

With Notre Dame trailing Cincinnati 17-0 at halftime Pyne helped the Irish get back in the game in the second half. But his performance wasn’t enough to complete a comeback. Pyne finished 9-of-22 passing for 143 yards with a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Braden Lenzy. Pyne also rushed four times including one sack for 10 yards.

Coan completed 14 of his 22 passes for 143 yards in the first half against Wisconsin. An interception thrown near the goal line wrecked Notre Dame’s promising opening drive. Buchner also threw an interception early in the second quarter.

Coan’s lack of mobility behind a struggling offensive line was a problem for the Irish in the first five games. On 32 carries including 20 sacks Coan gained 48 yards and lost 122 yards for a net of negative 74 yards rushing.

Pyne’s six carries in four quarters of action included 18 yards gained 24 yards lost and two sacks. Buchner’s running ability has been clear — 14 rushes for 100 yards — but his passing ability hasn’t been obvious. Buchner completed three of his six pass attempts for 78 yards including a 55-yard touchdown to running back Chris Tyree.

Coan entered Saturday’s game with 1100 yards nine touchdowns and three interceptions on 91-of-150 passing (60.7%). Pyne was 15-of-30 (50%) for 224 yards and two touchdowns in his two game appearances against Wisconsin and Cincinnati. Pyne entered the Wisconsin game in the third quarter when Coan injured his ankle.

Planners expect much of the growth will occur in western Benton County along major highways that exist or will soon exist.

Jeff Hawkins executive director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission noted that the area also is closer to the majority of jobs that are going to be available -- at companies such as Walmart and its suppliers at J.B. Hunt in Benton County and at Tyson Foods in northern Washington County.

The land is flatter west of Interstate 49 and is less expensive to develop he said.

[POLL: What do you think about recent plans for sustaining growth in the area?]

Hawkins said the growth is going to follow the infrastructure availability.

""That's a high-growth area between [I]-49 and say [Northwest Arkansas National Airport] and the area out that way. If they get sanitary sewer and they have adequate water out there and they address the roads infrastructure that's going to be a very high-growth area. That's going to fill in"" he said.

The bulk of the region's population lives and works along the I-49 corridor in or near the four largest cities. Planners expect those cities will begin to see more in-fill and vertical development -- taller buildings -- to achieve more density.

Unlike in most metropolitan areas no single city dominates the region and the four large cities of Northwest Arkansas are expected to remain the population centers planners say.

""In 25 years we'll have potentially four cities with over 100000 population two of those with potentially over 150000 population"" said Tim Conklin assistant director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. ""We're not showing one individual city becoming a big central core city. We'll have a polycentric region.""

People will go to the smaller cities and towns when the large cities run out of affordable land Conklin said. Northwest Arkansas has 27 other municipalities he noted. Fayetteville is the largest city but represents about 18% of the region's overall population Conklin said.

""You look at what I would call our big urban core cities -- Fayetteville Springdale Rogers Bentonville -- and the growth that they have seen but now those types of numbers are occurring in Elm Springs Cave Springs Tontitown Centerton adjacent to the major urban cities"" he said.

The sprawl will mean changes in the traditionally agricultural use of the land and in the culture of more rural living.

Mayors of the smaller towns note they already are growing but acknowledge that a newer larger wave is coming.

Most have tried to prepare.

GOING WEST

State highway officials are considering a new road to connect the Bella Vista Bypass and the Springdale Northern Bypass or U.S. 412 via Northwest Arkansas National Airport. The 2040 Northwest Arkansas Metropolitan Transportation Plan proposes such a north-south connector.

A study is looking at a huge oval-shaped area west of Bentonville and Arkansas 112 and east of Springtown Decatur and Gravette. It goes from the Bella Vista Bypass in the north to U.S. 412 in the south. The airport sits roughly in the middle.

Widening and improving Arkansas 112 building an access road to the airport and completing the U.S. 412 Springdale Northern Bypass are projects planned for the area.

Gravette has three exits along the I-49 Bella Vista Bypass which opened Sept. 30.

""It'll only be a few minutes down the road and that's what we're seeing people are moving in developers are looking in this area"" said Gravette Mayor Kurt Maddox.

Maddox said he took office in 2017 and was told then that the city needed to prepare for westward expansion.

""That's when we started preparing started looking at what we want the city to be like"" he said.

Maddox said the city has redone sidewalks and Main Street completed water and sewer infrastructure projects paved roads and focused on parks and the community center.

Twenty-five miles to the southeast Cave Springs has grown from a small town on a winding country road a decade ago to being recognized by the state as a city of the first class in the shadow of the metro area according to Mayor Randall Noblett.

Cave Springs officials expect growth to continue as Arkansas 112 is widened and made into a major four-lane roadway that will likely skirt the west side of town improving access to the area.

""We approved 18 subdivisions with more than 1850 lots in a city of 1100 people"" Noblett said. ""That's why we were able to grow after 2008 -- infrastructure to a large degree was put in place.""

Census data and estimates for small cities around the Bella Vista and Springdale bypasses show the towns have had large population increases since 2010.

Michelle Rieff mayor of Highfill said the proposed north-south connector would open up the area for growth.

""We know that road is going to come through Highfill. We don't exactly know where"" she said. ""But that is going to change Highfill drastically.""

Rieff said she expects the new roadway to drive development south of the airport and that the city wants to facilitate that growth by putting infrastructure in place.

WATER AND SEWER

Having enough water and wastewater treatment capacity will be an ongoing -- and expensive -- challenge in a region where smaller communities have historically struggled.

Bethel Heights West Fork Decatur Pea Ridge Cave Springs and Centerton have all grappled with the issue. Cave Springs adopted a sales tax and one of the primary reasons was to allow for sanitary sewer Hawkins said.

Perhaps no community is likely to see as much change as Highfill in the coming years. Long a tiny farming community it is now home to Northwest Arkansas National Airport and is largely a blank slate on which to build a city. The proposed north-south connector could provide needed access.

Rieff said Highfill has lots of open land and some of the few large parcels left in the county.

""I see industry developing on the west side of the airport. There's been some interest already"" Rieff said. ""That might be a manufacturing company. It might be some industry that complements the services of the airlines at XNA. I see a lot of housing.

""Our problem though is the money for the infrastructure"" she said.

Without a business or industrial base the city collects little sales tax and has limited property taxes to pay for wastewater facilities Rieff said. Highfill does have its own sewer system but the system is restricted by the state to 400 homes.

""We have one subdivision that we are about to finish that has 400 homes"" Rieff said.

Highfill depends on developers to put in the infrastructure needed for subdivisions she said.

""The big developers like us because we're easy to work with and they know we want to grow"" she said.

Highfill pipes sewage to Centerton and ultimately on to Decatur Rieff said.

One potential solution is a regional approach to wastewater -- something like the Beaver Water District has done with drinking water.

To that end some cities created the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority in 2002. The authority built a regional wastewater treatment plant in Bentonville that came online in 2010 and it's planning an expansion. The authority has nine member cities and three -- Bentonville Tontitown and Elm Springs -- currently send wastewater to the plant for treatment. Cave Springs is working toward doing so as well. The other member cities are Centerton Highfill Lowell Springdale and Rogers.

Joining is expensive. A town could spend more than $500000 to hook up to the facility plus having to build all or part of a line.

Sewer capacity is one of the first factors that developers look at when considering building in a community. They may look elsewhere if there's not enough capacity or if the system needs a major upgrade in order to provide service to a piece of property according to Hawkins.

Hawkins said wastewater systems can require costly and time-consuming fixes and a town's development can stop as the facility is brought back into compliance.

A lot of the region's treated wastewater goes into the White River which flows into Beaver Lake -- the main source of drinking water for Northwest Arkansas. Fayetteville's eastside plant discharges into the White River. Fayetteville also provides wastewater treatment services to Elkins Farmington Greenland and the southern part of Johnson and its growth areas.

Huntsville also discharges treated wastewater into the lake.

Other plants discharge into the Illinois River or its tributaries. The Illinois is considered a scenic river in Oklahoma which has generated lawsuits in the past.

LAND RUSH

The four big cities have annexed land around them for decades. Over the past 20 years or so smaller cities have extended their boundaries as part of an overall land rush.

Cities in Benton and Washington counties have increased their size by 33518 acres since 2006 according to the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. Gravette's land area in Benton County grew 280% mostly from one annexation in 2012 commission records show.

Mayors of larger cites nearby were saying 15 years ago that their five-year plans included absorbing Cave Springs Noblett said. The town had to grow to survive he said.

""We are no longer that little city"" Noblett said. ""And Arkansas sees us no longer as a small town.""

Cave Springs had 5495 residents as of the latest census making it the fastest-growing city in Arkansas by percentage since the 2010 census Noblett said. It's the 63rd-largest city in the state moving up 82 spots.

""We've got 21 cities that share at least one common boundary line"" Hawkins said.

Some cities have failed in their attempts to grow by annexation but the efforts are expected to continue.

Cave Springs lost its bid to annex an unincorporated area in July. The proposed annexation of about 2800 acres included land between Cave Springs and Highfill.

Decatur unsuccessfully tried in 2019 to annex land along Arkansas 102 to the east Arkansas 59 to Bethlehem Road to the north and the east side of Arkansas 59 to the south including the newly built Simmons poultry processing plant.

Residents of the Hiwasse community asked Gravette to annex them in 2012 -- and Gravette agreed to do so -- when Bella Vista declared its intention to take them.

One area of Benton County that already has been the center of a dispute bordered Rogers and Cave Springs on the east Bentonville on the north and Highfill on the west.

The Rogers City Council voted in 2017 to hold an annexation election so it could obtain about 3175 acres west of the city. The largest portion included nearly 2838 acres between Rogers and Highfill along with a smaller tract farther north.

Property owners petitioned Bentonville instead. The Bentonville City Council accepted a request from 39 property owners in the area to annex. The move cut a 2-mile-long and quarter-mile-wide strip out of a 4.4-square-mile area that Rogers had hoped to annex.

Rogers sued to stop the Bentonville annexation but lost. Cave Springs also was trying to annex some of the land.

GROWING ANXIETY

Mayors of the smaller cities welcome the growth but want to limit the changes it brings. Regional leaders talk about managing the growth to avoid common urban woes.

""I do hope that our growth is better planned and we don't have some of the problems that you find in other fast-growing areas like Austin [Texas] where traffic is a nightmare and housing has gotten expensive"" said Mike Harvey chief operating officer with the Northwest Arkansas Council.

""For some of these smaller communities you're going to see more people that have lived there less than five years than people that have lived there their entire lives"" Conklin said.

Noblett said he hopes Cave Springs can become a destination area with events such as craft fairs music festivals and amenities like nice restaurants.

""I think a big part of that is embracing the historic downtown"" he said.

Noblett said he'd like for new or replacement buildings downtown to be state of the art inside but look like the early 1900s buildings that surround them.

Maddox noted that Gravette residents have experienced the growth firsthand.

""It's a lot of change for the people living here too. Our job is to manage that understanding that growth is coming but try to maintain that hometown feel as much as you can"" he said.

Rieff said Highfill is a place where people want to live and that she expects housing options to range from smaller lots to multifamily housing to larger estates.

""Some people don't want change but I think the change will be for the better"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzMzOTA3LWZvcm1lci10ZXNjby1ib3NzLXRvLWhlbHAtYm9yaXMtam9obnNvbi1maXgtdWstc3VwcGx5LWNoYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Tesco Boss to Help Boris Johnson Fix U.K. Supply Chain,"Dave Lewis the former boss of Tesco Plc will advise U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on how to fix the supply chain crisis that is crippling many parts of British business.

The executive who spent most of his career working at Unilever Plc before turning around Britain’s biggest supermarket will help address problems that have led to “acute short-term issues” such as petrol and food shortages the government said in a statement Friday.

Lewis will suggest immediate steps and any necessary long-term changes to the U.K. supply chain. He will co-chair a new Supply Chain Advisory Group consisting of external experts and an Industry Taskforce to try to ensure efficient resolutions. He will work closely with No. 10 and the treasury and will be in the role until the end of the year.

British businesses are under increasing strain from post-Brexit labor shortages particularly of truckers combined with higher shipping costs shortages of carbon dioxide and soaring gas prices. Concern is mounting that the combined price shocks will push up food prices and damp consumer sentiment which bounced back strongly after the easing of lockdowns earlier in the year.

The growing supply chain crisis and increasing calls from companies to allow more truckers from the European Union to return to work in Britain has led to a deterioration in Johnson’s relationship with businesses. Last week the prime minister attributed labor shortages to years of under-investment in skills by companies that have been able to “mainline low-wage low-cost immigration.”

“Dave brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains” Johnson said in the statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qb3BsaW5nbG9iZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2FzLW1pc3NvdXJpLWhpc3BhbmljLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZ3Jvd3MtYnVpbGRpbmctdHJ1c3QtaXMta2V5LXRvLWJyaWRnaW5nLWN1bHR1cmFsLWdhcC9hcnRpY2xlXzI2YWY3MmFlLTI1MjMtMTFlYy05Y2YyLTZiNWQxMjliODg2OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Missouri Hispanic population grows building trust is key to bridging cultural gap,Missouri Independent is part of States Newsroom a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a public charity.

Three years ago it would have taken a brave man to predict Tyson Fury would once again stand on the verge of becoming world champion.

He was the washed-up fighter who put the heavy in heavyweight as he scaled a staggering 400lb just over two years since his stunning upset of Wladimir Klitschko.

Having struggled to cope with the fame and fortune which came this way - not to mention the public's dislike of a divisive and controversial character - Fury had descended into a drink and drug-fuelled depression.

On his darkest day he took his Ferrari for a spin and almost drove it into the wall before thoughts of his fatherless family dragged him back from the abyss.

Fury's now former trainer Ben Davison recalls the moment he saw his future pupil whip out a bottle of Patron in the lift and take a swig before noon.

But soon after he received a text from the former world champion which signalled the start of an incredible transformation.

Reflecting on his weight loss last year Fury told Joe Rogan: ""I was eating a lot and drinking a lot and I just stopped that stuff.

""My weight was put on through drinking excessive lager. There are 500 calories in a pint of lager and I would go out and drink 18 of them followed by whisky and vodka then I'd stop off on the way home and eat pizzas and kebabs.

""Before I was doing a lot of long running and long boxing work like 12-15 rounds on the pads. When I was losing the weight I was doing shorter explosive stuff doing more interval training.

""My diet was the most important thing you can train like a Trojan warrior but not eat right and take three steps forward and two and a half back.""

With Davison's softly-softly approach Fury began to shed the pounds.

""People don’t really know the extent of where Tyson as at the very beginning"" the rookie trainer told the Telegraph.

""He was in a bad place. It was very bad. Sometimes I used to look across and think I don’t know if this job can be done. I genuinely did think that as did many others.

""He put his trust in me because everyone was asking why he’d hired me. I had to put my trust in him by leaving my gym at home and make a commitment to him.

""We made a commitment to each other and we’ve ended up here. It’s been a tough and long road but we’re here now. It’s been a good journey.""

Slowly but surely the pounds began to fall off and Fury could see the light at the end of the tunnel as he began to consider a comeback.

He announced his return for the summer of 2018 when he stopped Sefer Seferi before outpointing Francesco Pianeta but his comeback was not quite perfect as he was denied victory against Wilder when the judges scored the fight a draw.

But any fears that Fury would again struggle to cope proved unfounded as he changed his trainer - and his gameplan - for last year's rematch.

Taking the fight to Wilder from the first bell Fury dropped him twice before the American's corner threw in the towel in the seventh round.",,,

A little later in the week than we usually get to this but it’s time to take a look back at the history between the Minnesota Vikings and their opponent for this week. On Sunday the purple will suit up for the first of their six NFC North matchups of the season as they play host to the Detroit Lions at U.S. Bank Stadium and at the risk of sounding disrespectful the Lions have given the Vikings plenty of opportunities to “get right” over the course of their history. We’ll be hoping for something similar on Sunday afternoon.

As always the numbers used in this story are brought to you by the good folks at Pro Football Reference.

Regular season games between the Lions and Vikings : 119

: 119 All-time record : Vikings 78-39-2

: 27 points 19 November 1961 (final score 37-10 first game between the two teams) Current streak: Vikings 7 wins

The Vikings have more victories over the Detroit Lions than over any other franchise in NFL history. In fact if the Vikings were to get swept by the Lions every year for the next 19 years the Vikings would still have a record of over .500 against the Lions. That’s pretty darn good I think.

These two teams met twice during the 2020 season with the Vikings extending their current winning streak over Detroit to seven games. The two teams met at Ford Field to finish up last season in a game that didn’t mean anything to either team. It was a relatively exciting game with the two teams exchanging the lead back and forth all afternoon. A controversial. . .well as controversial a play as one can have in such a game. . .touchdown by Kirk Cousins gave the Vikings a 37-29 lead late in the game (after a Dan Bailey miss on the extra point). Detroit then got a 2-yard touchdown run from D’Andre Swift to put themselves in position to tie but the Vikings’ defense denied the two-point conversion attempt. Neither team scored again and the Vikings escaped with a 37-35 victory.

Last year’s game in Minnesota was significantly less exciting. as the Vikings took a 20-10 lead into halftime on the strength of a pair of Kirk Cousins touchdown passes one to Irv Smith Jr. and the other to former Lions running back Ameer Abdullah. Smith got his second touchdown catch of the day early in the third quarter to extend the lead and after the Lions got another field goal from Matt Prater Dalvin Cook put the game on ice with a big 70-yard touchdown run. Detroit got another late touchdown but it wasn’t enough to prevent a 34-20 victory for the good guys.

Speaking of Cook in order to find the last time the Lions beat the Vikings in Minnesota. . .or anywhere else for that matter. . .you have to go back to what was a pretty dismal day for #33. It was Week 4 of the 2017 season and Cook was putting together what looked to be an outstanding rookie season including a touchdown run to give the Vikings an early 7-3 lead over the Lions. Then with the Vikings leading 7-6 midway through the third quarter Cook was hit during a run suffered a non-contact injury and fumbled the football back to the Lions tearing his ACL on the play and putting an end to his season. The Lions scored on their next drive on a touchdown run from Ameer Abdullah and held on for a 14-7 victory at U.S. Bank Stadium. That actually pushed their record to 2-0 in the Vikings’ new building as the purple didn’t manage to get a home win over the Lions at the new digs until 2018.

The Lions are coming into this weekend’s game pretty banged up and the Vikings need to get themselves corrected and on the right path for the rest of the 2021 season after some tough losses. Here’s hoping that the Honolulu Blue and silver give the Vikings an opportunity to “get right” once again this Sunday."

Now you can have an Uber ready and waiting as soon as you step off the plane.

Uber has expanded its Reserve service to select U.S. airports including Phoenix Sky Harbor allowing travelers to book rides via Uber Black or Uber Black SUV up to 30 days in advance for a smoother and more efficient travel experience.

Once you land the driver will wait up to 60 minutes for no additional charge at a convenient curbside pickup location.

No sweat if your flight happens to be early or delayed —Uber will automatically adjust your reservation based on the flight information you provide so your driver is ready and waiting at the airport when your flight lands.

Uber Reserve is also currently available at 19 other airports across the country including Atlanta (ATL) Charleston (CHS) Charlotte (CLT) Chicago (ORD and MDW) Dallas (DFW and DAL) Denver (DEN) Fort Myers (RSW) Houston (IAH and HOU) Miami (MIA FLL and PBI) Nashville (BNA) New Orleans (MSY) New York (JFK and LGA) Orlando (MCO) Philadelphia (PHL) Seattle (SEA) and Washington DC (DCA and IAD).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvbmV4LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjAtdGhvbWFzLWFuZC11YmVyLWN1cC1pbi1mdWxsLXN3aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2020 Thomas and Uber Cup in full swing,"ERROR: All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL2xpdmUtYmxvZy90aG9tYXMtdWJlci1jdXAtMjAyMS1kYXktMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thomas & Uber Cup 2021 LIVE BLOG – badminton: Schedule & results – day two.,"As it happened: Thomas & Uber Cup 2021 Day 2 - Denmark make quarters in Uber Cup China begin Thomas Cup defence with win

Fourteen-time winners China who will be aiming to avenge a disappointing outing in the last Uber Cup proved their superiority with a 5-0 win over Malaysia in Denmark.

Such was China's dominance on the day they did not even drop a game across all five matches as they cruised to their second victory of the Uber Cup.

The closest contest of the day came in the opening one.

India bested Spain in a tight affair despite Saina Nehwal having to retire after losing the first game 22-20 to Clara Azurmendi due to injury.

That put India in a hole but wins in the singles for Malvika Bansod and Aditi Bhatt as well as a straight-games win in the doubles was enough to overcome the early disappointment.

Thailand showed their qualities in a 5-0 win over Scotland.

Like China later in the day Thailand did not drop a game on their way to a comfortable victory.

Crucially Canada's only win in the contest came in the final match Wen Yu Zhang coming from one game down to beat Line Kjærsfeldt.

Her research has taught her two things.

Firstly the Housing First model – where rough sleepers are given a home alongside support to help them keep it – is key to ending homelessness.

Secondly a lot of the solutions to homelessness are already in place they just need “joining up” which is why Varle landed on the concept for Socially Homes.

“I think everybody expected me to come back with some crazy new innovations when it came to homelessness” added Varle.

Amy Varle lived in a homeless hostel when she was 16. Here experience inspired a 20-year mission to end homelessness. Image: Amy Varle

“Actually what I always say is the solutions are already out there already. They’re just not joined up and when they do join up they often don’t know how to work together.

“What we’re trying to do is bring everybody on to a bit of a level playing field and say actually we all have a piece of the jigsaw here we all have an equal part of the jigsaw you know and this is the value in this service.”

During the pandemic Varle has been working with other experts to create best products of reducing homelessness and developing an online community from the charity sector and investment sector as well as housing and homelessness service providers.

The expertise also comes from people with experience of homelessness according to Varle who insisted those who have lived on the streets will be paid as consultants for offering up their knowledge.

Varle claims the network has already created housing and support solutions for almost one thousand vulnerable individuals across Britain.

Next year she will take the model to the US with Socially Homes’ first ‘Global Gathering’ conference to be held in California in the spring.

The model has already been given the backing of experts in the UK.

Tony McKenzie Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s senior participation officer said: “I am super excited about the launch and especially the digital tech-for-good platform because social housing has been in need of innovation that is companionate and sustainable to address homelessness.”

Big Issue Contribution Your support today will connect individuals living in poverty to the vital resources services and opportunities needed to begin their journey to a new future. You will be supporting individuals in key areas including housing finance mental health and employment. Contribute now

Varle’s model comes at a crunch time for the Westminster government and the target to end rough sleeping by 2024.

The Big Issue has warned that thousands of people are facing homelessness in the months ahead due to rising energy prices and taxes as well as falling support as the end of the furlough scheme and the universal credit £20 uplift begins to bite.

The Big Issue has launched the Stop Mass Homelessness campaign to prevent surging homelessness. Find out how you can get involved here."

The drama between the two costars first began several weeks back when Mia 36 called Candiace's music video ""low budget"" and Candiace 34 hit back with ""Your mama's low budget.""

The comment was particularly loaded for Mia who unbeknownst to Candiace has opened up on the show about being placed in foster care as a child and having a strained relationship with her mother.

The ongoing tension came to a head when the cast took a couples' trip to the Chesapeake Bay resulting in the food fight between Mia and Candiace who continued to double down on her comments about Mia's mom while not knowing the full backstory.

In the latest episode Candiace's husband Chris Bassett pulled her away from the fight while an emotional Mia sat down with Karen Huger and Wendy Osefo to process what had occurred.

""She can talk about me all day long — don't talk about my mom"" Mia said. ""My mom has worked way too f------ hard. You got to understand being a little girl who was left behind I had to fend for myself for my entire childhood. She has never been a mother to me but she has worked her ass off to get to where she is today.""

She continued ""Her sobriety is everything to me. I'll be damned if I let a little f------ chihuahua take that s--- from her and if my mom relapses because of that bitch she better catch my ass outside I will tell you that. You don't talk about anybody's mom what the hell?""

Later Candiace expressed some regret once she learned Mia's story.

""I didn't know"" she told Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon. ""And I learned later and I saw the hurt in her face but did she see the hurt in my face? Questions that need answers I don't know.""

""I heard she was crying really badly"" Gizelle 51 noted though Candiace seemed to have no idea about the emotional fallout. ""Was she crying badly? Was she really?"" she said.

""If I had known about Mia's mama trauma and her traumatic childhood I would have just you know read her big-ass hands or her feet or something"" Candiace added in a confessional. ""I wouldn't have talked about her mom.""

As the episode went on one explosive fight led right into another when Ashley Darby brought up the drama during a group dinner.

""So I have to ask you Chris how do you feel about what happened earlier today in between Mia and Candiace? Did you want to come in and like help and de-escalate the situation?"" Ashley 33 asked Chris.

""Ashley Ashley Ashley — we were doing so well!"" Gizelle told the cameras in anticipation of what was about to unfold.

Chris shared that he had spoken to Candiace about the fight but then turned the conversation to Ashley's husband Michael Darby who was not present on the trip. Chris and Michael have feuded in the past along with their wives who have a long history of tension.

""Michael referred to Chris as white trash"" Candiace said.

""You called him a slave driver. Isn't that worse than calling somebody white trash?"" Ashley said while a past tweet of Candiace's that called Michael an ""overseer"" appeared on screen.

""Because he drives his slaves"" Candiace said turning the conversation into a true screaming match.

""You have no idea how to be a civil human being you really don't"" Ashley said.

""The common denominator in both of these situations is Candiace"" she added in her confessional. ""It just really bothers me that she wants to play the victim instead of acknowledging and taking ownership.""

Candiace also brought up Ashley's past support of former costar Monique Samuels amid the legal drama between Candiace and Monique 38.

Candiace said Ashley ""played a major part"" in the drama though Ashley replied ""No ma'am I did not.""

""I will never talk about it with you because you are a foul f----- up individual"" Candiace added.

""Candiace she didn't start anything last year"" Gizelle chimed in.

""But she got herself involved in some legal s--- to be a vindictive bitch"" Candiace said.

That increase led the hospital to examine ways to expand access to mental health care an issue that regularly tops needs assessments in many communities. By late 2019 Holland Hospital opened an area adjacent to the emergency room specifically designed for the growing volume of patients with severe depression anxiety suicidal thoughts psychotic symptoms substance use disorder and other mental health conditions.

In opening the six-bed unit Holland Hospital recognized that the emergency room was an integral part of the mental health system and sought to provide a better setting to assess and treat those patients said Joe Bonello Holland Hospital’s vice president of nursing.

“Those patients were already coming to the emergency department and coming in increasing numbers. We were lacking a space that was well designed both to be therapeutic for those patients and to provide a safe environment for the patients and for the staff” Bonello said. “It really was the first step for us toward expanding our behavioral health services and it was in response to a rapidly growing need in the community.”

When first opened in November 2019 Holland Hospital’s mental health emergency room served about 140 to 150 patients a month. Today the unit averages 200 patients monthly Bonello said.

The unit shows how health care providers have sought to address the rising number of patients who need treatment for a mental health condition.

In Grand Rapids Spectrum Health and Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services partnered in November 2020 to open a unit known as EmPATH — short for Emergency Psychiatric Assessment Treatment and Healing — adjacent to the Butterworth Hospital emergency room for patients seeking help for a mental health condition.

The Butterworth and Holland units operate with the same goal: Providing a specialized setting to care for people with a mental health condition who come into an emergency room which Bonello said is “probably about the worst environment you could be in when you’re in a behavioral health crisis.”

Alternative sites

In the last 12 months Holland’s mental health emergency room treated 3350 patients about a quarter of whom required admission for their condition either to the hospital’s inpatient unit or to another psychiatric facility Bonello said.

The units at Holland and Butterworth are each designed with a soothing aesthetic and low-stimulation quiet environment that’s intended to calm a patient in the middle of a mental health episode.

“ERs are chaotic and a lot of our patients are in significant turmoil in their life” said Dr. Subodh Jain division chief of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Spectrum Health. “The emergency room is non-conducive to their immediate treatment.”

Staffed with social workers nurses and mental health professionals the Butterworth and Holland units gave both hospitals a better setting to evaluate and treat mental health patients. That also frees up needed beds in an ER where medical staff are often not adequately equipped to properly assess and treat mental health patients.

In forming the six-bed EmPATH unit that sees about 100 patients a month Spectrum Health and Pine Rest also sought to reduce hospitalizations by getting patients into treatment immediately Jain said. That can sometimes alleviate the need for their transfer to an inpatient psychiatric facility.

Between 65 percent and 70 percent of EmPATH patients are discharged home within 24 hours with plans for follow-up care Jain said.

Capacity shortage crisis worsening

The mental health crisis and need for increased access to care exists on both the outpatient and inpatient levels care providers say.

Quite often a mental health patient who needs inpatient care in a psychiatric facility will wait hours and sometimes days in an ER bed until they are transferred to an appropriate setting.

Holland Hospital recently had a patient wait four days in the mental health emergency room before they were transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit “and that’s certainly not the first time that’s happened” Bonello said.

The situation reflects the inpatient capacity shortage that stems from a need for more beds and a shortage of mental health care professionals.

“We can’t do this on our own. We really need more providers who can help with this. We’re doing everything we can to meet the needs of the community and still the demand far outweighs the resources that we have available” Bonello said.

The Holland Hospital mental health emergency room and the EmPATH unit at Butterworth Hospital offer new settings for care in a crisis that providers say has worsened in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Care providers say they’re seeing more people than ever with anxiety and depression brought on by the pandemic.

“We all have limits on our coping abilities” Bonello said. “We’re just seeing that everybody’s been pushed to the brink and then one more thing happens and it pushes them beyond the ability to cope. The baseline stress is higher for everybody and so as a result we’re seeing more.”

Spectrum Health and Pine Rest began discussing the EmPATH unit just prior to the pandemic’s onset Jain said. He describes the present demand for mental health care as “humongous.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has at least created greater awareness about the mental health care crisis he said.

“The pandemic just highlighted the problem to the extent that I think it was a call on all of us to do something about it especially with the (emergency departments) being flooded by other patients” said Jain who questions how well care providers can sustain new mental health programs without higher reimbursements from insurers.

New facilities planned

To address the mental health crisis care providers plan to develop a number of new inpatient psychiatric facilities across the state including in Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo.

Kalamazoo-based Bronson Healthcare has partnered with Franklin Tenn.-based Acadia Healthcare Co. to develop a new 96-bed psychiatric hospital in Battle Creek. Construction was to start this fall on the $35 million facility planned at Glenn Cross Road and M-66 that will integrate physical and mental health care. When opened in early 2023 the new facility would provide inpatient behavioral health care for adults from the aging Fieldstone Center in Battle Creek.

Mercy Health and an Auburn Hills-based operator of psychiatric hospitals plan to build a new facility in Kent County through a joint venture. Havenwyck Hospital Inc. — an affiliate of Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services Inc. — received tentative state approval in the spring for a 60-bed adult inpatient psychiatric hospital.

That project’s approval has been appealed by Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services which had a competing project denied by the state.

Pine Rest last week did get temporary approval from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for an emergency request for a 40-bed inpatient psychiatric unit that could transition between serving adults children and adolescents.

Pine Rest this month also filed an application with the state to add 16 beds to an existing 162-bed inpatient unit at the Van Andel Center on its 68th Street campus in Gaines Township that would flex between adult and adolescent needs.

The mental health care provider wants to add inpatient capacity as demand for care increases said Harmony Gould Pine Rest’s vice president for hospital and residential services. Pine Rest has been running occupancy rates about 80 percent since July 2020. The number of people turned away when inpatient units are full has doubled in the pandemic Gould said.

“As we’re seeing occupancy go up over the last 20 months we’re just trying to respond to community needs” she said. “We’re just busy all of the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYm1jd29tZW5zaGVhbHRoLmJpb21lZGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLjExODYvczEyOTA1LTAyMS0wMTQ5OS040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mapping the health systems response to violence against women: key learnings from five LMIC settings (2015–2020 ...,"Key summaries

Table 1 summarizes the key findings from the five settings—Bangladesh Brazil Nepal Rwanda and Sri Lanka. While all five LMIC settings have implemented in-service training as key to addressing provider knowledge attitudes and practice significant gaps remain in addressing frequent staff turnover provision of training at scale and documentation on the impact of training. Health system protocols for VAW address sexual violence but do not uniformly include clinical and health policy responses for other forms of violence such as emotional or economic violence. Providing privacy to survivors within health facilities remains a universal challenge. Nepal’s health system response to VAW represents the most comprehensive rollout across key components. Protocols exist for providing a health systems response which includes 24-h operationalization of One Stop Centres (OSCs; which are called One-Stop Crisis Management Centers or OCMCs in Nepal) appointment of designated staff provider sensitization and training on clinical response. Further the VAW data is centrally recorded and managed through the Health Management Information System (HMIS). Community engagement for identification of survivors and referral to support services is a prominent part of Nepal's health systems response [20 29 31 34 35]. [OSCs provide multi-sectoral case management for survivors including health welfare counselling and legal services in one location and will be described further in the following section.]

Table 1 Key summaries from health system response to VAW across five selected LMIC settings Full size table

1. Models of service delivery

Service delivery for VAW includes psychosocial support medical treatment multi-sectoral referral including within the health systems [15]. As seen across these five settings health system protocols for VAW specify medical services and supplies for response to sexual violence but do not uniformly include clinical and health policy responses for other forms of violence (such as emotional or economic violence) [313233 37 45].

In Bangladesh nongovernmental organization (NGO) clinics implemented a routine enquiry pilot for identification of violence among women seeking health services. The NGO Health Service Delivery Project (NHSDP) was a health service delivery project in Bangladesh funded by the United States Agency for International Development. This project supported the delivery of reproductive maternal and child health services through a network of rural and urban local NGO clinics that targeted poor and underserved women of reproductive age [28]. The NHSDP trained its staff on VAW including aspects of gender and women-centered care implemented a routine enquiry pilot and developed a national protocol on health response to VAW [28].

In Rwanda the Maternal and Child Survival Project applied quality assurance standards for VAW at OSCs nationally reaching over 1500 clinicians [30]. This work included routine enquiry for VAW integrated into family planning and antenatal counselling in 12 health facilities. Provider training did not include gender sensitization and key aspects of women-centered care [30]. Staff reported that disclosure rates of violence were extremely low (one to two percent in the first six months) of this routine enquiry pilot [30]. Providers reported feeling overstretched and overburdened while client feedback indicated that providers were insensitive when inquiring about violence. These challenges precluded the expansion of the routine enquiry intervention.

One-Stop Centers (OSCs) were found to be the most dominant model of care implemented by the health systems in four countries (Bangladesh Nepal Sri Lanka and Rwanda). An OSC provides multi-sectoral case management for survivors including health welfare counselling and legal services under one roof with the intention of minimizing referrals and the need to have survivors repeat their accounts [18]. In Bangladesh [33] Nepal [29] Rwanda [37] and Sri Lanka [32] OSCs are located within hospitals. While Brazil does not have OSCs hospitals around the country provide response to sexual violence including medical services and psychosocial counseling [38 46]. While Rwanda and Sri Lanka’s OSCs were set up by the health system the OSCs in Bangladesh and Nepal are set up as large multi-sectoral programmes with delineated health sector roles and responsibilities [26 29 33 37]. Outside of OSCs in all five countries hospitals in the health sector include response to sexual violence through medical services psychosocial counseling and referral as outlined in their respective health systems protocols [24 313233 37 45]. A summary of the models of care in each setting is shown in Table 2. Available details on client volume and services at OSCs in each setting are shown in Additional file 1.

Table 2 Summary of models of health services for VAW by setting Full size table

In all five settings staff at hospitals are designated and trained in protocols detailing response to VAW [25 313233 37]. Referrals to OSCs come largely from police and directly from communities (Additional file 1). Health system protocols for VAW specify that hospital departments especially emergency and specialized departments should refer clients for additional medical services [25 313233 37]. Gaps remain in training of health providers in identification of signs and symptoms of VAW [23 29 32 33 37].

In Brazil protocols include a team approach implemented to responding to VAW in which all medical cadres are deemed responsible for clinical response identification treatment and referral [23]. A violence prevention nucleus consisting of a social worker psychologist and nursing technician is responsible for multi-sectoral coordination training and surveillance of domestic violence cases at primary health clinics [38]. In Nepal and Sri Lanka responsibilities of health care providers include identification confidentiality and obtaining informed consent providing first aid and LIVESFootnote 1 history taking medical management medico legal services referral and follow up [31 32]. In Sri Lanka the public health midwife is tasked with identifying issues related to VAW and referring and connecting survivors to the health system. Specific to sexual violence medical officers are identified as responsible for medical management and response [32].

While a survivor-centered approach remains central to the framework of Health Systems Response to VAW reviews find that providers’ beliefs values and attitudes often restrict their provision of survivor-centered care [12 18 23]. In addition to insensitive provider attitudes towards VAW the use of traumatic procedures from health care providers among survivors have been documented [54]. In Brazil Nepal and Sri Lanka harmful practices such as virginity testing and assessment of hymen for sexual habituation remain within clinical protocols despite supportive policies on health system response to VAW [53].

A 2020 review of one-stop centers (OSCs) found that staff engaged in victim-blaming in most settings [18]. Though Brazil criminalizes domestic violence many health providers are “still reluctant to engage with the issue [23].” Even staff within violence prevention nucleus felt unprepared to respond to VAW and were uncertain about their roles and referral pathways for survivors [38]. Data from health providers in Rwanda showed acceptance and normalization of VAW [40]. Across all the five settings VAW particularly violence by the intimate partner/husband is normalized in society with 28 to 53 percent of women agreeing that wife-beating is justified for any reason across the five settings [54555657585960]. Health providers are part of the same society and commonly share the same attitude towards acceptance of violence and of blaming the survivor for the violence [61 62].

2. Health infrastructure

Providing privacy and confidentiality availability of medicines and other supplies constitute infrastructure. In all the settings data showed that providing privacy to the survivor emerged as a challenge. Additional challenges in all five settings included lack of furniture information and communication material instruments and medicines use of space and equipment designated for OSCs by other departments and excessive patient load leading to overcrowding [17 18 25 26 44]. In Nepal OSCs were ranked as providing better privacy and confidentiality than health facilities and this was attributed to the protocolized nature of VAW response at the OSCs. A score card used to rank OSCs in Nepal showed 82 percent of assessed OSCs operating with adequate space and equipment or supplies [34 35]. In all other settings infrastructural challenges included lack of adequate health provider training besides the lack of space to ensure privacy [17 18 25 26 44].

3. Health workforce training/development

Stakeholder training is built into the standard operating procedures for health systems response to VAW in all settings [21 313233 37]. Frequent staff turnover remains a challenge to capacity building on VAW response. Health provider training programs in Nepal focus on improving competency and skills; nurses are mandated to identify survivors and doctors to provide medical treatment and to report medico-legal cases [29]. Nepal addressed staffing gaps in its 2016 revised OSC Operational Guideline by appointing a minimum of one medical doctor and two to three staff nurses to the OSC for 24-h service availability [34]. A 2020 report on Nepal’s OSCs indicates that the majority addressed these staffing changes to be operational 24 h a day [29]. Following training on health systems response providers noted a new sense of responsibility they felt to support the survivor get justice while noting that doctors not being relieved from their regular duty if they have to attend a court hearing remains a challenge [29]. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and NGO partners in Bangladesh support the government in providing staff training; they have developed a screening checklist referral flow-chart counselling guideline and provided training to the providers for essential services in their clinic networks [28]. Monthly review meetings with health providers outreach workers and their supervisors are conducted. The National Protocol for Health Sector Response to VAW in Bangladesh requires health providers to provide psychological first aid to survivors medico legal examination and proper documentation [33]. Sri Lanka focuses on training and capacity building both for health providers and the public health midwife. Sri Lanka introduced VAW as a module for public health midwives focused on knowledge-building skill development for addressing and preventing VAW in the community as well as on positive provider–client interaction and communication [32]. Since 2015 the government in Rwanda has focused on strengthening and scaling its OSC model in all provinces improving documentation implementing quality assurance standards providing specialized support to children and adolescent survivors training providers on first-line support for survivors and post-GBV health care making appropriate referrals and strengthening referral pathways with help from its non-governmental partners [37].

In Sri Lanka health providers including medical officers nurses midwives and their supervisors are trained in response to VAW [32]. The medical officer for maternal and child health at the district level is tasked with coordination between district and divisional levels [32]. In Nepal the OSCs have designated staff for managing/responding to cases that come and usually a nurse or paramedic and a psychosocial counsellor [34]. Information on the process of designating a nodal person for managing VAW cases from the other three settings is vague.

While all countries reported that they train in-service providers there was no documentation on impact of training on provider knowledge attitudes or practices. In Bangladesh in addition to initial training the NGO Health Service Delivery Project integrated discussion on provider attitudes on VAW into monthly meetings between health staff and supervisors besides refresher trainings [28]. In Nepal a 2016 study indicated a lack of training and knowledge around VAW among health providers [19]. While impact data on provider change in attitudes resulting from training on VAW were not available staff nurses who received psychosocial counselling training noted how they have changed the language they use with survivors and have become aware of how to show sensitivity respect and empathy to survivors [29]. Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population introduced an in-service for medical doctors on autopsy and clinical medico-legal training although training has not been initiated in recent years. A pre- and post- intervention study of a training intervention for public health midwives on response to IPV in Sri Lanka found that role plays field handbooks and cultural sensitivity training were important components for an effective training program [17]. However impact data on provider change in attitudes was lacking.

However impact data on provider change in attitudes was lacking.

4. Leadership and governance

Government prioritization of resources and interventions is essential to changing practices. All settings have included VAW in their health policy and programmes. Responding to VAW became a health policy issue in Nepal in 2010 and the government developed a National Plan of Action against VAW that built in a health sector response. The National Plan foregrounded the need for building a multi sectoral health response for GBV [19]. The Ministry of Health plays a central role in executing this Plan and has standard operating procedures for OSCs detailing the management of the centres including infrastructure and resources and the pathways for rolling out a multi sectoral coordination [34]. In Sri Lanka the Family Health Bureau under the Ministry of Health is responsible for all VAW services that are provided by the state health system [32]. The National Policy on Maternal and Child Health describes the approaches and support for prevention and management of VAW and mandates capacity-building for health providers [26] as well as comprehensive health-sector based response in OSCs [22]. Bangladesh has developed a comprehensive protocol for the Women Friendly Hospitals Initiative which centrally acknowledges VAW as a health concern and developed a National Action Plan on Violence against Women 2013–2025 which outlines multisectoral coordination [41 43]. The multisectoral program on VAW is jointly implemented by the governments of Bangladesh and of Denmark and led by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs Bangladesh.

Rwanda criminalized VAW in 2008 and the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion developed National Strategic Plan for Fighting Against Gender-based Violence (2011–2016) [44]. Rwanda has a Gender Monitoring Office which has a mandate of monitoring compliance to gender equality principles [40]. From 2003 onwards Brazil rolled out gender based public policies to manage women victims of VAW in healthcare settings highlighting the primary health care (PHC) system as an important context [21]. In 2006 the country implemented the Maria da Penha Law which marks out domestic violence as a crime; the next year Brazil launched the first national policy on VAW delineating the role and goals for the health sector [27]. Other policies include the National Special Secretary for Women's Policies (responsible for developing intersectoral action plans focused on women targeting particularly health security education and reduction of violence) the National Policy to Combat VAW and the National Policy for Humanization in Health (focused on humanization of all health care approaches). These policies have been implemented into primary health care settings through the Family Health Strategy [21].

5. Financing

Fund allocation is required for service training of providers for VAW response for appointment of trained staff for running OSCs and providing other services for health system response and necessary infrastructure [5]. The funds for OSCs come from government ministries of health in Nepal Sri Lanka and Rwanda [26 34 44]. In Bangladesh the majority of funding for OSCs comes from international donors (including the Danish government for the Multi-Sectoral Programme on VAW) [33]. In Sri Lanka the OSC program is financed by the Ministry of Health while international donors are only in a supportive role [26]. The OSCs in Rwanda were initially co-funded by the United Nations and the Government of Rwanda [44]. Local-level prioritization is well placed in Nepal where each Village Development Committee allocates 15 percent of its budget for women’s issues with microplanning occurring through Health Facility Management Committees. Funds are available to reimburse the healthcare and legal expenses incurred by survivors even though complex regulations and administrative hoops challenge access [34]. Recent changes in the federal system in Nepal leave uneven funding of multi-sectoral services for VAW survivors such as safe homes and rehabilitation services [34 35]. In Brazil there is a national pact with rules of fund transference between national government and the states but the budget for VAW was hugely cut recently [25 63].

6. Health information system

Documentation and information management in Nepal includes VAW data recorded at the national level on two different platforms from all health facilities through the Health Management Information System (HMIS) and from the OSCs routed to the Prime Minister’s Office [35]. The VAW data is disaggregated along sex age type of violence caste ethnicity and disability [35]. Additional indicators note the services provided to survivors and referrals made. Rwanda and Nepal are the only countries in this study which report data on VAW through HMIS. Since 2012 Rwanda has worked on streamlining its quality of health data which is collected from the community health workers and health facilities to HMIS and has integrated facility-level as well as household-level data [30]. While the Multi-Sectoral Programme on VAW in Bangladesh indicates plans for a nationalized database on VAW such a database does not exist. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics collects household level survey data on VAW once every four years [33]. From the national VAW hotline non-identifiable data is accumulated on volume of calls types of VAW experienced and referrals [33]. In Brazil reporting on VAW is the responsibility of state and local authorities with data accumulated at sub-national levels [24]. Sri Lanka does not capture data on medico-legal cases nor reports through HMIS [26].

7. Coordination and community engagement

Coordination to facilitate internal and other sectoral referrals and community engagement are important axes of the Health Systems Framework to Address VAW. OSCs in Nepal have protocolized multisectoral coordination such as with the legal judicial and livelihoods. The referral pattern of OSC survivors shows community awareness about services as a portion of survivors reach OSCs directly [29]. In Sri Lanka’s 2016 Demographic and Health Survey 13 percent of surveyed women were aware of Mithuru Piyasa services [59]. In Sri Lanka since these centers are located within the hospital intra-facility referrals are relatively smooth though other-sectoral referrals are not formalized. Recognising the importance of engaging the community Sri Lanka prioritized the use of information education communication material with public health midwives responsible for community engagement. Given their access to the community midwives remain critical for identifying survivors especially those women who otherwise would continue to bear the violence in silence [17].

In the rest of the settings structured intersectoral coordination and referral are lacking. Changes within the federal system in Nepal have resulted in uneven funding of multi-sectoral services for VAW survivors such as safe homes and rehabilitation services [35]. The NGO Jhpiego oriented select community health volunteers in Nepal for identification and referral of survivors showing that with appropriate training and safety mechanisms community health workers can raise community awareness about VAW facilitate support for survivors and help prevent harmful practices [20]. In Bangladesh while the Multi-Sectoral Programme on VAW does not have an explicit community engagement component the initiative runs TV ads and radio spots for public awareness on the availability of VAW services [33]. The world’s largest NGO (Building Resource Across Communities or BRAC) as well as other NGOs have implemented programs focusing on improving community engagement and awareness of VAW though these services are not directly linked to the Multi-Sectoral Programme on VAW [36]. In Brazil networks of psychologists and social workers activists and women-led organizations increase awareness on VAW though efforts are not formally linked to available health services [24]. Rwanda’s Protocol on Treatment of Survivors of VAW demonstrates a model of inter-sectoral coordination for VAW and includes provisions for safety planning and community resources for survivors though formal coordination with other sectors for VAW support is not protocolized [37].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51bi5vcmcvZW4vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8xMC8xMTAyMjcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Make mental healthcare for all a reality urges Guterres,"Reminding that millions of people face grief over lost family members and friends that many are anxious over job security and that older people may experience isolation and loneliness Mr. Guterres said that “without determined action the mental health impact may last far longer than the pandemic itself”.

Children ‘alienated and distressed’

In his message for the Day the UN chief also highlighted that children and adolescents “may feel alienated and distressed” and called for action to address the inequality in access to mental health services.

According to the World Health Organization WHO around 20 percent of the world’s children and adolescents have a mental health condition with suicide the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds.

Tweet URL What’s on children’s minds should be on all our minds.COVID-19 has put the wellbeing of an entire generation at risk. Even before the pandemic too many children and young people carried the burden of mental health conditions without support. This must change. #OnMyMind UNICEF UNICEF

Earlier in the week the UN children’s agency UNICEF urged more investment on child mental health.

The latest edition of the agency’s flagship report The State of the World’s Children highlights that even before the crisis children and youth were already carrying the burden of mental health conditions and without significant investment in addressing them.

The past 18 months have been hard on children said Henrietta Fore the UNICEF Executive Director.

Inequality in treatment access

“In high-income countries over 75 percent of people with depression report that they do not receive adequate care and in low and middle-income countries over 75 percent of people with mental health conditions receive no treatment at all” continued Mr. Guterres.

Pointing to chronic under-investment as the main factor with governments spending an average of just over 2 percent of their health budgets on mental health the UN chief said it was simply “unacceptable”.

Positive Steps

Underlining that there is finally recognition that “there can be no health without mental health” he noted that Member States have endorsed WHO’s updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan.

In 2019 the UN health agency launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019-2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions in 12 priority countries serving 100 million more people.

During the World Health Assembly in May 2021 governments from around the world recognized the need to scale up quality mental health services at all levels and some countries have found new ways of providing mental health care to their populations.

“The United Nations family together with partners across the global mental health community are introducing new guidelines and developing new tools to improve mental health” Mr. Guterres added.

Long way to go

Concluding that “these are positive steps but we have a long way to go” the UN Secretary-General reiterated UN’s commitment “to work together with urgency and purpose to ensure quality mental health care for all people everywhere”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZHAub3JnL2luZGlhL2Jsb2cvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtYWxsLWxlYXZpbmctbm8tb25lLWJlaGluZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mental Healthcare for All: Leaving No One Behind,"Illustration: UNDP India

Last year Google Search trends for words like stress anxiety and relaxation reached their highest recorded levels in the search engine’s history. This was a direct impact of the COVID-19 crisis that bropught along with it another silent epidemic that has ravaged many – Mental Health issues.

Over the years the mental health of a population has come to be recognized as an important public health problem but the stigma associated with it still make it difficult for people to come forward and seek help.

The World Mental Health Day is commemorated every year on 10th October and this year’s theme is “Mental Health in an Unequal World” – an apt theme considering the growing disparity between 'haves' and 'have nots'.

Marginalized communities like sexual minorities people with disabilities the elderly the poor etc face mental health problems just like everyone else but their problems are exacerbated due to the prejudice stigma and discrimination they face. Often they are not able to afford or access quality mental healthcare.



Various research studies have shown elevated rates of major depression anxiety disorders Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the resultant substance use and abuse among these communities.

With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) UN Member States pledged to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first”. This is well reflected in the World Mental Health Day theme for this year which envisages making mental healthcare a reality for everyone.

Mental Health Care in India

While mental health care in India has been available since the 18th Century rapid improvement has been seen in this field in the last 30 years with active involvement of the Judiciary and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in monitoring the availability of infrastructure and human resources for mental health care.

However the availability of human resources for mental health for the population remains a challenge. In 2019 there were 0.3 psychiatrists per 100000 people in India compared to 2.2 in China and 10.5 in the United States and 0.8 mental health nurses per 100000 people in India compared to 5.4 in China and 4.3 in the US.

The National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) was started in 1982 with the objective of developing community-based mental healthcare in India. The NMHP has evolved over the years and is working to provide basic mental health services at the community level through multiple strategies like out-patient and in-patient services at Community Health Care (CHC) and Primary Health Care (PHC) centers satellite outreach clinics Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model services with financial support to NGOs technical and financial support to day care centers and residential centers etc.

The Government of India bolstered efforts in mainstreaming mental health by passing the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 which protects the rights of persons with mental illness including the Right to Mental Healthcare. The Act also clearly spells out that mental healthcare should be provided to all without any discrimination and in a manner that is acceptable to persons with mental illness and their families and caregivers.

Mental Healthcare of Marginalized Communities

People belonging to marginalized communities have their own unique challenges in accessing Mental Healthcare. Many among them belong to the lower socio-economic strata which affect their accessibility and affordability of mental healthcare. The provision of mental healthcare to these communities will require developing focus strategies to reach them and provide them quality mental healthcare.

For people with disabilities Mental Health services may be provided through PPP mode with NGOs (a model already being used under NMHP) that already work with this group. Further the Public Health facilities (CHC PHC) should make efforts for creating a stigma and discrimination-free enabling environment for these communities to access services.

Similarly for sexual minorities the Targeted Intervention Model (TI-NGO) used under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) may be useful to reach out to the communities. Recently Integrated Transgender Clinics are also being set up under this programme and mental healthcare can be part of the service package.

UNDP India is also working with NIMHANS to develop holistic psychosocial support training modules on LGBTQIA+ community mental health for services providers. Apart from the Public Healthcare System affordability is a major issue in the private sector. Therefore medical insurance should cover mental illnesses as it covers physical illness. Section 21(4)A of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 mentions this and it is slowly being implemented.

Further convergence with other relevant programmes e.g. Tribal Health Programme will be essential. Reaching the unreached communities with quality mental healthcare is critical to achieve Universal Health Coverage and to reach SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being - by 2030.

The development of the world’s first malaria vaccine is an important addition to the existing range of methods to prevent malaria. But it is a complementary control tool to be added to already proven measures for prevention a vital addition to options such as routine use of insecticide-treated bed nets indoor spraying with insecticides and the timely use of malaria testing and treatment.

But access to these methods to save lives has been far from satisfactory. Per the latest data 229 million people got malaria in 2019 the last year for which complete statistics are available and 409000 died – most of them children. While Asia has not been hit as hard as Africa it is endemic in Bangladesh Bhutan India Indonesia Maldives Myanmar Nepal Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Population movement and rapid urbanization both largely caused by unemployment and environmental deterioration among other problems change the pattern and increase the incidence of drug-resistant malaria. In southern Thailand for example 46 percent of rubber tappers are infected. It is the seventh most common cause of death in Thailand."

It was the worst oil spill Marathon Petroleum had seen in years. A crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline released 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana creek staining the banks of the waterway and threatening a population of endangered freshwater mussels.

The incident barely registered however in the performance reviews of Marathon’s top executives who earn part of their annual bonus by meeting environmental goals. Because these reviews account for the company’s number of significant oil spills in a year — not the total volume of oil — the Indiana spill counted as just one of 23 incidents in 2018.

The way Marathon evaluated its executives 2018 was the company’s best environmental performance in at least eight years. The board of directors awarded chief executive Gary Heminger $272251 for “excellence in environmental personal safety and process safety improvement.""

Many of the largest fossil fuel companies reward top executives for meeting environmental goals a compensation tactic they adopted over the past two decades as a response to regulators and investors concerned with pollution and worker safety.

But the way some of these incentive programs are designed allows companies to award executives their full bonuses even in years when the firms cause major environmental damage or total emissions go up according to a review of pay disclosures from six of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies and interviews with experts in compensation and environmental data.

Four of the companies — Chevron Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental Petroleum — have never missed their environmental targets in all the years they have publicly disclosed such goals filings show. And yet researchers who study environmental data for MSCI an investment analytics firm said three of the companies — Valero Phillips 66 and Occidental — still lag behind the industry average for reducing toxic emissions carbon emissions or both.

Marathon which only missed its environmental targets once in the past decade was rated average for toxic emissions and carbon emissions among oil and gas refining companies reviewed by MSCI.

“When you meet the metrics every year that suggests that the metrics haven’t been sufficiently challenging” said Rosanna Landis Weaver executive pay program manager for As You Sow a nonprofit group backed by foundation grants and individual donors that advocates for corporate social responsibility.

In some cases experts say companies are using metrics that don’t provide a full picture. Marathon’s focus on the number of environmental incidents across all of its operations means “very poor performance at one or two sites” — such as a large oil spill — “can be diluted by outperformance at other facilities” Trillium Asset Management an investor in Marathon that pressures companies to improve their social governance and environmental practices said in a letter to the company’s shareholders last year.

In emailed responses to questions Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said the company uses incentives to “measure the effectiveness of our environmental management system and drive continuous improvement in environmental stewardship.”

Another oil giant Occidental Petroleum has given bonuses to executives for investing in carbon-capture projects even as the company’s total carbon emissions have gone up filings and company emissions data show.

Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the company has pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and would soon begin evaluating executives on progress toward that goal. The carbon capture projects will “help both Occidental and businesses in other industry sectors to achieve shared net-zero goals.”

Lillian Riojas a spokeswoman for Valero said the company has “been able to meet our environmental targets because we have made very significant progress over the last decade"" in areas including safety and toxic air emissions.

Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said the company’s board has updated its annual bonus program three times in the past three years to add incentives for reducing methane flaring greenhouse gas emissions and investments in carbon offsetting.

Bernardo Fallas a spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment.

Critics say climate goals are usually such a small portion of bonus plans that they have little influence over executive behavior. When Shell made emission reduction goals 10 percent of its executive bonus last year some environmentally minded investors opposed the plan arguing that over 50 percent of the annual bonus was still based on growing the company’s production of gas.

The pay package “encourages executives to chase higher levels of fossil fuel output” said Simon Rawson a director at ShareAction a United Kingdom-based nonprofit that works to promote better corporate behavior and receives the majority of its funding through charitable grants.

This year Shell said it would make emission reductions a greater portion of annual bonus incentives and remove natural gas production goals completely. Anna Arata a Shell spokeswoman said the pay packages of 16500 employees partially depend on meeting companywide short-term emission goals.

The failure of some pay programs to promote better corporate behavior highlights a lack of oversight by corporate boards of directors who approve executive pay at publicly traded companies and are tasked with managing long-term risks such as climate change Rawson said. Even as many boards acknowledge this mandate — creating climate committees and designating sustainability chairs — they’ve failed to hold executives accountable for real action on environmental issues he said.

The energy industry’s experience is a cautionary tale for the broader business world. Dozens of large companies including Coca-Cola Walmart Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble have tied executive pay plans to environmental targets as they face pressure from investors to mitigate climate change said Mindy Lubber chief executive of climate advocacy group Ceres.

“CEOs do what they are paid to do” said Lubber whose Climate Action 100+ initiative pushes large companies to set carbon emission goals and have at least one senior executive’s pay tied to the company’s progress toward those emission goals.

But as evidence from oil and gas companies shows executives can score highly on environmental goals even when their companies have mixed track records on the environment.

During Heminger’s tenure as Marathon CEO from 2011 to 2020 climate advocates criticized the company for being slow to adopt a carbon reduction plan and for its role in orchestrating a Washington lobbying campaign aimed at loosening restrictions on vehicle pollution. Marathon says it was advocating for a review of the “feasibility” of current vehicle pollution standards and never took a position on whether changes to those standards were needed.

Pollution at Marathon refineries led to Clean Air Act violations and congressional scrutiny over toxic air emissions at a Detroit refinery where local residents have complained for years about the facility’s release of toxic chemicals which they believe contribute to a high rate of respiratory illness in their community.

In Marathon’s annual pay disclosures Heminger is credited with meeting or surpassing environmental targets during nine of his 10 years as CEO. He earned a total of $1.9 million for meeting these goals including added payouts for exceeding expectations in five of those years a Post analysis of energy company bonuses shows.

Heminger who retired last year declined to comment.

Marathon’s bonus system was questioned last year by Trillium Asset Management which saw a disconnect between the way executives were rewarded and the way company facilities had harmed communities in places like Detroit. The investor asked Marathon to publish a report exploring how it could better incorporate community concerns into its bonus system.

In a proxy filing Marathon’s board opposed the measure saying unlike its current quantifiable metrics community concerns “would be difficult to measure and audit.” The board said it had the power “to reduce or completely eliminate awards” if it finds “our performance in any area including our impact on the communities where we live and operate has been unsatisfactory.""

Trillium has since sold its shares in Marathon said Jonas Kron Trillium’s chief advocacy officer.

Under its bonus system Marathon classifies all spills air emissions permit violations and regulatory actions into four tiers based on their severity and only counts the most severe incidents in the annual bonus plan. Oil spills for example are only counted if they release 10 or more barrels into water or 100 or more barrels onto land.

By this measure the company has been fairly consistent: Every year from 2013 to 2019 the company experienced one or two pipeline oil spills of over 100 barrels according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

But these numbers fail to account for the larger impact of spills like the one at Indiana’s Big Creek — at the time Marathon’s largest pipeline spill by volume in seven years. Marathon sent around 80 responders to clean up the site according to Kevin Turner an on-scene coordinator with the Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to fund an effort to propagate the mussel population.

The release of 1400 barrels of diesel fuel into an Indiana waterway in 2018 was Marathon Petroleum’s worst spill in several years. It involved a crack in a 60-year-old underground pipeline. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Kheiry the Marathon spokesman said the company continually updates its technology and procedures to prevent oil spills and that this spill represented an “unanticipated risk"" because it was caused by bank collapse which usually doesn’t happen on flat terrain. The company recovered most of the spilled oil and cleaned up the banks of the creek. He said one bird died as a result of the spill and “there is no evidence that mussels were impacted.” He added that Marathon does try to account for the severity of incidents by using its tier system; the Indiana oil spill counted in the highest tier.

Because Marathon has grown its operations it’s hard to assess whether the company has reduced its overall environmental harm. In four different years Marathon counted a higher number of environmental incidents than the year before but Heminger got his full environmental bonus anyway because the board set higher limits for the number of incidents those years.

Marathon’s Kheiry said the company has grown significantly over the past decade including with its acquisition of oil refining rival Andeavor in 2018. Because it has more pipelines refineries gas processing plants and other facilities the company is exposed to more environmental risk and therefore its board sometimes raises the limits Kheiry said.

“We believe our record of reducing incidents at newly acquired assets and maintaining superior performance at our existing assets shows that the [compensation] program has been a success"" Kheiry said.

Marathon says its environmental metrics are checked by its internal auditing group but are not reviewed by any independent third party.

Some of the people who live near Marathon’s Detroit refinery say air pollution remains an ongoing problem in their community. Vicki Dobbins who lives blocks away from the refinery says her neighborhood still smells like “old garbage” due to gas emissions.

“You can sometimes ride through here and the air is so strong you have to hold your breath” Dobbins said.

After a release of toxic air emissions at the refinery in 2019 dozens of residents called local health officials to complain of a noxious gas affecting their breathing according to the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy which cited the company for causing a nuisance. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) convened a field hearing in Detroit and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform asked the EPA to investigate the problem of chemical leaks at the refinery.

Earlier this year Marathon settled with Michigan over 10 different environmental violations covering several incidents from the past four years agreeing to take new precautions including a community air quality website visible to the public. Tim Carroll an EPA spokesman said the agency conducted an inspection of the refinery in July of this year and “will share more information about it when it becomes publicly available.”

Marathon citing data from Michigan’s state pollution database said air emissions at the Detroit facility have declined 80 percent over the past 20 years and said the vast majority of air pollutants in that area of the city are now generated by other neighboring industrial facilities such as steel and automobile plants and a sewage treatment center.

The company says it’s working with residents of southwest Detroit. As part of its settlement Marathon agreed to install a new air filtration system at a public pre-k-8 school less than a mile from the refinery. Marathon says it also set aside $5 million this year to buy the homes of some residents who want out.

The threat of climate change has forced many companies to rethink their pay practices. Investors are pushing energy giants to go beyond pollution goals and incorporate carbon emission targets into CEO pay claiming that may be the best way to motivate executives to take the drastic actions necessary to meet long-term carbon reduction goals.

The challenge says U.K. researcher Dario Kenner is that oil executives are already hardwired to grow profits and revenue from fossil fuels which often means generating more carbon emissions. Kenner who researches wealth and climate change co-authored a study this year that found executives of BP Chevron ExxonMobil and Shell all have strong personal incentives to delay significant carbon reducing measures.

While Marathon Occidental Chevron and Valero all began linking executive bonuses to carbon emission goals within the past two years these companies all still incentivize executives to grow financial or production metrics such as earnings cash flow or total oil production filings show.

“If you have big chunky metrics that are linked to production and growth that is going to drive executive behavior” says ShareAction’s Rawson who helped lead the opposition to Shell’s pay programs last year.

For the past three years Houston-based energy giant Occidental has rewarded CEO Vicki Hollub a total of over $600000 for meeting the company’s environmental safety and sustainability goals the Post analysis of bonuses shows. These goals encouraged Hollub to make investments in carbon capture technologies which the company described as “an important feature of Occidental’s strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.""

[Carbon capture a climate change solution slowly gains ground]

But scientists say capturing carbon is energy-intensive and not yet contributing to a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. Rather than decreasing its emissions Occidental’s total carbon emissions from its direct operations grew by 30 percent from 2017 to 2019 according to company data.

The company’s efforts in carbon capture “have not yet translated into quantitative evidence in terms of overall improvement in the company’s performance for carbon emissions” said Antonios Panagiotopoulos a vice president at MSCI.

Moses the Occidental spokesman says its emissions numbers reflect an increase due to its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

La multinacional estadounidense Facebook anunció este viernes (08.10.2021) la prohibición de vender o comprar terrenos de áreas ""de conservación ecológica"" en el Amazonas a través de cualquiera de sus plataformas que incluyen Instagram y WhatsApp además de la propia red social.

""Hoy anunciamos medidas para frenar los intentos de venta de terrenos en áreas de conservación ecológica en la selva amazónica"" indicaron desde la empresa que dirige Mark Zuckerberg en una entrada en el blog corporativo.

Así Facebook cambió sus políticas comerciales y a partir de ahora revisará las ofertas que se publiquen en las plataformas para cotejarlas con una base de datos internacional de zonas protegidas por su importancia medioambiental.

La compañía con sede en Menlo Park (California EE.UU.) aseguró que continuará trabajando para evitar que la gente encuentre maneras de saltarse esta prohibición y siga comerciando con tierras en zonas de preservación ecológica en las plataformas.

A raíz de un documental emitido por la BBC en marzo pasado la Suprema Corte Federal de Brasil ordenó una investigación sobre la venta de áreas protegidas de la selva amazónica a través de Facebook.

Según la investigación numerosos anuncios proponían en Facebook Merkatplace la venta de parcelas de bosque amazónico de hasta varios centenares de hectáreas de manera totalmente ilegal.

Bloquearán anuncios

""Ahora vamos a comparar los anuncios que han pasado en Facebook Marketplace con una base de datos constituida por una organización internacional con autoridad sobre las zonas protegidas para identificar los anuncios que podrían infringir esta nueva política"" explicó el grupo en una nota de blog.

""Sobre la base de criterios específicos Facebook buscará identificar y bloquear nuevos anuncios en las zonas protegidas"" dijo el grupo en su mensaje.

""Con información complementaria como esta base de datos sumamos otro obstáculo para las personas que tratan de anunciar estas parcelas en el Marketplace"" agregó Facebook que precisa que se trata de las ""primeras etapas"".

Así lo confirmó el pasado jueves la ministra de Hacienda María Jesús Montero en una rueda de prensa posterior al Consejo de Ministros extraordinario donde presentó el proyecto de Ley de los Presupuestos Generales del Estado (PGE) para el año 2022. ""La prórroga que se había incorporado a la Ley de Presupuestos para la entrada en vigor era hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2021. Eso continuará hasta esa fecha pero no incorporamos ningún elemento más. Cuando termine el año se activa la Ley que había anteriormente que pretende regular esta materia con mucha más eficacia de la que tenemos actualmente"" aseguró Montero.

Este aumento conocido por el sector desde que entró en vigor la congelación del tributo en julio de este año llegará en un momento en el cual las ventas de vehículos todavía no habrán recuperado los niveles previos a la pandemia. En lo que va de año las matriculaciones de vehículos se han incrementado un 88% en tasa interanual hasta las 647.955 unidades pero si se compara con los datos de 2019 las ventas acumuladas caen un 33%.

Posibles enmiendas

No obstante la titular de la cartera de Hacienda confirmó que esto seguirá adelante pensando que el proyecto de Presupuestos no sufra enmiendas. Y es que eso fue lo que sucedió este año: una enmienda impulsada por el PDeCat en la Ley de medidas de prevención y lucha contra el fraude fiscal. En su documento el PDeCat buscaba un cambio en los tramos de aplicación del impuesto de matriculación para revertir la subida llevada a cabo el pasado 1 de enero cuando se incrementó el precio medio de los vehículos nuevos como consecuencia de la nueva legislación ambiental.

""La entrada en vigor de la normativa WLTP (más estricta) supondrá un aumento en el valor de emisiones oficiales ya que el dato es aproximadamente un 20% superior al vigente. De no corregirse esta modificación de carácter estrictamente técnico en España el impuesto de matriculación se vería inmediatamente incrementado y además para muchos modelos supondría perder la actual bonificación del impuesto"" reza el texto que ya fue presentado a finales de 2020.

Así quedará el nuevo impuesto de matriculación

Asimismo el portavoz del PDeCat en el Congreso Ferrán Bel indicó cuando se congeló el pasado mes de julio que si el mercado continúa sufriendo las consecuencias de la pandemia más adelante volverá a presentar una enmienda para mantener el impuesto de matriculación a niveles de 2020.

Desde la patronal de concesionarios (Faconauto) aseguran a elEconomista que esta alza ""supondrá en este momento un serio problema ya que se desmovilizará a muchos clientes como ya pasó en los primeros meses de este año"". Además consideran que ""vendrá a unirse a los problemas ya conocidos: falta de stock por la crisis de los chips y la inseguridad existente entre los compradores en esta transición hacia la descarbonización del parque"". Asimismo recuerdan que esta alza ""recaerá en el ciudadano medio"".

Por su parte el presidente de la patronal de la distribución (Ganvam) Raúl Palacios ha afirmado a este periódico que ""es importante extender la moratoria del cambio del impuesto de matriculación al menos hasta diciembre del año que viene porque el mercado está muy lejos de recuperar la normalidad registrando niveles raquíticos. A una situación coyuntural de incertidumbre económica se ha sumado la crisis de los chips que es global y que puede alargarse hasta 2023"".

Las ventas hundidas por la falta de chips y sin previsión de mejora

La escasez mundial de chips que afecta a la industria desde finales de 2020 y que está prevista que se alargue hasta mediados de 2022 está provocando paradas en las fábricas y falta de stock en los concesionarios. De hecho el presidente de la patronal de fabricantes (Anfac) José Vicente de los Mozos pidió la semana pasada al Gobierno generar confianza en el consumidor con el objetivo de proteger la industria del automóvil. Según las previsiones de Anfac el año cerrará con un total de 900.000 unidades un 25% menos que en 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGhlcmFsZG9kZWNoaWh1YWh1YS5jb20ubXgvZmluYW56YXMvb3B0aW1pc3Rhcy1mbG9yZXJpYXMtZXNwZXJhbi1hdW1lbnRvLWRlLTUwLWVuLXZlbnRhcy1wYXJhLW5vdmllbWJyZS1jaGlodWFodWEtNzMxODMwNC5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaGVyYWxkb2RlY2hpaHVhaHVhLmNvbS5teC9maW5hbnphcy9vcHRpbWlzdGFzLWZsb3Jlcmlhcy1lc3BlcmFuLWF1bWVudG8tZGUtNTAtZW4tdmVudGFzLXBhcmEtbm92aWVtYnJlLWNoaWh1YWh1YS03MzE4MzA0Lmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Optimistas florerías esperan aumento de 50% en ventas para noviembre,"Comerciantes de flores en los panteones municipales esperan de modo optimista un aumento de 50% en ventas para el mes de noviembre.

The attack was similar to what T-Mobile customers experienced previously. At that time there were 48 million users that suffered from the data breach.

According to the victims there is a particular phone number that people should avoid. There's a possibility that the unsolicited texts from an unknown sender could retrieve users' data without their permission.

Verizon Subscribers Should Avoid This Phone Number

According to Phone Arena's report on Saturday Oct.9 Verizon subscribers have started to receive malicious messages from unidentified senders. The phishing scam involves sending texts to a recipient through a suspicious phone number.

The specific contact which is 562-666-1159 notifies users that they have already paid the bill for the previous month. Particularly the exact message says ""Verizon Free Msg: Sept bill is paid. Thanks (first name of the customer)! Here's a little gift for you.""

Phone Arena wrote that most Verizon users have already finished paying their bills for September. For this reason the old invoice hinted that the message was completely bogus on the part of the hacker.

Furthermore it would be unlikely for Verizon to send a gift to the subscribers who have paid their bills in advance. This recent phishing attack could mean that the user's information is on the verge of being stolen.

The cybercriminals behind the text message will ask subscribers to provide their personal information. If a subscriber falls for this trap his or her security number bank account number and other confidential information would be hacked.

If this happens the necessary details of a subscriber's Verizon account would be accessed by the threat actor. The hackers would order a phone that the subscriber needs to pay once the scam succeeds.

What To Do If You Receive a Phishing Message

From another article written by The Daily Star this week the state Office of Information Technology Services has released some precautions just in case hackers launch a phishing scam.

First confirm the sender's information through the phone numbers. Make sure that it came from a trusted source or else. Additionally watch out for syntax and grammatical errors in the message. If it contains poor spelling or grammar the text could likely be a phishing tactic.

You can also check the corresponding URL if it properly matches the website. One more thing to do when dealing with phishing scams is to refrain from clicking a malicious link.

Previous Phishing Scams

Last August a new UPS delivery scam took place where the recipient received a message telling about the appointment of his/her product delivery. The attacker will also inform the victim that there are some problems with the shipping that's why the product will not arrive at the said date.

In September an email scam hit both Gmail and Outlook users. Just like the previous UPS scam the cybercriminal will send an email indicating that a person has purchased an item.

Later the receiver will be instructed to call a phone number from a bogus employee on Amazon or Paypal. The scammer will proceed to collect the data on the process.

T-Mobile 5G is rolling out now across the US and is taking advantage of different versions of 5G technology to help it improve coverage and capacity.

Similar to AT&T T-Mobile has also rolled out a lot of low-band 5G which isn't great for speeds. That so-called 5G Extended Range network was started in 2019 and is essentially 4G with a few enhancements to make it quicker. T-Mobile rightly calls it a ""foundational layer of its 5G network"" and while that's true it's not really full 5G.

It does have the benefit of huge coverage though cover more than 200 million people and more than 1 million square miles across the US - over 8000 cities.

One thing's for sure - T-Mobile is gaining customers at some speed. Figures from the fourth quarter of 2019 point towards a million 'postpaid' customers; people who pay a monthly bill. 77000 pay-as-you-go or prepaid customers were also added over the period.

T-Mobile remains the third biggest network in the US despite it having absorbed the Sprint network in a protracted deal that closed during early 2020. After the acquisition it has just over 100 million subscribers across the US.

According to the network it has added 53 million users since 2013. Not surprising when you have had 27 successive quarters with over a million new users added.

Among the 5G test projects that T-Mobile has carried out the network has been using 5G-embedded cameras to virtually put fans on the baseball field in order to catch the action from the players’ point of view and go behind the scenes. They're mounted on players hats and catchers masks - T-Mobile says this is the first time that 5G embeddable cameras have been integrated into a professional sports league event. Each camera features a real-time HD stream.

T-Mobile has also worked with Major League Baseball to create an augmented reality app for fans with bonus stat views for T-Mobile 5G customers.

In a measure of how T-Mobile sees itself CEO Mike Sievert will deliver the keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2022.

Gary Shapiro president and CEO CTA: ""The pace of innovation has accelerated over the last 18 months and the rapid roll-out of 5G will only increase the momentum. There’s so much excitement in this space and for the first time we welcome Mike Sievert to our keynote stage to share more about T-Mobile’s vision for fuelling 5G innovation.""



Speed and reliability

In May 2021 RootMetrics released its first-ever 5G Scorecard which shows the race between the US’s 5G networks. Although AT&T was best for Everyday 5G download speeds T-Mobile offers the broadest Everyday 5G availability of any carrier according to the tests. RootMetrics tested the 125 most populated metropolitan markets in the US.

T-Mobile holds a significant lead in the race for Everyday 5G availability according to RootMetrics recording the highest Everyday 5G availability in 44 out of 65 total cities tested to date.

T-Mobile was also recently been hailed as the most reliable 5G network in the US according to consultancy Umlaut. The network had the best overall score of the US networks with an overall 707 points out of a maximum of 1000. The tests were carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.

In a clear ranking of how the network rollout is panning out Verizon scored second overall with 632 points with AT&T bringing up the rear with 599 points.

In terms of reliability T-Mobile also achieved the highest score with 664 out of a maximum of 800 points. In contrast Verizon ranked second with 560 points and again AT&T was third with 520 points.

""umlaut’s report is just the latest to prove customers and businesses alike can count on T-Mobile 5G to deliver a fast and reliable 5G connection in more places than anyone else"" said T-Mobile's Neville Ray.

""While the other networks play catch up we’ll keep adding more 5G coverage and capacity to bring a transformative experience to customers across the country.""

Ookla also recently rated the network as the fastest 5G network in the US. The testing - carried out during the first quarter of 2021 - saw the network clock 82.35Mbps download speeds followed by AT&T at 76.6Mbps and Verizon with 67.24Mbps. Ookla’s study also found that T-Mobile customers spent more time connected to a 5G network than customers on rival 5G networks.

T-Mobile 5G cities

The 5G Extended Range network covers 8300 US towns and cities. It is still be able to get to speeds of around 450Mbps if conditions are at their best although expect significantly slower speeds than that generally. Essentially it is like a quicker form of 4G LTE.

T-Mobile's Ultra Capacity network is different. It's a millimeter wave (mmWave) network similar to that which we've seen from the other US providers - but not providers in Europe. It provides the fastest speeds but has poor range. T-Mobile says it is upgrading 1000 cell towers a month for this covering 100 million Americans. However it is really only in some areas of the very largest cities at present.

T-Mobile 5G phones

T-Mobile originally offered the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and the OnePlus 5G before launching the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren on an exclusive in the US.

Like most other networks offering 5G globally T-Mobile has now added the Samsung Galaxy S20 S21 and iPhone 12 to its roster in 2020/21.

(Image credit: Apple)

Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini

The whole iPhone 12 range comes with the latest A14 Bionic platform so there's no performance limitation for going for one of these 6.1-inch or 5.4-inch handsets (the Pro has more RAM though). Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are available in Black White Red Green Blue.

The standard iPhone 12 is our pick of the iPhone 12 range.

(Image credit: Apple)

Apple iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max

The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the same-sized iPhone 12.

However the Pro Max certainly does with its huge 6.7-inch display and sheer desirability. The cameras are among the best we've seen especially in low light. It's eye-wateringly expensive though.

Google Pixel 4a 5G

Today's best Google Pixel 4a 5G deals $279.99 View

While Google's best 5G phone is the Pixel 5 (not currently available on T-Mobile) the Pixel 4a 5G is certainly much more affordable. Not to be confused with the standard Pixel 4a the 5G version is based around the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset and features a large 6.2-inch OLED display. There's a dual-camera setup with 12.2 megapixel wide and 16 megapixel ultrawide camera sensors and you'll get 128GB of storage and 6GB of memory too. And naturally being a Google phone you're guaranteed of the latest Android updates.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S21 5G

Samsung's latest S Series phone is a hugely impressive 6.2-inch handset. It may longer be the only tech king in town but it's still using bran new tech inside with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 platform at its core. We like the triple cameras which are much better - particularly with low light - than earlier models. It also has decent battery life too.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra

At over half an inch bigger than the standard model the 6.8-inch S21 Ultra is a luxury phone. The camera system just about makes it worth it if you want the best with a five-camera setup that includes a 10x optical zoom. Like the standard S21 it runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. There's even support for the S Pen stylus too should you want that.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S20 5G

Today's best Samsung Galaxy S20 5G deals $1385 View

Capable of 8K video recording and with a large 6.2-inch AMOLED display the standard S20 is no slouch powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 platform for the US market. Like the others in the range it has super-fast charging too.

Available in cloud pink cloud blue and cosmic grey it's only around in a 128GB version only.

There's a triple camera (not quad like the other S20s) and it has a 64 megapixel main sensor. It's also got a 30x digital zoom too.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S20+

The 6.7-inch S20+ is available in three colours - cloud blue cosmic black and cosmic grey - and adds an extra storage size to the standard S20 in the form of 512GB in addition to 128GB.

Again it offers a 64 megapixel telephoto lens and 12MP ultra-wide camera setup but the S20+ (and Ultra) offer quad-camera arrangements.

The price premium for the S20+ is not extensive over the standard S20 and as such is worth considering.

(Image credit: Samsung)

Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra

Slightly bigger - by 0.2-inches than the S20+ - the S20 Ultra clocks in at 6.9-inches and features an upgraded camera.

Storage capacities are the same as the S20+ at 128 and 512GB. However the Ultra is only available in cosmic black or cosmic grey.

So what's better about the camera? Firstly there's the zoom - the S20 Ultra is capable of 100x (rather than 30x) while there's an extremely large 108 megapixel camera sensor to go alongside a 48 megapixel telephoto lens.

You won't find the 100x zoom that practical but using it is fun.

T-Mobile 5G coverage

For its 5G Ultra Capacity network T-Mobile is using 28 Ghz mmWave (millimetre wave) just as Verizon is. That means excellent download speeds but a more difficult blanket rollout. That's because the shorter wavelength signals don't travel so far and are easily blocked in urban areas or by external walls - so you need loads of 5G nodes.

You only need to look at T-Mobile's current coverage maps to show the issues around mmWave deployment - it's extremely patchy.

So as we mentioned T-Mobile has also opted to use low-band 600Mhz spectrum. The low-band spectrum can also carry 5G signals inside.

Before the T-Mobile launch of low-band 5G Sprint was leading the way with low-band and it's one of the reasons that Sprint and T-Mobile felt they would be a good fit by merging which they duly did.

T-Mobile 5G deals

In terms of SIM-only T-Mobile 5G offers service plans at $15 for 2GB (not enough in our opinion) and $25 for 5GB. The plans also offer 100GB of free monthly home internet to 10 million American families. And if that wasn’t enough the company also gives free wireless service to every first responder in America.

Currently Samsung Galaxy S20 5G is available on T-Mobile from $31.25 a month on a 24-month deal providing you put $349.99 down plus tax. You can also buy it outright from the network for $1099.

Magenta Max is a new plan specifically made for a 5G world - it won't slow down based on how much data you use. T-Mobile says that nearly 50% of Magenta MAX customers use a 5G smartphone and they use noticably more data – 43% more music 48% more video and 26% more social media.

The network says that ""on average these customers on average have each listened to the equivalent of 360 more songs watched 576 more minutes of video and made 1512 more posts on social media than our other customers.""

T-Mobile 5G business and home internet

T-Mobile Business has announced three new plans as of early 2021. The three plans are: ‘Enterprise Unlimited’ plans a set of business mobile tariffs to offer 5G with “unprecedented value”; ‘Home Office Internet’ providing a dedicated connection for business use; and ‘Collaborate’ which is a suite of mobile-first cloud-based apps.

""Today we’re unveiling a comprehensive set of T-Mobile for Business solution unlocked by our 5G network to solve real problems and empower business to do business whenever and wherever they need to and we’re calling it T-Mobile WFX and it includes three key solutions to help businesses work from anywhere says T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert.

T-Mobile Home Office Internet covers more than 60 million households at launch close to half of all homes in America with plans to cover more than 90 million households by 2025. And T-Mobile’s new Collaborate service will be available as part of ‘Enterprise Unlimited’ or on a standalone basis.

Pricing for T-Mobile Home Office Internet starts at $90 per line per month and Enterprise Unlimited with T-Mobile Collaborate together start at $37 per line per month; with T-Mobile available as a standalone product from $12 per month.

T-Mobile's Home Internet covers 30 million homes at present for $60 a month. ""I’m proud to announce that we're launching T-Mobile Home Internet"" said Mike Sievert T-Mobile CEO at the launch of the service in April 2021.

""More than 30 million homes are now eligible. That's almost one in five American households available today. And that makes T-Mobile one of America's largest ISPs by service area - Verizon says they won't even reach that many homes in their fixed 5G wireless for nearly two more years.”

T-Mobile 5G for business

Like the other big US networks T-Mobile sees big opportunities for businesses willing to invest in 5G especially around the internet of things and remote connectivity.

In May 2021 T-Mobile for Business announced new small business rate plans and fixed wireless internet for small businesses. These plans feature unlimited talk text and data plus high-speed mobile hotspot data with every plan more Premium Data and an option for unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi. Some plans also include Microsoft 365 subscriptions too.

Like other networks T-Mobile has its fair share of test bed tech. The latest is a driverless car service in Las Vegas powered by T-Mobile 5G. Yep no driver - Halo began driving on Las Vegas public highways earlier this year - you simply summon a vehicle using a mobile the app.

The car picks you up drops you off and carries on to its next destination. However while it is driverless it is not fully autonomous; the vehicles use proprietary RemotePilot tech where drivers remotely operate the vehicle over the 5G network. The car will come to a safe stop if a hazard is detected while the vehicles are learning using AI in order to work towards eventual Level 3 autonomy.

According to an early 2021 report by Accenture the pandemic has changed the way people work and socialize with 79% of respondents wanting to work from a “third space” – a location other than their home or workplace.

T-Mobile also collaborates with universities and standards bodies to support 5G technology research and development operating the T-Mobile Accelerator T-Mobile Ventures investment fund. It's also a co-founder of the 5G Open Innovation Lab.

Meanwhile 87% of enterprises expect their employees to work from home three or more days per week - tomorrow's office is pretty much anywhere.

The company now has 16 locations including 15 in Michigan and one in Johnson City Tennessee.

Koronich now 32 said the company will continue to expand in the coming years.

A few weeks ago he reacquired a 9000-square-foot gym in Genoa Township from a franchisee. He said he's making some improvements to the space adding fitness programs and getting new workout and boxing equipment.

The gym features four workout spaces. They offer group classes semi-private training and nutrition.

He said he recently moved back to Howell after living in Detroit for several years and wants to give back to the Livingston County community who supported his dream from its humble beginnings.

""My inspiration is that we started with a 1000-square-foot gym in Howell and it was the community who helped us. It's kind of a pay-it-forward kind of thing.""

The gym will support people recovering from addiction by comping memberships. He also plans to partner with nonprofits junior sports leagues and other organizations to give back.

Road to success

Koronich said mixed martial arts and other combat sports got him into fitness when he was young.

He started out as a personal trainer and worked for big box gyms before founding TRVFIT Fitness.

Within a few months they had outgrown their original gym and moved into a larger 3000-square-foot space in Howell.

MORE: Brighton City Council votes to consider cannabis businesses but not in downtown

Then they outgrew that space and moved to the 9000-square-foot Genoa Township location at 2100 Grand River Annex.

More TRVFIT Fitness locations opened shortly after the company's founding. The second is in South Lyon.

There are several TRVFIT locations in Livingston County including Koronich's Genoa Township location and other franchise locations in Hartland Pinckney and Fowlerville.

""I was partnering for the first four or five and then we started franchising"" Koronich said.

He currently owns three of the locations with partners. He also owns gyms in Berkley and Plymouth. The rest are franchise locations.

He said 2019 was their biggest year for expansion when eight new locations opened.

""In the next year there are five new pending locations and we have a minimal goal of 15 more.""

He said early next year he will actively market to potential franchisees in Michigan and other states.

At its height there were 20 locations operating at the same time. A few have closed or rebranded.

During COVID-19 shutdowns the gym offered programs online on demand. Those materials are still available to purchase as a package.

Revamping the Genoa Twp. location

""We have a bunch of space upgrades and new equipment coming"" Koronich said of his plans for the Genoa Township expansion.

Two spaces on the ground level house weighs workout equipment and space for group classes and training.

One of two spaces in the basement is for yoga barre and Pilates. Koronich calls it the ""mind-body"" room.

The basement also features a boxing training area with punching bags. Koronich plans to keep the room dark an illuminate it with colored party lights.

""I've found the darkness makes people more comfortable when they are just learning how to box and sometimes worry what they look like.""

He said the boxing equipment will be revamped too.

""We have a bunch of custom (punching) bags coming. We're doing a mural. This room will be totally redone.""

He said while fitness training is the most popular he hopes to grow the boxing side of the gym.

""Functional training is popular but I want boxing to be as big.""

He's also planning to open a pro shop upstairs which will sell the gym's own line of supplements boxing gloves and other retail items.

Looking into the future Koronich envisions the company will continue grow and add locations.

""It's about scaling the right way whether we open more headquarters (corporate-owned locations) or franchises. We have a lot of potential plans for expansion or relocation.""

A film about the complexities and interconnectedness of families Encanto centers on the Madrigal family and their magical home and particularly on Mirabel the only member of her large family without a magical gift. Set in the South American country of Colombia and featuring music by Lin-Manuel Miranda Encanto is the 60th animated feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios. Disney News sat in on a recent press conference where for the first time filmmakers shared a sneak peek into the process of making Encanto. Director Byron Howard writer and director Jared Bush writer and co-director Charise Castro Smith producer Yvett Merino producer and president of Walt Disney Animation Studios Clark Spencer associate production designer Lorelay Bové head of animation Renato dos Anjos head of animation Kira Lehtomaki and animation reference consultant Kai Martinez all spoke about their part in the process of creating the film.

The journey that would end up taking five years eight internal screenings and hundreds of script drafts all started with directors Byron Howard and Jared Bush who previously teamed up on the Oscar-winning film Zootopia. Having each worked on musicals separately in the past — Howard directed Tangled and Bush was screenwriter on Moana — and sharing a love of music (both are trombonists) they wanted to tackle one together. Bush had collaborated with Lin-Manuel Miranda on Moana and so Miranda was brought onto the project from the very beginning. This was unique to Encanto: songwriters are not typically brought on so early in the process of creating an animated musical. The three brainstormed thinking about what they all had in common: family — specifically large families. This led them to a central question they wanted to explore in the film which Howard phrased as “How well do we truly know our families and how well do our families know us?” They figured everyone has complicated interesting families and so this would be a universal experience for their story to tell.

The complex dynamics between large families seemed like a rich area to explore and they realized that setting the movie in Latin America — especially Colombia considered the crossroads of Latin America — made a lot of sense as family is very important in Latin American cultures. Howard and Bush had met Juan Rendon and Natalie Osma both originally from Colombia when they filmed a behind-the-scenes documentary on Zootopia for the network Fusion and the four had remained friends. They heard from Rendon and Osma that is rich in cultural diversity with Spanish African and Indigenous people among many others who have come to this crossroads of Latin America. As Bush put it they learned the country is “a melting pot of Latin culture music dance art and food with some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet and also [is the] home of magical realism” referring to literary work by authors such as Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez. It seemed perfect so in 2018 the creative team took a trip to check out Colombia for themselves. They visited big cities like Bogotá and Cartagena small towns like Barichara Salento and Palenque and natural landmarks like the Valle de Cocora. In Colombia the team encountered a phenomenon they’d read about in their research — encantos or places of natural wonder with heightened spirituality spots where emotion-related magic happens. Of this discovery Howard shares “[It] was amazing because we were looking for a way to incorporate magic into the movie. It felt very important to do that but in a way that felt specific to Latin America and [to] combine [that] with this idea — inspired by magical realism — where magic is everywhere. It's tied to emotion and roles in the family. That all seemed to really speak to each other.” And so the team had a title for the movie: Encanto.

Encanto director Byron Howard visits Valle de Cocora during the filmmakers’ 2018 research trip to Colombia.

Soon after the group returned from Colombia they realized they needed to bring another writer on. After reading hundreds of scripts Bush and Howard knew immediately after reading Charise Castro Smith’s script that she was the collaborator they were looking for. Castro Smith not only joined as a writer but also became a co-director of the film. As to why she’s drawn to this type of storytelling she explains “The language of magical realism just makes visceral sense to me. It’s woven into my imaginative DNA. Growing up in Miami a place where fact often felt stranger than fiction the tall tale of a story often felt like the best way to capture the reality of a given event. Still does.” Magical realism was the missing piece that brought the story of Encanto to life.

From the beginning in addition to Rendon and Osma the creative team worked with both internal and external resources to make sure the film was as authentic as possible. They put together a Colombian Cultural Trust consisting of experts in music anthropology culture architecture and botany among other subjects who helped guide them on big-picture topics down to the smallest details. Producer Yvett Merino explains the process of working with the trust: “They really came on very early on working with Lorelay [Bové] and the art team and then carried on through our asset team as we actually started building all the assets. There was an ongoing meeting and collaboration with them just to make sure that we were representing [everything] correctly.” Internally in Walt Disney Animation Studios artists and studio employees formed a group called Familia that also advised the filmmakers. The filmmakers were aware that Colombia is not a monolith with Howard pointing out “Colombia is like many countries packed into one so we had to be careful not to just ask our consultants from one region. We had to have coastal consultants and consultants from Cali and Bogotá and everywhere in the country as much as possible.” And so these teams through their research insight and personal experiences helped to elevate the project.

One important aspect of the movie that the Colombian Cultural Trust was able to advise on was the Madrigal family home. As Charise Castro Smith puts it “We had a big breakthrough [when] we realized that the family’s house didn’t have to just be a house — because in an encanto the house itself could have powers too.” Casa Madrigal the magical home of the Madrigal family is full of personality; Bush says “It’s a house that plays favorites like families do.” From a production design standpoint the house was inspired by traditional Colombian homes in Barichara Cartagena and Salento. With the kitchen in particular — a gathering place in the home — consultants steered the team toward a more neutral color palette. Says associate production designer Lorelay Bové “We added some props that would be found in a cocina Colombiana like a molinillo which is a hot chocolate stirrer or a corn grinder and traditional clay pottery called La Chamba.”

The house was an important character in its own right. Howard explains “We played with the idea of the physical house as a literal representation of the family and their emotional connections. For instance if the family’s happy the house is healthy. If the family’s being playful the house can be playful. But if the family is going through struggles the house can crack.” Renato dos Anjos head of animation says the house was one of the most challenging elements in the film: “It's this living breathing thing that anywhere you are in the scene there's something moving with how it emotes through the house. You know — how does the house feel a certain way and how does she express that to a character?” Colombian architects advised the production that these homes often have an indoor-outdoor feel. This caused them to add a beautiful courtyard to the home “where you can see all the magical doors. Each family member has a uniquely designed room” says Bové. To that measure each of the Madrigal family members with magic powers have their own room that represents their unique gifts. Through Antonio’s door working with a botanist consultant the team paid homage to Colombia’s robust biodiversity.

Encanto follows three generations of the Madrigal family. The matriarch is Abuela Alma who first brought the family to the encanto and forged a new life for them there. Castro Smith describes the character “Abuela Alma’s steely strength and single-minded determination to protect her family hasn’t wavered in 50 years since she lost her husband.” And of course the visuals are designed to complement the characters’ stories. For Abuela Alma Bové explains “Since our Abuela Alma had lost her beloved husband and goes through so much her costume color palette and her character design has a lot of weight and feels more constrained than other characters. She has more of a traditional 1900s look... a little more conservative.”

The movie’s protagonist Mirabel is in the third generation of Madrigals who live in the encanto but is the only one without a magical gift. Director Byron Howard shares of her journey “After spending her entire life trying to measure up to the rest of the Madrigals Mirabel finds that she is the only one who can save her beloved family and their magical home.” Designing the character of Mirabel a collaborative process led by art director of characters Bill Schwab was crucial to the film. Early on the team decided that Mirabel’s outfit would be filled with handmade fun and imperfect embroidery “sort of like what a teenager would do in a diary with their drawings” says Bové. Their anthropologist consultants were able to provide the teams with authentic examples from which to draw. Continuing with the theme of imperfection head of animation Renato dos Anjos explains “Mirabel as she’s moving around sometimes makes little mistakes here and there and that’s because she often feels a little bit awkward and out of place.” The character was only perfect once they found her imperfections. Dos Anjos’ fellow head of animation Kira Lehtomaki shares “I think on an emotional level Mirabel was actually a really difficult character because she was somebody that was really in the depths of her soul trying to understand why she wasn't given this gift. And yet she exudes kind of this upbeat ‘it doesn't bother me’ kind of attitude through a lot of it. But finding that right balance was really really tricky.”

In figuring out what character received what gift writer and co-director Charise Castro Smith explains “We realized that if the family in our story lived in one of those magical encantos maybe the children born there would be special — but special in a way that is a nod to family dynamics that we can all relate to that we all know.” She describes how each gift ties into the role the character plays in the family: “Like the strong dependable child who is the rock of the family or the perfect golden child whose happiness blossoms or the quiet kid who isn’t comfortable talking to people and so he talks to animals.”

Mirabel’s nuclear family consists of her mother Julieta whose magical power is the ability to heal through food; her father Agustín who married into the family and thus doesn’t have a magical power; her oldest sister Isabela who has the power to make plants grow and flowers bloom; and her middle sister Luisa who has the power of superstrength. From a production design standpoint Bové explains “Visually in our department we wanted to make sure to organize the families through distinct color palettes to make sure that our audiences can track who’s who and which member is from each side of the family. We have Julieta and Agustín’s side of the family which is Mirabel’s side of the family more in jewel tones and cooler tones.” Julieta’s healing power ensures that she’s the family caretaker. “Agustín is very accident-prone and he tends to get hurt a lot” Howard laughs. “It is actually a perfect situation that he married a healer.”

Isabela the eldest daughter is effortlessly graceful and is the golden child of the family while middle sister Luisa is the rock of the family who solves problems and holds everyone together. However they may not be happy with the roles they’ve been assigned. In contrast with the way Mirabel moves Isabela’s movements are always perfect. Dos Anjos shares that for Isabela “We always wanted her to feel that if you see her anywhere in the movie even if she’s not the main character in the shot that she still looks very elegant and great in every angle. She knows she’s always on stage.” Isabela’s character design matches her movements and signifies her special gift. “Another inspiration for Isabela’s costume and her room was flower festivals in Colombia especially the one from Medellín. And we designed for her dress and her environment a lot of dahlias hydrangeas orchids daisies amongst other flowers from Colombia” says Bové. Luisa also moves effortlessly though with a physicality more fitting to her power of superstrength — the animators “found a lot of inspiration looking at movement of female shot put athletes” says dos Anjos.

Julieta’s siblings Pepa and Bruno are the other branches in Mirabel’s extended family. Bruno is estranged from the family and they don’t talk about him. Mirabel’s aunt Pepa has the ability to control the weather with her emotions… which are plentiful. Married to Pepa is Félix who like Agustín was not born in the encanto and so doesn’t have powers though he is “definitely the life of the party” says writer and director Jared Bush. Pepa and Félix have three children: Dolores who has the gift of extraordinary hearing; Camilo who has the ability to transform his appearance at will; and Antonio who Mirabel is closest to and who has the gift of speaking with animals. Bové shares of their design “Pepa and Félix’s side of the family have more of the warm color palette” in contrast with Mirabel’s immediate family.

With such a diverse cast of characters it’s no wonder the family dynamics are complicated. But the filmmakers hope that illustrates a point. “I'm really hoping the takeaway is that people realize they need to ask their family questions. They need to seek to understand them differently and see parts of them that are hidden sometimes and also show parts of themselves that they don't always bring into the light” says Bush.

At last month's Communacopia conference held by Goldman Sachs Disney CEO Bob Chapek was asked about the importance of ESPN and sports broadcasting to his company's streaming strategy. His answer sounded like a throw-away line. ""The number one most-viewed thing every year tends to be sports something like nine out of 10 of the top viewership events in television are sporting events"" Chapek said in a virtual session on Sept. 21. ""Who knows what the future will bring but it's certainly an important part of our consumer offerings at the Walt Disney company."" Chapek's generic response about the future for one of Disney's most valuable assets inspired no follow-up questions or headlines. But Chapek was addressing an existential threat facing the media industry and an issue that may one day rock the foundation of his media empire which includes some of the most valuable studios and film franchises in the world alongside the dominant network for live sports. Disney's big dilemma for ESPN is whether and when to fully embrace a future without cable. Broadcast and cable networks still make billions of dollars per year from the traditional TV model. ESPN is a huge beneficiary because media companies earn monthly subscriber fees from pay-TV providers regardless of how many people watch their programming. Niche channels make just a few cents a month per subscriber while sports networks charge several dollars. Disney makes more money from cable subscribers than any other company and that's solely because of ESPN. ESPN and sister network ESPN2 charge nearly $10 per month combined according to research firm Kagan a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. That's at least four times more than almost every other national broadcast or cable network according to Kagan. Disney requires pay-TV providers to include ESPN as part of their most popular cable packages. It's a no-brainer for TV providers who wouldn't dare drop ESPN. Meanwhile the non-sports world is cutting the cord. More than 6 million people ditched pay TV in 2020 according to research firm eMarketer — the highest annual total ever. About 25 million Americans have dropped linear TV bundles in the past decade. That creates a struggle within Disney that's poised to escalate. Disney wants people to sign up for its streaming entertainment products Disney+ and Hulu. Wall Street wants this too. Streaming video is a growth business. Traditional pay TV is a declining one. It's also a wise financial swap for Chapek. While Disney makes more than $10 a month per subscriber for sports it makes far less for entertainment networks such as Disney Channel and FX which draw lower audiences and don't command high advertising rates. If Disney can get a cord cutter to pay $8 per month for Disney+ and $6 for Hulu it's a huge win for the company. The reverse is true for ESPN. Swapping an ESPN subscriber for an ESPN+ customer who contributes average revenue of less than $5 per month is a significant loss for Disney. ESPN+ is a streaming service with limited content.

Disney Chairman Bob Iger who was CEO until last year told investors when he launched Disney+ that Disney was ""all in"" on streaming video. But ESPN isn't. ESPN's strategy is to cling to the cable bundle for as long as possible knowing it can draw potentially billions of dollars from U.S. households that are each paying $120 for the network even if they never watch it. Some analysts have even questioned whether Disney should spin off ESPN allowing Chapek to focus more clearly on streaming. An ex-Disney executive who recently left the company and asked not to be named said there's ""strategic misalignment"" between the parent company and ESPN and the businesses no longer belong together because Wall Street doesn't look kindly on declining assets. The executive said having ties to the legacy bundle will weigh down a company's stock multiple.

ESPN's fit within Disney

Whether or not the fit still make sense Disney has a huge financial incentive at least in the short term to keep the marriage going. At $10 per month or $120 per year multiplied by about 75 million U.S. homes Disney earns roughly $9 billion annually in domestic carriage fees from ESPN and its associated networks. Advertising that comes with broadcasting sports brings in billions of additional dollars. That cash allows ESPN to spend big on sports rights continuing a virtuous cycle. Disney agreed to spend $2.7 billion for ""Monday Night Football"" in a deal that runs all the way until 2033. ESPN pays $1.4 billion annually for NBA games and will likely pay more when those rights will need to be renewed after the 2024-25 season. The network owns media rights to every major U.S. sport in some capacity. It also allows Disney to pay up for original streaming content bolstering the quality of Disney+ and Hulu as the company competes with Netflix and Amazon . ""We're successfully navigating the evolution of consumer choice"" said Jimmy Pitaro chairman of ESPN which is majority-owned and controlled by Disney in an interview with CNBC in April. ""We believe we can be multiple things at the same time. As consumers continue to gravitate toward direct to consumer we have the optionality that we need.""

ESPN's role as cash machine works nicely for the time being. But if 25 million U.S. households ditch cable in the next four or five years as some predict the math will no longer add up said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""If we're going to 40 to 50 million the question is 'Is there any economic model that justifies the level of spending that we're currently at?'"" said Greenfield. ESPN has to figure out how to make up $3 billion in annual lost pay-TV subscription revenue that's coming in the next few years as cord-cutting continues a decline that Disney executives are anticipating according to people familiar with the matter. Disney's plan is to incrementally raise the price of ESPN+ as it adds more valuable content while maintaining contractual obligations for exclusive programming to pay-TV distributors the people said. An early example is Eli and Peyton Manning's alternative broadcast of ""Monday Night Football"" which will air 10 times this season on ESPN2 with some appearances available on ESPN+. Should the number of pay-TV bundle subscribers drop to a level well under 50 million U.S. households Disney would likely take ESPN to consumers in a more complete streaming package said two people with knowledge of the company's plans. At that point the economics would flip as most of the people paying for linear TV would be sports fans. Disney could likely make more from a full-service sports streaming service than it would make in a wholesale pay-TV distribution model. In the near term selling ESPN separate from the linear bundle isn't feasible. Disney has negotiated digital rights flexibility in almost every major rights renewal in the past few years. But the company is currently restricted by its linear pay-TV obligations which require certain premium programming to stay exclusive to the cable bundle according to people familiar with the matter.

What to charge for streaming ESPN

David Levy the former president of WarnerMedia's Turner Broadcasting said that Disney will have plenty of leverage with consumers when the time comes to bypass the bundle.

Levy who's now chairman of data firm Genius Sports said he thinks Disney can get 30 million customers to pay $30 a month for streaming ESPN or more than double the cost for a standard Netflix subscription. That would bring in $10.8 billion annually — more than Disney makes today from pay-TV affiliate revenue. ""With sports there's a guaranteed built-in audience"" Levy said. ""It's much different than entertainment. With entertainment every show is hit or miss and you always have to market content. You never know what will succeed and what won't. That's why sports is the best content to invest in and it will be no matter what the distribution model is."" But Levy's estimate may be optimistic. A top executive at one of the largest U.S. pay-TV operators told CNBC that about 15% of video subscribers are heavy sports viewers. That would equal just over 11 million U.S. households. Even if ESPN could double that number for a streaming app at $30 the service would make less than the $9 billion ESPN takes in today. The uncertainty of how many subscribers will pay for sports in an à la carte streaming world isn't lost on the leagues. The NFL built in early out-clauses to its most recent 11-year deals with the networks according to people familiar with the matter allowing the league to bail if the business model stops working. The NFL can end its agreement after seven years with CBS NBC and Fox and after eight years with ESPN said the people who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. That's why Disney and other networks with live sports want to keep the linear bundle around until they have to let it go. It's difficult to make up the lost revenue in a reliable way. ""We believe strongly that the traditional pay TV bundle will remain intact for a long time"" said

Sean McManus chairman of ViacomCBS 's CBS Sports. ""I don't think it ever whittles away to zero. And while it's certainly possible the amount of subscribers will continue to decline I don't think the decline ever reaches a point in the coming years that it won't support the current rights deals that we have both for NFL football and our other sports.""

Churn baby churn

A streaming-only world would also subject ESPN to a challenge that it's never had to worry about: Churn. People who cancel ESPN unsubscribe from the whole linear bundle. In the direct-to-consumer market it would be easy for football fanatics to only subscribe during the few months when games are played.

ESPN executives have been playing with ways to incentivize annual membership on the existing ESPN+ service to reduce month-to-month volatility. Several times this year ESPN has sold a pay-per-view UFC fight for $69.99 on ESPN+ and at the same time offered a full-year membership that would include the match for $89.99 a 35% discount. Packaging ESPN+ with Hulu and Disney+ is another churn buster as the combined offering is 33% cheaper than buying all three individually. However a more complete ESPN offering combined with another streaming service would have to cost more a proposition that would likely scare away the non-sports fans who are used to paying much less. Disney already packages sports in some of its foreign streaming services such as India's Disney+ Hotstar and Latin America's Star+. But the economics internationally aren't the same as in the U.S. ""If you put sports into Hulu or Disney+ instead of charging $5 or $7 now you're charging $30?"" Greenfield said. ""And then you're trying to compete against Netflix at $15. There is no model I see that works. There's no easy answer.""

Threats and saviors

Then there are the technology risks. ESPN executives are hesitant about moving their prized programming to directly to consumers because of rampant password sharing among young users according to people familiar with the matter. ""Watching a pirated stream or sharing a streaming service password seems like a victimless crime"" said John Kosner who led digital media at ESPN from 2003 to 2017 and is now president of media consulting firm Kosner Media. ""But it really impacts the business model of sports on streaming services."" Whether younger audiences even want live sports is another issue for Disney. Other entertainment options such as social media mobile games and on-demand entertainment services may be eroding the cultural grip of televised sports. Americans age 13 to 23 are half as likely as millennials to watch live sports regularly and twice as likely to never watch according to a 2020 Morning Consult survey. ""The overall relevance of sports is an open question for the younger generation"" said Kosner. One potential model that could save Disney a lot of future heartburn is a new streaming bundle that effectively replicates pay TV but with more options. If that becomes the winning form of distribution media companies may be in a familiar position making money from their most-popular services even if not everyone is watching them. Dexter Goei CEO of cable TV provider Altice USA said in May that such a product offering could work well for the sustainability of the media industry. It ""would allow us to focus primarily on our broadband product"" and ""be a partner for content on a direct-to-consumer basis as opposed to a partner on a linear basis"" Goei said at JPMorgan's Technology Media & Communications conference. It ""will dramatically improve the economic trends of our business from a cash-flow standpoint"" he said.

The growing popularity of sports betting could also help. Betting by mobile app which is slowly being legalized around the country boosts viewership because ""if you place a bet on a game you're much more likely to watch that game"" Levy said. Kosner added that augmented reality devices that create new viewing experiences and innovative products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are digital collectibles also have the potential to lure younger fans to watch games. Add it all up and media executives can find plenty of reasons to be optimistic despite the uncertainty that lies ahead for live sports. ""The value of sports continues to be more and more important every single year"" CBS's McManus said. ""Advertisers are going to continue to want to reach the largest possible audiences. The way to do that is with sports. I don't see a cliff coming. Our roadways are clear."" (Disclosure: Comcast's NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.)

For coronavirus-battered multiplex chains it’s reason for a celebratory martini.

But the box office is still extremely fragile analysts say and one of the doomsday scenarios about the pandemic’s lasting impact on theatergoing has been coming true: The only movies attracting sizable attention in cinemas are big-budget franchise films. The audience for smaller dramas and comedies seems — at least for now — to be satisfied with home viewing either buying films through video on demand or watching them on streaming services.

“Superhero action and horror movies are performing well in theaters particularly when they are offered exclusively and not simultaneously available to stream” said David A. Gross who runs Franchise Entertainment Research a film consultancy. “But parts of the business remain down. Dramas character-driven and art-house movies were under pressure before the pandemic and the bar is going to be even higher now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hcnlzdWUuY29tL3RveGljLW1hc2N1bGluaXR5LWF0LWl0cy1tb3N0LXRveGljLWpvaG4tY2VuYS1icmVha3MtZG93bi1wZWFjZW1ha2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Cena Breaks Down Peacemaker in New Clip,"Recommended Videos

James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad delivered one of the wildest ensemble of characters in the superhero genre. And few were more outrageous and hilarious than John Cena’s Peacemaker a hyper-violent vigilante who will murder men women and children in the name of “keeping the peace.” Cena’s awkward aggressive Peacemaker was such a standout that despite dying in the film was revived to star in his own HBO Max series set to premiere in January 2022. But while stealing scenes in the film we still know little about Peacemaker’s origin story and what makes him tick.

In a new behind the scenes featurette Cena and Gunn unpack the man behind the toilet bowl mask and delve deeper into the psyche of Christopher Smith/Peacemaker.

Gunn says “To me Peacemaker is the saddest character in the whole thing. He has the most difficulty connecting to another human being because he doesn’t feel like he belongs.” This is evident in the film as most of the squad gather around Bloodsport and Ratcatcher 2 while Peacemaker serves his own mission.

“We talked a lot about backstory and James was like ‘Hey man be like a douchey Captain America who would shoot a kid’ okay I got it” said Cena. Gunn added that Peacemaker was inspired by many “dude bros” he grow up with “like a lot of dude bros he didn’t have a great father didn’t have any mother” defining him as “toxic masculinity at its most toxic.”

Gunn continued “How sad is it that he feels like an outsider in any room that he sits in that he is desperate to be dominant because he doesn’t feel like he belongs.” The idea of the controlling egomaniac as superhero has certainly been explored before (most recently in Amazon’s The Boys and Invincible) but Cena brings a tragic pathos behind his macho blustering. It also helps that he’s absolutely hilarious. “John Cena is the best improv artist I’ve ever worked with in my life” remarked Gunn.

Cena said “He’s socially awkward…something as simple as the uniform hits on the head that this guy’s got validation problems … This man genuinely thinks he’s a hero and wants his Peacemaker logo on everything.”

If the Peacemaker series unpacks the toxic masculinity surrounding the character it could make for a very exciting character arc that most comic book movies don’t explore. Cena who delivered solid comedic cameos in Sisters and Trainwreck has finally found his breakout role. And to think had Cena hit the mainstage 10 or 20 years earlier he would likely be playing a Peacemaker-type character sans irony or humor. We can’t wait to see what he does with Peacemaker the series.

NCIS star Michael Weatherly just premiered the sixth season of his CBS legal drama Bull but one original character was missing in Thursday's (October 7) episode.

Benny Colón (played by Freddy Rodriguez) was nowhere to be seen though the episode quickly addressed his departure.

""Benny is blissfully happy in Rome singing 'Mi Amore' to his Italian bride"" Marissa (played by Geneva Carr) reminded characters and viewers alike during a karaoke session when someone asked to hear Benny do a Kenny Loggins rendition.

""True love won't be denied"" said Weatherly's titular character Bull. Meanwhile Jaime Lee Kirchner's Danny was baffled that Benny would move to Europe after only knowing the girl for a month.

Rodriguez joined the show right when it started in 2016 and his departure was announced last May following an investigation after several members of the show's writing staff quit at the end of season five.

Among their claims they accused showrunner Glenn Gordon Caron of ""fostering a disrespectful work environment"". Caron – according to the allegations – ""was callous and often berated the writing staff"" (via TVLine).

Caron it was announced was also removed from the show and his overall deal with CBS Studios was terminated. The network have declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding the workplace investigation into Rodriguez while neither Caron nor Rodriguez have released any statements in response to the announcements.

At the end of season five Benny who was a former prosecutor and a part of Bull's jury consulting firm TAC was being courted to run for District Attorney. In the season finale Benny resigned only to return to Bull's team once again at the very end.

But according to the premiere's explanation he must have resigned once more to move to Italy and has left the team for good with Chunk (Christopher Jackson) taking over his role at TAC.

Rodriguez is also known for his roles as Federico in Six Feet Under and Gio in Ugly Betty.

California Legislature Passes Four Plastic Pollution Related Bills

Original Post (Posted 9/10/21)

The Surfrider Foundation is pleased to celebrate that four significant bills that address plastic pollution have successfully passed the California state legislature and are headed to the Governor's desk. The Surfrider Foundation worked closely with the bill co-sponsors allies and coalitions to advocate for this legislation through our chapters and powerful grassroots activist network. These priority bills are SB 343 (truth in labeling for recyclable materials) AB 881 (exporting of mixed plastic waste) AB 1276 (unnecessary foodware accessories) and AB 962 (reusable beverage bottle systems) and are a part of the Circular Economy Package.

SB 343 (Allen) which received bipartisan support is a historic bill as the nation's strongest law to prevent deceptive recyclable labeling. It aims to help fix the country’s broken recycling system and reduce consumer confusion on what can be recycled.

This law expands the existing Truth in Environmental Advertising law that prohibits using the word recyclable on unrecyclable products to include the chasing-arrows symbol or any other suggestion that a material is recyclable. Using the chasing arrow symbol is allowed only on materials that are truly recyclable in most California communities and are routinely sold to manufacturers to make new products. Although SB 343 faced opposition from the plastics battery and other product manufacturers it received support from waste management waste haulers environmental organizations and local governments.

This legislation sets an important precedent for other states and the nation to end deceptive recycling labeling practices. Ultimately this law will help reduce consumer confusion about which material is suitable for the blue bin improve the recycling stream and end markets and decrease taxpayer and municipal government costs.

Another precedent-setting legislation that received bipartisan support was AB 881 (Gonzelez). This bill closes the loophole in California law that enables exported mixed plastic waste to be deemed recycled even when it is landfilled burned dumped or otherwise improperly managed. AB 881 reclassifies the export of mixed plastic waste as disposal while allowing truly recyclable plastic to continue to count towards the state's recycling goals. This bill increases transparency in our waste management practices and helps prevent California from simply exporting our environmental problems.

Building off of local successes AB 1276 (Carillo) expands the straw upon request law to include other single-use food accessories such as plates cups utensils and condiments to be given to consumers only upon request. These policies are common sense solutions. Restaurants save money consumers avoid getting what they don’t want or need and it helps reduce single-use plastic waste that pollutes our communities gets incinerated or goes to the landfill (very little is actually recycled).

Finally AB 962 (Kamlager) creates returnable bottle systems in California to preserve bottles so that they can be washed and refilled by beverage producers rather than being crushed for recycling. It also allows for returnable bottles to flow through the state's Beverage Container Recycling Program (CRV/Bottle Bill). This bill evens out the playing field between bottle washers and recyclers by paying the same amount. A returnable bottle operation creates new jobs reduces waste and is better for our community and environment.

The Governor must now sign or veto these bills by October 10 2021.

The Surfrider Foundation is excited about these pending victories but our work continues. The Governor must now sign or veto these bills by October 10 2021. Using this momentum Surfrider is also advocating to pass the 2022 ballot initiative the California Recycling and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act. A vote for this initiative will reduce plastic pollution restore and protect environments harmed by plastic pollution and increase recycling.

When you're sorting your waste from your compost and recyclables do you ever think about where the waste in your black cart ends up?

How big is Prince Edward Island's landfill and how soon before it's full? What happens then?

We have the answers to everything you ever wanted to know about the Island's only landfill where your black cart waste may end up.

CBC talked with Heather Myers disposal manager for Island Waste Management and Elizabeth Mallett who supervises the East Prince Waste Management Facility which includes the landfill as well as a small compost facility and drop-off centre.

Where is it?

Since late 1994 P.E.I.'s only landfill has been off Highway 2 in Wellington about 15 kilometres west of Summerside.

An overhead drone shot of P.E.I.'s only landfill at the East Prince Waste Management Facility in Wellington. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)

Before that there were more than 60 provincial and municipal dumps across P.E.I. which have now closed Mallett said.

The facility offers tours — just call ahead.

How big is it?

The landfill is about 13 hectares.

Three of six cells are full two are almost full and the final one is almost empty.

The finished height of the trash heap is 35 metres above sea level.

When will it be full?

""At the present rate that we're filling the landfill which is at about 24500 cubic metres a year we should have space for about another 30 years"" Myers says.

Myers said there is room for one more small cell on the site.

IWMC owns more land just to the west of the present facility which could be a potential location for another similar-size landfill although approvals have neither been sought nor given for an expansion. That could add another 50 years or so to the life of the landfill site.

So the Wellington landfill could have another 80 years of life.

""The less amount of land we're using up for a landfill the better"" Myers said. ""That's why it's important for people to sort properly.""

IWMC continues to seek programs to reduce what goes into the landfill like agricultural plastics and electronics like toasters and fans.

Myers said a program a couple of years ago to divert mattresses from the landfill to a Quebec recycler has taken about 14000 mattresses or box springs a year out of the landfill. Islanders can drop off their old mattresses for free while businesses like hotels must pay fees.

Will that trash ever break down?

No.

Landfills are designed to be deprived of oxygen or anaerobic. Oxygen helps things break down — those are aerobic conditions.

""Five hundred-plus years maybe never"" is how long it could take trash to break down Myers said noting people have removed newspapers after 50 years a landfill and they were still legible.

Anaerobic conditions can create potent greenhouses gases such as methane which is another reason IWMC wants to keep organic matter out of the landfill.

What garbage goes there?

Did you know only the waste from Prince County goes into the landfill?

Filling the final phase or cell of the landfill to the left is just beginning. The other cells to the right of the photo are already grassed over or just being topped off with trash. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)

Trash from Kings and Queens counties is burned at the Energy From Waste incinerator in Charlottetown which provides heat to public buildings.

Myers said people frequently ask why they need to separate their garbage if it just going to be burned.

""They can only take so much material a year it's around 26000 metric tonnes"" Myers said. ""If people aren't sorting correctly and putting organics and recyclables into their waste cart then that capacity gets used up much quicker at P.E.I. Energy Systems which then diverts it to landfill.""

Also not everything incinerates including glass bottles and tin cans she said.

Non-toxic ""bottom ash"" from the incinerator is actually trucked to Wellington to be spread as over trash at the landfill after it has been compacted — nothing goes to waste during this process!

How close is the landfill to homes?

The active area of the landfill must be at least 750 metres away from the nearest homes or businesses. The closest homes are on the St. Nicholas Road Myers said.

Neighbours do not have any complaints about the site Mallett added.

Is it like a dump?

""The landfill cell is not like a landfill that was on P.E.I. many years ago — it's what's called an engineered landfill cell"" Myers said. There are many base layers to protect the ground and groundwater from contamination including compacted soil gravel for drainage layers of protective matting and a thick high-density polyethylene liner. That liner comes in huge rolls rolled out over the entire landfill and the seams are fused together to prevent leaks.

Aerated lagoons to the left and a settling pond to the right as well as constructed wetlands in the right-hand corner are part of the landfill's leachate treatment. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)

""We end up with basically a big bathtub"" Myers said.

The trash that is dropped off by commercial haulers and businesses is compacted by a 37-tonne $700000 landfill compacting machine that basically runs over and flattens garbage all day.

Rain or melting snow that falls onto the garbage is drained through pipes in the base layers — Myers said it's ""like a tea bag"" — then pumped to holding ponds on the site to be treated to meet environmental standards.

Also unlike dumps of old the landfill is surrounded by groundwater monitoring wells that are checked annually for possible contamination of nearby groundwater.

The cells of the landfill that are full are ""capped"" with layers of sand plastic gravel and topsoil then planted with grass.

What goes in the landfill?

Less and less goes into the landfill Myers said as IWMC starts or joins programs that remove household electronics light bulbs paints tires and agricultural waste like baler twine and silage wrap.

Besides the active landfill site the Wellington facility includes a large blue compost building compost windrows to the left and a compost screener and a waste watch drop off area to the right. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)

Islanders are doing a ""reasonable job"" sorting but there's still plenty of room for improvement Myers said.

""A lot of recyclables end up in the waste stream even refundables like water bottles"" Myers said. She speculates that could be because it takes some effort to wash recyclables and store them.

Although more take-out cups and cutlery are made from compostable materials like corn Myers notes many of them still look like plastic and make it difficult for IWMC staff to discern what's what especially since the markings on the items are small and sometimes dirty. She'd like to see Islanders choose items that do not resemble plastics.

If you sort properly ""it is a good feeling to know that you are generating such little waste"" she added. ""It's something you can take pride in.""

People don't dump as much as they used to

Islanders put 50 to 65 per cent less waste in landfill than before P.E.I. began the Waste Watch program.

""But we can always do better"" Myers said. People (she includes herself) purchase things they don't need or that have excessive packaging.

Seek out items of higher quality so you generate less waste replacing them she said and buy in bulk to reduce packaging.

""Even if we all started with one little thing that is better than us all doing nothing.""

There's an app for that!

Besides newsletters a couple of times a year in the mail a frequently updated website and a toll-free phone number did you know IWMC has a free mobile app called Recycle Coach to help you with dates times and sorting questions?

It will send you reminders to put your black or green cart curbside and can be especially helpful during holidays when carts may be picked up on alternate days.

Does the landfill make money?

The landfill charges disposal fees to cover its costs Myers said but it does not make a profit.

Dumping commercial waste from businesses and institutions costs $100 a tonne.

Did COVID-19 have an impact?

Prior to COVID-19 IWMC was breaking even Myers said. But since the pandemic began in March 2020 businesses have been dumping much less while households have been disposing of much more.

People working and staying home during the pandemic took the opportunity to purge and redecorate and put their waste curbside. IWMC pocketed no additional fees from them. But businesses dumped much less and IWMC lost out on those fees.

""We were down 20 to 25 per cent for the commercial [by weight] and we were up by the residential by about the same ... but we don't get any extra fees for the residential.""

Even though the trash evened out the money didn't Myers said. However that is now beginning to turn around.

""Things are recovering"" Myers said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY29yYWxzcHJpbmdzdGFsay5jb20vdHJhZGl0aW9uYWwtcmVjeWNsaW5nLXJldHVybnMtbm92LTEtMzUxMzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traditional Recycling Returns to Coral Springs Nov. 1 • Coral Springs Talk,"Share Tweet reddit Whatsapp

By Bryan Boggiano

The city commission unanimously approved a contract with Waste Management Inc. to return residential curbside recycling on October 6.

Recycling will resume in phases beginning Monday November 1 starting with single-family homes. In early 2022 the city will discuss recycling returning to multi-family residences.

Coral Springs entered a contract with Waste Management in 2018 to send all residential recycling to the company’s material recovery facility (MRF). But the city suspended it in 2020. As a result the city transferred all recyclable items to a waste-to-energy facility.

When the city suspended its contract with Waste Management the value of blended materials at MRFs was about $23/ton but it is now about $107.37/ton.

At that time foreign markets declined due to restricting imports recycling costs increased rapidly and recycling contamination increased according to a press release.

Contamination happens when non-recyclable items end up in recycling. Highly contaminated loads increase processing fees and can be rejected.

The city started a Recycle Right campaign to educate the community on the economics of trash and why recycling properly is essential. After suspending traditional recycling staff monitored the market to determine when would be a good time to bring back curbside recycling according to a press release.

“Thankfully commodity values have increased tremendously making it a great opportunity for the city to resume our recycling program through a phased approach” said Robert Norris director of Public Works.

Along with recycling making a comeback the city will conduct a multifaceted Recycle Right campaign to educate residents on what can and cannot be recycled to keep contamination rates and processing fees low.

“How much Coral Springs pays to recycle will be based on our contamination rate” he said. “We are relying on every resident who lives in a single-family home to start recycling ‘right’ effective today to achieve the lowest possible contamination rate.”

Three audits measuring the contamination rate will occur on January 1 March 1 and May 1. After that the city will conduct audits every six months. The last recycling audit conducted in summer 2020 found a 36.5 percent contamination rate.

Recycling dropoff options continue at Mullins Park next to the Coral Springs Gymnasium the Waste Transfer Station at 12600 Wiles Road and Whispering Woods Park.

She has set up Freetown Waste Management Recycle an industrial plant dedicated to transforming old tires into paving bricks floor tiles and other goods that are in high demand in Africa's most populous nation.

""Creating something new from something that will otherwise be lying somewhere as waste was part of the motivation"" Runsewe told Reuters at her factory in the city of Ibadan in southwest Nigeria.

""We are able to create an entire value chain around the tires"" she said holding a paving brick that is one of the company's best-selling products.

Waste management in Nigeria is patchy at best. In villages towns and cities piles of waste are a common sight and residents often burn them at night for lack of a safer method of disposal. Tires are routinely dumped and abandoned.

Freetown relies on scavengers who collect old tires from dumping grounds. They are paid 70 to 100 naira ($0.17-$0.24) per tire.

Some tires are also supplied directly by mechanics like Akeem Rasaq who is delighted to have found a place where he can make some money from old tires.

""Most of the tires end up in public drainage clogging up the drain but things have changed"" he said at his roadside workshop.

Freetown started operations in 2020 with just four employees and growth has been so rapid the workforce has jumped to 128. So far more than 100000 tires have been recycled into everything from speed bumps to soft paving for playgrounds.

""It is important to support anybody that recycles in our country"" said Houssam Azem founder of the Lagos Jet Ski Riders Club which has purchased paving bricks from Freetown for a children's play area.

""Taking tires which is an environmental nuisance and turning them into what children can play on I think it is a win-win for everybody."""

If investors are learning anything about Wells Fargo (WFC 1.00%) it's to listen to CEO Charlie Scharf's words carefully. As sentiment on the bank turned bullish and many including myself started to believe that the asset cap the bank has been operating under for more than three and a half years could be lifted in the near term Wells Fargo received a fresh $250 million fine and a new consent order from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which regulates national banks.

Additionally Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the Fed would not hesitate to act if Wells Fargo did not fix its regulatory problems that ultimately lead to the bank's infamous phony-accounts scandal in which employees at the bank fraudulently opened depository and credit card accounts for millions of customers without their authorization.

Scharf has not misled investors. On Wells Fargo's second-quarter earnings call he called the remaining work on regulatory issues ""significant."" He also said there could be ""setbacks and progress will not be a straight line"" a statement that proved true in Q3 and that Scharf has echoed on past earnings calls.

Scharf has also said numerous times that the work laid out in the remaining consent orders is ""clear"" so a good thing investors can do is get familiar with the bank's remaining consent orders which could prove to be the best way to track the bank's progress on its regulatory work.

10 remaining consent orders

As Scharf has said many times there is still a lot of work required to get the bank where it needs to be and this work could take multiple years. As consent orders run down the bank's stock should rise as investors anticipate the bank being closer to finally having updated its regulatory infrastructure to regulators' liking. Here are the 10 active orders remaining on Wells Fargo.

April 13 2011 -- The longest outstanding of the bunch the Federal Reserve issued this consent order to nine other banks in addition to Wells Fargo for problems in each of their mortgage loan servicing divisions and how they foreclosed on mortgages of clients. Likely born from problems in the Great Recession the Fed wanted to improve the way the largest banks communicated with borrowers and ensure banks weren't still trying to foreclose a loan once the terms of that loan had been modified.

July 20 2011 -- Another issue related to the bank's mortgage program the Federal Reserve fined Wells Fargo $85 million. This was due to claims that the bank led higher-quality borrowers who could have been considered of prime credit quality into loans with more costly interest rates normally reserved for less-than-prime borrowers. The order which directed Wells Fargo to compensate victims was the largest fine the Fed had hit a bank with in regards to a consumer complaint at the time.

June 3 2015 -- The OCC fined Wells Fargo $4 million related to the sale of identity theft protection products that it looks like the bank in part inherited from its acquisition of Wachovia during the Great Recession. The OCC in the consent order said Wells Fargo through a vendor charged some customers for some identity theft services they never received.

Sept. 2 2015 -- I did not find a ton of information on this consent order but it's still active per the OCC's enforcement action records. It looks like based on the documents one of Wells Fargo's subsidiaries engaged in activities it wasn't supposed to. The order stipulated that Wells Fargo was not to acquire any new financial subsidiary unless it received special permission from the OCC.

Aug. 22 2016 -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which was born from the Great Recession and is intended to act as a consumer watchdog fined Wells Fargo $3.6 million and ordered the bank to reimburse borrowers in its student lending division more than $400000. The CFPB asserts that Wells Fargo charged borrowers wrongful fees didn't provide certain information and didn't have accurate credit information for borrowers. These actions led to ""increased costs and unfairly penalized certain student loan borrowers."" Interestingly Wells Fargo announced the sale of its student loan portfolio not too long ago.

Sept. 8 2016 -- Directly related to the phony-accounts scandal the OCC fined Wells Fargo $35 million for opening up bank accounts and credit card accounts without the approval of the customers they were opening them for. Many fines and punishments would follow for this practice. The OCC also faulted Wells Fargo in this order for not having the proper risk management practices in place to prevent such a scandal.

Feb. 2 2018 -- The most punitive of all of the consent orders the Fed took the unprecedented move of actually preventing Wells Fargo from growing its balance sheet until it corrected its internal controls and risk management practices. The order would limit the size of the bank to roughly $1.95 trillion in total assets.

The move has cost Wells Fargo immensely -- Bloomberg in August of 2020 estimated that the cap had cost the bank at least $4 billion in profits. Wells Fargo has made some progress on the asset cap but it is currently anyone's guess as to when it gets removed. Earlier this year market sentiment suggested Wells Fargo could be close to removal but that sentiment has turned more negative in light of Powell's recent statements although it really is hard to know. By far this consent order is the most prohibitive to the stock price.

April 20 2018 (2 orders) -- The OCC and CFPB worked together in issuing two consent orders that both had to do with the same infractions at the bank. The consent orders were in regards to an auto lending insurance program in which the bank inappropriately charged consumers for collateral protection insurance or left the policies in place for too long. The orders also had to do with improperly charging customers to extend the interest rate on their mortgages. The agencies tasked Wells Fargo with establishing and putting in place an enterprise risk management program that prevents such problems from reoccurring. In total the two agencies also fined Wells Fargo $1 billion.

Sept. 9 2021 -- Most recently the OCC slapped Wells Fargo with a $250 million fine which was for the bank's inability to correct deficiencies from past orders in a timely manner. The order said Wells Fargo had yet to address the issues raised in its 2018 OCC consent order and that there were still existing problems with the bank's mortgage servicing practices.

Progress has been made

Although the company still has 10 active consent orders in place Wells Fargo has also made some decent progress since the start of 2020.

May 4 2020 -- Wells Fargo received an outstanding grade on its Community Reinvestment Act performance which measures how well the bank serves low- to moderate-income communities within the bank's geographic footprint.

Jan. 5 2021 -- The OCC eliminated a previous consent order placed on the bank in 2015 that had to do with the bank's regulatory infrastructure associated with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) compliance program. BSA and AML have to do with helping the U.S. government prevent bad actors such as terrorists from laundering money through the banking system. BSA/AML-related consent orders have not been uncommon for large banks in recent years.

Feb. 17 2021 -- Media outlets reported that officials at the Fed accepted a proposal submitted by Wells Fargo for restructuring its governance and risk management framework. The approval marked the second of four steps Wells Fargo must successfully get through in order to get the asset cap removed. The news sent the stock soaring on this day and shows how the asset cap is the most prohibitive of all the consent orders to the stock.

Sept. 9 2021 -- Wells Fargo announced that a consent order from the CFPB in relation to the bank's retail sales practices from the phony-accounts scandal was no longer in place. ""The expiration of the CFPB's 2016 consent order is representative of progress we are making"" Scharf said in a statement.

How close is Wells Fargo to getting its remaining consent orders removed?

There is still a considerable amount of work for Wells Fargo to do on the 10 remaining consent orders. The somewhat good news is that several of the consent orders seem very closely related such as those made by the OCC and CFPB in 2018. The most recent one in 2021 is essentially reprimanding the bank for not working quickly enough through past consent orders so my guess is that once some of the main issues are solved several of these could be lifted simultaneously or within a very close time period.

The asset cap is the largest shadow over the bank and its stock performance so watch that one the closest. Lastly I'd point out that the two consent orders Wells Fargo has gotten removed took at least five years from issuance.

Bank consent orders often do take years to get removed and Wells Fargo is dealing with numerous so patience will likely still be required. But on a positive note management knows what it needs to do seems to be working diligently and continues to make progress albeit with some setbacks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwdWJsaWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy90b2RheXMtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL2xvY2FsLW11c2ljaWFuLXRvLWJyaW5nLXZvaWNlLXRvLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWFyZW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local musician to bring voice to Wells Fargo Arena,"A local Marshalltown musician is currently hard at work preparing for a slate of opportunities.

Eric Verdulla will perform the National Anthem at Wells Fargo Arena in November before auditioning for NBC’s singing competition show “The Voice” in December and releasing his solo album in January.

Having played in front of audiences of five people the chance to sing for the Wells Fargo Arena crowd summoned goosebumps and brought tears to Verdulla’s eyes he said. With a friend’s band unable to play Verdulla was offered the chance to do a duo performance at an Iowa Wild game on Nov. 13.

“I needed it at that time” Verdulla said. “I was really starting to get down on myself about where I was at.”

A couple weeks prior to receiving the opportunity he and his girlfriend were driving by the arena.

“We drive by that and I’m like ‘that’s my dream.’ My dream is to play at Wells Fargo” Verdulla said.

Last year Verdulla auditioned for “The Voice” and made it to the second round. He received an invitation to audition again this year with his goal just to make it further.

“It gave me a goal” he said. “It gave me something to reach out to and really put my focus on.”

During the audition he plans to show off his diversity of vocal abilities. Verdulla currently fronts one of Marshalltown’s most well-known heavy metal acts Agony of Defeat but his upcoming solo album will feature a different tone in the realm of soft rock and country.

“I was scared because I was in a rock band for the longest time to show I loved country music soft rock music and R&B music. But then eventually I was like ‘Man this is me. This is me and I’m not changing'” Verdulla said. “I just want to be the best that I can be all the time. I want to be the best rock musician that I can be the best R&B musician that I can be the best country musician that I can be.”

While Verdulla feels very strong about his rock music vocals with Agony of Defeat he feels his country and soft-rock voice comes more naturally to him. As to what he enjoys most he says it’s dependent on where his life is- right now it’s country.

“If I’m feeling a little jumpy and excited and want to tell you how it is that’s an Agony of Defeat song” Verdulla said. “If I want to talk about my emotions and love and caring that side of me I’ll do country and soft rock.”

Open-mindedness to music has been with him as long as he can remember: Verdulla’s mother playing in a band is one of his first memories of music. While many musicians might not let a small child play around with their instruments Verdulla remembers the band members letting him bang away on their drum kits and guitars. His career in the studio began with singing R&B and he recorded his first track when he was 14 years old.

Among his upcoming opportunities the release of his new album which has been in the works for two years and features 15 original songs is the most important thing on Verdulla’s mind. He invites anyone to visit his Facebook page and provide feedback which he takes seriously.

“I can guarantee you every single time you come see me I’m going to give you a show” Verdulla said. “I’m going to give you as much perfection as I can and we’re going to have a good time.”

He said many people mistake his music for a hobby but Verdulla views music as central to his identity.

“I bleed this” Verdulla said. “This is who I am. It’s everything that I am.”

WMB,Williams Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9jYWxlYi13aWxsaWFtcy1zYXZlZC1va2xhaG9tYS1kaWQtb2tsYWhvbWEtdGhlbi1jb3N0LWhpbS1tb25leS0wNDIyNDc0MDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NCAA football: OU's Caleb Williams should profit off big game,"As Caleb Williams was leading Oklahoma back from the dead from down 21 to the biggest comeback in Red River history phones across America began buzzing. Williams a true freshman had never started a college football game before. As he engineered touchdown drives his star brightening by the play fans took notice.

So too did companies.

Zach Soskin an athlete brand builder was texting with people who work for them. “People who write pretty significant checks to athletes” he says. People who under the NCAA’s new Name Image and Likeness rules can sign players to endorsement deals. All of them Soskin says were watching Williams “Waiting to see what does this kid have to say? What type of person is he? How will he handle himself postgame?""

They watched and watched waiting for an interview that never happened.

ESPN sideline reporter Holly Rowe asked for one. Williams she said in a since-deleted tweet “Expected to be interviewed.” But head coach Lincoln Riley who himself gave an on-camera interview “Said no.” Oklahoma also did not make Williams available to other reporters.

And that rankled athlete advocates because Williams’ moment in the spotlight with millions watching on ABC was what Soskin called an “opportunity to have a ‘hello world’ interview and send his brand/earnings through the roof.”

“Media time leads to media attention which leads to follower growth which leads to NIL opportunities” explains Blake Lawrence the CEO of Opendorse a sports marketing firm.

Companies Soskin says “Are looking for someone who can represent their brand. And how can they know [whether Williams can do] that if he's not allowed to talk?”

Ellen Staurowsky an Ithaca College professor who has studied the market value of college athletes says: “There is no question that an athlete like Caleb Williams who puts in an outstanding performance and is deprived of an opportunity to speak on a national stage is negatively affected by that in terms of potential financial opportunities.”

An Oklahoma spokesman did not respond to an email asking why Williams wasn’t made available for interviews. The reasoning likely falls in line with a policy that isn’t uncommon throughout college football. Many top coaches for years haven’t allowed true freshmen to talk to the media. Prior to the NIL era some saw the policies as overbearing as what Staurowsky calls “an exercise in control”; others reasonably defended them as well-intentioned as safeguards against the pressures of teen celebrity.

But now NIL experts say they’re costly — and could soon be extinct.

'It's important to fix [things] for that next kid'

Williams experts say will still have plenty of financial opportunity. Most agree that Oklahoma and Riley didn’t necessarily directly cost him money. “I think his performance on the field will generate enough buzz” says Peter Schoenthal the CEO of Athliance an NIL company.

“He's gonna be a star that has a big future” Soskin says. NIL money and perhaps NFL money will be a part of that future.

And even if Williams’ football career doesn’t go to plan “He can make money off this moment ’til the day he dies” Soskin assures. “He can sign Red River Rivalry memorabilia or do local Oklahoma commercials about this. … No matter what happens now he can own a sports bar in Norman or something.”

But what if Williams had “crushed the interview” as Soskin expects he would have? “If he's mature gracious humble” Soskin says or if he’d conjured an iconic line his marketability could have soared.

And what if instead of a five-star recruit at a blueblood he was an out-of-nowhere temporary star? “What if” Soskin continues “he was a freshman who didn't come from much and just had lightning strike in the biggest game?

“It's important to fix [these policies] for that next kid.”

Because the height of that kid’s earning power according to Staurowsky “is now not five years from now.”

And because “personal branding and storytelling are critical elements to unlocking NIL value” says David Carter founder of the Sports Business Group and a founding partner at NIL company Altius. Interviews of course are storytelling opportunities.

“Any hindrance to that” Carter continues “will prove detrimental to both the athlete in terms of potential revenue and the school given potential recruiting impacts.”

Why it'll inevitably change

And this is why many experts expect these policies to disappear. “Recruits” Carter explains “may be less interested in programs that prohibit or otherwise limit them from continuing to tell and monetize their story.” Schoenthal compares it to the very early NIL days when schools initially balked at allowing athletes to use the university’s logo in personal branding. “And then we started hearing that it was being used against them in recruiting” Schoenthal says. “So schools started loosening their restrictions on athletes and allowing them to use trademark logos so long as they’re asking permission before.”

Any similarly restrictive policies such as freshman media policies will be highlighted by rival coaches in recruiting battles. “Schools are going to use anything they can to boost their own program and maybe take a shot at another program” Schoenthal says.

Says Soskin: “You bet your butt the next time somebody's recruiting against Lincoln Riley they'll bring it up.”

And so “over time” Carter says “such policies will eventually fade.”

Soskin points out that none of them was crafted explicitly to limit NIL earning potential. “Oklahoma does a relatively great job of building their players' brands” he says. “Lincoln Riley's generally pretty pro-player.” The policy instead “is just a rule that they forgot to change.” The NCAA spent months denying the inevitability of the NIL era leaving schools unprepared to navigate uncharted waters. “It didn't give programs and coaches the time to react in all of the ways they should” Soskin says.

They are instead reacting on the fly. Some experts expect it to be a few years until all freshman media policies are retracted. Others think the open market will accelerate change. Soskin could see a wave of it “after this season.”

“Or” he says “maybe even starting tomorrow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLzIwMjEvMTAvMDkvb2tsYWhvbWEtdGV4YXMtc3BlbmNlci1yYXR0bGVyLWJlbmNoZWQtY2FsZWItd2lsbGlhbXMtbmls0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spencer Rattler Caleb Williams could see Red River NIL impact,"In the name image and likeness era the Sooners' thrilling comeback and quarterback change has implications beyond the field.

Those within the name image and likeness industry knew this was coming. But even they couldn’t have expected this.

A college football quarterback dubbed as a future NFL first-round pick and Heisman Trophy favorite rakes in thousands of dollars in endorsement and commercial deals only to spiral into oblivion during the actual season.

Three months into the NIL era here we are. Oklahoma QB Spencer Rattler the recipient of high preseason praise and an estimated $200000 in NIL ventures was benched for a true freshman. Forget about the first round and the Heisman—Rattler appears to have in all likelihood lost his starting job.

Now what happens?

Kevin Jairaj/USA TODAY Sports

“He still has a great name for advertising” jokes one industry source. “Can’t take that away from him.”

Behind Rattler’s replacement rookie Caleb Williams the Sooners stunned Texas 55–48 storming back from massive deficits to win one of the most memorable chapters of the Red River Rivalry. Oklahoma trailed 28–7 in the first quarter 35–17 in the second quarter and 41–23 with less than three minutes left in the third quarter. Coach Lincoln Riley’s team scored 25 unanswered points in a nine-minute span beginning with 1:04 left in the third roaring to a win on a 33-yard touchdown jaunt from tailback Kennedy Brooks with three seconds left.

It was wacky. It was wild. It was weird.

And for NIL purposes it presents one of the first quandaries for companies who poured money into the expectations and predictions of college-aged kids. NIL industry sources believe Rattler’s NIL endeavors are in the low six figures around $200000. He created his own logo and has a website to sell his own personalized merchandise.

He’s got a trading car deal signed an endorsement contract with Louisiana-based chicken restaurant Raising Cane's and was given two vehicles by a local Oklahoma automotive group after he threw for five scores against Western Carolina. The length and terms of the contracts will determine future payouts. Those are not made public.

“Hope he pays his taxes on those two cars” joked another source within the NIL industry.

Rattler isn’t the only big NIL earner to struggle. Clemson QB DJ Uiagalelei a spokesperson for Dr. Pepper is having a difficult start to his sophomore season and Miami quarterback D’Eriq King estimated to have made at least $200000 in NIL ventures is out for the season the school announced Monday.

While Rattler’s star fades another rises. Williams a Washington D.C. native threw for 212 yards ran for 88 and scored three touchdowns. He’s ahead in the NIL game described by some as a savvy social media “influencer.” In fact he’s got his own YouTube channel.

“He’s already an influencer” says one NIL executive. “Now he is about to be a player.”

But his coach is at least right now standing in the way of him seeking publicity in the media.

Riley denied a request from ESPN to interview Williams after the game something reported by sideline reporter Holly Rowe who even approached the quarterback to deliver him the news: You can’t talk.

It is somewhat normal for major college coaches to deny true freshmen to speak to reporters. However in the NIL era it’s a move that can be seen as a coach hurting his player’s potential exposure and future financial ventures.

In college sports players have more power than ever.

“So what if player does interview despite coach edict?” asks one NIL expert.

Halfway through the second quarter of Saturday’s game after having already run for a 66-yard TD in a brief first-quarter appearance Williams trotted onto the field to replace a guy who was projected as the Heisman favorite before the season began. The Sooners were down 35–17. They then outscored the Longhorns 31–6 to set up a wild final few minutes.

Texas QB Casey Thompson tossed a 31-yard touchdown to tie it at 48 with one minute 20 seconds left. Williams then marched the Sooners down the field on completions of nine 10 and 11 yards capping it with a handoff to Brooks for the game-winner.

He celebrated with teammates and high-fived coaches—the new rising star of the NIL era.

What happens to Rattler? That’s the wrong question NIL experts say.

“What happens for Caleb Williams?” one asks.

Like the bridge that spans the Fraser River and bears his name much of Rudy Johnson’s life has been about making connections.

“My life was busy busy. I had so many things to keep up with” the 98 year old said during a recent interview in his room at Seniors Village in Williams Lake. “I’ve really only been downsizing in the last 10 years.”

On May 30 2021 his wife Helen passed away at the age of 97.

They had been married for 77 years and had six children - Gary Janice twins Randy and Bob Don and Debby.

When Helen moved into Seniors Village about six years ago Johnson said he followed her.

“I couldn’t get along without her” he said. “I sure miss her.”

Johnson was born in Sweden and emigrated to Vancouver B.C. when he was nine years old.

In his room at Seniors Village there is a framed photograph of the family home back in Sweden.

After his arrival in Canada learning English was not as easy for him as it was for some of his siblings.

When he attended school the principal told him to stay away continue to learn the language and come back when he could get by.

“My dad said ‘OK I’m going to give you a team of horses and a scraper and you can go to work for the municipality’ so I did” Johnson recalled. “I got a dollar for each horse a dollar for me so that was three dollars a day I got paid.”

He never did return to school and by the time he was 13 had rigged his first spar tree.

“Once when I was 14 or 15 I attended a Sunday picnic in Powell River. They had two spar trees and I beat all them guys by far climbing up and down. Then when it was finished the Workmen’s Compensation Board had a little plaque that named me as verified second rigger.”

When Johnson asked why he didn’t get the first place trophy he was told he couldn’t have it because he was under age.

Johnson first visited the Cariboo during a hunting trip at Soda Creek in 1946 and returned a year later with timber rights eventually building his first tie mill and moving his family to live with him.

About 1954 the Johnsons moved into Williams Lake to a home on Second Avenue where the post office is located today.

He moved his tie mill from the West Fraser Road area to 153 Mile House which he later sold and built a sawmill on the Beaver Valley Road.

Eventually he left the lumber industry and became very busy working on construction in Williams Lake.

“I was building roads excavating streets building homes moving churches and homes and digging basements” he recalled.

Aside from tie mills and sawmills Johnson was an owner or partner in companies such as Lovell Logging Cariboo West Contracting Chilcotin Airways Aero Electronic Surveys Ltd. Central Aircraft Leasing and Salvage Ltd. and Western Line Cleaners.

It was also common for him to provide ambulance services because he had the means to fly into remote sites.

In 1962 the Johnsons purchased the Buckskin Land and Cattle Company on the west side of the Fraser River and the whole family helped run the ranch.

His son Randy said his dad was a good teacher and taught his children lots.

“He was good to work for and taught us how to do things right. It was great. We ran the ranch for 30 years as a family. Each one of us had a job to do. It was set up pretty good.”

At its peak the ranch had 600 cows and another 400 head of yearling Randy said nothing his mom Debbie and he looked after the cattle and everyone helped with the haying.

“Bob was instrumental in setting up the water and irrigation system” Randy added noting Debbie and her family also ran a registered herd on the ranch for a few years.

It was an incident where Helen almost drowned in the Fraser River after falling off the Soda Creek Ferry that inspired Johnson to build the Rudy Johnson Bridge.

He learned through a friend in 1968 there was a surplus bridge available and purchased it for $40000 from the Alaska Department of Highways.

“I had to phone my banker and tell him I was buying a bridge - he almost fell over” Johnson said.

The bridge’s 3300 pieces were transported on three railway cars to a dock in Alaska and then shipped to Prince Rupert B.C. From Prince Rupert the pieces went by rail to Prince George and then to Williams Lake.

The bridge pieces were hauled by truck from Williams Lake and then placed along the road in numbered order.

Johnson contracted Dominion Bridge and foreman Jim English to build the bridge and had an engineer on site who signed off the work.

“We put the bridge together all on the hard ground and then we picked it up and swung it over the river onto cement buttresses that Martin Stacey myself and a crew poured two months before that.”

He and Helen were the first ones to try out the new bridge followed by the two cattle trucks.

“Sometimes we had 30 loaded trucks waiting to cross” he recalled noting the logging companies paid a fee to use the bridge but it was open to the public at no charge.

Seven years later the government sent him a memo asking to buy the bridge and Johnson sold it.

“I could never have built the bridge today - not with all the red tape” he said.

Eyeing his upcoming 99th birthday on Dec. 13 Johnson said his health is fair.

When asked for advice to impart on a younger generation he responded ‘just keep working.’

In 2014 he self-published a book about his life and dedicated the book to Helen.

“With her loving support her strength and her determination the accomplishments we have enjoyed together were made possible” he wrote for an insert inside the book.

“Our children are a major part of our success and happiness.

“Some of our most cherished and happiest moments have been with our children our grandchildren our great grandchildren and with our friends.”

The book has been widely read and is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about Johnson and the Cariboo.

As Johnson took out the accordion to play a tune Randy said his dad never learned how to read music but played by ear.

“In the last couple of years he’s been playing it now and then and the ladies in here want him to come down and play them a tune. He’s getting better and better at playing it as time goes on because of a lot of the old stuff is coming back.”

Johnson said he has always remained grateful for the generosity shown to his family when they first moved to the West Fraser area so long ago.

“We would have starved if it wasn’t for our neighbours” he said.

Randy said one time someone asked his father what was something that had a big impact on his life. “Dad looked at her and said ‘electricity’” Randy recalled.

“When you think about what someone his age has seen throughout his lifetime it really is amazing.”

Aziz who spent more than 20 years overseeing foreign and U.S. casino expansion for MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts was convicted on two counts of conspiracy by a jury in a Boston courtroom after prosecutors said he paid $300000 in bribes during 2018 to get his daughter enrolled into the University of Southern California as a basketball player.

Aziz left the gaming industry in September 2016 when he resigned his position as president of Wynn Macau. He spent three years with Wynn Resorts as the president of development overseeing foreign and domestic expansion opportunities.

Prior to joining Wynn Aziz spent 18 years with MGM Resorts International including 13 years as president of MGM Grand Las Vegas and five years as president of MGM Hospitality where he oversaw the company’s non-gaming international expansion.

His attorney told reporters in Boston Friday that Aziz – who was listed in the complaint by his given name Gamal Adbelaziz – would appeal the conviction.

Aziz was alleged to have bribed a senior associate athletic director at USC in order to help his daughter get recruited by the USC basketball team and facilitate her admission to the university.

He is alleged to have paid a $300000 donation to USC’s gift account for the Galen Center the arena for USC’s basketball and volleyball programs and $20000 per month in payments to the senior associate athletic director.

Aziz a native of Egypt is currently listed as chairman and CEO of Legacy Hospitality Group according to his LinkedIn page.

The trial was the first stemming from the bribery scandal that was uncovered in 2019. Prosecutors and federal law enforcement officials filed hundreds of charges against 57 parents including Hollywood celebrities and wealthy financial executives alleging they had conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to fraudulently secure college placement for their children.

Forty-seven of the 57 defendants including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman have pleaded guilty to reduced charges paying fines with minimal jail time. The longest sentence any parent pleading guilty has received was nine months. Aziz was found guilty along with private equity firm founder John Wilson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3d5bm4tZ29sZi1jbHViLWtvZXBrYS1kZWNoYW1iZWF1LXZlbnVlL9IBP2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL3d5bm4tZ29sZi1jbHViLWtvZXBrYS1kZWNoYW1iZWF1LXZlbnVlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 things to know about Wynn Golf Club the host course for Brooks Koepka vs. Bryson DeChambeau,"7 things to know about Wynn Golf Club the host course for Brooks Koepka vs. Bryson DeChambeau

The 18th hole at Wynn Golf Club is unlike any other. Brian Oar

Let’s get ready to rumble! Another heavyweight golf bout is on its way to Las Vegas but this time around the venue won’t be Shadow Creek. When brawny rivals Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau go head-to-head the day after Thanksgiving in the fifth edition of The Match they’ll do so at Wynn Golf Club behind the casino hotel of the same name. Like Shadow Creek which hosted the first iteration of The Match a $9-million extravaganza starring Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson the Wynn is an impeccably manicured Tom Fazio design that commands a hefty price tag. But unlike Shadow it hasn’t been the backdrop for any recent high-profile televised events. If you’re thinking of playing the course — or just watching the event — here are seven fun facts to stuff into your trivia bank.

1. It’s a strip tease

Though it doesn’t cost as much as Shadow Creek which recently bumped its peak-season greens fees to $1000 the Wynn still charges plenty: $600 a round. It does so with convenience as a calling card. As the lone resort course on the Strip it’s the only spot in town where you can roll out of your penthouse suite ride the elevator to the ground floor and stroll directly to the first tee.

2. It was going to be a water palace

Nearly four years ago when then-CEO Steve Wynn closed the course blueprints were in place to transform the site into Wynn Paradise Park a lavish aquatic playland. But Wynn wound up resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations (he no longer has any involvement with the property) and the new brass determined that a pristine golf course made more sense than what amounted to a giant swimming pool.

3. It’s a Fazio redux

Often when a golf course gets reworked a new architect is called upon. In this case though the ownership turned to the original designer Tom Fazio who carried out the job with his son Logan.

4. It has a Rat Pack past

The Strip is not St. Andrews. No one would call it hallowed ground for golf. And yet there’s history here. Long before this property became the Wynn it was home to the Desert Inn a resort and casino with a course of the same name. The PGA Tour Senior Tour and LPGA Tour all competed regularly on its fairways. So did Frankie Dino and the boys.

5. The caddies are sticks

The Wynn’s loopers aren’t just pack mules who can work a laser. The caddie corps includes former collegiate golfers mini-tour players and assorted others whom you wouldn’t want to face in a money game. In short you can count on savvy insights to say nothing of some very Vegas-sounding counsel such as: “Take this one off the Barry Manilow sign.”

6. It’s a mix of old and new

Though the rebuilt course has new greens and fairways and eight entirely new holes it covers mostly the same footprint as its predecessor and it preserves elements from its past including more than 120 mature trees that date to the days of the Desert Inn. A dramatic waterfall still flows behind the 18th green just as it did on the original Wynn course though the hole once a par-4 now plays as a par-3. Though Bryson and Brooks won’t be playing all 18 (theirs will be a 12-hole match on a yet-to-be specified routing) you can bet they’ll be playing the closer. It’s just too much of a Vegas spectacle to omit.

7. Aces are wild

The odds are slim (roughly 12500 to 1) but the payoff is fat. Anyone who makes a hole-in-one on the par-3 18th at the Wynn walks off with a cash prize of $10000 from the resort. That rule does not apply to Brooks and Bryson who will getting paid far more for their time in Vegas whether they make an ace or not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2dvdmVybm1lbnQvdHdvLXBhcmVudHMtY29udmljdGVkLWZpcnN0LXVzLWNvbGxlZ2UtYWRtaXNzaW9ucy1zY2FuZGFsLXRyaWFsLTIwMjEtMTAtMDgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two wealthy dads convicted in first U.S. college admissions scandal trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/two-parents-convicted-first-us-college-admissions-scandal-trial-2021-10-08/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2dvdmVybm1lbnQvdHdvLXBhcmVudHMtY29udmljdGVkLWZpcnN0LXVzLWNvbGxlZ2UtYWRtaXNzaW9ucy1zY2FuZGFsLXRyaWFsLTIwMjEtMTAtMDgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmxhc3QuY29tLzEwNDEwNS9qdXN0aW4tYmllYmVyLW1lbHRzLWRvd24tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXdpdGgtc2hvdy1pbnNpZGUteHMtbmlnaHRjbHViLWF0LXd5bm4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Justin Bieber Melts Down Vegas With Show Inside XS Nightclub At Wynn,"Justin Bieber stunned a packed crowd inside XS Nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas performing his massive hits with a special group of famous friends!

One person died and at least 14 others were injured after gunfire broke out early Sunday in a bar along West Seventh Street in St. Paul leaving what authorities described as a ""hellish"" scene with victims inside the building and out on the street.

The St. Paul Police Department reported just before noon Sunday that three men — ages 29 32 and 33 — had been arrested in connection with the shooting and were among those being treated for injuries.

St. Paul police spokesperson Steve Linders said earlier Sunday that officers encountered a chaotic scene just after midnight when they arrived at the Seventh Street Truck Park bar and food hall just west of the Xcel Energy Center.

“There were gunshot wound victims lying in the street outside the bar there were gunshot wound victims lying on the sidewalk outside the bar and there were gunshot wound victims lying on the floor inside the bar” he said during a news conference several hours after the shooting.

A woman in her 20s died at the scene Linders said.

""One minute she's having a good time the next minute she's lying in her friends' arms who are trying to save her life. And she didn't make it. I can't think of anything worse” he said.

Fourteen people were transported to area hospitals and are expected to survive their injuries Linders said. That includes the three suspects arrested later Sunday.

“They're in custody and in the hospital being treated for injuries suffered during the incident” police reported at midday Sunday. “Once they're discharged all three will be booked into the Ramsey (County) Jail and await a charging decision.”

There were so many people hurt by the gunfire Linders said that more than a half-dozen of them had to be taken to Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis in addition to the victims taken to hospitals in St. Paul. Linders said other agencies — including Metro Transit police the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office and Maplewood police — handled some 911 calls in the city because so many St. Paul officers had to respond to the shooting.

The name of the woman who died has not been released.

“This is nothing short of a tragedy” Linders said. “We had people in the city of St. Paul out on a Saturday night having a good time. And we had other people who decided to pull guns with reckless disregard for human life and pull the trigger over and over and over and over again. And it ended in tragedy. Our hearts break for the young woman who died and for her loved ones. And for everybody who was in that bar.”

In the aftermath of the shooting police investigators could be seen standing at the doorway of the Seventh Street Truck Park and apparently examining vehicles outside for bullet damage or other evidence. At least one vehicle was towed from in front of the business.

Police officers were posted outside the emergency department entrances at both Regions and United hospitals with multiple police vehicles lined up at the sidewalks outside of each facility.

Speaking later in the day St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter thanked those who helped the victims of the shooting and he lauded the quick work by police.

""We are of course heartened to see arrests made in the case. But we know our entire city is going to be listening closely as we demand many many more answers for what occurred last night for the heartbreak and trauma that played out across our community.""

Carter said the city had recently dedicated $1 million in federal money to police overtime — with a focus on the West Seventh area. But he said an increase in gun violence requires wider-ranging solutions including community-based responders and intervenors.

""We know that we have more work to do. We know that our officers cannot do it alone"" he said. ""I'm blessed to live in and serve a city where people look out for one another we have to continue to do that work on the street level on the neighborhood level ensuring that if you see something say something.""

Response from city and state leaders

St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell posted on Twitter that ""hearts are broken — victims families community and officers. I spoke with the homicide victim’s family this morning and they are absolutely devastated. I am incredibly proud of the exhausted women and men of the SPPD. We WILL bring justice to the victims.""

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum also issued a statement Sunday writing that ""the epidemic of gun violence plaguing the Twin Cities has hit us in St. Paul with a mass shooting event that can only be described as a horror. I know our St. Paul community will come together to support the victims and their families during this time of pain and grief. My prayers are with the victims. I also want to pledge my full support to the St. Paul Police and all our law enforcement officials as they pursue the perpetrators of this horrendous crime. I am committed to keeping St. Paul safe and that means working with all community leaders to get guns off our streets and out of the hands of criminals. We must never allow this kind of criminal act to happen again.”

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted that ""what happened last night in St. Paul was an appalling tragedy. A life lost and 14 people injured because of senseless gun violence. Our hearts are with the family and friends of the victims and the St. Paul community. This must be a call to action.""

And Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted: “Horrific. Minnesota is keeping in our hearts the family of the young woman killed and the 14 others injured and the St. Paul neighborhood reeling from this senseless gun violence. We’re working in close coordination with local law enforcement as they apprehend those responsible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9mYXN0LWZyaWVuZHNoaXAtb2Ytd2lsZC1kZWZlbnNlbWVuLW1hdHQtZHVtYmEtYW5kLWpvbmFzLWJyb2Rpbi82MDAxMDUxMzgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Room assignment nine years ago started fast friendship of Wild's Matt Dumba and Jonas Brodin,"When they aren't working out of a satellite office Jonas Brodin and Matt Dumba report for duty at Xcel Energy Center.

They're on the same team two long-tenured employees who have the same job which they perform right next to each other.

To just call the Wild defensemen colleagues doesn't cut it.

""We know each other way more than being co-workers"" Dumba said.

Studies show a majority of Americans work with someone they consider a friend. But Brodin and Dumba's bond goes way beyond end-of-the-day happy hours.

They take trips together share the same hobbies and live a few floors apart in a Minneapolis apartment building. They even finish each other's sentences.

Their kinship translates to the ice where the two will open the season Friday at Anaheim as the Wild's only returning duo on defense.

""They genuinely enjoy playing together and they work well together"" said their boss General Manager Bill Guerin. ""They trust each other.""

Developing a bond

The Holiday Inn in St. Paul is the birthplace of this friendship; Brodin and Dumba were roommates there during the Wild's prospect development camp in 2012.

Dumba's first impression of Brodin? Quiet.

""I thought he just went about his business"" Dumba said ""and he was so good on the ice.""

Both are first-round picks with Brodin now 28 drafted 10th overall in 2011 by the Wild and Dumba 27 selected seventh a year later. But they joined the Wild from opposite sides of the world.

""It's crazy when you think about it"" Dumba said. ""Stockholm and Calgary two of the same people born a year apart and thousands of miles apart from each other.""

While Brodin was climbing the ranks in Sweden Dumba was playing in Canada but he had picked up some Swedish from a former teammate and heard Brodin playing the Swedish DJ Avicii in their hotel room.

""We had fun right away"" Brodin said. ""It just felt like right way this could be a good friend.""

They had the same taste in music but Brodin struggled to communicate in English. Dumba helped him.

""I could understand everything"" Brodin said ""but I was really bad at speaking it.""

Eventually Dumba started calling Brodin ""Jimmy"" a nickname that he still goes by today.

""It just stuck"" Dumba said. ""I don't know why 'Jimmy.' I just kept calling you 'Jimmy' and then all [teammates] started calling you 'Jimmy.' ""

""Maybe I was slim too my first year"" Brodin said. ""I didn't have a lot of muscles.""

""Yeah you were pretty slim"" Dumba said.

Making memories

In 2013 Brodin went full-time with the Wild and a year later Dumba turned pro splitting games between the NHL and minors before sticking with the Wild in 2015.

After starting out with other partners they began to play together around 2016. By then they were already buddies who went head-to-head in video games.

""You have some beers with a guy"" Dumba said ""and you get to know each other.""

They invited their friends to games packing everyone into the same suite and then their friends became friends.

""You could see amongst our friend groups that it was the same people as doppelgängers"" Dumba said.

They went to Mexico and Scottsdale together and a few years ago Dumba visited Brodin in Sweden for Brodin's birthday in July.

In-season they go out for dinner while on road trips after making a pact five years ago to ""not ever hermit crab it and stay at the hotel"" Dumba said. When they are in Minnesota they like to catch a movie golf and play pingpong and pool.

Even their families have hung out like two Christmases ago when everyone went to an outdoor rink and had coffee with Baileys and donuts in the parking lot.

""I know his old man pretty good now; he knows mine"" Dumba said. ""When they're in town one of us will come out to dinner. Jimmy has come out to dinner with just my parents or vice versa.""

Between them is a connection that transcends the sport.

""Our relationship is not just hockey"" Dumba said. ""We talk about personal stuff and family and problems going on with that because we still are going through the same thing.""

Side by side

Their careers with the Wild remain that common denominator. Only captain Jared Spurgeon circa 2010 has played for the Wild longer than Brodin and Dumba.

""We stuck with this organization and this organization stuck with us believed in us"" Dumba said.

They've weathered trade rumors in outlasting former franchise cornerstones such as Mikko Koivu Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. The pair also emerged unscathed from the summer purge on the blue line that subtracted Suter Ian Cole Carson Soucy and Brad Hunt.

""They have that chemistry"" said assistant coach Bob Woods who oversees the Wild's defense. ""They hang out off the ice so they know each other really well. They care about each other and you watch them around the rink they're always talking. They're always talking about situations on the bench and there's just that friendship that I think is important to have.""

Not only are they natural complements — Brodin shoots left and Dumba's a righty — but their styles mesh.

""We're both versatile"" Dumba said. ""I got a little more —""

""Offensive side"" Brodin interjected.

""Yeah offensive side"" Dumba said ""and Jimmy is defensive even though he definitely gets up there lots which I like seeing him up there.""

Last season Brodin set a career high in goals with nine while leading the Wild in average ice time per game for the first time at 22 minutes 26 seconds just nine seconds more than Dumba who is known for his shot on the power play and in overtime where he has the most goals in franchise history with six.

Add Dumba's 2021 output (six goals) to Brodin's and the combined 29 assists between the two of them and they provided an effective boost to the offense.

""They're both very skilled with the puck and make those little plays to get it to the forwards"" Spurgeon said.

But they also lived up to their namesake as defensemen.

Among the pairings that played the most minutes together last season Brodin and Dumba were near the top of the NHL in fewest scoring chances against at 5-on-5 and high-danger chances.

Because they have played together so much they know what to anticipate. And since they care they support each other; they want to put the other in a position to succeed instead of leaving him in a jam. Never have they gotten mad at each other on the ice.

""That's why we get out of pressure really good together"" Dumba said. ""It's like you're always trying to go to the best spot that I would think you would want me to be and vice versa.""

Still they communicate all the time. And they praise each other's subtle moves that don't make it to the box score or highlight reel and help the other out when one is having an off-night on the ice.

""The other guy steps up"" Brodin said.

Same for the Wild when poor shifts are snowballing.

""Jimmy"" Dumba will say ""let's calm this down. Let's slow it down.""

They are ready for the responsibility that comes for a veteran pair as well.

""We want to play against the top lines"" Dumba said. ""Against tough matchups we get more fired up from each other. Jimmy's telling me who he's going to be all over that night and I pick the other guy's wingman whoever else is on that line and we just focus in on shutting them down that night. It's fun.""

Friends forever

Brodin and Dumba never chose to be roommates at development camp all those years ago; they were assigned to stay together a decision that saddled them with a sidekick for life.

""We grew up together"" Dumba said.

Now they are collaborators confidantes and each other's cheerleader.

When Brodin signed a seven-year $42 million contract extension in September 2020 Dumba tried to travel to Sweden to celebrate with Brodin.

""I couldn't get into Sweden because of coronavirus"" Dumba said ""but I was going to go. I actually looked for a flight.""

And when Dumba was named an alternate captain last month getting passed over for the title didn't bother Brodin.

""I'm so happy"" Brodin said. ""It's deserved well deserved especially how he is on the ice and off the ice too. Just a good human.""

Hockey and the Wild introduced them. But when those things go away Brodin and Dumba will still be friends.

""Maybe on the farewell tour in 10 years [I'll] go play in Sweden with Jimmy"" Dumba said. ""Uncle Jimmy then. Uncle Jimmy. Uncle Dumbs.""

Until that legacy is finalized there's more to accomplish.

Together.

""[A] Cup to go on top of that maybe 1000 games together"" Dumba said. ""That'd be sick.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmUxMS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3N0LXBhdWwtZmF0YWwtYmFyLXNob290aW5nLzg5LWIzNDc3N2E3LWJkNzgtNGY4OC1hMDEyLWQ2YzY1NjJlMGIwYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 arrested after shooting at busy St. Paul bar kills 1 injures 14,"The three men were being treated for injuries sustained during the shooting.

ST PAUL Minn. — Officials say three men have been arrested after a shooting in a busy St. Paul bar left a young woman dead and 14 people injured.

The woman's mother identified her to KARE 11 as Marquisha Wiley a 27-year-old vet technician.

“She has the biggest heart"" Wiley's mother Beth Wiley said.

Multiple 911 callers alerted police to the shooting at about 12:15 a.m. Sunday the St. Paul Police Department said in a news release. It happened at Seventh Street Truck Park a bar and food hall near Xcel Energy Center in downtown St. Paul.

Officers found a ""chaotic"" scene with 15 people who had been shot. St. Paul police spokesperson Steve Linders said some were lying inside the bar with others lying on the street and the sidewalk.

Wiley was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said a total of 14 people were taken to local hospitals and are expected to survive. Bystanders helped officers give aid as medics made their way to the area.

Police said they believe multiple shooters were involved.

At about noon Sunday St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell said three men had been arrested in connection to the shootings and Wiley's death. The men were in an area hospital being treated for their injuries. One man is in his late 20s and the others are in their early 30s.

Police said after the men are discharged from the hospital they will be booked into the Ramsey County jail awaiting formal charges.

No motive has been determined.

On Monday afternoon Seventh Street Truck Park said in a statement on its Facebook page that it will be closed ""in the coming days"" but will reopen soon.

The post added that the bar's management and staff are ""heartbroken"" by the shooting.

""We send our deepest condolences and thoughts to the victims families patrons and our community feeling the impacts of yet another shooting"" the post read. ""Thank you to the St. Paul Police Fire and Paramedics for their quick response and apprehending the suspects so quickly.""

Minneapolis-based DJ Mr. Peter Parker who was performing at the bar when the shooting began described the chaotic scene.

""I'm playing records it's fun... Everybody's upbeat they're singing along. I'm thinking I've got 45 minutes left and then bam"" Parker told KARE 11. ""Everybody hits the floor.""

Parker went on to say ""I shut the music off and then I kind of maneuver myself off the stage and then it was like trying to see what happened... When I got back up to see the room I could see that there was about four five people that were hurt in the party and they were on the ground.""

Parker didn't know the extent of the injuries until he got out of the bar.

""I got to see what was happening and I was like okay this is really really horrific"" he said.

Parker said he has been DJing for 25 years and has never experienced anything like Sunday morning's shootout.

""This was not expected"" he said. ""This was not a violent party. This was a fun upbeat event and it was a very shocking thing that happened.""

Axtell described the situation as ""hellish."" He said the people responsible will be held accountable.

Police said this was the 32nd homicide of the year in St. Paul.

Investigators are urging anyone with information about the shooting to call 651-266-5650

This is a developing story. It will be updated when more information is available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvd2h5LXdpbGQtY2hvc2UtYnJhbmRvbi1kdWhhaW1lLW92ZXItb3RoZXItdG9wLXByb3NwZWN0cy1mb3ItZmluYWwtcm9zdGVyLXNwb3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Wild chose Brandon Duhaime over other top prospects for final roster spot,"After wrapping up practice at TRIA Rink in downtown St. Paul on Sunday afternoon the Wild boarded a charter bus headed for Duluth. A few days of team building up north is exactly what players need after a lengthy training camp.

“We haven’t really gotten together with the guys off the ice” winger Marcus Foligno said. “It’ll be a good time. I think the bus trip will be a blast. Just the boys on the bus. It’ll feel like juniors again.”

The Wild are the only NHL group heading up to Duluth. That was by design after the Wild finalized their opening-night roster on Saturday.

Though its seems like the writing has been on the wall for the past week or so winger Brandon Duhaime officially won the battle for the final roster spot. He beat out training-camp sensation Adam Beckman and top prospect Marco Rossi for that last roster spot. Meanwhile fellow top prospect Matt Boldy is expected to miss four to six weeks after suffering a broken ankle in the preseason finale on Thursday.

“I was definitely excited having that conversation with (general manager Bill Guerin) and (coach Dean Evason)” said Duhaime who immediately called his mom to tell her the good news. “That was awesome. It was a step in the right direction. I just want to keep moving forward here.”

Asked why Duhaime made more sense than Beckman or Rossi Guerin replied “The role that they play is not necessarily the position we have open.”

In other words Duhaime is going to play about 10 minutes a game alongside Nico Sturm and opposite Nick Bjugstad. That’s not what the organization has in mind for Beckman and Rossi.

“We don’t want these guys sitting in the stands or playing 10 minutes a game” Guerin said. “We want them playing a lot of minutes a lot of games and in a lot of different situations. In our mind they really handled it great. There’s nothing negative. We have a plan for these guys. They will be here someday.”

As for Duhaime the Wild were consistently impressed with his grit throughout training camp. He started to separate himself from the pack almost immediately.

“We could see it like ‘Wow he means business. He’s ready’ ” Guerin said. “Just the impact he can have on our lineup with the youth and the speed and quickness and strength. He plays a physical brand which we really like.”

His journey to this point also has impressed Guerin. After being selected in the fourth round of the 2016 draft the 24-year-old Duhaime played at Providence College then for a couple of seasons with the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League. He has improved every step of the way.

“His development process has been exactly what we’re talking about” Guerin said. “He just keeps getting better and he keeps developing and that’s it. It doesn’t happen overnight for a lot of guys. Just the fact that he went through the process and just kept working and working and working and now he finds himself here.”

As for Beckman while he was disappointed he didn’t make the team especially after looking outstanding throughout training camp he is excited for the next step in his career.

“It’s all for development purposes” he said. “That’s kind of the way I’m looking at it. Just to continue to try and get better and kind of use it as — maybe not motivation — just another way to get better and hope that I could one day get there.”

PAUL Minn. (AP) — A shootout at a busy bar in St. Paul Minnesota early Sunday left a woman dead and 14 other people wounded authorities said.

The shooting happened shortly after midnight at the Seventh Street Truck Park bar. Police said preliminary information indicated several people fired gunshots.

Police arrested three men who were being treated at a hospital for injuries from the shootout. All three will be booked into the Ramsey County jail once they are discharged the St. Paul Police Department said in a statement on Twitter. They have not yet been charged.

Authorities were still investigating what led to the shootout.

“We have a very busy bar a lot of people just enjoying themselves and then we had a few individuals who decided to pull out guns and pull the trigger indiscriminately with no regard for human life” said police spokesman Steve Linders. “And I think about the poor woman who was just out enjoying herself. One minute she’s dancing smiling and laughing and the next she’s dying in friends’ arms. It’s nothing short of a tragedy.”

The woman in her 20s who was killed is the 32nd homicide victim in the city so far this year the Star Tribune reported. All of the other people who were shot are expected to survive police said in a statement.

“My heart breaks for the woman who was killed her loved ones and everyone else who was in that bar this morning” St. Paul Chief of Police Todd Axtell said in the statement. “In an instant they found themselves caught in a hellish situation. I want them to know that we have the best investigators in the country and we won’t stop until we find the people responsible for this madness.”

The Seventh Street Truck Park bar is in an entertainment district just south of the Xcel Energy Center where the NHL’s Minnesota Wild play. Linders said he doesn’t recall any recent previous calls for police service to the bar.

“It’s just not on our radar as a spot where we see this type of thing” Linders said. “We don’t see this type of thing anywhere.”

ConsenSys announced in an April press release that it had raised $65 million from investors J.P. Morgan Mastercard UBS and others in what the company called a “formation round.”

Headquartered in New York and founded in 2014 by Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin ConsenSys develops and invests in projects built on the Ethereum blockchain according to the report. The platform is a competitor to bitcoin and can be used to develop apps for financial services.

The digital asset most closely aligned with Ethereum is ether which Lubin used as the central source of funding to launch ConSenys the report stated.

The company is also the developer of MetaMask a fast-growing gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi) programs. MetaMask is projected to bring in some $1 billion in revenue within the upcoming 12 months according to FT.

MetaMask launched MetaMask Institutional in December to bring increased DeFi exposure to crypto funds market-makers and trading desks according to a Tuesday (Oct. 5) press release. The institutional version of MetaMask integrates institution-compliant custody operational risk and other compliance features.

Since it was launched last year MetaMask has handled over $8.9 billion in trades via a special feature that enables people to exchange digital tokens according to the report.

“MetaMask Institutional’s focus is to provide unrivaled access to DeFi even in the face of rigorous institutional requirements” said Johann Bornman product lead for MetaMask Institutional per the Tuesday release. “Qualified custodians and custody technology play a fundamental part in these requirements.”

It offers pet health disease prevention products such as parasiticide and vaccine products that protect pets from worms fleas and ticks under the Seresto Advantage Advantix and Advocate brands; pet health therapeutics for pain osteoarthritis ear infections cardiovascular and dermatology indications in canines and felines under the Galliprant and Claro brands; vaccines antibiotics parasiticides and other products for use in poultry and aquaculture production as well as functional nutritional health products including enzymes probiotics and prebiotics; and a range of vaccines antibiotics implants parasiticides and other products used in ruminant and swine production under the Rumensin and Baytril brands.

Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive operational activism experience helping boards and management teams run companies more efficiently and improving margins. They have made 103 13D filings. In those 103 filings they have averaged a return of 33.9% versus 13.3% for the S&P500. Their average 13D hold time is 18 months.

Elanco was spun out of Eli Lilly in September 2018 and was met with a lot of excitement – in its first day of trading the stock closed +50%. The reason why the stock was received so well was because management publicized opportunities to grow revenue at or above industry growth rates and to improve margins by approximately 1000 basis points over five years. In 2018 Elanco's EBITDA margins were 21% versus 38% for Zoetis its closest peer. Further Zoetis was a relevant case study for Elanco as it was also spun out from a larger company and management was able to execute on its value creation plan resulting in Zoetis' stock price outperforming the S&P500 by 330% since its IPO.

Elanco management targeted 31% EBITDA margins by 2023. The company's management made it seem as though its strategy would not be dependent on other large deals and that it would be focused on executing on its own pipeline. However on Aug. 20 2019 Elanco announced the acquisition of Bayer's Animal Health business for approximately $7.6 billion which surprised the market and sent the stock down 24%. Elanco explained this acquisition as it being too good of an opportunity to pass up as it would significantly expand scale and change the mix of the business. As a result management accelerated the timeline of its margin target goal by a year and announced that because of this acquisition they would reach their goal of 31% EBITDA margins by 2022.

Post-acquisition Elanco and Zoetis had a closer scale and more similar geographic/portfolio mixes but Elanco's (including Bayer) margins were well below Zoetis which had EBITDA margins of 40% by 2019. Granted that Zoetis had some valuable products with high pricing power leading to higher gross profit margins than Elanco but that is why Elanco was not targeting 40% but only 31%. But then in 2020 management revised its guidance and stated that it was now hoping to achieve 31% EBITDA margins by 2024 a year later than even its first projection and two years later than its last projection.

To confuse and frustrate shareholders even more management has claimed that they have realized significant cost savings but this is not resulting in margin expansion. Instead the gap between Elanco and Zoetis remains: 2455 basis points in 2020 and 2086 basis points estimated for 2021. This had resulted in a lack of confidence in management's execution an underperforming stock price and a large margin and multiple gap with Zoetis trading at 26x 2022E EBITDA and Elanco trading at 18x. This gap can be closed through improved operational execution which will inspire greater confidence from shareholders and lead to an improved valuation multiple. Starboard's analysis estimates a $47 stock price for Elanco with 31% EBITDA margins and no multiple improvement and a $74 stock price with 31% EBITDA margins and a multiple equal to Zoetis. With even better margin improvement to 37.1% Starboard sees a potential $91 stock price.

It is important to note that Starboard is not the only activist in Elanco. In October 2020 Sachem Head filed a 13D on Elanco. In December 2020 the firm settled with Elanco for three board seats for Scott Ferguson Paul Herendeen and William Doyle. Starboard has given the company some time to execute with these new directors and will likely give it more time but at some point the board and management have to show they can execute. Starboard is not the only shareholder who is clearly frustrated. At last year's annual meeting there were significant votes cast against each director up for election – Art Garcia (46.34%) Denise Scots-Knight (46.54%) Jeffrey Simmons (37.04%) and William Doyle (21.09%).

Elanco has a huge opportunity to create shareholder value through margin improvement and Starboard has extensive experience in improving margins of portfolio companies from the board level. Starboard cannot make director nominations until January 2022 but this seems like a logical situation for an invitation on the board for Starboard so hopefully it will not come to that.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor an institutional research service on shareholder activism and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Elanco is owned in the fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,
